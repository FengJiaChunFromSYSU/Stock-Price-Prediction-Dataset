By Samuel R. Avro, Guest blogger / November 21, 2012 The Holistic Energy Company I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with Dick Williams, the President of Shell Wind, discussing a range of topics including the current state of the wind industry and how Shell is positioning itself to be the energy company of the future. Dick has been a longtime employee of Shell, and has led the wind business for more than five years. He has also joined on as a member of the executive committee for Total Energy USA, which is a new conference being held next week (November 27-29, 2012) in Houston with a goal of nothing less than tying the whole of the energy industry together in a single event. We started out by talking about the Total Energy USA conference, and my opening question was why get involved in a new energy conference (it’s not as though there aren’t countless other energy events to spend time with). Dick said that the draw to the event was the scope and location. RELATED: Top 5 nations that use renewable energy Houston is the oil and gas capital of the world but there is so much more here. And if you look at the future of the industry – we all believe that at some point fossil fuels wind down. The question is just when: Is it now, 50 years, 100 years 200 years. It is going to take this energy mix going forward and why can’t Houston become the capital of that energy world – not just oil and gas. You have solar, biomass, wind, clean natural gas, carbon capture and all these offshoots. This is another stage in Houston’s evolution, we want to be more, we want to set ourselves up for the future. At Shell we are doing a lot of work looking at the year 2025. We have a group called Future Energy Technologies. We are really doing some very interesting forward thinking stuff, and part of what we are coming up with is that it’s going to take a very diverse energy mix going forward. This is a great idea, for the City of Houston to showcase what it can do, and for Shell to get involved and show that we have this wide range of energy options that we are looking at. That theme, the broader vision for energy, a holistic view of technology now and in the future was consistent throughout our discussion. Working with a portfolio of technologies has been a core part of Shell’s strategy for nearly a decade. We have our wind business. We have a little hydrogen business. We are working on some of the second and third generation biofuels concepts. We’ve owned solar manufacturing. If you truly believe that in the year 2015 or 2025 that it is going to take all kinds of energy sources, then you have to pitch your tent in several different arenas. He explained that an important part of the value of the wind business for Shell has been the compatibility with the company’s core hydrocarbon business. We can tie our wind business or our potential wind business in as a facilitator for other projects. So, for example, up in Canada we can do a wind project that will offset carbon for the oil sand projects or the other unconventional energies up there. Down here in the U.S. we look [at whether we can we use] power or use credits towards production projects under development in locations like California and Wyoming. Can we provide the green electron for drilling operations? We did this huge portfolio review when we got here and one of our folks mapped all of our projects on a map and then we went and got the potential Shell projects and we laid them over and they fit really nicely. From there we moved into Shell Wind’s focus and his market outlook. (Read More: Does Obama’s Re-Election Save the Wind Power Industry?) While Shell Wind’s recent focus in North America has been on green-field project development, Dick acknowledged this market was challenging and that they had begun looking more regularly to other projects “opportunistically”. RELATED: Top 5 nations that use renewable energy To develop a wind farm is about a 7 to 9 year process. With the uncertainties of power markets and transmission, doing green-field projects are getting tough. We have looked at a fair number of opportunistic projects where developers have gotten into trouble and can’t get financing. They call us. We are looking at several of these. We did last year too. Policy, Production Tax Credit and a Price on Carbon I asked about 2013, and Dick said that there were no projects in development slated for new operation, but they were reviewing several distressed projects. That was part of a broader discussion of the Production Tax Credit and the role of policy more generally. (Read More: 5 Ways that Wind Power Can Survive Without a PTC Extension) On the potential for an extension of the PTC (on which Shell has a competitive advantage in the market with because the company has a significant appetite for tax credits) he had this to say: We of course would like to see an extension. Everybody is worried about the production tax credit. It has been used as the villain for job layoffs and shutting down factories and things like that, but you know, you’ve done the calculations and looked at the models of these projects, and the PTC changes a 5% product to a 6% product. It does not have that huge of an effect. His follow on comment to this was a key point: It does have a huge psychological effect in that in order to keep these products going, you need some policies. The one thing I will advocate for is policy certainty – policy with PTC, or the whole valuation of carbon question. Which brought us to a very interesting part of the discussion. That’s a big thing that our society still has to grapple with. How do you equate the life cycle cost of a natural gas plant to an unscrubbed coal plant, to a scrubbed coal plant, to a wind project, to hydro, to nuclear to solar while taking into account the price of carbon. I actually think that if you worked on either long-term power policy or long-term renewable portfolio standards or long-term transmission, especially if you had more highways for electrons to move around we would see some positive things happen with power prices [for wind projects]. We turned from there to the global marketplace, and where he thought the exciting markets for wind were over the next couple of years. I actually think that North America is still pretty viable to be honest with you. There are still some good opportunities here. To really solidify that, you have to figure out the transmission equation. A lot of wind is in Texas, some is in California, but that’s the not near the load center. You are going to have to figure out how to transport it. You still need the highway to get it out. I think that the North Sea and the waters off of Germany and Holland and Belgium – Europe has put in some policies that are making a statement. There are parts of South America that are looking promising. Brazil has tried. They are in the infancy stage. Mexico has a very progressive view on building transmission. Down there are a lot of the majors like Walmart and Procter &amp; Gamble, and they have all contracted for very long term renewable purchase agreements with these wind installations [which are supported by] the transmission lines. They are doing some very interesting things. You do have security issues down there, but they are very progressive. There [are projects] up in Alberta. They are still trying to sort out carbon offsets and carbon policies. When they sort that out, they have capacity that is real. Offshore Wind I followed up by asking about Shell’s offshore wind business, I knew they had exited a few years back, but had since returned and I wanted to know if he thought the offshore market in the U.S. might also become a viable opportunity. RELATED: Top 5 nations that use renewable energy I still believe it is a tough road to hoe. I think where they want to put it on the East Coast makes sense – close to the load centers. And I believe that it’s technically doable, but the construction cost is 2-1/2 to 3 times onshore installation [and so is] the maintenance. You have to look for a power price that will support those costs. You also have the environmentalists. They worry about the birds, fish, etc. On our offshore wind farm in Holland we just finished a 5-year $3 million euro environmental study that was a part of our permitting process that was to study the effects of our wind farm on the fish community. And then you still have the FAA and the Department of Defense. They are still very concerned about the offshore wind farms and radar synergies. If you look at the subsidies here in the US, we get a PTC of $22 [per MWH]. Our incentive for our Dutch [offshore] farm is somewhere around $92 euros [per MWH]. Europe is willing to step up. It comes down to a political and emotional decision that our society has to grapple with. Overall I came away very impressed with his clear vision on the role of wind integrated into the larger energy company and an upbeat, if measured view of the wind industry in the coming years.

(This year’s theme was “dirty weather.”) More than 100 people — elected leaders, scientists, business people, and activists — appeared on panels and millions tuned in to watch. I caught up with Climate Reality founder Al Gore around hour 18 of his all-nighter and asked him about current U.S. climate politics, carbon taxes, and natural gas. Q. Did you see Obama’s press conference the other day? A. I heard the excerpts on climate, and [laughs] … oh … Q. Go ahead! A. No, I’m not going to go ahead! We have conflicting interests here! [laughs] Well, I think it’s too early to put a definitive interpretation on where he left it with that comment. I was genuinely encouraged that he said, in the first half of his answer, that he was going to conduct a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, etc. Many urged him to do it in the first term and I’m glad that he’s pledging to do that now. That could take on a life of its own and have an impact how he thinks about it. And … as I say, I really do believe it’s premature to put a definitive interpretation on what it means about his intentions. Q. Did you hear [White House press secretary] Jay Carney this morning? A. No, God help us, what’d he say? Q. He said, “We would never propose a carbon tax, and have no intention of proposing one.” A. I don’t think that comes as a big surprise to anyone. Those of us that hold out some hope that we will find a way to get a price on carbon, and know there are multiple ways to do it, have felt that the convergence of the fiscal cliff and the climate cliff could produce some surprising results. And there have been some private comments by some Republicans to that effect. But certainly that’s something you wouldn’t wanna bet money on in Vegas. Q. What do you think of this idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax? A. I have proposed a revenue-neutral carbon tax for a long time, 30 years. I proposed it in my first book, Earth in the Balance. I supported cap-and-trade because a lot of folks felt that it offered the opportunity for bipartisan consensus. And by the way, it may yet gain altitude globally — China, as you know, is implementing it in five provinces and two cities. They have indicated that they intend to use these pilots as a model for the nationwide program. Many are skeptical, but they often do follow through with what they say they’re going to do. And [cap-and-trade] just started in California yesterday. Australia is now linking theirs to the E.U. system. South Korea’s moving, British Columbia, Quebec — there are a lot of parallel developments that could converge, particularly if China does follow through. It’s premature to write [cap-and-trade] off, even thought it’s has been demonized and so many people are afraid to talk about it. But from the very beginning, I preferred a carbon tax. (And by the way, I’d be in favor of both; I don’t think they’re inconsistent at all.) And yet, the political environment in the U.S. has not changed to the point where it’s something you’d wanna bet on. But look, we’ve got to solve this. It’s an irresistible force meeting an immovable object, and something’s gotta give. I have enough faith in humanity to believe, against a lot of evidence, that we’re going to solve this. Q. Does this idea of a carbon/income tax swap make you nervous? The income tax is one of the only places we have progressivity in the U.S. tax code. A. I have not proposed doing it on the income tax, I have proposed doing it on the payroll tax. I am also friendly to the notion of a rebate scheme, though I doubt they’ll do that. It needs to be progressive — the rising inequality in the country is too serious to run the risk of worsening that. Q. Do you worry that you getting out in front of this might brand it in a certain way — A. Well, they come after anybody who speaks up in favor of doing something on climate. It’s not going to surprise any of them that I’m in favor of it. I’ve said it on practically a daily basis for years and years. Q. One thing that pops up every time you enter this debate is this notion that you’ve made a bunch of money off your green investments. I remember you saying to Congress that you’ve donated that money to your climate group. A. I have. The question was about Kleiner Perkins [a venture-capital firm in which Gore is an investment partner]. I have given, and do give, every year, 100 percent of my salary and 100 percent of distributions from Kleiner Perkins to the Climate Reality Project. There is absolutely no income of any sort from Kleiner Perkins that I do not give completely and totally to the Climate Reality Project. Q. The political climate in the U.S. seems stuck [on the climate issue]. What’s your take on how it’s developing in other countries? A. First of all, I don’t agree that it is stuck in the U.S. I really don’t. I think there is a great deal of movement beneath the surface. I run into people all the time who are former deniers, former opponents of doing anything on climate who are saying, “Look, this is just getting too weird. It’s clear that this is going on, we’ve got to do something.” Now, we’re not at the tipping point, but we’re much closer than we have been. I’ve said this before and I really do believe it’s true: Changes like this don’t occur in a linear way. The potential for change builds up, unmanifested, until it reaches a critical mass. You don’t always see it coming. There are plenty of examples of that. I believe we’re seeing just that kind of movement just beneath the surface here in the U.S. States are moving. Local governments are moving. Business is moving thanks to the happy discovery by so many businesses that initiated sustainability changes for branding reasons that it makes them money. It’s not a cost, but a benefit. By now, that’s pretty widely known in the business community. News Corp, for goodness sakes, is CO2 neutral. They don’t brag about it. They do it because it saves them money. I’m not saying we’re right on the tipping point. I know better than that. But neither do I think it’s accurate to say that we’re stuck in neutral. I don’t think we are. But to get to your real question, I think that what happened in Australia was hugely significant. What’s going on in China is quite significant. The fact that the E.U. is hanging tough and some member states are actually torquing up their commitment is very significant. I think Mexico is significant; we’ll see what [Mexican President-elect Enrique] Peña Nieto does when he takes over in a couple of weeks, but they’ve made a commitment for 75 percent reduction and they’ve got a broad societal consensus. I think what Hawaii is doing is enormously significant. You know, a lot of countries around the world are looking at their hold cards, they’re looking at the damage, and it is now translating into a set of commitments that are meaningful and will continue. Q. The federal level is blocked up, but there’s this movement underneath the surface. What’s the right way to take advantage of that movement? A. The sooner we can increase the scale of renewable installations, the steeper the cost down-curve is going to be. We’ve kind of got a Moore’s Law Jr. underway on [solar] PV. Wind is not as steep as PV. Efficiency is probably steeper than both, or comparable to PV. So there are a lot of trends moving in the right direction. Any policies that accelerate the movement to scale will help. In many areas, renewables, particularly solar and wind, are competitive. Not everywhere by a long shot, but in a growing number of areas. That in itself drives a certain tipping point, because when utilities are confronted with a better bargain, even with all the regulatory morass, they do make changes. We’ve seen 166 coal plants close. Yes, [natural] gas is a big part of it, but so is the impact of renewables on the margin. And that margin’s getting wider and wider all the time. Q. What’s your take on the natural gas revolution that’s happening? A. I’m concerned about methane leakage — the fact that it’s a valuable commodity and they have an incentive to capture it hasn’t stopped the leakage. Particularly in the fracking process, when they pull the fluids out, there’s just a huge outgassing. There are still leaks throughout the production and distribution chain, and the magnitude may well be sufficient to outweigh any CO2 advantage that you would otherwise gain. The fact that [then-Vice President Dick] Cheney exempted [fracking] from [the Safe Drinking Water Act] really put the whole industry in such a privileged position, it disadvantages the advocates of the public interest, which was the intention. But it does mean that there are a lot of legitimate questions that need to be run to ground, no pun intended. If you assume for the moment that those questions can be answered, then I think it’s responsible — only in that circumstance — to view gas as a short- to medium-term bridge fuel, substituting for coal, to buy some time for getting to scale and riding the cost down-curve on renewables. I do worry that we could make such a legacy investment in gas infrastructure that the nation’s appetite for making a second conversion would be severely diminished. But I weigh that against the inherent market power of the cost down-curve for solar and wind reaching the point where utilities — and homeowners, and business owners — simply can’t say no to it, even if we’re in the middle of the bridge substitution strategy. Q. Right now the activist community is taking on two big fights — one is against the Keystone pipeline, the other against coal export terminals in the Northwest. Where do you stand on those? Is it possible to keep some of the coal in the ground? A. I know the realpolitik and business perspective is to say, “It’s gonna come out no matter what,” but I don’t buy that. We have a planetary emergency. I know it drives some people nuts when I say that, but dammit, that’s what we face. We have to take that reality on board. I’m going to support [Washington] governor-elect Jay Inslee. He is my close friend and I think he is going to handle this extremely well. The folks around the Northwest ports have their own reasons for being concerned about what’s planned. I’m going to support those who are skeptical about this giant export strategy of coal. And let me answer the first part of that question — you’re probably not in as much suspense about that one. I am strongly opposed to that tar-sands pipeline. I think it’s crazy. Again, you have the realpolitik/business logic, but I just think it is morally wrong for us to open a brand new source of even dirtier carbon-based energy when we are desperately trying to bend down the curves. I understand why a lot of people think it’s unrealistic in the extreme for one of these things to be slowed down or stopped. But you know, if you take that position, then you are inherently saying, “Well, it’s not that unrealistic to destroy the future of human civilization.” gristDOTorg/climate-energy/a-chat-with-al-gore-on-carbon-taxes-natural-gas-and-the-morally-wrong-keystone-pipeline/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353511379805</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:22:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353512162982-4</Id><Topic><Title>Tax-and-Spend: The Essence of Superior Urban Civilization</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353359785518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 16:16:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stop spending on these silly wars.

Spending on war and borrowing to pay for it can be troublesome if the government borrowing is not offset by lower private sector borrowing - such a situation is what is know as a credit bubble and they always burst. But as for the wars... Probably the most useless one strategically was the Vietnam War. Out of that war came many advances in medicine, however, without which many people would have not have lived as long as they have - you should add all their contributions to the economy before subtracting the cost of the war. Wars provide many other useful technologies too by forcing investment into areas entrepreneurs are either unable or unwilling to invest in - like aviation, rocketry (space flight and satellite technology), computers (world war II war technology), etc. As for war being the source of the nation state. That is beyond dispute. No state today would exist if not for war, and the taxes it takes to fund it. Without a nation you are back to the sticks or the wilds living like a beast.

A world of high oil prices will suck people and business away from the rural areas and suburbs into the urban cores.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Red State Renewable Alliance, an ad-hoc coalition of citizens and companies dedicated to promoting the wind energy industry and its role in cultivating jobs and revitalizing manufacturing, announced its launch today. The mission of the Red State Renewable Alliance is simple: to tell the full story of the success of clean renewable wind energy in traditionally conservative areas of the country and emphasize the importance of incorporating this resources as part of an "all of the above" energy strategy in the United States. The United States has set itself apart as a leader in wind energy, representing more than 20 percent of the world's installed wind power. With the development of wind energy, the United States has seen manufacturing growth, job creation and return investment for farmers and communities across the country. Nearly 500 facilities across 44 states manufacture for the wind energy industry. The Red State Renewable Alliance will work to promote wind energy and extend the wind energy production tax credit (PTC) to maintain America's leading position and to save American jobs associated with the industry, many of which are in traditionally conservative Congressional districts. John Feehery is the Executive Director of the Red State Renewable Alliance. Mr. Feehery is a well-known Republican strategist and former spokesman for Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Majority Whip Tom DeLay. He believes strongly in wind as a key component of America's energy independence. "I am delighted to work hard to save jobs in the heartland of America, and to help preserve 'all of the above' as the energy policy of the United States. Studies show that the wind energy production tax credit pays for itself, cuts utility costs for consumers and we all know that it is a clean energy resource," said Feehery. "We at the Red State Renewable Alliance will tell the story of wind energy and the wind PTC in new and innovative ways, and we will convert the doubters out there."

Next Release: November 29, 2012 Notes and Definitions Reclassifications of data from working to base gas resulted in reducing estimates of working gas stocks in the Producing Region nonsalt facilities by approximately 7 billion cubic feet for the week ending November 16, 2012. These reclassifications had the effect of increasing the implied net withdrawal to 38 Bcf from 31 Bcf for the total Lower 48. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is changing the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR) web products. The implementation of these changes will be preceded by a public testing period, commencing on November 27, 2012. An example of the new webpage and more information about the public testing period, including specific times, can be found at: eia Summary Working gas in storage was 3,873 Bcf as of Friday, November 16, 2012, according to EIA estimates. This represents a net decline of 38 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 24 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 168 Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,705 Bcf. In the East Region, stocks were 2 Bcf below the 5-year average following net withdrawals of 19 Bcf. Stocks in the Producing Region were 128 Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,147 Bcf after a net withdrawal of 12 Bcf. Stocks in the West Region were 43 Bcf above the 5-year average after a net drawdown of 7 Bcf. At 3,873 Bcf, total working gas is above the 5-year historical range. Working gas stocks in the Producing Region, for the week ending November 16, 2012, totaled 1,275 Bcf, with 311 Bcf in salt cavern facilities and 964 Bcf in nonsalt cavern facilities. Working gas stocks increased 1 Bcf in the salt cavern facilities and decreased 13 in the nonsalt cavern facilities since November 9.

I know better than that. But neither do I think it’s accurate to say that we’re stuck in neutral. I don’t think we are,” he said in an interview with Grist. He said former climate change deniers are shifting their opinions in response to extreme weather events. And while Gore said “you wouldn’t wanna bet money” on getting a carbon tax passed, he noted the softening anti-climate rhetoric is positive. He said the mere fact Republicans raised the idea of a carbon tax — only to have some of the party's leaders shoot it down — is a sign of progress. “I think there is a great deal of movement beneath the surface,” Gore said. But words are one thing — action is another. Gore said the Obama administration decision on the Keystone XL project is the first test to see whether the two match up. “I am strongly opposed to that tar-sands pipeline. I think it’s crazy. Again, you have the realpolitik/business logic, but I just think it is morally wrong for us to open a brand new source of even dirtier carbon-based energy when we are desperately trying to bend down the curves,” he said. Many lawmakers on the left and the right expect President Obama to greenlight the pipeline’s northern leg. That portion requires administration approval because it crosses national boundaries. The pipeline would bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, and its supporters are promoting it as a jobs and energy security issue. Environmentalists have pushed back against the pipeline because it runs through environmentally sensitive regions and would increase delivery of one of the dirtiest forms of fuel. Gore also said stopping coal exports from the Pacific Northwest is essential to preventing climate change. The coal industry is pushing the administration to approve five new export terminals in Oregon and Washington to take advantage of growing Asian markets. Greens oppose the idea, saying it would exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions. “I understand why a lot of people think it’s unrealistic in the extreme for one of these things to be slowed down or stopped. But you know, if you take that position, then you are inherently saying, ‘Well, it’s not that unrealistic to destroy the future of human civilization,’” Gore said. Despite the possibility the administration could approve coal exports and Keystone, Gore said he was “genuinely encouraged” that Obama spoke about climate change in his first post-election press conference last week. Obama touted his first-term accomplishments, such as finalizing new vehicle efficiency standards and funding for green power projects. He said policies for the next four years are still being ironed out, adding, “You can expect that you will hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.” Still, Gore said those remarks contained little detail about what Obama’s climate agenda portends. “I really do believe it’s premature to put a definitive interpretation on what it means about his intentions,” he said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/269083-gore-potential-for-congress-climate-deal-growing</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353524192686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:56:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353525453029-14</Id><Topic><Title>We don't need petroleum data.

But in a rapidly-warming world chock-full of violent storms, severe droughts and extreme weather events, common traditions can be turned upside down. Just ask residents of the northeast struggling to make ends meet after Superstorm Sandy blasted through their communities and destroyed holiday plans for thousands. It's part of the new world order of extreme weather events that scientists warn will be more common if we don't begin to dramatically cut climate-altering carbon pollution now. But there is reason to be optimistic this holiday season that we are finally reaching the tipping point in terms of taking action in the U.S. People re-elected a president who vows to fight climate change and aggressively push the country toward clean energy solutions necessary to cut carbon pollution. Polls show more and more Americans believe climate change is real and that we need to make our environment more sustainable. So when 350.org’s Bill McKibben brought the popular “Do the Math Tour” to Washington this past weekend, it was a perfect time to renew the call to stop the massive Keystone XL pipeline project that would bring a river of dirty tar sands crude to refineries in the Gulf. Scientists have longed warned that super carbon-rich tar sands oil of Canada could have massive impacts on the global weather patterns and sensitive ecosystems. Watch a short video about the protest with NRDC’s Susan Casey-Lefkowitz That was the message that McKibben and his tour hammered home. A host of environmental organizations, civil rights activists, student leaders and thousands of supporters took to the streets around the White House once again to protest the Keystone XL pipeline, a massive multimillion-barrel superhighway of carbon-intensive tar sands crude that would cut straight through the nation’s agricultural breadbasket, threatening precious groundwater supplies as it flows to Gulf coast refineries and onto the international market. Protesters of all stripes, farmers, ranchers, Native Americans and students have fought it from Canada to the Gulf. But it is in many ways just the beginning of the fight, as President Obama ordered a second review of the TransCanada pipeline proposal last year after wide-ranging protests by citizens across the country. Meanwhile, the oil industry is mounting a well-financed offensive, spending millions in Washington to try to get its way, as NRDC’s Danielle Droitsch recently blogged: The tar sands industry is making a lot of noise right now in a desperate attempt to push for approval of the controversial northern segment of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. It’s no surprise Big Oil’s American Petroleum Institute continues to push for approval of the pipeline despite mounting evidence the pipeline is not in the national interest. What is less well known is that some of the biggest recipients of Big Oil’s money in the Senate are weighing in with the same message. Thanks to our friends at Oil Change International we now have a better sense of the influence Big Oil has in Congress to promote tar sands and the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. Protesters at KXL pipeline rally in Washington Photos: Rocky Kistner/NRDC The fight against climate change will be long and hard, but we have the technological know-how to create a more sustainable future. All we need is the political will. People have voted for a clean energy future, so now's as good time as ever to stop the Keystone XL pipeline in its tracks. And with the political winds shifting toward our backs, we can continue building more wind turbines as well. huffingtonpostDOTcom/rocky-kistner/keystone-xl-tar-sands-pip_b_2170999.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353525464974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:17:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353525711069-16</Id><Title>Fiscal Cliff Negotiations</Title><Msg>With Obama away in Asia dividing his time between meeting foreign leaders and dealing with the Gaza difficulties it seems little could possibly be getting done on the fiscal cliff negotiations, that is unless the Republicans are just caving in on everything.

Stocks of distillate fuel, including both diesel fuel and heating oil, are closely watched in this region, which is home to 80 percent of U.S. households that consume heating oil. As discussed in the October 11 edition of This Week in Petroleum (TWIP), the pull on distillate supplies from global markets and backwardation in heating oil prices for future delivery have both discouraged inventory builds in the Northeast. More recently, Hurricane Sandy disrupted shipments of petroleum products into the Northeast, further limiting distillate inventory builds. However, additional distillate fuel supplies are likely to become available in the region over the coming weeks with the restart of refineries in the New York Harbor area and an increase in shipments from the Gulf Coast. Distillate fuel inventories in the Northeast fell in nine of the last ten weeks to 26.1 million barrels on November 16 (Figure 1). Inventories are now 6.3 million barrels (20 percent) lower than they were on September 7, and 23.1 million barrels (47 percent) below the five-year average. About 40 percent of the 6-million-barrel draw has taken place in the three weeks since Hurricane Sandy, as storm-related damage to terminal, pipeline, and refinery infrastructure has limited product flows into the Northeast. Recent draws are only one part of the Northeast distillate inventory story. In 2012, distillate inventories did not increase over the summer months as they typically do, and as a result were low heading into autumn. From 2007 to 2011, distillate fuel inventories in the Northeast typically increased by about 16.3 million barrels (48 percent) from late April through late September, before leveling off between late September and Thanksgiving. Draws have historically picked up in December as colder weather takes hold in the Northeast. This year, a strong global distillate market lifted prices for heating oil in Europe above prices in New York Harbor during the spring, encouraging distillate exports from the Northeast. Year-to-date in 2012, distillate exports from the East Coast have averaged 138,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), a 49,000-bbl/d (54-percent) increase compared to the same period in 2011. Higher exports contributed to the 2.4-million-barrel decline in inventories from late April through late September. There are some signs that supplies of distillate in the Northeast could increase in the next few weeks. As of November 16, weekly data indicated that refinery runs on the East Coast were 218,000 bbl/d below their pre-storm four-week average level. However, the 70,000-bbl/d Hess Port Reading refinery has recently begun to operate. Also, Phillips 66 has reported plans for its 238,000-bbl/d Bayway Refinery in Linden, New Jersey to be partially operational late this month, adding more locally produced distillate supplies to the New York Harbor market. Additionally, distillate price spreads between New York Harbor and other major product hubs could attract products to New York. As of November 20, heating oil in New York Harbor was trading at premiums of four cents per gallon and five cents per gallon to Europe's Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub and the U.S. Gulf Coast, respectively. It is unlikely that the differentials to ARA will encourage significant shipments of distillate from Europe to the Northeast; in the short term, however, it will likely discourage flows the opposite way. Backwardation (where futures contracts settling in the prompt month are trading at a higher value than those settling further in the future) on the front end of the heating oil futures curve has also moderated, lessening the short-term incentive to sell inventories into the prompt market. On October 29, the prompt November futures contract sold at a 5-cent-per-gallon premium to the contract settling in January, which is much stronger backwardation than typically is seen during October. However, backwardation declined sharply with the rolling of the prompt contract to December and with regulatory waivers easing supply concerns. As of November 20, the prompt contract was selling at a penny-per-gallon discount to the third-month contract, which is now for delivery in February. Despite possible easing in the Northeast distillate market in the coming weeks, the heating season typically gathers steam in December. Over the past five years, consumption of distillate fuel increased by an average of 181,000 bbl/d from November to December in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) 1 which includes the Lower Atlantic states as well as the Northeast. The increase typically resulted in a draw from Northeast distillate inventories in December of 4.4 million barrels. However, this year, demand growth is uncertain. The residential heating oil market has been in structural decline over the last decade as many consumers have switched to more economically competitive fuels for space heating, such as natural gas. With the heating oil market shrinking, fewer inventories are needed to cover space heating demand. While the magnitude of the decline in heating oil demand is unclear, inventories are likely still below historical levels on a demand-cover basis, but more adequate than what current levels relative to a five-year average suggest. Additionally, the extent to which Hurricane Sandy affected distillate demand is not yet evident. Weather also adds uncertainty to expectations of heating oil demand. Based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast, in its (November Short-Term Energy Outlook) the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects heating degree days in the Northeast will be about 20 percent higher than last winter, but about 2 percent lower than the 30-year normal. Significant deviations from this forecast could affect heating oil demand, inventories, and prices. Gasoline prices fall for a sixth straight week, diesel fuel for a fifth The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline decreased two cents last week to $3.43 per gallon, six cents higher than last year at this time. The largest decrease came on the West Coast for the fourth consecutive week, with the price down eight cents from last week to $3.71 per gallon. The Rocky Mountain price dropped a nickel from last week to $3.51 per gallon. East of the Rockies, the East Coast price is now $3.48 per gallon, down a penny from last week. The Gulf Coast price remains the lowest in the Nation at $3.17 per gallon, a decrease of four cents per gallon. Going against the trend, the Midwest price increased a penny to $3.34 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price decreased less than a penny to remain at $3.98 per gallon, three cents lower than last year at this time. The largest decrease came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price fell five cents to $4.06 per gallon. The West Coast price is now $4.09 per gallon, four cents lower than last week. Down a penny, the Gulf Coast price is $3.87 per gallon. The Midwest price is up less than a penny to remain at $3.91 per gallon, and the East Coast price increased two cents to $4.05 per gallon. Propane inventories fall again Total U.S. inventories of propane dropped 0.5 million barrels last week to end at 72.7 million barrels, 22 percent higher than a year ago. The Midwest region led the decline, withdrawing 0.8 million barrels. Meanwhile, East Coast stocks fell 0.2 million barrels and Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks fell slightly. The Gulf Coast region added 0.5 million barrels of propane inventory. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.8 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating oil and propane prices show little change Residential heating oil prices remained flat during the period ending November 19, 2012. The average residential heating oil price fell a fraction of a cent to remain at $3.98 per gallon for the third week in a row, 4 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices rose by 4 cents per gallon last week to reach $3.21 per gallon, almost 8 cents per gallon more than last year at this time. The average residential propane price increased by less than a penny last week to $2.41 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices decreased by a penny to just under $0.95 per gallon for the week ending November 19, 2012, almost 53 cents per gallon lower than the November 21, 2011 price. eiaDOTgov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp -------------------------------- Monthly Biodiesel Production Report With Data for August 2012 | Release Date: October 31, 2012 | Next Release Date: November 29, 2012 | full report Highlights Production - U.S. production of biodiesel was 90 million gallons in August 2012.

That is the lowest level since November 2009, and a full 1/3 lower than it was a year ago. China's economic boom the past decade was coal based. They increased coal production by billions of tonnes per year, and began drawing coal to them from around the world. They had a huge advantage of not being constrained by the Kyoto Protocol, as Europe is, and not being constrained by the EPA as U.S. industry is. That advantage was only good for a one-time surge in economic output however. Once they have driven out of business their competition (ref: the collapse of industry across Europe and America since 1997) they have no market for more of the energy intensive, high polluting products they specialized in. Their industrial growth, thus, grinds to a halt. Their trade surplus can no longer be increased by mining or buying coal and producing mfg goods, and their real estate market which had been rising on yuan printing to buy up the inflow of dollars crashes... The Chinese are in real trouble... The oil market is counting on them growing more, endlessly based on nothing but a very confused conception of their economy and world demand.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353526972112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:42:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353537119942-19</Id><Topic><Title>Show Me The Money!

In the letter today to House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, Jackson said he’d made “my share of mistakes” without specifying what he’d done wrong. The resignation is effective today, according to the letter. “I am aware of the ongoing federal investigation into my activities and I am doing my best to address the situation responsibly, cooperate with investigators, and accept responsibilities for my mistakes,” Jackson, a Democrat, wrote in the letter. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Nov. 8 that Jackson, 47, is in plea negotiations with federal prosecutors to settle charges that he misused campaign funds. The newspaper had previously reported that Jackson was under investigation for allegedly using the funds to decorate his Washington home and giving a $40,000 Rolex watch to a female friend. Jackson was elected Nov. 6 to a 10th term with 63 percent of the vote in his Chicago-area district. He has been on medical leave from Congress since June 10. In response to increasing pressure from colleagues to explain his absence, Jackson’s office said July 27 that the congressman was being treated for depression at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Jackson’s spokesman, Frank Watkins, didn’t respond to an e- mailed request for comment on the resignation. The congressman’s office didn’t reply to a phone message asking for comment on the matter. William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen in Washington, declined to comment on whether Jackson is under investigation. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, a Democrat, will have until Nov. 26 to call a special election, said Jim Tenuto, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections. The election date must be within 115 days of Quinn’s announcement. Jackson is the son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353538867057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:01:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353538956049-21</Id><Topic><Title>How democrats govern</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353538867057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:01:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Detroit City Council answers possible financial progress with no, no, no Just a few short days ago Free Press Editorial Page Editor Stephen Henderson and I debated whether or not Detroit would get its act together, moving forward on a series of reforms that are necessary for the city to regain its financial footing. It seems that answer is a resounding no. In an epic (and not in the good sense) eight-hour Tuesday meeting, the Detroit City Council shot down one proposal after another: a contract to reform the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department; a contract with law firm Miller Canfield that the state says is necessary for the city to receive a cash infusion; a land sale to financier John Hantz, whose dream in life is apparently to beautify the east side with a tree farm, which would have the nifty side effect of returning derelict parcels to the city’s tax rolls. (The Hantz Farms land sale and the Miller Canfield contract have officially been tabled, not rejected, but let me tell you — if you watched any part of that meeting, all signs are pointing to no.) Taken individually, there are surely questions to be asked about each of those deals. (With, perhaps, the exception of the Hantz land sale, which has been exhaustively discussed for years. If you’ve got outstanding questions at this point, the Hantz folks really aren’t the ones to blame.) But in the context of Detroit’s financial situation, denying or pushing back these decisions are all questionable choices. • RELATED: Bing says Detroit employees will go on furlough Jan. 1 to avert city cash crisis • HENDERSON AND KAFFER: Waiting ... waiting ... waiting ... for tomorrow in Detroit And beyond the isolated import of any of those decisions is an underlying theme: Not reform. Not progress. Not forward momentum. The city is currently operating under a consent agreement with the state; when it was adopted this spring, the agreement was seen as the city’s best hope of avoiding the appointment of an emergency manager or, at worst, municipal bankruptcy. The consent agreement itself has been subject to a barrage of legal attacks. Union activists are attempting to invalidate it in court; Detroit Corporation Counsel Krystal Crittendon says she believes it’s not valid. The agreement set out specific reform priorities that the city would meet with state support. Two state-vetted officials — Detroit’s CFO Jack Martin and program manager Kriss Andrews — were hired to help implement the reforms, and a financial advisory board composed of some of the region’s sharpest business and financial minds was impaneled to provide guidance and oversight. The city, with the state’s approval, sold a round of bonds that would enable it to stay afloat while enacting major structural change. Almost eight months later, I think it’s safe to say the consent agreement isn’t working. A few changes have been implemented, but the financial advisory board has consistently warned that changes aren’t moving quickly enough. At its last meeting, Andrews told the board that the city’s cash position is worse than expected, by some $18 million, meaning that the city is dependent on drawing from that state escrow account. Which brings us to Tuesday. The milestone agreement, signed by Andrews, Martin, Detroit Finance Director Cheryl Johnson and state Treasurer Andy Dillon, is remarkably clear. Approving contracts with Miller Canfield, payroll administrator ADP, accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young and outside auditor Milliman, which will examine the city’s pension fund, were among the conditions required for an immediate cash draw of $10 million. (The latter three, by the way, were approved.) The question everyone is asking today is whether the council’s failure to approve the Miller Canfield business will stop the cash draw, if the state will really let the city go bust. That’s the wrong question. If the state wanted to push Detroit into emergency management, or even municipal bankruptcy, well, that could happen at any time. It could have happened a year ago. Tripping the city up on a technical error is clearly not what Dillon and Gov. Rick Snyder are aiming to do. The real question, the metric I’d be using if I were Snyder or Dillon, is whether or not the consent agreement can work. And increasingly, it’s hard to answer that question with anything but no.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353538956049</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:02:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353539015938-22</Id><Topic><Title>How democrats govern</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353538867057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:01:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(NECN) - The former Mass. highway safety director resigned Wednesday after being stripped of her title earlier this week. The Boston Globe reported earlier this week that Shelia Burgess' driving record included seven accidents, four speeding violations and one failure to wear a seat belt. Burgess has been on medical leave after suffering a head injury in an August car crash. Part of Burgess' resignation letter reads, "It has been my pleasure to serve this Administration over the past five years. However, at this time I feel my health must be my first priority." Public Safety Secretary Mary Heffernan had said that Burgess would be reassigned after her medical leave. Heffernan says Burgess did a good job, but never should have been hired in the first place given her driving record, and would have a hard time gaining back the public's trust.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353539015938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:03:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353541910465-23</Id><Topic><Title>Infernal needs to be committed !</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1353539289872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:08:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Happy Thanksgiving to maxipad.

The opinion from the Western District Court of Appeals reverses a lower court order concerning the impact of the green power mandate on electric rates. Earlier this year, a Cole County Circuit Court judge had declared the rules “unlawful and unreasonable” and remanded the matter back to the PSC. Tuesday’s court decision is a victory both for the PSC, which spent months developing the rules, and renewable energy advocates, who filed a brief on the commission’s behalf. Henry Robertson, a lawyer representing Renew Missouri, said the lower court ruling could have had a “crippling effect” on efforts to advance green power in the state if it had been upheld. Missouri voters approved the state’s renewable energy standard by a 2-1 ratio in 2008. The law requires Ameren and other for-profit utilities to gradually increase the use of renewable energy through 2021, when 15 percent of their power must come from wind, sun and other renewable resources. The law says the use of renewable energy cannot cause electric rates to rise more than 1 percent from what they would be otherwise. The rate cap provision in the rules was at the heart of the legal battle. The PSC rules require utilities to use a 10-year average when calculating the 1 percent rate impact to allow for higher upfront costs. Utilities argued for a narrower definition of how rates are affected. Tuesday’s court decision is the latest chapter in a long-standing battle over how for-profit utilities in Missouri must add renewable energy to their generating portfolios. And it may not be over yet. Ameren Missouri and other utilities that challenged the PSC rules may seek a rehearing or try to get the state Supreme Court to take up the case. An official with Missouri Energy Development Association, the utility lobby in the state, wasn’t available Tuesday afternoon. An Ameren Missouri spokeswoman said the utility had no immediate comment and said the utility was still reviewing the court opinion. stltodayDOTcom/print/business-section/missouri-court-upholds-psc-s-renewable-energy-rules/article_f3c9a503-cb8f-5baa-baf4-3b29f4eade13.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353546400361</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:06:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353547263502-26</Id><Title>Supporters of military biofuels program gear up for battle</Title><Msg>Supporters of military biofuels program gear up for battle Posted on 11/21/2012 by Greenwire midwestenergynewsDOTcom/2012/11/21/supporters-of-military-biofuels-program-gear-up-for-battle/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353547263502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:21:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353549255250-27</Id><Title>Government Driven Technologies</Title><Msg>Just a few: Lasers.
