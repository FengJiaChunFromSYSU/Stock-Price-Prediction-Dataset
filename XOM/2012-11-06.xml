Obama plans to change America into a weak socialist state. That is his goal. Massive wealth redistribution -- he plans to take what you have worked for and redistribute it -- the operative word is TAKE, TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. Since he has never built anything, he said that if you have a business, you didn't build that - somebody else built it. BECAUSE OBAMA'S REAL-LIFE WORK EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN AS A COMMUNITY AGITATOR he just does not believe that someone who works hard to build a business did anything. He wants revenge against white people (except for Hollywood celebrities and Rock Stars who fly around with him in Air Force One). You libs will be his victims as well -- merit will count for little. It will all be about "protected" groups of people. Mainly illegal aliens as there are so many of them. In California, our schools are now little more than daycare facilities for babysitting and feeding breakfast and lunch to the children of illegal aliens, and our roads are gridlocked with unsafe, often brakeless large trucks coming in from Mexico. Our taxes are so high because we pay for the medical care and "education" of illegal aliens and direct them to the food stamp office as they come across the border so that they can get free cell phones. Many of these aliens arrive with infectious diseases that spread quickly. As goes California, so goes the nation -- California is falling into the ocean, off the fiscal and cultural cliff -- STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING TO THE REST OF AMERICA before it is too late.</Msg><Username>carrieanneamerica</Username><Timestamp>1352191566976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 03:46:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352199683189-5</Id><Title>The USA Was Adequately Warned</Title><Msg>with Obama's book "Dreams from My Father" and the Movie 2016.

Eliminating deductions will be very difficult and nobody is going to cut taxes with a $1.1 trillion-a-year deficit. What hangs in the balance is not whose bold vision will or won't pass but rather how pushes and pulls at the margin best serve middle class interests. ObamaCare, for example, won't be repealed unless Republicans win a highly unlikely filibuster-proof majority. It will be implemented with either zeal or restraint. From that perspective, here are five reasons why a Romney presidency would be better for growth, employment and the middle class than reelecting President Obama. 1) Federal government spending has risen from 20% of GDP in 2007 to an unprecedented 24% today. While increases in government spending might temporarily boast GDP in the short run, in the long run reductions in private sector spending offset increases in government spending. Look at Europe. Today, Germany and France have 35% to 40% fewer hours of work per working age adult than the United States, according to statistics collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Four years after the financial crisis, it's no longer the short run. Belief in the possibility of a short-term rebound has faded. We need sustainable increases in growth. Private sector growth will benefit from moderation in public sector spending. Instead, President Obama has vehemently opposed spending cuts at every turn. He opposed Simpson- Bowles and fought spending cuts in the debt ceiling negotiations. That's consistent with his goal of increasing, rather than reducing, government spending on behalf of his constituents. Today, with spending at 24% of GDP, we need a president who is more likely to rein in spending on the margin. 2) With thousand of pages of new regulations, ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank have put an enormous regulatory strain and increased uncertainty on the private sector. This has slowed growth and increased unemployment. Without a filibuster-proof Republican majority, these programs will not be repealed. Instead, growth would benefit from more prudent application of these regulations and, in some places, even bipartisan pruning of some of their less productive excess. Who is more likely to do that, President Obama, who advocated every page of these regulations, or Governor Romney, who will take a fresh look from a pro-growth perspective? 3) Unless one political party achieves a filibuster-proof majority, nothing gets done federally without bipartisan compromise. By design, our government requires the president to secure some support from the opposite side of the aisle to initiate change. Who is more likely to hammer out a compromise? President Obama, who rammed far reaching health care legislation through Congress using legislative reconciliation rather than compromise and who has failed to produce any significant bipartisan compromises over his four year tenure, or Governor Romney, who successfully worked with his 85% Democratic Massachusetts legislature to produce landmark legislation? Success in the private sector demands compromise. Competition defeats excuses. Governor Romney's extraordinary private and public sector success demonstrates his skill and willingness to negotiate compromise. 4) Low-cost domestic energy represents one of the few opportunities for the United States to accelerate growth. President Obama rejected the Keystone Pipeline. He has slowed drilling on public land and increased regulatory uncertainty in the energy sector. Governor Romney will take steps to accelerate domestic energy production. His actions in Massachusetts demonstrate that he takes environmental concerns seriously. 5) Given the unprecedented level of spending, the explosion in regulation, and the unwillingness or inability to hammer out compromise, even on energy, any shift on the margin to rein in President Obama's excesses, especially from a leader with a proven track record of compromise, is likely to boost business confidence and investment at a time when we need growth. Governor Romney's election would provide that boost. The Obama presidency used its initial filibuster-proof majority to make extreme changes. The Massachusetts electorate and the midterm election halted further gains. Despite heavy election losses, President Obama has fought to hold on to these gains. A step back toward the middle would be a step in the right direction. A Romney presidency is far more likely to take that step.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352226748480</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:32:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352226844727-30</Id><Title>Blaming Mitt Romney for deadly meningitis and other wild liberal media claims</Title><Msg>With just a few days left until the election, the left’s out-of-control fringe has taken control – blaming Mitt Romney for deadly meningitis or even warning that his presidency will lead to the slow killing of gays. And when they aren’t doing that, they are calling, well, somewhat tongue in cheek, for a complete halt to sex with Republicans. Maybe it is true about someone putting drugs in Halloween candy. This close to Election Day, it’s getting harder to rank the liberal arguments on a scale of 1-10 (1 being sane and 10 being bonkers.) Perhaps they need the speakers from “Spinal Tap” to measure their level of lunacy. At the top of the list is blaming Romney for a meningitis outbreak based on something he didn’t do. Let’s say 10.5 on the scale. Salon.writer Craig Unger pinned the recent spike in meningitis, which resulted in the deaths of 29 people, on Romney. Unger used one of the oldest and lamest campaign tricks. Find a lawyer to make some wacky accusation and then write about it. As it turns out, Unger was complaining about a recent problem that happened in 2012 and Romney hasn’t even been governor since 2007. But if Romney wasn’t killing meningitis victims, then he must be planning to kill gays. That’s according to Sirius XM "Out Q 108" radio host and gay-left activist Michelangelo Signorile. He told one gay, pro-Romney caller that he should buy some arsenic to commit suicide, since it would be less awful than the "slow painful death" President Romney would apparently administer if he became the next inhabitant of the Oval Office. That’s the evolution of the campaign in a nut shell (in this case, emphasis on the nut). From a pathetic Washington Post story on a prank Romney did in high school, to a radio host claiming he would kill gays. But in a campaign where Biden talks about slavery, slow painful deaths are probably only a 9 on the scale. But far-left liberals aren't done. The Huffington Post’s Nico Lang even urged readers of the “Gay Voices” blog: “If They’re Voting for Mitt Romney, Don’t Have Sex With Them.” That’s right. Think Lysistrata with a lobotomy. “If every non-Romney voter in America promises to never again hook up with, have a casual sexual relationship with or even go to first with a Mitt supporter, our swing states will go blue in a heartbeat,” Lang wrote. “No one wants to give up that liberal nookie.” Yeah, HuffPo is considered by most in the news media to be a legitimate website. So, give that a 7.5 on the Outrage Meter. That’s an average of 9 on the Outrage Scale. If Romney wins, this stuff will look sane and the scale will be battling the deficit in trillions territory.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352226844727</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:34:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227263461-31</Id><Title>Funny business in Philly: GOP officials booted, Black Panthers return</Title><Msg>-A Pennsylvania judge issued an order Tuesday to reinstate Republican election officials across Philadelphia who allegedly were ejected or refused entry by on-site Democratic voting chief judges. One Republican official claimed that "just under 70" Republican election officials were blocked from Philadelphia polling sites Tuesday morning by Democrats on site. One of them, the official claimed, "was shoved out of the polling place." "For this many inspectors to be ejected from polling places is rare, even for Philadelphia," - One polling site in Philadelphia apparently had a mural of President Obama emblazoned on the wall directly behind the voting machines. The mural, at a local school being used as a polling site, contained the words "change!" and "hope," along with a quote from the president. Republicans were drawing attention to the image Tuesday morning, with one Mitt Romney spokesman tweeting: "Voters in Philly's Ward 35 are being forced to cast their ballots next to this." "It is an absolute disgrace," said Shannon Royer, deputy secretary for external affairs and elections in Pennsylvania. "Election materials and electioneering inside the polling place are prohibited by state law. This can be interpreted as trying to influence voters inside the polling place. I am told discussions are going on now about covering the mural." - Elsewhere in the city, a representative from the New Black Panther Party was also spotted outside a polling site. The New Black Panthers stirred controversy in 2008 when members appeared outside a polling site, one of them holding a billy club. The representative seen Tuesday morning was not armed.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352227263461</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:41:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227413564-32</Id><Title>Obama Waffled on Benghazi One Day After Attacks</Title><Msg>Bias at CBS suggested as reason for withholding video footage until now</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352227413564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:43:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227440600-33</Id><Title>This has no business beoing over 90, none,</Title><Msg>it's a very odd 2 days</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1352227440600</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:44:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227489614-34</Id><Title>East Coast in the dark, Storm coming, LESS ENERGY with be used!</Title><Msg>What is wrong with you idiots?</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1352227489614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:44:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227584299-35</Id><Title>Picking Losers and Losers</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama’s taxpayer-financed “investments” in green energy firms netted huge profits for company executives even as they cost taxpayers millions, a recent Washington Examiner analysis found. Corporate insiders at publicly traded green energy firms that received taxpayer funding in the 2009 stimulus made more than $60 million selling company stock after the government’s investment. Top executives in some cases cashed out before seeing their company’s stock value plummet. The sum value of Obama’s “portfolio” of green energy investments has fallen 78 percent since he took office, a level of performance worse than that of green energy firms not receiving taxpayer funding. Biofuel manufacturer Amyris Inc., for example, was given $24.3 million in taxpayer money to turn plant sugars into diesel fuel. At one point, this helped push its stock price above $30 a share. Today, Amyris has closed two of its three plants, and its stock sells for less than $3. Amyris’ insiders got rich first, though, netting $21 million in stock sales after the firm went public in September 2010. Solazyme, another biofuel manufacturer, received $21.8 million from Obama’s Energy Department. Its stock once traded at more than $25 a share but now is worth less than $9. Its corporate insiders realized $18.4 million in capital gains before the stock price collapsed. Corporate insiders at A123 Systems were not as quick to cash out as their biofuel colleagues. The Massachusetts electric-car battery manufacturer received a $249 million grant from Obama’s Energy Department in 2009, before going bankrupt last month. Its stock was worth more than $25 a share when it first went public in September 2009. A123 officers and directors still made more than $11 million in stock sales. Obama has promised to “double-down” on his green energy agenda if he is reelected on November 6. Recently uncovered emails reveal that Obama played an active role in the Department of Energy (DOE) loan program despite previous assertions to the contrary, the Examiner reported on Wednesday. The emails also show collusion among top administration officials to target taxpayer dollars to green energy firms in Nevada with the aim of helping Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) win reelection in 2010. The Obama administration has funneled taxpayer dollars to foreign companies such as the Spanish solar firm Abengoa, as well as to companies such as Fisker Automotive, which has shipped production overseas and whose signature car model suffers from a tendency to explode. Two U.S. senators on Thursday wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner expressing concern over the bankruptcy filing of A123 Systems, the battery company that supplied components to Fisker. Sens. John Thune (R., S. Dak.) and Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) say they are worried that a Chinese firm could acquire A123, which was awarded several military contracts for research and development. The firm could then gain access to highly sensitive information and technology, potentially compromising U.S. security interests. The administration’s most high-profile green energy failure was its decision to gamble more than $500 million by investing in Solyndra, a California solar firm that filed for bankruptcy in in September 2011. Solyndra was partially owned byprominent 2008 Obama campaign bundler George Kaiser. Kaiser can expect to see a better return on his investment than American taxpayers. As part of a 2010 agreement to restructure Solyndra’s loan, Obama’s DOE granted priority status to private investors such as Kaiser with respect to the first $75 million recovered in the event of the firm’s bankruptcy. The move may have violated federal law. California investment guru and partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB) John Doerr, who has personally contributed more than $170,000 to Democratic campaigns and committees since 2008, owned stakes in several green energy firms that received taxpayer funding in the stimulus. Doerr, an early and outspoken advocate for federal investment in “green” technology, was named to the president’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board in 2009 where he helped craft the $787 billion stimulus package. Of the 27 companies listed in KPCB’s “green-tech” portfolio, 16 received some form of taxpayer support. Steve Westly, a top Obama bundler who was appointed to a White House advisory board on energy policy, is another prominent investor with ties to taxpayer financed companies. Westly has openly acknowledged that a close relationship with federal lawmakers is key to investing in green technology. In response to a reporter’s question about which green energy companies he likes to invest in, Westly said: “Who cares what I think. Let’s talk about ‘what does Obama like? Here’s what he likes,’ because here’s where the federal government is putting money. And let me tell you, whatever he likes, that’s what I like.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352227584299</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:46:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352227655676-36</Id><Title>Union Spends $70M for Dems, More than Obama Super PAC</Title><Msg>The Service Employees International Union has spent nearly $70 million in campaign dollars this election cycle, making the union the top outside spender for Democrats, reports the Wall Street Journal: SEIU, like other large entities that spend money on elections, doesn’t have to disclose all of its expenditures to the Federal Election Commission.

The Danish government plans to push back power production from two offshore wind farms with a joint capacity of 1,000 megawatts by one year to 2018. The 600-megawatt Kriegers Flak and 400-megawatt Horns Rev projects will still start full output by 2020, according to a document posted today on the website of the Danish ministry of climate and energy. Offshore wind is a key component in an agreement between government and opposition parties, signed March 22, to replace 50 percent of coal use with renewable energy sources over the next eight years and boost the share of wind power to 50 percent of total generation from 28.2 percent last year. Tenders for the two projects will be announced in 2013 to 2015. Denmark currently has four offshore wind farms at Horns Rev and Roedsand, with capacities from 160 megawatts to 209 megawatts. Denmark’s biggest utility Dong Energy A/S is constructing a fifth farm at Anholt, which is due to start this year with full 400-megawatt output in the first half of 2013. bloomberg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352228496190</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:01:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352228507857-38</Id><Topic><Title>Down goes Romney/Ryan</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352227928515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:52:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The primary asylum occupants seem to be you and wahleee boy, and you seem to have caught his insanity even more seriously than most would have believed possible.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352228507857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:01:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352228661276-39</Id><Topic><Title>East Coast in the dark, Storm coming, LESS ENERGY with be used!</Title><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1352227489614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:44:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So how short are you?</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352228661276</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:04:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352228944751-40</Id><Title>★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ AP reporting a ROMNEY LANDSLIDE !!! 2:00pm</Title><Msg>yesssssss sirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !!!</Msg><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1352228944751</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:09:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352229058705-41</Id><Title>Report: Fossil fuels could raise global temperatures 10 degrees by century's end</Title><Msg>Report: Fossil fuels could raise global temperatures 10 degrees by century's end By Zack Colman - 11/05/12 02:14 PM ET The continued use of fossil fuels could push global temperatures 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) higher by the end of the century, according a report released Monday. While nearly 200 nations at the 2009 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to limit the average global temperature increase to 3.6 degree Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2050, too few nations have taken measurable steps to hitting that mark, accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said in its annual carbon report. That makes "ambitions to limit warming to 2 [degrees Celsius] appear highly unrealistic,” the report said. “Even doubling our current rate of decarbonisation, would still lead to emissions consistent with 6 degrees of warming by the end of the century. To give ourselves a more than 50% chance of avoiding 2 degrees will require a six-fold improvement in our rate of decarbonisation,” Leo Johnson, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers’ sustainability and climate change practice, wrote in the report. To meet that goal, the world would need to reduce its carbon intensity by 5.1 percent per year through 2050. From 2010 until 2011, carbon intensity fell 0.7 percent worldwide, the report said. Fossil fuels are inhibiting that progress, the report said. While overall worldwide carbon intensity fell, energy-related emissions rose 3 percent. The United States, for its part, has seen its carbon dioxide emissions drop to a 17-year low. The report said U.S. energy-related emissions fell 1.9 percent in 2011, while its overall carbon intensity dropped 3.5 percent. The energy-related emissions decrease is partially a result of a mild winter and a greater concentration of more fuel-efficient vehicles. But most of the U.S. carbon reduction is credited to increased use newfound natural gas abundance. That has helped push the U.S. to export its coal at record levels this year, therefore offering little, if any, net benefit to global emissions reduction targets. The report praised natural gas for its carbon-cutting qualities, but feared a reliance on it could stunt progress in developing other energy sources. “But low gas prices may also reduce the incentive for investment in lower-carbon nuclear power and renewable energy,” the report said. The report said growing use of natural gas in emerging economies could create a dependence on fossil fuels. It noted carbon emission reduction “appears to have stalled” in major emerging economies such as China and India. “Avoiding lock-in will require discipline in governments that encourage gas generation, to ensure that incentives are not diverted away from renewable energy,” the report said. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352229058705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:10:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352229846624-42</Id><Topic><Title>Down goes Romney/Ryan</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352227928515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:52:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny I thought that was you.

New Jersey’s Democratic Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez on Monday asked EPA to allow fuel shipments to New Jersey terminals not normally permitted to handle biofuel. EPA’s decision to honor that request will allow 17.6 million gallons of fuel to enter New Jersey. “We need to get fuel flowing into New Jersey, and the EPA’s decision to allow fuel to be rerouted to New Jersey is an important step toward getting our state moving again. The fuel shortage and power outages at gas stations are holding our state back from a full recovery. We will continue working to do everything possible to get our first responders and all New Jerseyans moving again,” the senators said in a statement Tuesday. Superstorm Sandy battered the state’s fuel terminals, causing disruptions in the gasoline distribution system. In turn, gas stations have begun running out of fuel, inhibiting a recovery effort. To address that shortage, EPA last week eased clean diesel fuel rules in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and in the New York City area. That temporary exemption enabled certain vehicles to run on home heating oil for emergency response efforts. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352244551295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 18:29:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352245302233-52</Id><Title>What is Intrade?</Title><Msg>Pivsup (aka Maxwizard) keeps referencing it as a great predictor of Obama being re-elected - like in a big way - 72%.
