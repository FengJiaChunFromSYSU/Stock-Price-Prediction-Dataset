An Exxon Mobil pipeline ruptured in central Arkansas on Friday, leaving a sheen of oil on nearby streets and causing the evacuation of 22 homes in the small town of Mayflower. Exxon Mobil said its Pegasus Line, which runs from Patoka, Ill., to Nederland, Tex., was carrying heavy crude from western Canada when the spill occurred. On Tuesday, Attorney General Dustin McDaniel of Arkansas announced that he was opening an investigation into the spill, and he asked Exxon to preserve all documents related to the accident. Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would also move heavy Canadian crude, leapt on the Exxon spill, reiterating their contention that crude drawn from Canada’s tar sands region is too risky to transport and especially vexing to clean up. “What we’ve got here is a small example of the type of risks associated with a tar sands pipeline,” said Anthony Swift, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of many environmental groups fighting the pipeline proposal, which is awaiting State Department approval. “It also demonstrates the large gaps in pipeline safety.” On Tuesday, vacuum trucks and crews were still working to clean up the accident, which the Environmental Protection Agency called a “major spill.” While it was unclear how much oil had leaked, Exxon Mobil said it had recovered thousands of gallons of oil mixed with water and had prepared for a spill as large as 420,000 gallons, though it said it believed that the amount released was smaller. “Our focus is on the nytimesDOTcom/2013/04/03/us/pipeline-spills-stir-new-criticism-of-keystone-proposal.html?_r=0</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1364999545780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365001459531-6</Id><Topic><Title>The Way to Fix the USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364913787151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:43:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem is that if you use wealth as a criterion of nobility you get people like Bernie Maddow, Sheldon the Casino guy and Donald Trump as your knights in shining armor.

If they do not consider themselves allies they can do a lot of damage. A U.S. Constitutional Convention would be required to create an American Nobility. Counting dollars is easy, so the process would be to just grant titles based on money first, and then let those nobles vote for members of cultural committees to decide on other ways to become a noble. Setting up committees to decide on grounds for kicking someone out of the nobility would certainly be possible too, and consistent with the traditions of European nobility. Allowing non-nobles to vote on such matters would not be consistent with the tradition. I don’t think the hard part would be copying Europe’s noble tradition which has never been just about money. The hard part would be getting America’s people to accept it. I suspect most are really sheep when you get past the bluster and would be easy to control. Others would be more difficult.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365002983399</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365003710670-8</Id><Title>"XOM upgraded...." and "13 INDICATOR...." messages below are SPAM</Title><Msg>As are 99% of phoney one line responses, many of them pure gibberish.</Msg><Username>r60rider</Username><Timestamp>1365003710670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:41:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365004783335-9</Id><Title>Did they find the leak ? and what caused it ?</Title><Msg>Feds on Exxon like a flea on a dogs back, before they even know what happen,</Msg><Username>smkpit</Username><Timestamp>1365004783335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:59:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365005228821-10</Id><Title>ERBB IS AND MJNA LEGAL MARIJUANA STOCKS GONNA MAKE PEOPLE MILLIONS</Title><Msg>ERBB</Msg><Username>aenadeona</Username><Timestamp>1365005228821</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:07:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006087803-11</Id><Topic><Title>13 INDICATOR XOM BUY/SELL/HOLD REPORT !</Title><Username>barry.white95</Username><Timestamp>1362318160412</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 08:42:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome!</Msg><Username>savage.richard</Username><Timestamp>1365006087803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365007654613-12</Id><Topic><Title>The Way to Fix the USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364913787151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:43:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You bring up difficult questions.What constitutes nobility?
