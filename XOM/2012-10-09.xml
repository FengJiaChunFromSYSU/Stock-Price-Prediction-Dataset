By Dene Moore, The Canadian Press October 9, 2012 5:30 AM PRINCE GEORGE, B.C. - The environmental assessment panel examining the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline returns to British Columbia on Tuesday, for final hearings that will put the project's environmental impact and emergency planning under a microscope. The hearings slated to begin in Prince George will see the proponent, Enbridge Northern Gateway (TSX:ENB), scientists and project critics questioned under oath about the evidence they've submitted to the panel. Enbridge officials said they look forward to their return to B.C. "As the project proponent, we intend to demonstrate to British Columbians and to all Canadians through the examination of the facts and science upon which this project application is based that there is a path forward that provides for prosperity while protecting the environment," Janet Holder, the company's vice-president of western access, said in a statement released Friday. "The (panel) is the appropriate forum for this confidence-building exercise with Canadians." But company officials may take a back seat to federal government representatives, who will be subject to questioning for the first time since hearings began earlier this year. Several participants in the panel hearings have been so keen to get answers on everything from regulatory changes to government budget cuts that the panel has already tried to rein in the cross-examinations. "It will be the first set of hearings where the federal government will be on the stand. That will be interesting," said Nikki Skuce, of ForestEthics, one of the groups taking part in the hearings scheduled in Prince George and Prince Rupert over the next few months. Officials from Aboriginal Affairs, Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Natural Resources and Transport Canada will be answering questions on evidence those ministries have provided to the panel as it weighs the project. The Conservative government has been roundly criticized for its support of a tanker port on the West Coast that would give Canadian oil producers access to Asian markets. Nine participating groups have been denied requests to question federal witnesses because their questions were not linked to the specific evidence filed with the panel. The Alberta Federation of Labour wanted to ask about refining oil in Canada and government views on keeping jobs in Canada, while the Haida Nation wanted to know about foreign interests in the project and federal budget cuts. "Requests have not been granted where the nature of the questions does not relate to the evidence to be tested or to the List of Issues," the panel wrote in an Aug. 30 letter to participants. At least a dozen groups and individuals will be allowed to question the federal government representatives. Several conservation and First Nations groups will forego attending the hearings in Prince George and focus on Prince Rupert, where the tanker port and shipping will be under scrutiny. "We're going at Enbridge's witness panels in a way that we hope will give the joint review panel the information they need to make a learned decision," said Art Sterritt, executive director of Coastal First Nations, an alliance of aboriginal bands along the B.C. coast. "It's such a vast array of half information and no information that it really is quite a flawed process at this time. And that's not the fault of the panel." The Haisla Nation will also be there, said chief counsellor Ellis Ross, but the review process has already taken a "tremendous" amount of time and resources and the Haisla and other First Nations are already looking beyond the environmental assessment process. "This is an environmental assessment, that's all it is. This is not a process to deal with aboriginal rights and title. This is not consultation and accommodation of aboriginal rights and title," Ross said. "This is a really important part of the process for B.C. and Canada, but it's not the most important part of the process for aboriginals." The pipeline would transport diluted bitumen from the Alberta oil sands from Bruderheim, Alta., across northern B.C. to a tanker port planned for Kitimat, B.C. calgaryherald</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349789345872</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:29:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349794023683-24</Id><Topic><Title>XOM price per share could probably blast off!

They threw in money from the start. They drummed up big-name endorsements when other liberal groups hung back. And they’ve joined the ranks of campaign foot soldiers. So environmentalists should be excited to see their guy ahead in the polls — a sign that their hard work is paying off. Instead, they’re grappling with a tough reality: Even a win could be setting themselves up for a colossal loss early next year. Many environmentalists believe that Obama may be just a few months away from approving what they say would be a devastating blow to the Earth’s climate — the Keystone XL pipeline. The project would allow crude oil from the vast Canadian oil sands to flow to refineries in Texas, while enabling what greens warn would be a calamitous release of carbon into the atmosphere. “It will definitely be a gut-check moment. We’ll start to see what his legacy looks like,” Bill McKibben, an activist who helped organize anti-Keystone protests at the White House last year, said in an email. Multiple environmental activists said privately that approval of the pipeline would be a grievous disappointment. But they were quick to say their support for Obama remains steadfast because, in their view, a Romney presidency would be much worse. Still, if Obama does approve the pipeline, environmentalists are prepared to make a lot of noise — after the election. “Clearly, if the president were to go forward and approve the project even after review has shown that it’s damaging to the environment ... we’ll call a spade a spade,” Sierra Club lobbyist Melinda Pierce said. Jane Kleeb, executive director of the anti-Keystone group Bold Nebraska, vowed to keep a close eye on every step of the construction process if the pipeline gets the go-ahead. “We’ll create our own citizen team to be flip-camming every foot of pipeline that goes into ground,” she said. Obama has yet to take an official stance on the pipeline, which needs to undergo a final review by the State Department before he decides whether it should receive a permit. But the president has already done plenty to fuel the greens’ qualms — including by offering a public embrace to Keystone’s southern half, which would funnel Oklahoma crude oil to Texas. In March, Obama posed in front of a yard filled with large pipes near Cushing, Okla., to champion that part of the project, announcing that he was directing federal agencies to “make this project a priority, to go ahead and get it done.” Obama has offered some resistance to Keystone’s northern segment, first by postponing his decision on the project last fall and then by denying it a permit when congressional Republicans tried to force his hand. But the administration’s sticking points have largely centered on the relatively narrow question of whether the pipeline would threaten Nebraska’s ecologically vital Sandhills region — and the state is weighing possible alternative routes. NASA climate researcher James Hansen has warned that it would be “game over” for the Earth’s climate if Keystone is built, and environmental groups have turned the fight against the pipeline into one of their most visible causes in recent years. Last year, green activists staged mass sit-ins outside the White House for 15 days to protest the project, with more than 1,200 arrested. They included actress Daryl Hannah, who was arrested again last week in Texas while trying to block construction of the southern Keystone segment. Meanwhile, Republicans have turned Obama’s slowness to act on the pipeline into a prominent part of their election year attack. But in the end, prominent Keystone supporters and opponents alike say they expect Obama to approve the project in early 2013. “I don’t see any reason why the State Department wouldn’t find this in the best interest of the United States,” said Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a vocal supporter of the pipeline. And environmental crusader Ralph Nader told POLITICO in a videotaped interview that “everybody, even the environmental community, knows he’s going to approve it after the election.” For many greens, though, any potential angst over next year has largely taken a backseat to winning the election for Obama. Politically active environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters made a rare joint endorsement of the president last spring. Since then, green groups have mobilized to get the president reelected. For example, LCV and the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action spent more than $1 million on an ad campaign supporting the president in Colorado and Nevada. One part of the calculation: Romney says he’ll approve Keystone on “Day One.” But the environmentalists still hold out hope that Obama could side with them. “Because the Keystone pipeline has been such a flashpoint, he could very easily say, ‘We’re denying this pipeline because it’s not in the nation's interest,’” Bold Nebraska’s Kleeb said. Some environmentalists think Obama may find a middle course — an outcome that would still give Keystone supporters a win, but not a sweeping one. “I would not be surprised if he approves the permit with conditions — that there are real, measurable, and permanent offsets of the increased carbon pollution due to [Keystone] making an expansion of tar sands oil production possible,” said one leading voice of the environmental community who didn’t want to go on record speculating about the project. The person said it’s also possible that Obama would veto the project if the State Department’s analysis shows that the new path still poses a risk for Nebraska’s Sandhills. A White House spokesman declined a request for comment on this story, directing questions to the State Department. A department official said the agency will conduct a “thorough review process in a rigorous, transparent and efficient manner,” adding that “we do not anticipate concluding the review before the first quarter of 2013.” The Keystone controversy touches on a significant debate for environmentalists about a second Obama term: Would he move drastically to the left or stay in the center? “I expect this to continue to be a centrist administration that’s trying to find what they view as a sensible middle ground between different interests,” said David Goldston, a senior adviser at the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, which has not officially endorsed Obama. “I can’t predict where exactly they're going to end up.” Joe Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former Clinton-era Energy Department official, said Obama’s ultimate place in history depends on the planet’s fate. “The second term is about legacy, and the only legacy that matters is avoiding catastrophic global warming,” Romm said. “If he fails at that, he, along with the rest of us, will be judged harshly by history no matter what else happens.” Goldston said that while a Keystone approval would be a major blow to environmentalists, greens are setting their sights on a number of other issues, including potential plans to impose climate regulations for existing power plants and tighten ozone standards. “There would be a lot of disappointment in the environmental community. It wouldn’t be a great way to start a second term,” Goldston said. “But there are a whole range of policies that we’re looking for from this administration.” Republicans, for their part, continue to use Keystone to bash Obama both on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lee Terry (R-Neb.), a leading Keystone supporter, has joined other Republicans in warning that a vote for Obama is a vote against the pipeline. “I think a lot of people assume that President Obama, if elected, will [approve] it,” Terry said in an interview with POLITICO. “But considering how hard the NRDC and Sierra Club and other environmental organizations oppose the oil sands, I don’t have a high level of confidence.” Project developer TransCanada, which has been trying to build the project since 2008, expressed confidence that it is close to the finish line. “From an energy security perspective, it seems very difficult to turn down this land-based connection to the third-largest oil reserves on the planet to a country that happens to be your greatest ally,” said Alex Pourbaix, president of energy and oil pipelines at TransCanada. politico</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349807006333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:23:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349808077341-38</Id><Title>House Energy chief Upton (R-Mich.): Repeal both oil, green power tax breaks</Title><Msg>House Energy chief Upton: Repeal both oil, green power tax breaks By Ben Geman - 10/09/12 08:01 AM ET House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) is calling for removal of oil-and-gas industry tax breaks if subsidies for green energy are also eliminated. Upton’s comments, given at a Monday-night debate with Democratic challenger Mike O’Brien, arrive a week after Mitt Romney said billions of dollars in oil industry tax breaks would likely be jettisoned under his proposal to lower the overall corporate tax rate. “I’m for putting all of these on an even footing,” Upton said. “Let’s look at the oil and gas subsidies, let’s take them away. Let’s let them compete just like everyone else at the same level. We can do that with the tax code to take those special provisions away.” The Kalamazoo Gazette reported Upton’s comments and provided audio of the remarks here. Upton bashed the federal loan guarantee for the failed solar energy company Solyndra — the source of a lengthy Energy Committee probe — in arguing that aid for the oil and renewable energy industries alike should be removed. “Let’s let all of these energy companies compete on their own. Let’s have a very serious discussion about removing any subsidy that puts one form of energy ahead of the other. Let’s let the marketplace determine that. Supply and demand is a pretty good system that works, and let’s have that in place,” Upton said. But stripping incentives for green energy has faced pushback from advocates who say that, unlike mature fossil fuel industries, low-emissions renewable sources should continue receiving the federal aid. Upton voted in 2011 to maintain oil industry tax incentives, but those proposals were not coupled with repeal of green energy incentives. Upton, who was first elected to his southwest Michigan seat in 1986, is considered a safe bet to win another term. The Hill’s race ratings list his seat as “likely” to remain in Republican hands. Romney’s comments last week were met with a lukewarm reception from oil industry groups, which have battled hard — and successfully — to maintain an array of incentives. Trade group officials said they were open to discussion of Romney’s idea of removing their incentives while lowering the overall rate, but didn't rush to embrace the idea. Upton, like Romney, broadly said that the tax code should be overhauled to lower rates while removing deductions. “You see, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. When you lower that to 25 percent — all the loopholes, get rid of them. Special subsidies? Get rid of them. Lower the rate and we will bring jobs back that have gone overseas. And we ought to be doing the same thing on the individual tax code, too. It's way too complex. You've got to be able to simplify that. It ought to be bipartisan and I'm convinced it will happen for the right reasons,” he said, according to a transcript. While Upton discussed tax policy changes, it’s the Ways and Means Committee, not the Energy and Commerce Committee he leads, that has jurisdiction over tax policy. Nonetheless, the election-season remarks arrive as oil and green energy tax policy is facing increased scrutiny. The wind industry is battling hard to preserve a key incentive. The production tax credit, which the industry calls vital to financing new power projects, is slated to lapse at year’s end unless Congress extends it. Romney favors letting the wind incentive expire while President Obama is pressing for its renewal. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349808077341</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349808751104-39</Id><Topic><Title>XOM price per share could probably blast off!

Legal limitations and a lack of key data have hampered the Environmental Protection Agency's oversight of shale production, said the report from the Government Accountability Office, Congress' non-partisan investigative arm. "Officials at EPA reported that conducting inspection and enforcement activities for oil and gas development from unconventional reservoirs is challenging due to limited information, as well as the dispersed nature of the industry and the rapid pace of development," the report said. Breakthroughs in horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing in recent years have unlocked massive oil and gas reserves trapped in shale formations. The surge in domestic drilling has raised concerns about possible water and air pollution. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Governor Mitt Romney, have touted the shale boom on the campaign trail, with Romney pledging to keep states in charge of most onshore drilling. The Obama administration has said that states are the primary regulators of shale energy output, but the federal government can offer a template for effective oversight. Critics of shale oil and gas drilling have charged that federal regulation of the practice is inadequate, especially since hydraulic fracturing is exempted from certain EPA rules. The report was requested by Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate who have raised questions about fracking. The GAO found that the EPA has difficulty investigating water contamination cases because there is often no information on the quality of water before drilling began to use for analysis. The agency also said it does not always know where to conduct inspections or enforce certain regulations because it sometimes does not have information on what activities are going on at well sites. In some cases, the EPA must completely rely on companies to identify themselves as subject to regulations, the GAO reported. "Regulators have operated with one hand tied behind their back for too long when it comes to the oil and gas industry," said Congressman Edward Markey, one of the lawmakers who requested the report. Markey and other lawmakers have pushed for legislation that would expand federal oversight of hydraulic fracturing, a move the industry has warned is unnecessary and could curb development. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349824685316</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:18:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349825325014-65</Id><Title>Waxman wants federal probe of California gas price spike</Title><Msg>Waxman wants federal probe of California gas price spike By Ben Geman - 10/09/12 05:16 PM ET A powerful House Democrat wants the Federal Trade Commission to find out if market manipulation is boosting California gasoline prices, which soared a half-dollar per gallon in the last week. Tuesday’s letter from Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) to the FTC boosts political pressure on regulators to probe prices that, according to AAA, jumped 49 cents in a week to a current average of $4.67-per-gallon for regular gasoline. “A decade ago, market manipulation by Enron sent California’s electricity prices soaring. While we do not know whether this is a parallel situation, we must make sure California consumers are protected,” writes Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “That is why I am requesting an independent investigation by the FTC that examines the causes of the current gasoline price spike in California,” adds Waxman, who is a key ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called for an FTC probe Sunday, while on Monday Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) separately urged the multi-agency Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group, which is led by the Justice Department, to investigate. AAA, in its weekly analysis Monday, noted that California already faced low supplies approaching the Oct. 31 end to the summer-blend gasoline requirements, a situation worsened by a power outage at an ExxonMobil refinery in the state. While Exxon announced Friday that its Torrence, Calif., refinery had resumed normal operations, motorists were “already feeling the pain” of soaring prices, AAA noted. AAA said that lower prices are likely on the way after the refinery’s resumption of normal operations and a waiver from Gov. Jerry Brown (D) over the weekend that allows early sales of winter-grade gasoline. Waxman’s letter notes a series of problems and maintenance issues at California refineries – including the Aug. 6 fire at a Chevron refinery. Those incidents, combined with low inventories, are commonly cited as the reasons for high prices in the Golden State. But he noted that those conditions may have made the California gasoline market ripe for manipulation or price gouging. “Periods of tight gasoline supply require special vigilance because of the opportunities for market manipulation – especially when individual market participants possess substantial market share as is the case in California. When Los Angeles consumers see their gasoline prices skyrocket by 50 cents per gallon over the course of one week, something is wrong,” Waxman’s letter to FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz states. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349825325014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:28:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349826222045-66</Id><Title>845 MW of Oregon Wind Power Going to California</Title><Msg>845 MW of Oregon Wind Power Going to California October 8, 2012 By Jake Richardson 1 Comment An enormous wind farm in Oregon is now generating about 845 MW for California. The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm has 338 turbines from General Electric. Each is rated at 2.5 MW. Shepherds Flat is one of the largest wind farms in the world. It is located in Eastern Oregon near Arlington, and has been estimated to benefit the local economy by about $16 million annually. The cost for the GE2.5XL turbines and ten-year service agreement was about $1.4 billion, and the DOE provided a $1.3 billion loan. Google also invested in the project, to the tune of $100 million. Power generated at Sheperds Flat will prevent about 1.5 million tons of CO2 from being added to the atmosphere each year. One estimate says that is the equivalent of CO2 from 260,000 passenger vehicles, each year. About 400 jobs were created for the wind farm’s construction and 35-45 were added permanently to operate it. The facility became operational September 22. At that time, Senator Wyden remarked: “This project proves that we can create jobs and lift up the rural economy by generating clean, carbon-free, renewable energy while still allowing local ranchers to graze their herds on the surrounding land just as they have for generations. That’s why I fought so hard to make sure Shepherds Flat stayed on track, and why I’m proud to be standing here today.” It’s very curious that stories of failure like Solyndra receive much attention in the mainstream media, but success stories like Sheperd Flats apparently don’t rate as highly on their radar. American wind power capacity has doubled since 2008, but where is all the press about this important and beneficial trend?

It will consider projects from hydroelectric, solar, biogas, geothermal, and wind energy. Smaller projects must be at least 10 MW. They will also accept proposals for one very large project. The extra power created by the renewable energy developments is expected to be operational between 2013 and 2017. “This RFP will be an important step in meeting the state’s renewable power goals, and together with our separate RFP for baseload and capacity resources will help solidify our ability to continue providing reliable, affordable power to our customers for years to come,” said Jim Lobdell, PGE’s vice president. About 11% of the utility’s energy currently comes from renewables. It is required by 2015 to hit 15%, and 25% by 2025. If it expands by 100 MW by 2017, it will have far more than the entire state of Georgia has currently.
