Roger Wicker Comments 0 PHOTO Karen McMahon U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS) and David Vitter (R-LA) on Thursday, introduced legislation to block an increase in the amount of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline. The bill would overturn Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers that allowed gasoline containing 15% ethanol (E15) to be used for many passenger cars and light trucks. The higher blend of ethanol has been found to cause engine damage, reduce fuel efficiency and contribute to higher corn prices and rising food costs for American consumers. The Wicker-Vitter bill would prohibit the EPA administrator from granting any waiver for a blend above 10% ethanol and would repeal the previous waivers. “EPA’s flawed waivers allowing E15 amount to government bureaucrats issuing short-sighted regulations that negatively impact families and businesses across the country,” says Wicker, a member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. “The concerns surrounding E15 that existed prior to the waivers have increased instead of diminished.” “Whether you drive a car, truck, boat or tractor, misfueling with E15 could result in engine failure, increased emissions and the voiding of warranty coverage,” Vitter says. “It is irresponsible for EPA to allow E15 without sufficient testing and technical analysis. I support an all-inclusive energy strategy, but experimenting before understanding the consequences and potential cost of using E15 is unfair to consumers.” EPA issued two waivers to permit the use of E15. The first, in 2010, was for use in cars and light trucks model year 2007 or later. The second, in 2011, allowed E15 to be used in vehicles model year 2001 to 2006. In November 2012, AAA urged the Obama administration to halt the sale of E15 because of possible engine damage. AAA said it found in a survey a strong likelihood of consumer confusion and the potential for voided warranties and vehicle damage. nationalhogfarmerDOTcom/business/bill-blocks-increased-ethanol-blend-gasoline</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360994964537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:09:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360995166460-2</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Blocks Increased Ethanol Blend for Gasoline</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360994964537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:09:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ethanol industry pushes back against legislation to block E15 By Holly Jessen | February 15, 2013 On Feb. 14, U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and David Vitter, R-La., introduced legislation that would overturn U.S. EPA approval of E15 for model year 2001 and newer light duty vehicles. The ethanol industry jumped in the fray quickly, with the Renewable Fuels Association saying the oil industry is panicked, fighting to preserve its monopoly, tax credits and record-breaking profits. The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw called the bill a “big, wet kiss” for the oil industry, calling attention to the fact that the bill was introduced on Valentine’s Day. “Banning a legal product from competing with foreign oil is the ultimate in big government, nanny-state protectionism for the coddled petroleum industry,” he said. “I guess we should no longer be surprised by the lengths Big Oil will go to protect its federal petroleum mandate. E15 is a legal fuel for American motorists to choose, but Big Oil doesn’t want consumers to have that choice.” If approved, the bill would prohibit the EPA from approving gasoline that contains greater than 10 percent ethanol. Wicker called the E15 waivers flawed and shortsighted. Vitter mentioned the possibility of misfueling, which he said was a concern whether a consumer drives a car, truck, boat, or tractor. “It is irresponsible for EPA to allow E15 without sufficient testing and technical analysis,” he said. “I support an all-inclusive energy strategy, but experimenting before understanding the consequences and potential cost of using E15 is unfair to consumers.” Bob Dinneen, president and CEO of RFA, countered that E15 is the most tested fuel in history. E15’s benefits include reduced toxins and carcinogens in gasoline, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and savings at the gas pump for consumers. Although the Coordinating Research Council, a non-profit organization funded by automobile and oil companies, has come out with reports claiming E15 causes potential engine problems and fuel system components, the accuracy of those reports has been called into question. In fact, Patrick Davis, DOE Vehicle Technologies Program Manager, wrote a blog posted to the U.S. DOE website that called the results of the first report “significantly flawed.” The Fuels America coalition also condemned the anti-renewable fuel legislation, saying it would take away consumer choice in order to protect oil companies. “The legislation ignores the millions of miles and years of testing that went into the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of E15,” the group said in a prepared statement. “In fact, E15 is the most tested fuel ever, having been put through the paces enough times to make 12 round trips to the moon.” The group pointed out that Ford and General Motors have said their new vehicles are compatible with E15. NASCAR also uses E15. “Instead of protecting oil companies, Congress should address what is actually hurting America families and businesses: high gas prices and dependence on oil,” the group said. “Americans deserve a choice when it comes to how they power their cars and trucks, and we need the economic benefits that increasing our use of renewable fuel will continue to deliver.” ethanolproducerDOTcom/articles/9578/ethanol-industry-pushes-back-against-legislation-to-block-e15</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360995166460</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:12:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360995704551-3</Id><Title>O’Malley Makes Big Push For Wind Energy Legislation</Title><Msg>O’Malley Makes Big Push For Wind Energy Legislation 2/15/2013 | By News Editor, Shawn J. Soper ANNAPOLIS -- Governor Martin O’Malley this week made his first big push for the Maryland Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013, which, if approved, would create the framework for the development of an offshore wind farm as close as 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City. On Wednesday, O’Malley testified on behalf of this offshore wind energy bill in front of the Senate Finance Committee. In each of the last two General Assembly sessions, the governor’s offshore wind energy bill has passed the House before getting stalled in the Senate before the sessions expired. This year, with the support of Senate President Thomas V. “Mike” Miller, the latest attempt appears to be on the fast track. For example, the current legislation has 24 co-sponsors in the Senate, which would be more than enough to pass the bill with just 47 Senators in Maryland. First, however, the bill needs to pass out of the Senate Finance Committee and O’Malley got his first chance to testify on the legislation this week. “This legislation is important to our jobs future, to our energy future and, therefore, to our children’s future,” he said. During his testimony, O’Malley said the Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013 was as much about the potential job creation as it was about expanding the state’s renewable energy capabilities. “Offshore wind would support 850 jobs during the construction period and it would allow us to create 160 permanent, good, local jobs once the turbines start spinning,” he said. “And if we succeed in establishing Maryland as the regional manufacturing hub for wind turbines, we will create and sustain even more good jobs.” The governor told Finance Committee members the proposed legislation would allow Maryland to tap into an unrealized energy resource. “Wind is one of Maryland’s two most abundant natural resources,” he said. “The U.S. Department of Energy estimates we could be generating 10,000 megawatts off the coast of our state alone. That’s enough energy to power every home in Maryland. This bill would get the ball rolling with 200 megawatts.” O’Malley suggested there is some urgency to get the offshore wind bill passed this year. “We can create jobs by harnessing offshore wind, but we have to act,” he said. “Now is the best time, and with our proximity to both our nation’s capital and the mid-Atlantic coast gives us a unique competitive advantage, a unique opportunity to be a leader in the creation of new jobs and the development of renewable energy.” Opponents have pointed out the potential surcharge on monthly electric bills for Marylanders to subsidize the development of the offshore wind farm off the coast of Ocean City, which were projected at around $3 in some of the early attempts at passing the legislation. However, O’Malley told the committee on Wednesday that figure has been reduced to $1.50 per month and that it wouldn’t be implemented until the wind farm is up and running. “This bill has very specific consumer protections built in,” he said. “No consumer will pay even a penny more on their energy bill until the turbines start spinning. The most optimistic estimate projects this at four years away.” O’Malley pointed out the General Assembly has set aggressive goals to protect the environment, including the goal to increase in-state renewable energy generation by 20 percent by 2022. Thus far, the state has only increased its renewable energy portfolio by just under seven percent. In addition, the state has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent by 2020 and had only attained a 5-percent reduction thus far. “Climate change is real,” he said. “The severe weather we’ve seen in recent years is only going to become more severe until we develop more renewable supplies of energy. Every megawatt hour we generate here in Maryland is a megawatt hour we do not generate from imported fossil fuels. By advancing this offshore wind energy project, we have the opportunity to prevent as much as 7.5 million tons of climate-changing pollution from being pumped into our atmosphere just through the first phase of 200 megawatts.” Shortly after the governor addressed the Finance Committee, the bills detractors were already chiming in. For example, Change Maryland, a fiscal watchdog group, said this week the offshore wind proposal is a tax on energy disguised as something else. “It seems Martin O’Malley’s priority is to make electricity and gas more expensive,” said Change Maryland Chairman Larry Hogan this week. “He is pushing an increase in the gas tax and pushing a wind energy policy that is not cost effective and guarantees electricity will be more expensive for ratepayers. While there may be political support for offshore wind, 96 percent of Marylanders are opposed to higher taxes, and make no mistake, the governor’s offshore wind proposal is simply a tax by another name.” mdcoastdispatchDOTcom/articles/2013/02/15/Top-Stories/OMalley-Makes-Big-Push-For-Wind-Energy-Legislation</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360995704551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:21:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361012307840-4</Id><Topic><Title>How democrats govern</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1360983376137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 21:56:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>will they ever get the message or r they going to starve to death.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1361012307840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 05:58:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361012460169-5</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>leave commie POS everyone on this board hates u.

What’s the best way to harness that power? Float a wind turbine out there. 0 Comments All the energy we need is blowing in the wind. Off the coast of the United States, four times the generating capacity of today’s electric grid--about 4,223 GW--blows untapped across the Atlantic to the Pacific. Yet harnessing this source of energy has traditionally been prohibitively (and politically) expensive. Europe’s first offshore wind farms near Denmark in 1991 proved turbines could do it, but only at double or triple (or more) the cost of conventional energy. Another concept for a floating wind turbine is this concept from Malta. Now New England is now vying to become the home of cheap offshore wind power. If successful, they’ll lead the way into the country’s rich stocks of renewable offshore energy: strong and steady oceanic winds. Thousands of miles along the Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island coastline are already potential "Wind Energy Areas" targeted by the Department of Energy for siting, leasing, and construction of new wind farms (often in federal waters about 12 or more miles offshore). Massachusetts’ Cape Wind project is already underway, but Maine is leaping ahead by building first floating windfarms for deepwater. A $120 million pilot project won local and federal DOE backing this year to erect four 3-megawatt floating turbines in about 500-foot-deep water off the Maine coast. It will be the first time such turbines have been raised in U.S. waters. Norway’s Statoil will lead the project and expects power to start flowing within three years. A scaled-down model of an offshore wind turbine, the VolturnUS project, will also test alternative floating wind turbine technology in the Gulf of Maine in 2013. If all goes well, say its boosters, these pilots will lead to a deep-water wind-power industry worth thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in the U.S. The key is cost. While Statoil has proved the technology’s feasibility in Norway with the Hywind project, a 2.3-megawatt, $62 million turbine that has survived 50-foot waves and hurricane-force winds while generating power, it is expensive."The technology is proven," said Kristin Aamodt, Hywind’s project manager, in the Portland Press Herald. "We know it works. But we want now to cut costs." Statoil’s goal is about 10 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour in a commercial wind park within 10 years, which would make it competitive with today’s electricity prices. That’s possible, says Habib Dagher, an engineering professor at the University of Maine, who leads the public-private DeepCwind consortium pushing to make Maine the national leader in deepwater offshore wind power. But only if the new technologies achieve the scale needed to reduce costs, do not require extensive construction at sea, and receive government support typical of bringing new energy technologies online. Floating wind turbines, Dagher says, could realize this vision. "The purpose of our program is to do it quite a bit differently than Europe has done it," says Dagher. "The idea is to cut down the cost of wind." Everything will be assembled dockside, without heavy vessels to install towers, and turbines will be floated more than 20 miles out to sea, where wind blows much stronger, and then anchored. fastcoexistDOTcom/1681361/the-coast-of-maine-will-be-home-to-the-first-floating-wind-farm-in-america</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361018159002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 07:35:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361021090904-8</Id><Topic><Title>Methes Energies signs contract for biodiesel sale of 1.2M gallons</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360961055828</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 15:44:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eslinger Biodiesel awarded $6M from CEC to build plant in Fresno By Ron Kotrba | February 15, 2013 Eslinger Biodiesel Inc. is scheduled to receive $6 million from the California Energy Commission’s Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program to build a commercial biodiesel production facility in Fresno. According to the CEC, the first phase of the $32 million refinery is expected to be operating within a year of funding, producing 5 MMgy of biodiesel made from waste vegetable oils and animal fats. Eventual production is expected to be 45 MMgy. The output, according to the CEC, will be shipped by pipeline to commercial blending facilities and is slated to be presold to companies obligated to purchase carbon credit offsets. In addition to high-quality biodiesel, the plant will produce pharmaceutical- and technical-grade glycerin.

Taxes are not really paid by the person taxed. Rather their burden is allocated based on tax incidence which is a function of the price elasticity of demand and supply for the good or service in question. Rents, wages, and prices vary with taxes, shifting around the real burden, and demand for goods, services, and rentals varies as well based on what is done with the money collected in taxes. Put simply, the more assets you have, whether they be human capital or physical, the greater your elasticity of demand and supply is likely to be and the less likely you are to really be paying taxes. The ones who will have their living standards reduced by America’s poor policies are those closest to the bottom of the income distribution. This fact of economics could not be changed by anyone and is one of the reasons why capitalists have done so well in countries with increasing tax burdens over the years. Government spending creates opportunities for capitalists and it is almost impossible for the government to really tax them. If one day you become wealthy enough to move from country to country at will you are in an even more powerful position to deflect taxes. Middle class people with few assets and poor prospects in America probably will embark on plane one of these days just as happened in the last century but in the opposite direction on ships.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1361031030780</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 11:10:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361036782150-11</Id><Title>Macquarie says rooftop solar juggernaut is unstoppable</Title><Msg>Macquarie says rooftop solar juggernaut is unstoppable By Giles Parkinson on 12 February 2013 The fundamental transformation of energy markets brought about by the growing incursions of renewables such as wind and solar has been underlined in a new report by the European energy analysts at Macquarie Group, who have concluded that the plunge in costs for rooftop solar PV has fallen to such an extent that its continued rapid deployment may be unstoppable. In an analysis that broadly reflects the conclusion of UBS energy analysts about how rooftop solar PV is heralding an energy revolution, Macquarie notes that many existing fossil fuel generators in Germany are losing money and could go out of business. And even steep subsidy cuts to renewables would not reverse the trend. “Traditional wisdom suggests that steep subsidy cuts can bring the solar build-out under control again,” the Macquarie analysts note. “We disagree, though, as the ever-increasing prices for domestic and commercial customers as well as rapid solar cost declines have brought on the advent of grid parity for German roofs. Thus, solar installations could continue at a torrid pace.” Here are some key graphs to illustrate its point. Macquarie notes that wholesale prices in Germany have fallen 29 per cent over the last five years, while retail prices have risen 31 per cent – both movements at least partly due to the impact of renewables. But those movements pale in comparison with the dramatic fall in the cost of rooftop solar PV. (If the graph is partly hidden in your browser, please click it to see it in full). Macquarie says rooftop solar generation in Germany currently costs between €0.12kWh and €0.14/kWh (assuming 85 per cent debt financing and 4 per cent interest rate). These compare favourably with retail grid electricity prices of €0.28/kWh (even at just 50 per cent on-site self-consumption). But solar PV can even offer savings at industrial and commercial grid prices which are even lower at €0.11-0.17/kWh. “Consequently, solar installations could continue at a rapid pace even without subsidies,” Macquarie notes. “Ultimately, this would threaten the role of coal-fired generation as the price setter in wholesale power price formation.” Macquarie says that these effects seem self-reinforcing and hard to stop, unless there is a total power system overhaul. That, though, is unlikely. “We cannot see political will for such an overhaul. Quite to the contrary, German Environment Minister (Peter) Altmaier proposed in October 2012 to lift the country‟s 2020 renewable energy target to 40 per cent” (and its 2030 target to 80 per cent). Moreover, in an election year that is likely to see the Social Democrats elected, either in coalition with the Greens or a “grand coalition” with Chancellor Merkel’s party, the pace of renewables expansion is likely to increase. And as this story we published today tells us, support in Germany for its “energiewende” (transformation) program remains strong. (It would be interesting to see how this corresponds in Australia, because utilities here appear to be simply taking matters into their own hands, by changing tariff structures or refusing and delaying solar connections). As we highlighted nearly a year ago now, in our story of Why generators are terrified of solar, Macquarie has its own illustrations of what is happening to the energy market. It makes mention of key milestones on May 25, when solar contributed more than 20GW of capacity into the German grid for the first time – accounting for one-third of peak demand – and on September 14, when wind and solar combined to produce more than 31.5GW (solar 16.1GW plus wind 15.4GW) in the early afternoon. Macquarie’s examples compare typical days in May and in March – the changes to the price curve are even more dramatic than that highlighted by the Melbourne Energy Institute’s Mike Sandiford in the case of South Australia last week. The loss of the curve represents a loss in revenue. Here is the example from May … And here is the example for March …. Again, the gap between the black and red lines represents lost revenue for generators. And while the proliferation of renewables is proving to be a painful experience for utilities, it is forcing the energy industry to challenge their traditional baseload/peakload approach to energy supply. The alternative is now viewed – even by the major generator companies – as non-flexible and flexible generation, with the dispatchable energy produced by gas plants, or at a later date storage technologies, filling in the gaps between renewables. Germany is also reportedly about to announce a new tariff to encourage battery storage deployment for solar PV. Still, the transition period promises to be problematic. Macquarie does highlight some perverse impacts of this situation – the fact that cleaner gas-fired fuel is being priced out of the market, while lignite – what we know in Australia as brown coal – survives, and that ageing gas-fired generators are not being replaced by state-of-the-art modern plants. However, it notes this has as much to do with the plunging carbon price in Europe, which has effectively removed the pollution price signal on dirtier fuels in the energy market, as well as the high cost of gas – most of which has to be imported from Russia. It notes that the current cost of new-build gas is nearly 50 per cent above average wholesale prices, and recently announced demand management initiatives, such as load shedding, are removing another major part of the market. That load shedding will result in up to 1,500MW of demand to be switched off in a matter of seconds, and up to 3,000MW within 15 minutes, (Australia faces a potentially similar issue because, while it has a carbon price – at least for the moment, the main brown coal generators have been largely insulated from this by the generous compensation package, and the emergency funds provided by the government. And Australia also faces increasing gas prices). Macquarie goes as far as to say that the German energy market is “kaput”. “Without radical overhaul, we conclude the German power system is structurally broken,” they say. The analysts note that in the normal course of events, up to 20GW of conventional capacity would be shut down, but authorities would likely prevent 10GW to retain structural integrity to the market. Still, despite the closure of nuclear facilities, Macquarie estimates that production from thermal generators (gas and coal) would likely fall by 40TWh by the end of the decade – a reduction of 10 per cent in current output – as solar (18GW) and wind (9GW) continued their capacity additions. German authorities are currently trying to get their head around a new design for the market, that rewards not just renewables but provides the right incentive to retain the capacity that is required to usher in that transition. One radical proposal came from the former Head of the Federal Network Agency, who proposed to temporarily shut off, without recompense, renewable energy sources during times of excessive peak production. But Macquarie said it was difficult to imagine how this would work, as it would be difficult to decide exactly at which times the market is excessively supplied. “Moreover, it would require retroactively changing the subsidies for renewable energy plants, which would presumably not just lead to lawsuits against the German government in international courts, but also weaken general investment confidence into Germany.” reneweconomyDOTcomDOTau/2013/macquarie-says-rooftop-solar-juggernaut-is-unstoppable-40618</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361036782150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 12:46:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361039548808-12</Id><Topic><Title>Macquarie says rooftop solar juggernaut is unstoppable</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361036782150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 12:46:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Germany uses only half the electricity and oil, and only 44% of the natural gas as the U.S. does per person, and with a substantially higher share of industrial output, and far greater wealth per person.
