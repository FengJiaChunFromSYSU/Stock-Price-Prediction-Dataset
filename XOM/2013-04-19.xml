I think Pier Luigi's Bersani, the leader of Italy's center-left coalition, summed it up best: "only an insane person would want to govern Italy now." I know what Germany's response will be if they produce this or that irrational result. The French tend to be very rational people, especially when it placed between the demands of their voters who are not interested in paying welfare to Italians, and Germany's unmovable position on rationality. If the result is irrational the result be to punish the irrational party until it decides to become rational.

They fail to understand the real reason why what happened in 1929 happened to begin with, and why there was a Great Depression. The reason is simple: Germany's and France's financial system were ruined by the proceeding World War and could no longer export capital, and indeed both became capital sinks, relying on New York to finance their own investments and third world investments they had been financing. Russia was lost to the Bolsheviks, something the United States caused by its intervention in the war and breaking of Germany's power. Having broken the German army the US refused to use its own army to crush the Bolsheviks, withdrawing the force it sent to Russia at the first hind of a confrontation, and leaving the place to the Communists. The subsequent total ruination of Russia's economy and its conversion into a bigger version of the North Korean "hermit kingdom" destabilized the world economy further. Also, the breaking up of Austro-Hungary and converting it into nonsensical pieces favored by American academics threw Eastern Europe and Viennese investments into chaos. So Europe faced many unresolved problems in 1929, none of which had anything to do with the interest rate and Federal Reserve policy in New York. It is unlikely anything the Federal Reserve could possibly have done in 1929 could have prevented what occurred. All the American imbeciles who spout their neo-Keynsesian and Monetarist tripe could have been transported back and in time to those days and they would have been able to change nothing. Their polices do nothing (useful) to impact the economy, and the sooner they realize this the better. What makes the economy grow is technology, capital, and labor, not monetary policy and demand management.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366375696673</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:48:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366377030072-5</Id><Title>Boston is NIGHTMARE scenario for Obummer and his minions....</Title><Msg>FYI</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1366377030072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 09:10:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366377303701-6</Id><Title>Colorado Looks To Raise Renewable Energy Standard To 25 Percent For Rural Electric Co-Ops</Title><Msg>Matt Kasper, Guest Blogger on Apr 15, 2013 at 6:32 pm Adoption of renewable energy standards — which require electric utility companies to produce a portion of their electricity from wind, solar, and other renewable sources — has considerably driven clean energy advances in recent years. Some 29 states and the District of Columbia have adopted hard targets for renewable energy production with another eight states setting renewable energy goals. Standards place an obligation on electricity-supply companies to reach set targets, while renewable energy goals are voluntary for companies — although states might incentivize a utility for reaching a set goal. Collectively, state renewable energy standards have supported the development of more than 33,000 megawatts of new renewable power through 2011 and by 2025 will provide 10 percent of the nation’s current electric generation capacity. But legislators in at least 14 states have introduced bills that would water down or repeal the mandates. So far only Montana is on the verge of wiping out the renewable energy standard entirely by including existing hydropower facilities. SB 31 has passed both chambers and is awaiting Governor Steve Bullock’s decision. Organizations like the Heartland Institute and the American Legislative Council, or ALEC, and Koch-backed Grover Norquist have been lobbying against renewable energy policies, and pushing “model legislation” to undo these standards. The good news is that the Colorado Senate has bucked the trend and will soon pass SB 252 — sponsored by state Senate President John Morse. The Senate still must have a third and final vote on the bill. SB 252 will raise the state’s renewable energy standard to 25 percent for rural electric cooperatives by 2020 — an increase from 10 percent. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/04/15/1844361/colorado-looks-to-raise-renewable-energy-standard-to-25-percent-for-rural-electric-co-ops/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366377303701</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 09:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366377665488-7</Id><Title>China Reclaims Top Spot Over US In Clean Energy Sector</Title><Msg>April 19, 2013 Joshua S Hill Movement within the clean energy sector during 2012 has been put under the microscope by The Pew Charitable Trusts in their fourth-annual Who’s Winning the Clean Energy Race? report. Released on Wednesday, the report states that a total of 88 gigawatts (GW) of additional generating capacity was installed during 2012, despite an 11% decline in investment levels from the year previously. Who’s Winning the Clean Energy Race? 2012 Edition cover “Clean energy trends demonstrate the ongoing resilience of this emerging sector in the global economy,” said Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew’s clean energy program. “For the third straight year, investment reached more than $200 billion, and 2012 ended with five times that of 2004. Every year, new markets open up and more renewable power is deployed around the world. Even though government policies have been uneven and unpredictable in certain markets, the economic, environmental, and security benefits of clean technologies are driving the sector forward. Countries that prioritize policy are positioning themselves for increased private investment, as well as manufacturing and job-creation opportunities.” “We have seen a trend where in almost every year investment has expanded and this is one of the first years we’ve seen it contract,” Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew’s clean energy programme, said. ”Part of the contraction is due to policy in the US and EU nations that have pulled back on their feed in tariffs, or made them less generous. There’s certainly been a contraction in investment. “A decline in investment is certainly a bad trend that we hope will turn around. The thing that is hopeful, is that we have seen prices dropping more installations for less money. So that’s a good trend. “China has done everything right by putting long-term consistent policies in place, goals for cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/04/19/china-reclaims-top-spot-over-us-in-clean-energy-sector/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366377665488</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 09:21:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366384489503-8</Id><Title>Russia/Chechnya</Title><Msg>It is fortunate that you have a Russian Nationalist in charge in Moscow.

The rules would require power plants to install pollution control technology and implement waste-treatment procedures in a phased approach between 2017 and 2022. The department said fewer than half of the 500 coal-fired power plants affected by the rules would incur costs. “Reducing the pollution of our waters through effective but flexible controls such as we are proposing today is a win-win for our public health and our economic vitality. We look forward to hearing from all stakeholders on the best way forward,” EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe said in a Friday statement. The proposed rules will go through a 60-day public comment period. The EPA must finalize the rules by May 22, 2014. The measures will likely attract challenges from industry and Republicans who have opposed regulations affecting coal-fired power plants issued through the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. The EPA said the proposed rules, which it issued through the Clean Water Act, would reduce pollutants such as mercury, arsenic, lead and selenium that enter waterways through coal ash and other waste from steam electric power plants. The agency said those pollutants have been linked to neurological and circulatory damage, as well as cancer and kidney and liver problems. The American Public Health Association applauded the department's move. “Toxic heavy metals have no place in our drinking water or on our dinner plate,” Georges Benjamin, the group’s executive director, said in a Friday statement. The EPA estimated the rules would slash pollutant discharges by 470 million to 2.62 billion pounds annually. It also projected the measures would save 50 billion to.. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/295095-epa-proposes-water-pollution-rules-affecting-power-plants</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366417641117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 20:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366417994838-18</Id><Title>Obama proposes new rules to clean up gas and reduce car emissions</Title><Msg>Obama proposes new rules to clean up gas and reduce car emissions EPA's new standards for gasoline sulfur would drastically reduce smog from car exhaust and bring US in line with other countries Suzanne Goldenberg, US environment correspondent guardian uk, Friday 29 March 2013 16.27 GMT guardianDOTcoDOTuk/environment/2013/mar/29/obama-epa-rules-gasoline-car-emissions</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366417994838</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 20:33:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
