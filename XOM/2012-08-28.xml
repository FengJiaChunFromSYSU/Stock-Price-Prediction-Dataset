Like Rome, it is military powerful, but it is buying its power with borrowed money, much as Rome borrowed its power from its enemies. The coming election is not going to be enough to reverse the trend, even if Romney wins. Unless he is able to gain a majority as big as Obama had in 2009 he will not be able to push through policies to reverse the decay. That outcome is nearly impossible. The Tea Party agenda personified by Ryan is just fantasy. There is no enough spending outside entitlements and the military to cut. The entitlements are not going away and they will result in a massive increase in federal debt and federal taxation to service it for the next five decades. The higher taxation will grind the living standard of the middle class, lower class, and small businesses into dust. Small business will effectively be dead in America, except for ones small enough to evade the tyranny of the government. Big business will control what remains of the rotting economy and pass its tax bills into lower wages, or leave the country entirely and import products into America to escape American taxes altogether. The left-wing environmental fascist agenda is well entrenched and its power will not be broken in November. It is finishing off the de-industrialization and destruction of Europe as we speak. All they have left now rigged bond markets, and government pensions exchanging stocks back and forth at elevated prices, much like boiler room. They lie to the public to cover up what they have done, but they will not be able to cover up the consequences. Europe is finished. America's economy is even more reliant on energy than Europe, particularly oil, and it will not survive a prolonged assault by the environmental fascists... The Western world is converging to the third world's level. The price levels will converge. Huge deflation will be the first phase. The livings standards will converge. The level of income inequality will converge...</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346163681000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346164401000-34</Id><Title>Wtf is happening ??</Title><Msg>http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/08/28/gas-line-explodes-near-highway-in-mckinney/</Msg><Username>joelooope</Username><Timestamp>1346164401000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:33:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346165799000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Growth Is Unsustainable</Title><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1346030932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Despite the continued whirring of the world economy, most people here and elsewhere are not getting anywhere and are feeling jilted by the system they’ve depended on for decades because they thought it could be sustained forever.

I don't think so. Profiting from these trends, as opposed to being a victim of them, puts you in good position. I'm comfortable enough, and no matter how bad things get for the rest I will be comfortable going forward. The decline of the West has been steady and relentless since the former communist Eastern Bloc bottomed after the Rubble in collapse in. '98. Much more besides 5 million b/d of oil got freed up by that collapse. The Soviet Union was easily the biggest commodity producer in the world, and its collapsed flooded the world with cheap commodities of all sorts. One pump job after the other from the Central bankers, and Fannies, Freddies, and fund pumpers has not been able to stop the decay that set in when that tailwind went away. You have a headwind now from China to compound the problem, and an entitlement one as well, plus the asinine environmental agenda. If you think a Republican in the Oval Office will make any difference to that you are dreaming. It will take super majorities in Congress to even make a dent on the problem, and even then it may well be impossible.

But let's assume the claim is true. Does it matter? Last numbers I say (from people highly incentivized to be in the know) were about 1.3MM BPD production (i.e. crude) were shut in. And there were also a little over 1.1 MMBPD of refinery run cuts. So IF the crude supply/demand was balanced 'last week', it should still be close this week. SPR bbls are not needed to meet refinery demand. I happen to be at a GC refinery (not one s/d or slowing down). I can say with certainty, we are not having crude supply issues. There are times we can't get as much of a certain type of crude as we would like, but this is not forcing run cuts nor production cuts. Even with over 1MM in crude run cuts, US refining (and inventories) are more than adequate to meet demand. Opening SPR MIGHT lower our crude costs. But it is not likely to lower prices for products. Product prices are not (currently) driven by crude avails OR refinery capacity, not even now. It is US and world demands that are setting prices. The neeed bbls are available and will 'be there' when and were needed. As to your comments about the convention, what are you going to say if a storm is hitting Houston or DC or NYC or elsewhere during teh Dem convention? Do you think they would cancel theirs? And even if RNC or DNC were inclined t cancel their conventino, what would it change? Fact is N.O., et al are having a rough night. Others will have it tomorrow. But for the vast majority of the country, there is nothing they could do to change or help this. Who cares what someone from ABC is doing in Tampa? Is it making things worse for those in N.O. tonight?</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1346211987000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346211994000-98</Id><Topic><Title>"Bain Capital"</Title><Username>notarethug</Username><Timestamp>1346210238000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:17:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why doesn't he answer questions about his underwear?</Msg><Username>half_miles_davis</Username><Timestamp>1346211994000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:46:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346212521000-99</Id><Topic><Title>Thurston Howell, III, and his wife, Lovey</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346207545000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 22:32:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wahleee boy's life is all about being jealous of everyone else.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1346212521000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:55:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
