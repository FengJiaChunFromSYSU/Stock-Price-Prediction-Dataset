Feinstein: Please do something more productive for your excessive pay and benefits. For example, try to pass a bill that will eventually outlaw all wars. War has made a Hell of Earth, and it's the G6 countries that arm the rest of the planet. Try to stimulate the manufacture of efficient solar cells that can be put on the roofs of all hybrid and electric cars and trucks - free power. totally clean. Thank you.</Msg><Username>gyrogearcrunch</Username><Timestamp>1371791981376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 01:19:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371820057220-2</Id><Title>Boehner thinks new White House climate rules would be “crazy.” But Obama may not have a choice.</Title><Msg>Boehner thinks new White House climate rules would be “crazy.” But Obama may not have a choice. By Juliet Eilperin, Published: June 20, 2013 at 2:10 pm In a question-and-answer session with reporters Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) ridiculed the idea that President Obama is likely to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. “I think this is absolutely crazy,” Bohener said.. “Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking the question, where are the jobs?” But data released late last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggests Obama will have little choice if he’s serious about curbing the nation’s carbon output. While carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants fell 13.1 percent between 2005 and 2012, it rose 7.1 percent the first quarter of this year. Overall, energy-related carbon emissions in the United States rose 3 percent in the first quarter of 2013, compared to a 4 percent drop in 2012. What accounts for the change? Paul Bledsoe, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Clinton White House climate aide, noted that natural gas prices have jumped 70 percent in the last year, prompting some utilities to burn coal again instead of cleaner natural gas. “The latest data indicate that the decline in U.S. carbon emissions of the last several years will not continue without regulation of both new and existing power plants,” Bledsoe said Contrary to some published reports, the president hasn’t signed off on regulating existing power plants — he and his aides are still weighing the decision. But there is little doubt that when Obama unveils his climate agenda — most likely next month, rather than next week — a proposal to curb carbon emissions from existing utilities will occupy a central place in his plan. washingtonpost</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371820057220</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371822504482-3</Id><Title>Tesla demonstrated 90 second battery swap</Title><Msg>Will be rolling it out to all supercharging stations. Faster and cheaper than filling a gas tank. 300 mile charge, 90 seconds. This also nullifies the fear of battery replacement. I speculate that Tesla will be unveiling some kind of battery swap subscription or small per charge fee. Either way, the battery swap nullifies the "But you have to replace the battery for however many $k after however many years" argument against electric. Gasoline will be obsolete in 5-10 years - or at least its price will have to come way down. Even if charging at home, it is $4-5 to charge up a 300 mile "tank" on electricity.</Msg><Username>gnostocks</Username><Timestamp>1371822504482</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:48:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371823336744-4</Id><Topic><Title>TSLA is THE strongest momentum stock on the market</Title><Username>momentum_train</Username><Timestamp>1370355813302</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 10:23:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Super momentum train TSLA went up more than 7% since I recommended it here 2 weeks ago.

It appears the plan is to have them at all Tesla stations. They recently raised $750 million and plan to build out their charging network with 100s of stations across the country. There should be quite a few installed by the end of the year. It looks like the real key will be how they ramp up. Their cars are still very expensive, but supposedly in 3-5 years they will be mass producing a $30k car designed to compete with Audi A4 and BMW 3 series. They have also partnered with Mercedes Benz to supply the power train for the new MB electrics, which presumably will be compatible with this technology. If they make more deals like this, it could be widespread more quickly. Also interesting to note is that as battery tech improves, they can probably utilize these stations to roll out the better batteries. Makes it a lot simpler logistically than effectively having to go through the same process as a recall.</Msg><Username>gnostocks</Username><Timestamp>1371833253723</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 12:47:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371838191269-9</Id><Title>IEA: Renewable energy making global gains, but so is coal</Title><Msg>IEA: Renewable energy making global gains, but so is coal Posted on June 21, 2013 at 11:34 am by Simone Sebastian Renewable energy grew at an extraordinary pace worldwide in 2012, with global solar power capacity up 42 percent and sales of hybrid electric vehicles surpassing more than 1 million for the first time in history. But the International Energy Agency said the increase in renewables isn’t enough to curb the march of climate change, because coal has continued to dominate growth in power generation around the world, led by China and India. Coal-fired power generation increased 45 percent from 2000 to 2010, far outpacing the 25 percent growth in non-fossil fuel energy. From 2010 to 2012, coal-fired power generation grew 6 percent, according to the IEA. China consumed nearly half of the world’s coal demand and India used nearly 11 percent. Growing coal exports from the United States are feeding some of that rising demand and lowering the price of coal on the global market. The rise of low-cost natural gas from shale has shifted some power generation in the United States from coal to gas, leading U.S. miners to ship their excess coal overseas. That low-priced coal helped fuel 65 percent growth in coal-based power generation in Spain and 35 percent growth in the United Kingdom, the IEA noted. “This is the fundamental threat to a lower carbon future,” said Justine Garrett of the International Energy Agency’s Carbon Capture and Storage Unit in a Thursday phone conference about the report. “Dependence on coal for economic growth is particularly strong for emerging economies, like China and India, but it’s also growing in Europe.” Renewable power generation also grew rapidly, but continues to exist at minuscule capacities compared to fossil fuels. Solar photovoltaic capacity grew by 42 percent worldwide and wind power capacity expanded by 19 percent.
