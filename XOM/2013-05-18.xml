Dlouhy The Energy Department on Friday gave Freeport LNG conditional approval to broadly export domestically harvested natural gas, marking only the second time a U.S. company has won that authority and suggesting the Obama administration may grant similar licenses later this year. The export license allows the Texas-based project to sell liquefied natural gas to Japan and other countries that do not have free-trade agreements with the United States. The company still must win approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to convert its existing Quintana Island, Texas import terminal into a facility capable of liquefying natural gas and shipping it overseas. And the Energy Department reserved the right to review Freeport’s application again before issuing a final export license. The move is the first of its kind since the Energy Department granted a similar export license to Cheniere Energy in April 2012, giving that Houston-based company the right to export as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day for the next two decades. The Energy Department had put other export applications on hold while it considered the economic effects of more broadly selling domestic natural gas overseas. Benjamin Salisbury, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, called the Energy Department’s move “a crucially important stepping stone,” because it clarifies the way the Obama administration will review the remaining 19 applications and puts the U.S. on track for additional approvals. A federal law dictates that the Energy Department must affirm proposed exports are in the public interest before granting licenses to sell the fossil fuel to countries that don’t have free-trade agreements with the United States — a fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/17/feds-give-texas-project-license-to-broadly-export-lng/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368851123838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 00:25:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368851350985-2</Id><Title>Feds’ fracturing rule signifies Obama’s approach to natural gas</Title><Msg>May 17, 2013 at 11:21 am by Jennifer A. Dlouhy You wouldn’t know it from the oil industry’s angry reaction, but the Obama administration’s latest plan to tighten standards for drilling on public lands gives more ground to the private sector at the expense of environmentalists who pushed for tougher protections. The initiative, unveiled by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management on Thursday, aims to boost the integrity of oil and gas wells to prevent contamination, would force companies to disclose the chemicals they pump underground and would make drillers adopt plans for managing water at the sites. Building off a proposal released last May — and later withdrawn — regulators rewrote the entire measure in response to nearly 200,000 public comments and make a number of big concessions to the oil industry in the process. For instance, the new rule would apply narrowly to hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, rather than broadly to all well stimulation activities. The proposal would let oil and gas companies reveal the chemicals they use at wells on public land — and withhold some details as trade secrets — using the industry’s preferred disclosure system, FracFocus. And federal officials could effectively exempt whole states or tribal territories from the mandates. Plus, according to the government’s analysis, the price tag of the proposed requirements would be less than $20 million annually industry-wide — or about $6,000 extra per well, a figure that analysts at FBR Capital Markets noted represents less than half of a percent of the cost of a typical well. While some provisions go the other way and tighten requirements for industry further than the proposal released a year ago, on most major, high-profile issues, the administration moved in the direction of oil and gas companies’ demands.

Moniz was nominated by President Obama in March as a replacement for Steven Chu, who announced his resignation Feb. 1. Moniz is the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems, Director of the Energy Initiative, and Director of the Laboratory for Energy and the Environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Physics, serving on the faculty for 40 years. He served as undersecretary of the U.S. DOE from 1997 until January 2001 and, from 1995-‘97, as associate director for science in the Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Bill Clinton. At MIT, Moniz served as head of the physics department and as director of the Bates Linear Accelerator Center. His major research contributions have been in theoretical nuclear physics, energy technology and policy studies. He has also been serving on Obama’s Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. “Throughout his career, Ernest Moniz has supported efforts to move beyond fossil fuels to a cleaner, more secure energy future in which renewable sources play a prominent role,” said Anne Steckel, vice president of federal affairs for the National Biodiesel Board. “He knows that advanced biofuels like biodiesel are critical to our long-term energy and environmental security, and he has supported practical policies aimed at developing renewables in order to reduce our dependence on petroleum, create jobs and reduce harmful emissions. He is also an internationally recognized expert on renewable technology who truly understands the challenges and opportunities facing the industry. As a result, we believe he will be an excellent leader at the energy department and look forward to working with him.” In addition to being welcomed by NBB to his new biodieselmagazineDOTcom/articles/9115/us-senate-confirms-moniz-as-nations-new-energy-secretary</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368854953546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 01:29:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368855876903-5</Id><Title>Harry Reid Focuses On July For The 'Nuclear Option'</Title><Msg>Harry Reid Focuses On July For The 'Nuclear Option' The Huffington Post | By Gabrielle Dunkley Posted: 05/17/2013 2:33 pm EDT | Updated: 05/17/2013 4:31 pm EDT Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has told top advisers that he is prepared to take action if Senate Republicans block three upcoming nominations, the Washington Post reported on Friday. Reid is reportedly focusing on the month of July to approach filibuster reform and possibly execute the "nuclear option," which would change the Senate rules and no longer require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. “This would take away the right to filibuster on nominations,” a senior Senate Democratic aide told the Washington Post. “All executive branch and judicial nominations would be subject to majority votes. He would not do it on legislative items.” A Senate Democratic aide confirmed the Post report to HuffPost and said that Reid met recently with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a leader of the push to reform the filibuster, to lay out his thinking going forward. Reid has consistently said publicly that he reserves the right to change Senate rules if he considers the GOP to be abusing the ones left in place by the bipartisan agreement in January. Reid warned in April that he would enact the "nuclear option" if President Barack Obama's judicial nominations are kept from moving forward. “All within the sound of my voice, including my Democratic senators and the Republican senators who I serve with, should understand that we as a body have the power on any given day to change the rules with a simple majority, and I will do that if necessary," Reid said. huffingtonpostDOTcom/2013/05/17/harry-reid-nuclear-option_n_3293865.html?utm_hp_ref=politics</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368855876903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 01:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368875453802-6</Id><Topic><Title>See oil prices plunging too much supply</Title><Username>kopach</Username><Timestamp>1368801019581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:30:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oil is going up stupid.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1368875453802</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 07:10:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368877494403-7</Id><Topic><Title>Sulfate aerosols cool climate less than assumed</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368796365079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like Adolf again.

The council, which operates the power grid for most of the state, reported that energy from renewable fuel sources reached 33.9 million megawatt-hours, up 7 percent from 2011. The vast majority of that — more than 32.5 million megawatt-hours — came from wind power. Solar power had the largest rate of growth, jumping from just 36,580 megawatt-hours in 2011 to 133,642 megawatt-hours in 2012. One megawatt-hour is roughly the amount of power consumed by an average home in a month, according to the council, which is also responsible for managing the state’s electric market to ensure power is available when it is needed. Other types of renewable energy included in the tally include hydropower, biomass and landfill gas. Each generates more power than solar but is dwarfed by wind power in the state. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/17/renewable-power-generation-grew-7-percent-in-texas-last-year/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368882919176</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:15:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368889560126-11</Id><Title>Board Paid politican</Title><Msg>Bluecheese4u- Must work for the dnc or BO.</Msg><Username>willstand99</Username><Timestamp>1368889560126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368929011399-12</Id><Title>Obama Tweets Study Of 97% Scientific Consensus On Manmade Warming, WashPost Confused On What That Means</Title><Msg>Obama Tweets Study Of 97% Scientific Consensus On Manmade Warming, WashPost Confused On What That Means By Joe Romm on May 18, 2013 at 10:51 am The story seems simple enough. First, on Wednesday a study came out that found 97% consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. It was by our friends at Skeptical Science, John Cook and Dana Nuccitelli. Then on Thursday, President Obama tweeted the study to his 31,000,000 (!) followers: So how does the ever-shrinking Washington Post report the story? With the headline, “Obama tweet gets Australian researcher 31.5 million followers on Twitter.” #FAIL And just to be clear that the WashPost is in fact as confused and innumerate as their headline suggests, the story asserts: That tweet, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, led 31,541,507 people to decide to follow Australian climate change researcher John Cook on Twitter. The Herald didn’t, however, make such a transparently silly claim. Their headline read, “Obama gives Aussie researcher 31,541,507 reasons to celebrate.” Ten seconds on the interwebs will reveal that Cook has 6,560 followers. But then we’ve suspected for a while that the Washington Post doesn’t employ any fact checkers. Nor does it have a single editor who understood enough about social media to realize instantly that the headline — and hence the story — must be wrong. No wonder the MSM is collapsing in the face of the new media onslaught. Note: As of Saturday morning, the story is still uncorrected. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/05/18/2027671/obama-tweets-study-of-97-scientific-consensus-on-manmade-warming-washpost-confused-on-what-that-means/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368929011399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 22:03:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368929042442-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Tweets Study Of 97% Scientific Consensus On Manmade Warming, WashPost Confused On What That Means</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368929011399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 22:03:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>skepticalscienceDOTcom/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368929042442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 22:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368933923930-14</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Tweets Study Of 97% Scientific Consensus On Manmade Warming, WashPost Confused On What That Means</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368929011399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 22:03:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blew cheese must work for a VERY Liberal Organ.
