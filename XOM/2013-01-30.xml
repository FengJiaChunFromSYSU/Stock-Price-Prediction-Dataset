The first phase, named Alamo I, is expected to be completed by the middle of 2013. It will feature 41 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity. The project was announced last July after OCI Solar Power struck a 25-year power purchase deal with CPS Energy. Once completed, the project will be “one of the largest municipal utility solar projects in the US and will create more than 800 jobs. As part of its plan, OCI Solar Power will develop several solar facilities that will power more than 70,000 homes. Plans for the remaining megawatts will be built through 2016. German inverter manufacturer KACO will supply its XP series inverters for installation at the project.” As we’ve reported before, Texas has enormous solar energy potential. The sunshine that falls on Texas in ONE month contains more energy than all of the oil that has ever been pumped in the state. It’s good to see solar energy deployment moving forward there, as the state could very easily obtain all of its electricity that way. sDOTtt/1z8Gb</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359557809278</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:56:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359558880358-11</Id><Title>Ruling considered a minor shot to cellulosic fuels</Title><Msg>Ruling considered a minor shot to cellulosic fuels Analyst: Investment unlikely to be deterred Jan 30, 2013 | 0Comments Written by Christopher Doering WASHINGTON — As the EPA gets ready to determine how much cellulosic fuel should be blended into the nation’s fuel supply this year, renewable fuel watchers say a federal court ruling is unlikely to curtail investment in the nascent industry. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided in favor of the American Petroleum Institute last week when it ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s process for estimating cellulosic biofuel output “did not take neutral aim at accuracy” and “was an unreasonable exercise of agency discretion.” The court’s ruling, in effect, said the EPA’s overly aggressive estimate was set with the goal of promoting the growth of cellulosic fuel to spur investment rather than making an accurate prediction of how much could be produced. Cellulosic ethanol, made with crop residue, grasses or wood chips, has advanced more slowly than what was envisioned in the 2007 Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) enacted by Congress. The EPA has acknowledged that cellulosic output targets in recent years have not met because of insufficient domestic production. No EPA mandate yet Last year alone, the EPA said 8.7 million gallons of the advanced fuel must be blended into gasoline. Last year the ethanol industry produced a fraction of that total, about 20,000 gallons. The EPA has yet to issue its 2013 mandate for cellulosic production. “We agree with API that EPA’s 2012 projection of cellulosic biofuel production was in excess of the agency’s statutory authority,” the three-judge panel said. “We accordingly vacate that aspect of the 2012 RFS rule and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.” Lisa Elliott, an assistant professor of economics at South Dakota State University, said the court’s ruling is unlikely to hurt the cellulosic industry. “The ruling was really that (the EPA) could go in and make their projections to where they want the mandate to be on that but they needed to back up their numbers,” Elliott said. “It doesn’t seem like that it would” deter investment in this young industry, she said. One concern is that if the EPA significantly cuts its cellulosic production totals there would be less of an incentive to invest to meet that goal, and renewable fuels could suffer. Completing plants With cellulosic plants in the late stages of development or under construction in more than 20 states and other countries, there are signs the industry is poised for a surge in momentum. DuPont Industrial Biosciences is building a 30-million-gallon-capacity refinery in Nevada, Iowa. A second cellulosic plant, a joint venture of Sioux Falls-based ethanol producer Poet and Dutch-based DSM Advanced Biofuels, is under construction adjacent to Poet’s corn-fed ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa. “Aggressive targets have spurred investment to get cellulosic biofuels to commercial scale, and with a number of plants now being built across the U.S., including POET-DSM’s plant in Iowa, the fuel standard has clearly been a success. We will need the RFS to drive this success further,” said Larry Ward, a co-director with POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels. “I’m confident that the oil industry will have plenty of cellulosic gallons to blend in the coming years,” Ward said. Victory for oil, gas Still, the ruling was a victory for the API, the organization that represents major oil and gas producers such as energy giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. The group has pushed Congress to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard, a requirement they have called unworkable and ill-conceived. “This absurd mandate acts as a stealth tax on gasoline with no environmental benefit that could have ultimately burdened consumers,” said Bob Greco, API’s downstream director. “This decision relieves refiners of complying with the unachievable 2012 mandate and forces EPA to adopt a more realistic approach for setting future cellulosic biofuel mandates.” The court ordered the EPA to re-evaluate the 2012 cellulosic standards and have a more realistic mandate in future years. Since no cellulosic was commercially produced in 2012, API contends the mandate for 2012 should be set at zero. For 2013 and beyond, API has asked that EPA base projections on at least two months of actual production, rather than “wishful thinking.” Earlier this month, supporters of advanced biofuels said cellulosic ethanol is on the verge of coming into its own after a slow start. The groups said that — after years of significant investment and advances in technology to overcome hurdles that have stymied development — there is finally visible progress. As more projects come on line, they said it will spur additional investments in the technology. In a statement, a group of biofuel groups including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, said they are “reviewing the court’s decision and assessing next steps in the matter.” “The biofuels organizations strongly disagree with the court’s characterization of what EPA did — EPA did not determine a reasonably achievable volume and then inflate it,” the groups said in a statement. “Rather, it set the volume based on the best information available to it at the time.” Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, downplayed the effect of the ruling. “It really doesn’t change things because all the EPA has to do is clarify when they roll out the next number and justify ... they will have to say here is our 2013 number and this is the number that we think will be produced, period. There is no fluff. There is no bonus. There is no added gallons because we want the industry to grow. “That’s what the EPA did in 2012, but the court disagreed,” Shaw said. argusleaderDOTcom/article/20130130/NEWS/301300038</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359558880358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:14:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359559612384-12</Id><Title>Nation's wind farms heading offshore</Title><Msg>Nation's wind farms heading offshore Updated: 2013-01-29 07:52 By Wang Qian and Jiang Xueqing (China Daily) The fans at the 150-megawatt offshore wind power farm in Rudong county, Jiangsu province. China Longyuan Power Group completed the farm and put it into production in November. Xu Congjun / for China Daily Project off coastal Jiangsu marks start of a new era China's wind farms are moving offshore, with the largest project going into commercial use in coastal Jiangsu province. The 150-megawatt farm opened off Rudong county in November and will supply up to 190,000 residents with renewable energy a year, according to the China Longyuan Power Group, which runs the farm. "It marks the country's entry into the new era of developing large, offshore wind-energy projects," said Zhou Qinsheng, a climate and energy expert with Greenpeace. A Greenpeace report last year said wind energy in southeastern China can generate 500 gigawatts of power, about twice the country's hydropower consumption in 2012 of about 249 gW, according to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission. Compared with onshore wind farms, offshore facilities are competitive in terms of wind resources, land and ecology, Zhou said. China's offshore wind power generating capacity is expected to reach 5 gW by 2015 and 30 gW by 2020, according to the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) on wind power. "It is a huge market. China is a newcomer and a fast learner," Zhou said. However, he warned wind power companies to think twice before rushing into the market because it entails high costs and demanding technologies. He estimates that the early-stage assessment for a potential offshore wind farm takes three to five years - sometimes dozens of years - and the costs are at least double those of land projects, with additional seabed cables to be installed and high maintenance fees. Jia Nansong, a spokesman for China Longyuan Power Group, said in November that the average cost of offshore wind power is 15,000 yuan ($2,409) a kW, about 5,000 yuan more than that generated through hydropower. Despite the difficulties, Goldwind Group, one of China's biggest manufacturers of wind power equipment, has stepped into the market, supplying 20 wind turbines of 2.5 megawatts each to the intertidal wind farm operated by China Longyuan Power Group in Jiangsu. Offshore wind turbines are more demanding technically than those onshore, as they have to resist salt fog, typhoons, floating ice and other tough environmental conditions, said Ma Jinru, vice-president and secretary of the board of Goldwind Group. "If an offshore wind turbine breaks down in strong wind, it may take days for engineers to be able to reach the turbine and fix it," she said. Technology matures Unexpected weather at sea is a worry for Song Lili, chief scientist at the China Meteorological Administration's Wind and Solar Energy Resources Center. "There are extreme weather events, such as tsunamis and typhoons, that can cause severe damage to offshore wind farms," she said, suggesting that weather reports every 15 minutes will help keep wind farms operating safely. Although China is a newcomer to offshore wind power, it has highlighted renewable energy in its future energy map. In the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15), enhancing offshore wind power projects is mentioned in the local marine economy guidance for most coastal provinces, including Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Liaoning, Zhejiang and Hainan. The plan states that by 2015 the country will support offshore wind power projects, improve meteorological support and improve the installation capacity of offshore wind power turbines. Jia, of the China Longyuan Power Group, said his company will enter the offshore wind power market in Jiangsu and Fujian. Li Yan, who heads the climate and energy campaign for Greenpeace, said: "There is every reason that China should support wind power. Resources are abundant, production costs are being lowered and the technology is maturing, all of which make commercial development very promising." Many see wind energy as crucial to reducing the carbon emissions scientists believe are responsible for global warming, and it may play an important role in China's sustainable development. The nation put its first offshore wind power project out to tender in October 2010. Ma, at Goldwind Group, said: "The first round of official bidding for the operation of offshore wind power projects has shown that the Chinese government strongly supports the trend in offshore wind power construction." Side effects While authorities are giving the go-ahead to boost the offshore wind power market, environmentalists are concerned about the potential impact. China requires offshore wind power projects to avoid areas involving marine transport, military use, marine protection and mineral resources. Greenpeace expert Zhou said this is far from sufficient, as large offshore wind farms may have side effects on wildlife, fishing and bird migration. An official at the State Oceanic Administration, who did not want to be identified, conceded there are possible side effects, but said that before an offshore wind power project is given the go-ahead, a comprehensive environmental assessment is carried out. By the end of 2011, China had installed a wind power generating capacity of 260 megawatts, ranking third in the world after Britain and Denmark. usaDOTchinadailyDOTcomDOTcn/epaper/2013-01/29/content_16184178.htm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359559612384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:26:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359575574503-13</Id><Title>How the US gov't will pay $1 trillion in yearly interest charges...</Title><Msg>which is what the bill will come to on $20 trillion in debt @5% (that is an optimistic projection too on both the debt and interest rate) A 20% value added tax excluding food and healthcare should just about cover it...

Solar cells 20 times thinner than the solar cells of today are only 5-7 years off, according to the nano-scientists that are currently developing them. The estimate, as of right now, is that the super-thin solar cells will be on the market by 2020, which should help to greatly cut down on manufacturing and production costs. “Over 90 per cent of the current electricity generated by solar panels is made by silicon plates that are 200 micrometres thick. Several billion of these are produced every year. The problem is the large consumption of silicon: five grams per watt.” And even tough silicon is one of the most abundant elements on the planet, the ‘pure silicon’ used in solar cells is very expensive and energy intensive to create. And a lot simply ends up discarded during the manufacturing process. There has been some recent research that should help to cut down on wasted silicon, though, so other improvements are also being made there. “About 100,000 tonnes of silicon are consumed every year. However, there is obviously something fundamentally wrong when half of the silicon must be thrown away during the manufacturing process”, says Erik Marstein, the Head of the Norwegian Research Center for Solar Cell Technology, the Head of Research for the solar cell unit at the Institute for Energy Technology at Kjeller outside of Oslo, and an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oslo. While solar cells have been becoming much cheaper in recent years, the researchers say that manufacturing practices must improve in order to allow solar companies to really make money. “It is difficult to make money producing solar cells at current prices. To make money, solar cells must be manufactured much more cheaply…. The most obvious way ahead is to make very thin solar cell slices, without increasing costs. This general rule applies to all types of solar cells: the more electrons sunlight pushes out, the more electricity. And the more energy in the electrons, the higher the voltage.” “The thinner the solar cells become, the easier it is to extract the electricity. In principle, there will therefore be a higher voltage and more electricity in thinner cells. We are now developing solar cells that are at least as good as the current ones, but that can be made with just one twentieth of the silicon. This means that the consumption of silicon can be reduced by 95 per cent”, Erik Marstein. There is a downside though, with thinner plates less sunlight is trapped. But the researchers have come up with a very effective way to address this, by forcing the light to move sideways. “We can increase the apparent thickness 25 times by forcing the light up and down all the time. We have calculated what this back sheet (that redirects the light) must look like and are currently studying which structures work.” Uglestad microbeads appear to be one of the best options. For those that don’t know, Uglestad microbeads are very small plastic spheres of a exactly uniform size that have a variety of different uses, and strange characteristics. “We can force the Uglestad microbeads to lie close together on the silicon surface, in an almost perfect periodic pattern. Laboratory trials have shown that the microbeads can be used as a mask.” Lasers can then be used to etch indentations around the microbeads. “We are now investigating whether this and other methods can be scaled up for industrial production. We have great faith in this, and are currently in discussions with multiple industrial partners, but we cannot yet say who.” Improvements to manufacturing processes, such as this, and other cost-saving measures could do a lot to help solar power companies become more profitable, and to stay in business. The solar industry has been going through something of a “shakeout” recently — as some of the less competitive companies have been going out of business, technologies such as this will continue to drive strong competition and improvements to solar technology well into the future. sDOTtt/1z9I7</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359575719374</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:55:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359575785986-15</Id><Topic><Title>Isn't the madam Chancellor great?</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1359556194303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:29:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would like to see the Axlerod smear machine try to defame a woman in 2016.

Jon Dwyer, a 29-year-old entrepreneur and president of Toronto-based Flax Energy Corp., has big hopes that one day flax will provide fuel, food and fodder for the world. Canada produces 56 per cent of the world’s supply of the grain. Mr. Dwyer expects to announce early in this quarter that his company is the only one in the world to meet the stringent ASTM (American Standard Testing Materials) standards to create biodiesel fuel out of flax. He also anticipates earning a patent on the process this summer. Neither of these developments will instantly turn the world on its head and provide a replacement for the oily petrochemical our world runs on. But “it means big prospects for the biodiesel industry, and for a little company like us,” Mr. Dwyer said. Food and fodder have long been part of the flax arsenal. The addition of flax oil as biodiesel – in other words, fuel – is exciting, Mr. Dwyer says. It’s green energy and it’s sustainable. Flax Energy’s cold-pressed process also avoids the use of chemicals. “We’re one of the only companies on our scale not using hexane to extract oil,” he said in an interview. Hexane is a hydrocarbon that has been identified by some studies as being harmful to people when exposed to it in high quantities, generally when inhaled. Flax Energy instead processes the grain in food-grade stainless steel turbines, he explains. The turbine spins and drags the seeds through the machine. “It crushes the seed and organically heats it up, and the heat causes the flax seeds’ vessels to open up and yield the oil.” Flax Energy, which maintains farms in Manitoba and Hamilton, Ont., sells most of its fuel to Toronto-based Steam Whistle Brewing and the cities of Brampton and Mississauga. Trucks at the Toronto’s Rogers Centre will run on the biodiesel as well, Mr. Dwyer said. “If we wish to replace oil, we need to find something that eats, breathes and lives like oil,” Mr. Dwyer told a recent symposium in Toronto. “Everything’s made of oil, even the parts of cars that run on electricity.” Wind and solar power may replace coal as an energy source, but not the multiple uses of oil, he said. Flax Energy’s oil also can be used in the manufacture of plastics, resins, cosmetics, rubber synthetics, adhesives, epoxy and jewellery. Flax oil becomes rancid when heated and isn’t a good choice for cooking, but it can be used in making linoleum and paint, he said. The 60 per cent of the flax seed that is left – the meal – is cooled and milled into a flour-like product and sold as animal feed. Flax Energy is the largest flax animal feed provider in Eastern Canada. Chicken and beef sold as being rich in Omega 3 acid have been fed flax, Mr. Dwyer said. Flax Energy, founded in 2008, built its own plant from scratch on the Toronto waterfront. It took 14 months, and the plant has been operational since September. It employs 12 people and sorts about 46 tons of flax seeds a day. It’s still a small producer, overshadowed by U.S. manufacturers that use other sources – such as corn – to make biodiesel. “There are not a lot of producers in Canada. We hope to grow within the country and on an international scale.” Money is scarce, said Mr. Dwyer, who nonetheless opposes government subsidies, calling them a hindrance to a company’s ability to work in a modern competitive market. “What we’ve done as a company is prove that sustainability doesn’t require government subsidies. We haven’t taken a cent of government money.” Flax Energy’s expansion will focus first on Jamaica, where the price of diesel is about $1.60 a litre because of the country’s dependency on foreign oil. “We’re working with a group to locate in Jamaica and build a new facility that can run on flax seed oil, palm oil, waste vegetable oil – a variety of products.” The company hopes to have a shovel in the ground this year. It will also market its flax animal feed to nourish tilapia (fish) and shrimp in Honduras to produce high-Omega-3 seafood. Mr. Dwyer also sees Europe – where diesel routinely tops $2.40 a litre – as a place for flax-related technology. In North America, Flax Energy wants to dominate the feed markets in Ontario and Quebec and move into New York and Pennsylvania in the animal feed sector, and to grow in the pasta and baking sectors, Mr. Dwyer said. Canada remains a challenge, however. “Canada’s a very difficult market to get attention if you’re doing something innovative on the manufacturing side,” he said. “We don’t seem to have an appreciation of manufacturing.” theglobeandmailDOTcom/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/sustainability/a-cheaper-way-to-turn-flax-into-biodiesel/article7945056/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359578523641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:42:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359579790703-20</Id><Topic><Title>A cheaper way to turn flax into biodiesel</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359578523641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:42:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Profiting by producing unsubsidized biodiesel.

Unless Congress acts to stop sequestration, federal spending will be slashed by about $110 billion on March 1, with half the total coming from the Pentagon. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made similar comments about the subsidies. The remarks indicate Democrats plan to take another stab at axing the subsidies, this time as part of an effort to dodge the automatic spending cuts, after legislative efforts failed last Congress. “There are many low-hanging pieces of fruit out there that Republicans have said they agreed on previously. I’m not going to go into detail, but one of them, of course, is deal with oil companies,” Reid said Tuesday. These swipes at the nearly $4 billion in annual incentives awarded to the oil-and-gas industry are not new. President Obama and Senate Democrats have pushed several bills to eliminate deductions offered to the oil-and-gas industry. Some bills would have affected only the largest firms, though smaller, independent drillers still would have taken a hit in others. But Republicans, and some oil-state Democrats, have blocked those attempts. They contend the industry's tax incentives should not be singled out for repeal when many other businesses are given deductions and cost-recovery mechanisms. Oil industry lobbyists also say removing the tax incentives could slow domestic energy development. Still, some Republicans and industry-friendly Democrats have said they are open to putting oil-and-gas incentives on the table only as part of a broader tax code overhaul. “It can't be we'll let sequester kick in because we insist that tax loopholes remain where they are for corporate jet owners, or subsidies provided to the oil and gas companies that have done so exceedingly well in recent years have to remain in place. That’s just — that’s not I think a position that will earn a lot of support with the American people,” Carney said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/280213-white-house-takes-aim-at-oil-and-gas-subsidies-as-part-of-sequester-plan</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359604573778</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 22:56:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359605311996-25</Id><Title>Pentagon nominee Hagel endorses ban on high-carbon defense fuels</Title><Msg>Pentagon nominee Hagel endorses ban on high-carbon defense fuels By Ben Geman - 01/30/13 05:08 PM ET Former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), President Obama’s nominee for Defense secretary, is backing a controversial ban on military purchase of alternative fuels that have higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil-based fuels. Hagel, in a written submission to Senate lawmakers vetting his nomination, said it’s his understanding that the 2007 energy law that imposed the ban “has not restricted the Department from purchasing whatever fuel it has needed to support military operations.” “Rather, Section 526 applies only to contracts that are for the express purpose of buying alternative or synthetic fuel. As long as mission capability is not restricted, it is helpful to have this guidance that new fuels should not be any more polluting than fuels produced from conventional petroleum sources,” Hagel, referring to the provision in the 2007 law, wrote as part of his broad submission to the Senate Armed Services Committee. The procurement law prevents federal contracts for alternative or synthetic fuels with higher “lifecycle” emissions — that is, the total emissions from production, combustion and other steps along the way — than conventional petroleum fuels. Section 526, authored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), was largely aimed at blocking the purchase of coal-based liquid fuels — an industry that hasn’t taken off anyway.  But it has also raised fears about complicating acquisition of fuels from refineries that use oil from Canada’s greenhouse-gas-intensive oil sands projects, which are a growing source of U.S. supply. House Republicans have passed legislation to exempt the military from the ban, alleging the law could harm energy security. However, Obama administration political appointees at the Defense Department say the law has been effective. Click here, here and here for earlier coverage of Section 526. Hagel’s answer is part of a wide-ranging, 112-page set of responses to defense policy questions obtained by The Hill. Click here for coverage of Hagel's responses on our DEFCON Hill blog. On energy, Hagel also backs military programs to expand use of biofuels in defense operations, but he argues large-scale use should only occur when the fuels are cost-competitive. “It is prudent for the Department to engage in tests and demonstrations that confirm defense equipment can operate on a range of fuels; however, as the Department allocates its limited resources to ensure it delivers necessary warfighting capability, it should only buy large volumes of these fuels when they are cost-competitive with petroleum products,” Hagel wrote. The military’s biofuels testing program has come under heavy GOP criticism due to the cost of the fuels. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/280203-pentagon-nominee-hagel-endorses-ban-on-high-carbon-defense-fuels-</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359605311996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:08:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359607022200-26</Id><Title>Greens bank on Kerry to quash Keystone pipeline</Title><Msg>Greens bank on Kerry to quash Keystone pipeline Comments (1) By Ben Wolfgang The Washington Times Wednesday, January 30, 2013 John F. Kerry long has been a vocal crusader against climate change in the Senate, and in the process the Massachusetts Democrat became a hero to the environmental movement. Now as the incoming secretary of state, Mr. Kerry is in a position to deliver one of the movement’s biggest victories in decades: drive a stake through the heart of the massive Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline project. Opponents of the ambitious project already are putting pressure on Mr. Kerry, who vacated his Senate seat Wednesday after being confirmed earlier this week to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton as the nation’s top diplomat. The $7 billion pipeline, which would transport oil from Canadian shale fields through the U.S. to Gulf Coast refineries, now is waiting only for approval from the Obama administration. Last week, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican, signed off on the pipeline’s route through his state, clearing the last hurdle outside of Washington. He did so only after the pipeline route was revised to avoid the most sensitive environmental areas in his state. The proposal is now under review at the State Department, which has the lead role because the pipeline crosses an international border. Environmentalists are banking on Mr. Kerry to make sure the pipeline dies there. “Now, one of the strongest champions for climate action in the Senate will be our nation’s top climate negotiator. We are excited that he will bring his strong credentials on climate to the critical decisions facing our planet, including increasing access to affordable clean energy options and stopping the expansion of dirty tar sands,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, arguably the most powerful environmental group in the nation. Given Mr. Kerry’s past statements, including equating the threat of climate change with a nuclear-armed Iran, environmentalists have good reason to be optimistic. Peter LaFontaine, an energy policy advocate at the National Wildlife Federation, told Inside Climate News that having Mr. Kerry as head of the State Department “is a good sign.” “Obviously there are other people in the president’s ear on this. It’s great to have Kerry at the table, too,” Mr. LaFontaine added. The Natural Resources Defense Council called Mr. Kerry “a champion for action against climate change” and expressed “great confidence” in him, given his record on the subject. Former colleagues in Congress, however, continue to speak out. Nearly 150 members of the House, including 14 Democrats, sent a letter to President Obama this week, urging him to approve the pipeline immediately. But other pipeline supporters fear that the president, no longer concerned with winning elections, will stop the pipeline as payback to environmental groups who helped get him re-elected and helped form a foundation of support for the past four years. “You cannot underestimate the strength of the environmental lobby and how much power this administration has ceded to them,” said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government and public affairs at the Western Energy Alliance, a nonprofit trade group representing more than 400 oil and gas companies in the western United States. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/30/greens-bank-on-kerry-to-quash-keystone-pipeline/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359607022200</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:37:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
