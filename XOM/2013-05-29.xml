The nine geographic fields that make up the majority of Eagle Ford yielded 529,874 barrels of crude a day, according to preliminary data released by the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees oil and gas drilling in the state. The fields produced 298,266 barrels daily in March 2012. February output was revised to 511,434 barrels a day from the preliminary report of 471,258, the commission said. Production totals typically increase in subsequent months as the state receives revised, corrected or late reports. Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a renaissance in Texas crude. The state produced 2.3 million barrels a day in February, the highest monthly level since April 1986, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. The EIA hasn’t released March production data for the state. EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle Ford play, with 639,000 net acres. Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) is next with 485,000, followed by Apache Corp. and BP Plc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Plains Marketing LP’s posted price for Eagle Ford light oil today was $90.75 a barrel, compared with the most recent settlement prices of $94.15 for West Texas Intermediate and $102.62 for Brent. Output of condensates, or natural gas liquids, was 89,345 barrels a day in March, down from 123,871 a year earlier, as drillers moved away from less profitable gas. Production of natural gas was 1.89 billion cubic feet a day, compared with 2.03 billion the year earlier. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/29/eagle-ford-oil-output-rises-77-to-more-than-500000-barrels-per-day/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369831574182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:46:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369832268350-2</Id><Title>Best OPEC Discipline Since 2011 No Proof for $100 Oil</Title><Msg>Grant Smith &amp; Mark Shenk - May 29, 2013 2:57 AM MT OPEC’s best adherence to its production ceiling in 18 months is failing to buoy the outlook for crude oil prices, raising pressure on the group to pare supplies amid burgeoning U.S. output. While all but one of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey predict the 12-member organization will maintain its target of 30 million barrels a day at its May 31 meeting in Vienna, most say OPEC needs to conform better with the limit to keep supply from overwhelming demand. Societe Generale SA says the necessary reduction could be “substantial.” The Centre for Global Energy Studies says prices may tumble without output curbs. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which accounts for 40 percent of global oil supply, hasn’t stuck so closely to its output ceiling since the current level was set in December 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That hasn’t stopped Brent, against which more than half the world’s crude is priced, losing 6.6 percent this year, falling as low as $96.75 a barrel on April 18, amid a combination of slowing global demand and surging U.S. shale supplies. “They’re going to have to keep cutting,” Seth Kleinman, head of energy strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London, said by phone yesterday. “This market’s looking heavy in terms of supply, and it’s getting heavier, and there will come a stage when OPEC needs to address that weight problem. Supply growth will be robust and demand will consistently disappoint.” Output Rebound Curbs by Saudi Arabia pared OPEC output to 30.6 million barrels a day in January, the closest to the group’s formal 30-million limit since its introduction in December 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Output has since rebounded, reaching 30.9 million a day last month, a level about 900,000 a day more than both OPEC’s target and the amount the International Energy bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-05-28/best-opec-discipline-since-2011-no-proof-for-100-oil.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369832268350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369833401838-3</Id><Title>Tropical storm Barbara nears hurricane strength near Mexican coast</Title><Msg>Tropical storm Barbara nears hurricane strength near Mexican coast MEXICO CITY | Wed May 29, 2013 8:56am EDT (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Barbara gained strength on its approach to Mexico's southern coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday. The center reported that the storm was nearing hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour and was located about 70 miles south of the port of Salina Cruz in southern Oaxaca state. Salina Cruz is home to Mexican state oil monopoly Pemex's largest refinery. Barbara churned northeast at about eight miles per hour, and is expected to swing through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, once it makes landfall later on Wednesday. The center issued a hurricane warning from Oaxaca's Puerto Angel to Barra de Tonala, and a tropical storm warming from Barra de Tonala to Boca de Pijijiapan in Chiapas state. Barbara is forecast to reach hurricane strength before it hits Mexico's southern coast, the center added. Between 4 and 12 inches of rain is expected over eastern Oaxaca through western Chiapas once Barbara reaches land, along with a storm surge of between 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/05/29/us-mexico-barbara-idUSBRE94S0MQ20130529</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369833401838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:16:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369833429718-4</Id><Title>Fannie Mae 4.50 is coming</Title><Msg>then 5 and 6</Msg><Username>sowj_gade</Username><Timestamp>1369833429718</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:17:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369833562631-5</Id><Topic><Title>Tropical storm Barbara nears hurricane strength near Mexican coast</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369833401838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:16:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SATELLITE East Pacific - Rainbow Color Infrared Loop ssdDOTnoaaDOTgov/goes/east/epac/flash-rb.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369833562631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:19:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369833820842-6</Id><Topic><Title>Tropical storm Barbara nears hurricane strength near Mexican coast</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369833401838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:16:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tropical Storm 02E (Barbara) Warning #03 Issued at 29/1000Z usnoDOTnavyDOTmil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/warnings/ep0213.gif</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369833820842</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369835467330-7</Id><Title>C L S N , O C Z ,</Title><Msg>momentum higher as shorts become buyers.</Msg><Username>remember_acad_arna_kerx</Username><Timestamp>1369835467330</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:51:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369838709281-8</Id><Topic><Title>Germanic themed Prometheus story – told by Americans</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369579076667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:37:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes indeed.

My Freyja liked the movie which is why I analyzed it as I did. I thought the character in the movie might be Scarlett Johansson. She looked so young. But no I should have noticed Charlize’s bosom was not quite the same as Scarlett’s, and I should not have underestimated Charlize’s genes and her relative immunity from aging quickly. Between the two of them, I think Charlize’s chest is really nicer. Of course that depends on genetic code matching preferences on my part. Penelope is quite nice.

Proxy advisory firm ISS had recommended that shareholders withhold support for CEO Tillerson's compensation, citing Exxon's "modest" shareholder returns and the company's reliance on awards that have less emphasis on performance. This year at the company's annual meeting, 71 percent of Exxon's shareholders cast a non binding vote supporting the compensation of the company's named executives, compared with 78 percent last year. The average support for so-called say-on-pay results was 91 percent in 2012, according to ISS. Tillerson told reporters after the meeting that the decline in support for his pay "wasn't a significant move" and meant that 70 percent of Exxon's shareholders were happy with the company's compensation practices. Exxon's total shareholder return - or capital gains plus dividends - for the year ended 2012 was about 5 percent, compared with 16 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, according to ISS. Exxon contends that ISS's model inappropriately emphasizes short-term stock performance and disregards the long-term investing cycles for an oil company like Exxon. In 2012, Tillerson's total compensation as calculated by the proxy firm rose 15 percent to $40 million. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/05/29/exxon-meeting-idUSL2N0E50Y420130529</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369850275579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:57:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369855607208-13</Id><Title>Merrill Lynch...just downgrade oil.....because of lack of growth in China &amp; Europe: Buy under $90</Title><Msg>Too high now!!!</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1369855607208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855686268-14</Id><Topic><Title>Merrill Lynch...just downgrade oil.....because of lack of growth in China &amp; Europe: Buy under $90</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1369855607208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:26:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>............................BofA Merrill downgrades oil on weaker demand in China, Europe Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dialed down their expectations for oil prices on weaker-than-expected demand in China and Europe and plentiful supplies. Recent U.S. oil production has exceeded the bank’s “optimistic forecasts,” the analysts said in a note to clients released on Wednesday. They are calling for a small surplus for oil markets in the next 18 to 24 months. The bank also trimmed oil demand expectations for 2014 on weaker growth in emerging markets. “Yet, while demand has turned out to be softer than previously anticipated, oil supply growth is running at a faster pace,” BofA Merrill Lynch said. “Lower global oil demand, rising supplies and higher inventories are a cocktail for lower prices.” The bank forecast Brent oil, Europe’s benchmark, at $103 a barrel in the second half of the year, and at $105 in 2014. Brent prices hovered around $103 on Wednesday, and prices for West Texas Intermediate fell below $94 on fears slower global growth would cut down on energy demand. Bank of America Merrill Lynch kept price expectations for WTI the same at $91 a barrel and $92 a barrel for this year and the next, respectively, but said it sees “downside risk.” What’s more, Brent oil could be trading under $100 between 2015 and 2020, the bank said. Production in countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will grow by 820,000 barrels a day this year and 910,000 barrels a day in 2014, compared to forecasts of production growth by 700,000 barrels a day and 815,000 barrels a day, respectively, the analysts said.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1369855686268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:28:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369856977285-15</Id><Topic><Title>C L S N , O C Z ,</Title><Username>remember_acad_arna_kerx</Username><Timestamp>1369835467330</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:51:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CLSN, $3.00 OCZ, $3.00</Msg><Username>peterhoffrnan554</Username><Timestamp>1369856977285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:49:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369865623662-16</Id><Topic><Title>Eagle Ford oil output rises 77% to more than 500,000 barrels per day</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369831574182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:46:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how can this be??

It’s one of several initiatives since the 2010 BP oil spill that lead to the overhaul of the department’s long-troubled offshore branch and tougher regulations. Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) on Wednesday published a solicitation for applications to manage the proposed institute, which Interior has been planning since 2010. “The Institute will help federal regulators keep pace with new processes employed by the industry as they move into deeper water and deeper geologic plays that require technological innovation to bring projects into production," BSEE Director James Watson said. The agency is committing $5 million over five years for operating the institute. It’s missions include R&amp;D, training federal workers in identifying the safest technologies, and implementing improvements in environmental protection and safety, containing blowouts and spill response, according to the solicitation for applications. The institute is envisioned as a place for collaboration among academics, industry, the government and others, and will be “an important source of unbiased, independent information and will not have any regulatory authority over the offshore industry,” BSEE said Wednesday. Creation of the institute stems from a recommendation of the Ocean Energy Safety Advisory Committee (OESC), a federal advisory panel created after the 2010 BP disaster that dumped several million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. “While there have been other efforts to identify technological gaps and to recommend improvement of drilling and production equipment, thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/302369-interior-to-create-offshore-drilling-safety-institute</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369871909536</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 19:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369872517779-18</Id><Title>Some ethanol plants cut out middleman to pass savings to drivers</Title><Msg>Holly Jessen | May 29, 2013 The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association is pointing to examples of ethanol plants that sell E85 directly to retailers. Contrary to the claims of the petroleum industry renewable identification numbers (RINs) are being used to lower fuel prices for consumers, the IRFA said. “Big Oil consistently touts the line that buying RINs equates to higher gas prices, but reality proves otherwise,” said IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw. “The blender – the seller of the RIN – can and should pass the value of the RIN through to consumers. In fact, Iowa ethanol plants are doing just that. By offering higher blends like E85 directly to retailers, Iowa ethanol plants are passing along the RIN savings and hoping that retailers will reflect the lower wholesale prices at the pump.” IRFA named two ethanol plants that offer E85 directly to retailers, Siouxland Energy and Livestock Cooperative, a 60 MMgy ethanol plant in Sioux Center, Iowa, and Absolute Energy, a 115 MMgy ethanol plant near the Iowa-Minnesota border. The two facilities announced implementation of the direct-to-retailers programs on May 24 and May 29. Recent OPIS prices for E85 at Iowa terminals were $2.69 a gallon, IRFA pointed out, while at the same time SELC listed its E85 at $2.17 a gallon. “Here at Siouxland Energy, we’re passing on the RIN savings to the consumer, and it’s making for some very attractive E85 prices,” said Tom Miller, SELC commodity manager. “I think ethanol plants are growing tired of watching a middleman pocket the RIN value to the detriment of consumers. Our plant wants consumers to understand the real value of homegrown ethanol, so we’ve cut out the middleman and we’re selling E85 directly to retailers at a much greater discount.” RINs are earned by ethanol blenders and can then be sold on the open market to oil refiners, which use the credits to demonstrate... ethanolproducerDOTcom/articles/9900/some-ethanol-plants-cut-out-middleman-to-pass-savings-to-drivers</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369872517779</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:08:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369874941332-19</Id><Title>Is bluechesse just talking to himself ?</Title><Msg>Try to make some friends...........your posts here are totally irrelevent and stupid !</Msg><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1369874941332</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:49:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
