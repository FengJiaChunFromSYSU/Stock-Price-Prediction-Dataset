The tax is either passed into the price of products which disproportionately impacts low income consumers, or is avoided entirely by industry relocating its energy intensive production to places like China. The best way to deal with the problem is a Speculator Tax, that is, a very high tax rate on capital gains and dividends to fund government sponsored energy research, and secondary and higher education in the sciences. The best model would be something close to what was in place before the election of Ronald Reagan: a 39.875% tax on long term capital gains, and a 70% tax on ordinary (short term capital gains and dividend) income over $1,000,000.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353776779170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 12:06:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353784496964-2</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Seen Pumping Gas In His New High Tax Home Of California</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353443695979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:34:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>on yur knees wahleeee boy</Msg><Username>wahleee_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1353784496964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 14:14:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353791739212-3</Id><Topic><Title>aka Raul_10spain is Chris O'Donough a cowardly racist</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1353633626596</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 20:20:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good point</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353791739212</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 16:15:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353797957798-4</Id><Title>GOP throwing in the towel.</Title><Msg>Just the other day Steve Forbes praised Clinton's economic policies, encouraging Obama to stand firm his campaign to reduce the deficit by abolishing Bush Tax Cuts. Forbes does elaborate, and says he wants spending cuts along with the tax increases. Of course that is what Obama has been saying since the summer before last - a balanced approach of tax increases and targeted spending cuts to ferret out waste. Alas, it will not be sufficient to raise taxes back to the Clinton levels, though. Over $10 trillion in new debt has been accumulated thanks to the Bush Tax Cuts and the riot of speculation and economic distortion they caused. So taxes will have to be raised higher on the speculators to service the $10 trillion in new debt...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353797957798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 17:59:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353798319897-5</Id><Topic><Title>Government Driven Technologies</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353549255250</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:54:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump. A challenge for the supply siders: list all the big tech companies and their date of founding. You will find that almost all of them were founded before Reagan was elected, during a time when the Tax Code was supposedly retarding entrepreneurs and investment... It is highly unlikely it was retarded of course - the tech companies sprung from the Universities and piggybacked off the technologies that were shooting off the government's Cold War efforts.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353798319897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 18:05:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353798754118-6</Id><Title>Wall Street Reform.</Title><Msg>The big banks should be broken up and Glassâ€“Steagall reimposed.

Any business that refuses to cease and desist from such activities should be held criminally liable and its officers subject to prosecution for fraud. So would end the riot of speculation in such worthless activities as betting or insuring foreign government debt or setting up offshore subsidiaries to speculate in oil and other commodities.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353799397239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 18:23:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353807820588-9</Id><Title>Republican Losers Whining and Thrashing</Title><Msg>As they face years of irrelevance and losses.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353807820588</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 20:43:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353810938465-10</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Losers Whining and Thrashing</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353807820588</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 20:43:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It took 48 years to get another Republican like Hoover elected after he was ejected in disgrace in 1932. The Democrat juggernaut is just getting started. Bush has got it off to a fantastic start. I look forward to it passing over the entire Reagan Revolution in each and every one of its parts and scattering it fully. It will be a profitable ride, yes very profitable...
