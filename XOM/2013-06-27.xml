Corbett predicts the global figure will rise to 87,000 deaths a year by 2012.</Msg><Username>doely_1</Username><Timestamp>1372330225294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 06:50:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372330663741-2</Id><Topic><Title>Petroleum association regrouping after loss at Supreme Court</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372270251533</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:10:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is none of the court business, until there is a constitutional law broken.

The most staggering statistic of all is that just 16 of the world’s largest ships can produce as much lung-clogging sulphur pollution as all the world’s cars. Because of their colossal engines, each as heavy as a small ship, these super-vessels use as much fuel as small power stations. But, unlike power stations or cars, they can burn the cheapest, filthiest, high-sulphur fuel: the thick residues left behind in refineries after the lighter liquids have been taken. The stuff nobody on land is allowed to use. Thanks to decisions taken in London by the body that polices world shipping, this pollution could kill as many as a million more people in the coming decade – even though a simple change in the rules could stop it. There are now an estimated 100,000 ships on the seas, and the fleet is growing fast as goods are ferried in vast quantities from Asian industrial powerhouses to consumers in Europe and North America. It is foolish to try to put coal out of business when this is going on.</Msg><Username>doely_1</Username><Timestamp>1372330912949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 07:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372334664592-4</Id><Title>yahoo blocking xom california spill</Title><Msg>you have to go to twitter look for drillingmaps</Msg><Username>tagthatstock</Username><Timestamp>1372334664592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 08:04:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372337023704-5</Id><Title>Brief cases full of €500 notes disappearing from banks around Europe...</Title><Msg>or will be 0 interest rate polices have rendered the banking system just about useless except for those who have no means of physically moving and protecting money except by means of bank balances. All one has to do get their money out of that system is demand cash. A briefcase full of €500 notes will hold more value per weight than gold, and once it is out of the banking system the money cannot be loaned anymore. Governments cannot trace the money anymore either. Removing money from the banking system enforces a reduction of credit on it. It is deflationary. The problem of banks losing the money or counting on deposit "insurance" is removed, as it the problem of finding German t-bills at something more than a NEGATIVE interest rate whenever some financial storm erupts. The oil price is held up largely based on the delusions of speculators and gamblers betting on an enormous expansion of credit. That is the same sort of delusion that prevailed before the gold price lost almost 40% of its value. Credit is not going to expand when interest rates are so low and assets are bid well past their value in huge parts of Southern Europe, China, Russia, and the Middle East. German real estate is one of the few physical asset one could lend on, but then that it is because it is not leveraged much to be begin with. There are fundamental reasons oil will plummet, and this credit reason simply reinforces those.

As the volume requirements of the RFS program increase, it becomes more likely that the volume of ethanol projected to meet those requirements will exceed the volume that can be consumed in the common blend ratio of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline, referred to as E10. Additional volumes of ethanol would then need to be used at higher blend levels such as E15 or E85 to meet increasing RFS levels or significant additional volumes of non-ethanol biofuels would be needed. As a result, to the extent that ethanol is likely to be used to meet RFS volume requirements, the volume of ethanol that can be legally and practically consumed is a limiting factor in meeting the statutory volumes. For 2013, we expect compliance with the RFS standards through the use of RINs generated in 2013 and those generated in 2012 that are available under the regulations for use (carryover RINs) in complying with 2013 standards. In 2014, the situation could be different. There are a number of factors that will play a role in determining how regulated parties will demonstrate compliance with the applicable RFS volumes. First, the advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel requirements rise substantially to 3.75 billion gallons and 18.15 billion gallons, respectively. While non-ethanol biofuels are anticipated to continue to grow to help supply the advanced biofuel standard, an estimated 16 billion gallons or more of conventional and advanced ethanol might still be needed to comply with the RFS program in 2014. Second, the number of carryover RINs from 2013 will also be a critical factor in determining how obligated parties show compliance with the 2014 RFS volume requirements.

It will create disasters before it creates jobs, but it will create jobs,” Lagarde said on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe.” Her remark came in a wide-ranging interview about the global economy. She cited climate change in response to a question about where job growth can occur at a time when workers are getting displaced by automation. “It is a major issue, particularly at a time when robot-ization is developing in many of these advanced economies,” she said. “But you know there will be areas of growth. You talk about green growth — that will be associated with particular jobs for which the training has not yet been invented and needs to be aggregated and put together,” Lagarde said Thursday. She also noted jobs associated with caring for aging populations. Her comments arrive as Republicans are attacking President Obama’s second-term climate agenda unveiled earlier this week, arguing that new power plant emissions rules in particular will cost jobs and raise energy costs. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor Tuesday that Obama’s plans will hurt the coal sector, which is “tantamount to kicking the ladder out from beneath the feet of many Americans struggling in today’s economy.” The White House is pushing back against the charge that new steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions will hurt the economy, noting that earlier Clean Air Act rules for other pollutants didn’t have that effect. “[T]he numbers speak for themselves: between 1970 and 2011, aggregate emissions of common air pollutants dropped 68 percent, while the U.S. gross domestic product grew 212 percent. Private sector jobs increased by 88 percent during the same period,” White House climate aide Heather Zichal said in</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372358174070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:36:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372359911019-13</Id><Title>Universal Bioenergy Inc.
