By Robert Wright inShare.Sep 9 2012, 10:31 AM ET375 Buried in New York Times polling guru Nate Silver's latest blog post is a chart that should have Mitt Romney ordering out for some Xanax. The chart depicts Silver's statistical inferences from several multi-day tracking polls that include Thursday and Friday, the final day of the Democratic convention and the day after--in other words, the two days after Bill Clinton's barnburner of a speech. I'll explain below why I'd add one grain of salt to Silver's inferences, but first, here they are, in this chart's final column, which depicts the estimated swing in Obama's favor since Clinton's speech: IMAGE/CHART My two reasons for mild skepticism: [1] I support Obama, and I'm a pessimist. OK, I admit that this reason isn't a paragon of rigor. So on to the second reason: [2] As Silver himself emphasizes, there's a big challenge in interpreting multi-day tracking polls, because they don't release their day-by-day figures. So when, say, Obama's seven-day Gallup tracking number goes up for Friday (as it did), what that means is that the average Obama number for Sep. 1-7 is higher than the average Obama number for Aug. 31-Sep. 6. And the only highly granular thing you can infer for sure from that (if I understand this correctly, something that has a 78-percent chance of being the case) is that the Sep. 7 number was higher than the Aug. 31 number. And we can't say for sure what the Aug 31 number was, because, again, these polls don't release day-by-day numbers. Here's the reason this matters: Obama's multi-day tracking numbers rose for Thursday, the day after Clinton's much-praised speech, and then reached an even higher level for Friday, the day after Obama's not-so-praised speech, and the day a weak jobs report came out. (These are the numbers released by the polling companies on Friday and Saturday, respectively.) It's tempting to look at those numbers and think, "Wow, Obama's numbers continued to rise immediately after his speech, and notwithstanding the weak jobs numbers." But, again, all we can say for sure is that his post-speech numbers were higher than his numbers had been a week earlier. (That's with the Gallup poll. Not all the tracking polls are 7-day--some are just 3-day--but the same type of uncertainty applies to all of them.) So here's a scenario that, if I'm understanding this correctly, is entirely consistent with the data: Obama's numbers rose a lot on Thursday, after the Clinton speech, but then fell on Friday, after the Obama speech and the weak jobs numbers, though they didn't fall as low as they'd been some days earlier (7 days in the case of the Gallup poll, other periods for other polls). If that's what happened, then the convention bounce, as it currently stands, could be significantly less than the eight points suggested by that final column in Silver's chart. So I would add my one grain of salt to this sentence of Silver's: "Despite a mediocre jobs report on Friday, there were no signs in the polls that Mr. Obama's bounce had immediately receded, as he gained further ground in the surveys that were released on Saturday [i.e., the surveys conducted through Friday]." True, there were no visible signs of slippage, but it's in the nature of these multi-day tracking polls that actual slippage could be concealed by numbers that keep rising. All that said, there's no denying that these tracking poll numbers will get filed under "bad news" by the Romney campaign, and deservedly so. Even the most pessimistic of pro-Obama pessimists should feel a mild lightening of spirits. [Update, 9/9, 11:20 a.m.: Adding strength to Silver's analysis--and sapping strength from my grain of salt--is the latest Rasmussen tracking poll, which came out this morning, after Silver's post, and includes Saturday polling numbers. It has Obama up by four percentage points, higher than the two percentage points of the previous day's Rasmussen poll. (And ...

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda oversaw the signing of a memorandum for the $13 billion project with Japan's Agency for Natural Resources and Energy on Saturday, on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit, Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom said. The project "will have a great meaning for developing the eastern part of the Unified Gas Supply System of Russia as well as raising Russian gas supplies to Asia-Pacific markets including Japan," Alexei Miller, Gazprom's chairman, said in a statement. "I would like to emphasize that the Japanese market has an advantageous size and is considered a top priority in the Far East," Miller said. Japan used 83 million tons of LNG in 2011, accounting for 14 percent of its total energy use. Almost all the natural gas Japan uses is in the form of LNG. Gazprom is the world's largest producer of gas, but its pipeline gas business has been hard hit by sliding demand for gas while competing liquefied natural gas carried by ship has flooded European markets. Gazprom relies on pipelines and long-term pricing agreements. Miller forecast that Gazprom's exports of natural gas to the Asia-Pacific would soon exceed the volume sold to Europe. "Taking into account the dynamics of the growth of gas demand in the Asia-Pacific region, now the decisions will be considerably accelerated," Miller said. Japan and Russia appear to be making at least some headway on their tussle over islands north of Japan claimed by both sides. Deputy ministers are to meet later this fall to discuss the issue with the aim of eventually signing a peace treaty, officials said Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which is holding its annual summit in Vladivostok. The two sides agreed to ban crab poaching in the Sea of Okhotsk and signed an agreement on building a timber processing factory in Siberia. Meanwhile, Noda and Putin agreed to arrange a visit by the Japanese leader to Russia by December, said a senior Japanese official who briefed journalists about the talks. The two sides want to resolve their differences in a "quiet and constructive atmosphere," the official cited Noda as saying. Gazprom and its partners have conducted a feasibility study on transmission and marketing of natural gas and chemical products in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan Far East Gas Co., the consortium participating in the government-backed project, includes Itochu Corp., Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Marubeni Corp., Inpex Corp. and Itochu Oil Exploration Co. Gazprom plans to extend a natural gas pipeline from Sakhalin to Vladivostok to a seaside terminal where the gas would be processed for shipment to Japan and other markets. The new project, if completed, would have a capacity of 10 million tons annually, doubling Gazprom's capacity from its...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347258223269</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 02:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347258514110-3</Id><Title>Pancontinental rises most in 19 years after Kenyan gas strike</Title><Msg>Pancontinental rises most in 19 years after Kenyan gas strike Date September 10, 2012 - 12:57PM 2 reading now Pancontinental Oil &amp; Gas, an Australian explorer focused on East Africa, surged the most in 19 years in Sydney trading after its venture with Apache Corp. recorded a natural-gas discovery off the coast of Kenya.

Most all of the people are young people, where statistics show the majority of them supporting for Obama. During his 2008 run for President, Obama said he wanted to form a civilian army that was just as powerful as the US military. Obama's civilian army that he will form during his 2nd term will be composed on primarily black and Hispanic young people who support his goals of turning the US into his Marxist utopian dream.

The premiers of Alberta and British Columbia - along with Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall - are attending the World Economic Forum in Tianjin and will take part in a natural resources panel and New West Partnership reception together Tuesday. The Asian sojourn is the first encounter between Clark and Redford since a dispute over the Northern Gateway pipeline disrupted a stormy Council of the Federation meeting in July. Clark's government is demanding a "fair share" of the economic benefits from the $5.5-billion project - currently under review by federal regulators - that would send Alberta bitumen to the B.C. coast for shipping to Asia. But Redford has rebuffed any suggestion of sharing energy royalties. Clark, in turn, refused to take part in interprovincial talks around Redford's much-touted Canadian energy strategy proposal. Representatives of each premier said Friday there had been no change in their respective positions and there are no plans for a formal discussion around the Gateway project. Clark's press secretary, Mike Morton, noted the two premiers likely won't be spending a great deal of time together in China. But he said B.C. would welcome a frank conversation with Redford about the Gateway project. "Absolutely," Morton said. "The premier's made it pretty clear that she ... would like to have that discussion. But to date, since the Council of the Federation meeting in July, that obviously hasn't taken place." Jay O'Neill, Redford's communications director, said market access for Alberta resources is one of the crucial issues to be raised overseas. The premiers will likely present a united front on the issue of boosting access for western Canadian resources, he said, downplaying the likelihood of a one-on-one discussion of Gateway. "Are we going to try to solve the world's problems? I don't think so," O'Neill said. "From our three province's perspective, looking at Asia and what Asia offers and what we can offer as a collective, is probably more important right now." Gerald Baier, a University of British Columbia political science professor, said there is little chance of a quick reconciliation between the two provinces on Gateway because political realities have meant "they've been kind of painted into a corner." There are huge environmental concerns in B.C. around Gateway because the proposed pipeline will run through pristine rain-forest and coastline and there is seen to be too little economic benefit. Clark's Liberal government is floundering in the polls ahead of an election next year. In Alberta, meanwhile, the idea of sharing energy revenues is a non-starter and has also been frowned on by other provinces. Baier said bringing Alberta and B.C. together would likely require some skilled diplomacy by Redford - or the intervention of the federal government. The frostiness between Red-ford and Clark is a far cry from the chummy relationship and joint cabinet meetings under former leaders Ralph Klein and Gordon Campbell, he said. And it may ultimately threaten the viability of institutions such as the New West Partnership, or even the Council of the Federation. "Kind of the danger of our system of federalism is that it does depend to some extent on informal institutions like this to keep the peace. "And when you depend on those and they don't work, you don't have anything more for-mal to back it up," Baier said. However, both the Alberta and B.C. governments said the relationship can withstand cur-rent strains. "They're still doing this trip despite differences.

The information-gathering sessions, which resumed this week, will go on for months, with thousands of others waiting to give evidence. But, even as corporate backers of the proposed $6-billion project began presenting their case, there was a growing conviction that the pipeline to carry oilsands-derived crude from Alberta to the B.C. coast had already become a non-starter. On Tuesday in Edmonton, the so-called joint review panel set up by Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government heard for the first time from senior executives of Enbridge Inc., the Calgary-base energy giant proposing to build Northern Gateway. It was the latest stage in a process that will see the National Energy Board-led panel deliver a yes-or-no recommendation to the federal cabinet by late next year. The final decision on building the pipeline will be made by Harper. Only a few months ago, it was widely thought the Conservatives’ unexpected decision to transfer final decision-making power from the independent regulators of the National Energy Board to Harper’s cabinet meant approval of the pipeline would be a slam dunk. But it’s not turning out that way. The plan to construct a pipeline to carry oil through northern B.C. for transport on supertankers has prompted an outpouring of opposition unlike anything seen in years. “The coalition of civil society that is coming together against this is unprecedented in Canada,” observed Karen Wristen, executive director of the Living Oceans Society in Vancouver. Those organizing against the pipeline include environmental groups, churches, B.C. municipalities, aboriginals and large numbers of residents along the planned Northern Gateway route. Across British Columbia, polls show growing public opposition. Premier Christy Clark has threatened to block construction unless Enbridge guarantees world-class environmental protection and B.C. gets a larger share of pipeline revenues. B.C. NDP Leader Adrian Dix, who could win the provincial election next spring, according to polls, goes even further. If elected, he says, his government will make its own decision on whether the project is environmentally safe enough to proceed. While Ottawa has constitutional control over pipelines, it’s generally accepted that B.C.’s jurisdiction over land and water would give the province ample power to hold up Enbridge’s project. The scope of the political opposition and the likelihood of years of court action by the 100-plus aboriginal groups opposing the pipeline are fanning doubts about whether it will ever get past the drawing board, despite the Harper government’s support. In a recent analysis, energy stock experts at CIBC World Markets said Northern Gateway faces “ever-increasing political risk” and has no better than a 50/50 chance of being built before the end of the decade. Roger McKnight, senior petroleum adviser at Oshawa-based En-Pro International Inc., also said Enbridge faces an uphill struggle. “I personally don’t think Northern Gateway will go through anytime soon or if it ever will,” he said in an interview. “There’s just too much politics in the soup and there are too many environmental concerns in the soup and there’s aboriginal rights in the soup and that makes for a pretty unsavory soup.” Asked if the federal government had been caught off guard, McKnight said, “Yeah, they misread the temperature of the water, environmentally and politically.” He said Ottawa has jurisdiction over pipelines but “Mr. Harper, who has 21 Conservative seats in B.C., is between a rock and hard place on this.” That point is borne out by a poll released Aug. 23 by Abacus Data Inc. that found 56 per cent of British Columbians oppose the pipeline, with 40 per cent strongly opposed. Supporters totalled 24 per cent, with 7 per cent expressing strong support. “The implication overall is that the project is going to have a difficult time turning that opposition into support,” said David Coletto, Abacus’ chief analyst. That’s because the percentage of British Columbians strongly opposed is so large, he said. The poll also found 40 per cent of British Columbians who voted for the federal Conservatives are against Northern Gateway. With Harper’s government highly supportive of the proposed pipeline, “the potential political implications of this could be huge,” Coletto said. “If the pipeline issue becomes attached to the Tories in a way that’s negative, it could cost them some of the closer seats around the Lower Mainland of B.C. and on Vancouver Island” in the 2015 election, Coletto remarked. Enbridge wants to build a 1,172-kilometre pipeline that would carry 500,000 barrels a day of oilsands-derived crude from Edmonton across the Rockies to Kitimat on the B.C. coast. There, 200 supertankers would dock annually to export the petroleum to the U.S. and Asia. But the proposal has been a lightning rod for opposition because it would pass through some of the continent’s most pristine wilderness regions. “The opposition is incredible,” said Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, MP for the B.C. riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands. “There is an enormous level of visceral opposition to anything that threatens the survival of wild salmon in B.C.,” she said. “And of course the oil tanker spill issue plays into that. People do not want our coastline polluted with an oil spill — ever.” The pipeline controversy also touches on a wider range of issues, including resource revenue-sharing among provinces under the constitution, First Nations’ land claims, global warming, protection of marine life, pipeline safety, water use, job creation and how quickly to develop the oilsands. More than 4,000 people have signed up to speak before the three-person federal review panel that started gathering information in January. As of last week, 1,105 aboriginals, residents along the pipeline route and others had appeared at the hearings in B.C. and Alberta, according to the NEB. Others will give evidence over the next six months. As the review panel began to hear from Enbridge this week, Northern Gateway Pipelines Inc. president John Carruthers acknowledged that most of those heard so far had been against the pipeline. “The majority of those who have appeared before the panel consist of people who have concerns regarding oilsands development and the project and its potential effects on their interests and who would argue that the project should be refused,” Carruthers told the panellists. But he expressed hope the public will support Northern Gateway once people become aware of projected economic benefits that will provide “a significant improved quality of life for all Canadians, including aboriginal Canadians.” At the same time, Carruthers said, the company hopes to address concerns about oil spills and co-operate with greens to make the pipeline a model of environmental protection. “For groups with an interest in local and regional environmental protection, as opposed to those whose primary interest is to delay or impede oilsands development, we believe there are real opportunities to work together,” he told the panel. Northern Gateway has been an important priority for the federal Conservatives. After the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the U.S. was delayed last year, the Harper government stressed the need to establish a conduit that would enable Canadian companies to market oilsands-derived crude in Asia. Now, in the face of rising opposition, the Harper Conservatives appear to be tinkering with the message. In early August, Harper suggested for the first time the decision will hinge on the findings of the regulators on the joint review panel. “The only way governments can handle controversial projects of this manner is to ensure that things are evaluated on an independent basis scientifically, and not simply on political criteria,” he said during a visit to B.C. But all indications are the federal government remains committed to building an export route across the Pacific for Alberta’s oilsands-derived crude. The Green Party’s May says this sets the stage for a political clash of historic proportions over Northern Gateway. “As long as Stephen Harper is prime minister, he will work to build that project,” she said. “But I don’t think it will get...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347314013533</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 17:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347315818204-25</Id><Title>Tropical Storm LESLIE, Hurricane MICHAEL, ...</Title><Msg>Tropical Storm LESLIE, Hurricane MICHAEL, ...
