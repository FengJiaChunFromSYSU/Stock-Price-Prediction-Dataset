It's being hosted by the BC Chamber of Commerce -- a group strongly in favour of the project. Chamber president John Winter says the public debate has been extremely one-sided. "What we're really hoping to have happen on Wednesday is a number of panels that will talk to some of the realities that are not being talked to at this point in time -- and try to create a common fact base for people to really make up their minds." Winter says the industry has done a poor job of raising its priorities and commitments when it comes to the project.

He was primarily a labor leader who was concerned about illegal immigrants undercutting union members, either by accepting lower wages or crossing picket lines. He never pretended to be anything else, and he resisted attempts by others to widen his agenda. When he pulled workers out of the field during a strike, the last thing he wanted was to see a crew of illegal immigrant workers take away his leverage. According to many historical accounts, Chavez ordered union members to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and report illegal immigrants who were working in the fields so that they could be deported. Some UFW officials were also known to picket INS offices to demand a crackdown on illegal immigrants. In the 70s, the UFW set up a "wet line" to stop undocumented Mexican immigrants from entering the United States. Under the supervision of Chavez's cousin, Manuel, UFW members tried at first to persuade Mexicans not to cross the border. One time when that didn't work, they physically attacked and beat them up to scare them off, according to reports at the time. The Village Voice said that the UFW was engaged in a "campaign of random terror against anyone hapless enough to fall into its net." A couple of decades later, in their book "The Fight in the Fields," journalists Susan Ferris and Ricardo Sandoval recalled the border violence and wrote that the issue of illegal immigration was "particularly vexing" for Chavez. UFW loyalists will never admit to this ugly history. But that doesn't change it. And this is the person Obama is honoring today with a national monument? One immigration hardliner paying his respects to another. I guess, in some perverse way, that makes sense. But it won't make most Latino voters any more enthusiastic about re-electing Barack Obama.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349727261574</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349728560169-26</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS MORMON... vs. OBAMA IS CHRISTIAN, you choose...</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349718377818</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:46:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama is a lying muslim antichrist !</Msg><Username>tvillesam</Username><Timestamp>1349728560169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:36:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349728915068-27</Id><Topic><Title>I TOLD YOU GUYS LAST 12 MONTHS THAT OBAMA IS A IDIOT !

Aldy, a White House energy aide in 2009 and 2010, bashed Republican “intransigence” on climate change proposals during the debate with Oren Cass, who is Mitt Romney’s domestic policy adviser. He noted that Republicans opposed cap-and-trade, and after that bill died, opposed Obama’s proposal for a nationwide “clean energy standard” to require major increases in low-emissions power generation. “We know we have to tackle spending. We know we have to tackle revenues. And so the president will be pragmatic, and if he actually sees a goodwill gesture from the other side, whether it's on a carbon tax, whether it's on other elements of fiscal and tax reform that are consistent with his principles, and it's being fair to the middle class, and if you can do so in a way that also tackles the challenge of climate change, I think he would consider that,” said Aldy, who is now a professor with Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. He added: “But I'm just speculating on that, but I think it's important to say, hey, is he going to come out and actually propose this? He needs to see a goodwill gesture from the other side, because he hasn't seen it for the last four years.” Cass, for his part, said Obama’s climate policy has become uncertain. “Now it's a very interesting argument to say, who knows what President Obama thinks, but he's not willing to put anything forward, particularly as someone running for president. One would hope that someone running for president would be very proud to say what they think, look forward to putting it forward, and attempt to bring people along with them,” he said. A carbon tax would face massive opposition on Capitol Hill and has not been the focus of Democratic proposals to battle climate change. But the idea has nonetheless generated interest of late, thanks to discussions in Washington policy circles and the backing of some former GOP House members (more on that here and here). Cass during the debate said Romney’s focus is on green energy “innovation” as opposed to efforts to put a price on carbon emissions, which occurs under cap-and-trade and carbon tax plans. He emphasized Romney’s view that federal support for alternative energy should be targeted to basic research, as opposed to tax credits and other policies to boost commercial deployment. With climate legislation politically dead, the Obama administration has begun moving ahead with greenhouse gas regulations under its existing Clean Air Act powers. Romney and most other Republicans oppose the rules, calling them economically burdensome, and the former Massachusetts governor wants to strip EPA’s power to regulate the emissions. Asked by one of the questioners how Romney would show “leadership” and “rally” conservatives behind the task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Cass said it would not be a priority but reiterated Romney’s backing for basic research. “Well, I think, frankly, that that's not where Gov. Romney would put his emphasis. You know, I earlier in the discussion, when initially asked about whether that should be a focus for government policy, just said no. You know, advanced technologies with respect to coal and other fossil fuels are absolutely important, as are advanced technologies in the renewable space, and Gov. Romney believes that investment should focus across all of them,” he said. “So in that respect, these are all things that would receive his attention. But with respect to a legislative agenda, moving forward, climate change would not be at the top of it,” Cass said.

The president, fundraising in Los Angeles, addressed energy during a $25,000-per-plate dinner with backers that included actor George Clooney. “On energy, I’m big on oil and gas, and developing clean coal technology, but I also believe that if we’re ever going to have control of our energy future, then we’ve got to invest in solar and wind and biofuels, and that it does make sense for us to double our fuel-efficiency standards on cars,” Obama said, according to a White House transcript. “And that's not a socialist plot for us to reduce our energy usage,” Obama said to laughter, according to the transcript. “It’s the smart thing to do. It’s right for our national energy. It’s right for our economy. It’s right for the environment. [Romney] disagrees.” Obama didn’t get specific about Romney's alleged disagreement. But the GOP nominee in late August bashed new auto mileage rules for model years 2017-2025 that will ultimately require automakers to build cars and light trucks with a fleet-wide average of 54.5 miles-per-gallon. Romney, through a spokeswoman, called the standards “extreme,” and said they will “limit the choices available to American families.” The Romney campaign also emphasized the higher up-front costs of the vehicles, while the Obama administration touted savings in fuel costs over time and reduced oil consumption. (Click here for much more on the rules.) While energy efficiency programs often have bipartisan support, various federal standards have drawn pushback from some Republicans who call them undue federal intrusion into consumer choices. House Republicans, over the last two years, have sought to roll back lightbulb efficiency standards contained in a bipartisan 2007 energy law. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349730215852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349730923375-30</Id><Title>California Advanced Fuel Suppliers Call for Immediate Action to Lower Gas Prices by Implementing EPA Approved Regulations Allowing for Increased Biofuel Blending</Title><Msg>California Advanced Fuel Suppliers Call for Immediate Action to Lower Gas Prices by Implementing EPA Approved Regulations Allowing for Increased Biofuel Blending GlobeNewswire Monday, October 8th 2012. SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 8, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, the California Advanced Energy Coalition (CAEC) proposed immediate action by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adjust its fuel regulations to accommodate increased amounts of low cost clean burning fuels on the market. By implementing a recent ruling by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allowing E15 into the market place, CARB could reduce California gasoline prices immediately as wholesale ethanol is selling at more than $1.00 per gallon below the price of gasoline. An emergency update of the CARB compliance model to include levels of ethanol up to 15 percent will mitigate the need for such waivers in the future, while increasing the supply of the lowest cost fuel in the market, and enhancing California's air quality. In spite of the EPA's approval for E15 nationwide in all vehicles built since 2001, as well as the California LCFS approved regulation that anticipates more than 25% ethanol fuel supply, current California gasoline regulations cap ethanol blending at only 10%. According to the EPA and the DOE, E15 gasoline has been the most tested fuel in history. Before approving E15, the US Department of Energy conducted six years of testing at a cost in excess $42 million, operating engines for a distance equal to six trips to the moon. Since the EPA ruling, both Ford and GM have included E15 as an approved fuel for use in all new cars. "We believe with focus and urgency, dictated by chronically high gasoline prices, California's regulations should be immediately amended to allow for increased ethanol, in a manner that enhances air quality and lowers gasoline prices," said Eric McAfee, chairman and CEO of Aemetis, Inc., an advanced biofuel producer in Cupertino, CA. "We fully support California's LCFS and the policy of increasing the supply of low cost, low carbon fuels into the marketplace. The testing data has been done. What is now needed is to add the EPA's new data to California's compliance model, which is a statistical task," McAfee added. When at full capacity, California biofuels plants produce approximately 200 million gallons of lower carbon ethanol. However, the current ceiling of ethanol blending at only 10% effectively mandates 90% petroleum use in California, which has contributed to the state's biofuels plants operating well below capacity, in spite of producing a low carbon fuel that can immediately reduce gas prices. "Clearly, gasoline regulations need to be updated with the LCFS state policy of adding new fuels into the market," said Neil Koehler, CEO of Pacific Ethanol, based in Sacramento, CA. "Ethanol is the most readily available alternative to gasoline, and is significantly cheaper than the gasoline components it replaces. The Brown administration should do everything possible to quickly increase the supply of this proven low carbon fuel, and align California's regulations with the EPA. We believe that ethanol can continue to be a key compliance fuel if allowed into the market at levels above 10%," said Koehler. A recent study by Ford Motor Company showed the need for a 30% ethanol blend in gasoline in order to meet future fuel economy and clean air requirements in high-efficiency engines. Ethanol contains approximately 115 octane and 30% oxygen, which allows refiners to use lower cost petroleum while still meeting strict federal and California air quality and performance requirements. "Why should California drivers pay more than $1.00 per gallon above the cost of a readily available, renewable, clean fuel produced in California?" asked Lyle Schlyer, CEO of Calgren Renewables, based in Pixley, CA. Calgren's ownership group includes California fuel blenders. On Sunday, Governor Brown approved a waiver requested by the California Independent Oil Marketers Association (CIOMA) to allow the production and sale off-season gasoline in California due to recent shortages and rising prices. virtual-strategy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349730923375</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:15:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349731503161-31</Id><Topic><Title>California Advanced Fuel Suppliers Call for Immediate Action to Lower Gas Prices by Implementing EPA Approved Regulations Allowing for Increased Biofuel Blending</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349730923375</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:15:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>California gas prices: Sen. Dianne Feinstein calls for federal investigation By ASSOCIATED PRESS | 10/8/12 11:08 AM EDT LOS ANGELES — The statewide average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in California rose to an all-time high Monday, the third record-setting day in a row that is prompting calls for a federal investigation into the price spike. The average price in the state hit $4.668, according to AAA. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate, saying residents need to be protected from "malicious trading schemes." (PHOTOS: Pain at the pump) Feinstein in her letter Sunday asked the FTC to determine if the price spike was caused by illegal manipulation of the market and to start monitoring the market for fraud, manipulation, or other malicious trading practices. "Publically available data appears to confirm that market fundamentals are not to blame for rising gas prices in California," she wrote. Despite a pipeline and refinery shutdown, she said, state data shows gas production last week was "almost as high as a year ago, and stockpiles of gasoline and blending components combined were equal to this time last year," she said. In some locations, fuming motorists paid $5 or more per gallon while station owners had to shut down pumps in others. A station in Long Beach south of Los Angeles had California's priciest gas at $6.65 for a gallon of regular, according to GasBuddy. Meanwhile, customers at an outlet in San Pablo north of Oakland paid just $3.49, the lowest. The dramatic surge came after a power outage at a Southern California refinery that reduced supply in an already fragile and volatile market, analysts said. The refinery came back online Friday. Prices were expected to stabilize in the coming days. Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, predicted the average price could peak as high as $4.85 before coming back down. Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday ordered state smog regulators to allow winter-blend gasoline to be sold in California earlier than usual to bring down prices. Winter-blend gas typically isn't sold until after October 31. Few refineries outside the state are currently making summer-blend gas, putting the pressure on already-taxed California manufacturers. politico</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349731503161</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349731800186-32</Id><Title>California Gov.

Brown takes emergency action to try to reduce gas prices By Stuart Pfeifer — Los Angeles Times Created: Monday, October 8, 2012 9:02 a.m. CDT LOS ANGELES (MCT) — California Gov. Jerry Brown took “emergency steps” Sunday to try to bring down record gas prices in the state. He directed the California Air Resources Board to increase the fuel supply by allowing the immediate sale and import of cheaper and more available winter-blend gasoline. The move would reduce the price of gas in California by 15 to 20 cents per gallon, probably within a few days, said energy expert Chris Faulkner of Dallas-based Breitling Oil and Gas. “This would immediately increase the supply of gasoline in California,” Faulkner said, but he cautioned that it would take a few days for the governor’s move to be reflected at the pump. “Gas goes up quickly and comes down slowly,” Faulkner said. Winter-blend gasoline is a mixture that evaporates more quickly than gas sold in summer months. It’s considered more detrimental to air quality during warm weather. Winter-blend gasoline typically isn’t sold until after Oct. 31. “Gas prices in California have risen to their highest levels ever, with unacceptable cost impacts on consumers and small businesses,” Brown said in a statement. “I am directing the Air Resources Board to immediately take whatever steps are necessary to allow an early transition to winter-blend gasoline.” On Sunday, gas prices hit a record average of $4.655 for a gallon of regular in California. The national average is at $3.814. Analysts have attributed the sudden surge of gasoline prices in California to refinery and pipeline problems. They have severely impacted supply in a state that already pays a premium for cleaner-burning fuel. “This is the worst it’s ever been for sure,” said Marie Montgomery, spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of Southern California. “This is pretty unprecedented. It’s terrible.” Chief among the immediate problems was a Monday power failure at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s refinery in Torrance. The refinery went back on line Friday, the company said. Other forces have been affecting the price of gas in California. A Chevron Corp. refinery in Richmond has been running at reduced capacity because of an Aug. 6 fire, and a pipeline that transports oil from Kern County to the San Francisco Bay Area was closed because of contamination. morrisdailyherald</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349731800186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:30:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349738016959-33</Id><Title>Republican lies.....more, again: Military Spending</Title><Msg>Romney says President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense would devastate our military.

Biodiesel is made up of 55 percent soybeans, 30 percent beef, pork and poultry fat and 15 percent recycled cooking oils. Potential retailers have the chance to be awarded grants to invest in equipment to build biodiesel pumps. The Nebraska Soybean Board is offering up to $60,000 per station for blending reimbursements. "What we're offering to do is to help them with the design and development of putting in a blender pump," Victor Bohuslavsky , the Nebraska Soybean Board executive director said. "Then we work out the program where they get a credit for a product that they go through or they use to help them get their investment back." In addition to the grant money, the board will provide technical assistance and monitoring. "The blending of the pumps at the station will help get more consumers to be able to use the product at different levels," Bohuslavsky said. "For example 5 percent- 2 percent levels they'd be utilizing." In 2011 the U.S. sold 1.1 billion gallons of the product. Next year, the board is expecting 1.3 billion gallons to be used.

The Government Accountability Institute (GAI), run by Stanford University research fellow Peter Schweizer, conducted an extensive, six-month investigation examining the potential for fraudulent and foreign funds being funneled to U.S. political campaigns via the Internet. The “alarming” results detailed in the report, GAI found, highlight “a serious and systemic threat to the integrity of the U.S. election system” that demands a full-scale investigation by federal authorities. The Obama campaign in particular warrants further scrutiny, the report and subsequent analysis by GAI’s lawyers determined, because it is the organization with the greatest potential to solicit and accept fraudulent and foreign donations online. The report suggests there is compelling evidence to suggest that the Obama campaign is not only breaking law, but also doing so deliberately. The Obama campaign oversees one of the most extensive and technologically sophisticated online fundraising operations in history, pulling in more than $500 million via the Internet in 2008, and hundreds of million dollars more during the current cycle. The vast majority of those donations were less than $200, and federal law does not require campaigns to collect information about the individual making such low-level donations: As of August, the Obama campaign has raised $138 million in such small donations. Furthermore, the campaign neglects to employ the most basic anti-fraud security measures to ensure that online donations are legitimate and only come from U.S. citizens, making it extremely vulnerable to fraudulent and illegal activity. A number of investigations into the campaign’s online fundraising efforts in 2008 found thousands of fraudulent small donations, many coming from fictitious persons. In one case, the campaign received $175,000 from Mary T. Biskup, a retired insurance manager from Missouri. Not only is that far above the legal limit for individual donations, Biskup denied making any contributions to the campaign. The lack of standard security features, such as card verification value (CVV) and address verification system (AVS), which are commonly used to verify the legitimacy of online credit card payments, is “incongruous with the acknowledged technological sophistication of the campaign,” the report states. Additionally, the campaign is willfully paying millions of dollars in higher processing fees by neglecting to install such basic verifications measures. Credit card issuers typically charge a 3.5 percent fee to process payments on websites that do not employ CVV or AVS. Not using these measures likely cost the Obama campaign about $7 million in additional processing fees in 2008, the GAI estimates. The campaign’s refusal to secure its online donations is “rather curious,” the report states, given that the campaign employs a number of technology experts who operate websites that use CVV for financial transactions. “Even more curious,” the report finds, is the fact that the Obama campaign does use CVV to authenticate purchases at its online merchandise shop. The Obama campaign has claimed the CVV method is unnecessary because it employs its own (undisclosed) techniques to weed out fraudulent donations. But as the report points out: “This begs the question: why is it using different techniques when it comes to selling campaign merchandise?”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752299305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:11:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349752553542-53</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Foreign Nationals Donating to Obama Campaign</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752299305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:11:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kenneth Sukhia, a Florida attorney retained by GAI to examine the legal implications of the report, wrote that the findings raise “legitimate questions as to a campaign’s knowing failure to use its best efforts to comply with the laws prohibiting foreign contributions.” In particular, the Obama campaign’s apparent willingness to pay millions of dollars to forgo basic online security measures raised serious questions about its motivations, the attorney stated. “It’s hard to imagine any campaign would pay extra for less security and marketing intelligence, unless it stood to benefit in some way from doing so,” Sukhia wrote. “There is reason to suspect that such decisions may be motivated by the belief that more money could be raised through foreign contributions than lost in added fees by declining security tools designed to stop them.” Because the Obama campaign employs a number of individuals that can reasonably be classified as experts in the field of online fundraising, and are presumably aware of the inherent security risks and legal restrictions, the campaign could ultimately be liable for knowingly soliciting and accepting foreign donations. “The law does not make it a crime to unintentionally or unknowingly receive contributions from foreign nationals,” the report notes. “But the law does not allow a person to cast a blind eye to the truth. In other words, no one can avoid responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring the obvious.” “It appears that if the Obama campaign has received and retained donations from foreign nationals,” Sukhia added, “the on-line Campaign team would be deemed to possess a high level of sophistication and expertise in this area and could not overcome the circumstantial evidence suggesting the knowing solicitation and receipt of such illicit finds.” Sukhia concurred with the report’s suggestion that a formal federal inquiry is warranted, finding “clear justification for further investigation” into whether the Obama campaign “disregarded their responsibility under [the law] to ensure that the Campaign is not knowingly soliciting contributions from foreign nationals.” The GAI plans to submit copies of the report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and several state attorney generals for review. The report’s findings are especially troubling for President Obama, who has repeatedly denounced the alleged influence of foreign funds in U.S. elections. “I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities,” he said during his 2010 State of the Union Address. The GAI report appears to provide amble impetus for a Congressional investigation in Obama’s campaign activities, something that could pose serious problems for the president if he is elected to a second term.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752553542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349752576986-54</Id><Title>PEW POLL TURNAROUND - Romney now UP by 4 pts.</Title><Msg>Prior to the debate PEW had Obama up by 8 pts.NOW PEW has Romney up by 4 pts.

In other words, no one can avoid responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring the obvious.” “It appears that if the Obama campaign has received and retained donations from foreign nationals,” Sukhia added, “the on-line Campaign team would be deemed to possess a high level of sophistication and expertise in this area and could not overcome the circumstantial evidence suggesting the knowing solicitation and receipt of such illicit finds.” Sukhia concurred with the report’s suggestion that a formal federal inquiry is warranted, finding “clear justification for further investigation” into whether the Obama campaign “disregarded their responsibility under [the law] to ensure that the Campaign is not knowingly soliciting contributions from foreign nationals.” The GAI plans to submit copies of the report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and several state attorney generals for review. The report’s findings are especially troubling for President Obama, who has repeatedly denounced the alleged influence of foreign funds in U.S. elections. “I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities,” he said during his 2010 State of the Union Address. The GAI report appears to provide amble impetus for a Congressional investigation in Obama’s campaign activities, something that could pose serious problems for the president if he is elected to a second term.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752721039</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:18:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349752791719-56</Id><Topic><Title>PEW POLL TURNAROUND - Romney now UP by 4 pts.</Title><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1349752576986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:16:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Real Clear Politics now has them tied in Florida and Ohio.That's based on an avg. of all major polls combined.</Msg><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1349752791719</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349752875888-57</Id><Title>General Motors is Alive—For Now</Title><Msg>A backroom deal hatched by General Motors during the auto bailout to fulfill the Obama administration’s demand for a quick bankruptcy could be reversed, draining the automaker of nearly all of its cash on hand and leaving it in worse shape than it was when it collapsed in 2009. As GM teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in June 2009, it cut a $367 million “lock-up agreement” with several major creditors in order to prevent its Canadian subsidiary from going under. The move spared the subsidiary from fulfilling the $1 billion debt it owed the creditors—major hedge funds—ensuring that GM would not have to face bankruptcy courts in two nations, which could have delayed the company’s recovery. The trustee for (old GM) creditors shortchanged by the government-driven bankruptcy are now suing the hedge funds in a move that could undo the bailout. “Many U.S. creditors waived their rights to object because the government wanted to push through the bailout for political reasons,” risk analyst Chris Whalen said. “If they had continued through normal channels, they could have easily been in bankruptcy for five years. So they made sure these issues were not adequately briefed before the court.” The GM that exited bankruptcy was radically different than the one that entered. The Treasury Department arranged for the company to split into Motors Liquidation Co., known as “old GM,” and created a “new GM” with the help of $30 billion from American taxpayers. Judge Robert Gerber, who approved the sale with little hesitation, could now reverse the entire auto bailout—and overturn one of President Barack Obama’s signature achievements. “When I approved the sale agreement and entered the sale approval order I mistakenly thought that I was merely saving GM, the supply chain, and about a million jobs. It never once occurred to me, and nobody bothered to disclose, that amongst all of the assigned contracts was this lock-up agreement, if indeed it was assigned at all,” Gerber said in July. Industry experts say GM should be very concerned with the judge’s reaction to the deal. “The judge has made it very clear that he is greatly dissatisfied with the process,” one analyst said. “He’s basically implying that GM hid it from him and that reopening the sale is a possibility.” More is at stake than the roughly $1 billion that “old GM’s” spurned creditors are seeking, according to industry observers. “The judge does not have a line item veto—he can’t just go in and take out money; he may have to reopen the entire bailout,” one bankruptcy expert, who requested anonymity because he has current business with the automaker, told the Washington Free Beacon. “If he reopens, everyone can come back and fight over how the bailout should have happened.” “It could unravel the entire settlement,” added a financier familiar with the situation. “They’d have to go back to the drawing board, wind back the clock to before the bailout.” In addition to the loss of taxpayer dollars, GM would face up to $30 billion in liabilities, according to another financial analyst.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752875888</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:21:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349752959395-58</Id><Topic><Title>General Motors is Alive—For Now</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752875888</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:21:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“When they did the bankruptcy they shed all liabilities on old GM. If you reopen the sale, the liabilities—creditor lawsuits, product liabilities, personal injury claims—they all come back.” If the court decides to reopen the bailout, new GM could cease to exist, according to the bankruptcy expert. Its stock would be removed from all stock exchanges and the company would have to repay the $27 billion it owes the federal government—a major problem considering the company has just over $30 billion in cash. “GM has plenty of cash, but that $30 billion doesn’t include their liabilities … Treasury would have to turn around and give the money right back,” a market observer said. “They’re burning through money right now. If they had to stop and repay Treasury, they’d cease to operate.” GM did not return requests for comment. President Obama pledged that the bailout would pull the company through bankruptcy in record time. The cash injection from Treasury accomplished that goal, but the corners GM cut to ensure a smooth transition left many parties unhappy. “They didn’t care about the company long-term,” risk analyst Whalen said. “The process was politically driven to be done as fast as possible, focused on securing short term support from the [United Auto Workers union].” The allegation of union favoritism has dogged the Obama administration throughout the auto bailout. In addition to General Motors Canada’s debt, Treasury faced similar charges while handling the bankruptcy of Delphi, GM’s independent parts supplier. “The government did a sloppy job with the bailout,” the bankruptcy expert said. “We have a fully functioning bankruptcy process based on centuries of common law, standard ways of doing things.” “The federal government didn’t want pension plans to bear any costs associated with traditional bankruptcies … and now you’re faced with this.” The Canadian and American governments played vital roles in the deal and pushed GM to negotiate as quickly as possible. “Officials from the U.S. and Canada were very much involved—they were in the building when the deal was being negotiated,” an insider familiar with the deal told the Washington Free Beacon. The Treasury Department did not return emails for comment. Investors have already expressed trepidation about putting money into GM. The lawsuit casts further doubt upon the future of the car company, the survival of which has been a key component of the Democratic ticket’s campaign: Vice President Joe Biden is fond of proclaiming “Osama bin Laden is dead and GM is alive” on the stump. However, if it is made to unwind the bailout, GM likely will be forced immediately into bankruptcy, which would leave it in a far worse position than it was before the 2009 bankruptcy. “You never want to free-fall into bankruptcy,” an industry insider said. “They went into bankruptcy in 2009 with a plan on getting out. If they were to enter it today, they couldn’t negotiate with creditors because everyone would be filing legal action against them.” GM’s own attorneys have admitted as much, saying in court documents that the lawsuit “could create a chaotic situation for GM Canada, spawn new litigation in other forums, and potentially provide a windfall to the noteholders.” GM’s stock has fallen nearly 40 percent since its record-setting IPO in 2010 after dismal European sales. In addition to owing U.S. taxpayers $27 billion, its lending arm, ResCap, a subsidiary of GM, has filed for bankruptcy after making risky gambles on the housing market. “We have Pandora’s Box on our hands,” said a financial analyst. “I guess that’s the nicest term I can find for clusterf—k.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349752959395</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:22:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349753069468-59</Id><Title>ObamaPhones Profiting ObamaDonors</Title><Msg>A wireless company profiting from the so-called “Obama phone” giveaway program is run by a prominent Democratic donor whose wife has raised more than $1.5 million for the president since 2007. Last week a video of a President Barack Obama supporter in Ohio claiming to have received a free phone from the president—“[Obama] gave us a phone!”—went viral, prompting media outlets to investigate. Since 1985 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has operated a program called Lifeline, originally designed to provide free landline phone service for low-income individuals. The government subsidizes telecommunications firms providing the service, and those firms also pass on costs to customers via the “Universal Service Charge” on their phone bills. The program expanded to include cell phones in 2008. That change has rapidly increased the cost to the federal government—$1.6 billion in 2011, up from $772 million in 2008. The number of Lifeline beneficiaries rose from 7.1 million to 12.5 million during the same period; cell phones account for roughly half of that 12.5 million. One of the major providers of the free cell phones—3.8 million subscribers as of late 2011—is Miami-based TracFone Wireless, a company whose president and CEO, Frederick “F.J.” Pollak, has donated at least $156,500 to Democratic candidates and committees this cycle, including at least $50,000 to the Obama campaign. Pollak’s wife, Abigail, is a campaign bundler for Obama who has raised more than $632,000 for the president this cycle, and more than $1.5 million since 2007. She has personally contributed more than $200,000 to Democratic candidates and committees since 2008. The Pollaks hosted Obama at their Miami Beach home in June for a $40,000-per-plate fundraising dinner, and hosted a similar event with Michelle Obama in July 2008. The couple personally donated a combined $66,200 to Obama’s reelection effort that year. Visitor logs indicate that Frederick and Abigail Pollak have visited the White House seven times. In 2009, the president appointed Abigail to serve on the “Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of the American Latino.” TracFone, a direct financial beneficiary of the Lifeline program, receives $10 a month for each subscriber in the form of federal subsidies. The company can make an additional profit selling extra minutes to Lifeline subscribers who exceed their monthly allowance of 250 prepaid minutes. TracFone and other wireless providers claim that revenue from selling additional minutes to Lifeline customers is low, but decline to publicly release such figures. The program’s rapidly increasing costs have attracted the attention of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and have prompted calls for reform. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.), for example, found that the program was “ripe for fraud.” In some cases, McCaskill noted in a December 2011 press release, the government was issuing multiple free phones to the same individuals. “I remain troubled by the expansive potential for the program to be abused, especially since Americans contribute to the program through their monthly phone bills,” McCaskill, who is up for reelection, wrote in a formal letter to the FCC. “The current requirements to determine eligibility often do not require customer documentation for participation in Lifeline, which may result in individuals receiving phones who should not be.” Rep. Tim Griffin (R., Ark.) has introduced legislation to restore the program to its originally intended purpose—providing landlines for use in emergencies—and stop the federal government from issuing free cell phones. Griffin told the Daily Caller he had heard reports of individuals receiving dozens of phones, some of which were of the expensive smartphone variety. The FCC in response to such pressure announced in February 2012 to reform the program and “reduce the potential for fraud while cutting red tape for consumers and providers.” TracFone, which did not return a request for comment, is the U.S. affiliate of America Movil, one of the largest phone service providers in Latin America. America Movil is one of many business ventures controlled by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, currently the world’s richest man, according to Forbes. Slim’s stake in the firm accounts for more than half of his $70 billion net worth. Slim—who bailed out the New York Times and is often referred to as “Mexico’s Mr. Monopoly”—has visited the White House at least twice, according to visitor logs.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349753069468</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:24:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349753162008-60</Id><Topic><Title>PEW POLL TURNAROUND - Romney now UP by 4 pts.</Title><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1349752576986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:16:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So are all the right wingers whining about the left leaning polls still whining?
