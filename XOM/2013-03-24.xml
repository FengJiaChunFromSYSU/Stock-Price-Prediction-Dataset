In its recently released annual environmental report, it states that its corporate facilities are now receiving 75% of their energy from renewables, and that some of its data centers are now 100% powered by renewable energy. “We’re committed to greening the grid wherever we have our facilities,” Scott Brodrick of Apple’s product marketing, stated in a interview with CNET. Among the recent improvements in sourcing was the creation of what was called “America’s largest end-user-owned onsite solar array,” at its data center in Maiden, North Carolina. The solar array there has a total capacity of 20 MW and will be joined in late 2013 by another 20 MW installation. Other improvements include: the use of biogas fuel cells at its headquarters, reducing the quantity of material used in many of its products, and beginning to use bio-based polymers in some of its products. Improvements have been made with regards to the issue of transparency as well. Speaking on that subject, Brodick said: “Over the past four years we’ve reported more comprehensively than any company in our industry, and we’ve done this by focusing not only on our facilities, which is what many other companies do, but also on our products.” Image Credits: Apple cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/03/23/apple-now-powered-75-by-renewable-energy-moving-towards-goal-of-100/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1364108512108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 03:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364135050240-2</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Now Powered 75% By Renewable Energy, Goal Of 100%</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1364108512108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 03:01:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>apple susks almost as much as MAX.
