I post here to help myself mesh with my wife’s level of hatred of the fossil fuel industry and her passion for environmental topics, not because someone is paying me. While she is reading on chemistry I like to have something to do. If I was talking with her and touching she would be very distracted and get nothing done. So I bash fossil fuels and idiotic speculators during such times and let her concentrate… For Sweden’s plans see: Energy Scenario for Sweden 2050, by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, a report funded by the Swedish government. Their task is an easy one, and they are assuming almost nothing in the way of technology transfer from Germany... They will easily surpass the 2050 goal. For Germany’s plans see: Max Planck Society’s and Fraunhofer Society’s websites. Those people are not in the business of wishful thinking. The EU is just doing what Germany and its allies want; when you think EU just think Germany…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366548842389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 08:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366558650334-3</Id><Title>OT---XOM reached good SELLING POINT---Friday.</Title><Msg>FYI</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1366558650334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 11:37:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366584673589-4</Id><Title>JUST LIKE 1929...no Buyers !!

The "Yen Carry Trade" gamblers will squeeze every single short out of the market with not only Bernanke free money, but now with the TBTF banksters' G-20 endorsing Abe's free money bet, the TBTF banks have a double-barreled betting machine at their disposal. All the Dow stocks will rally very hard, since the EuroTBTF banks will jump straight into the US market via DIA and SPY with their borrowed Yen to ride the debauched but rising dollar. Valuation, like Debt, doesn't matter in the New Paradigm. 'Fed balance sheet' is as meaningless as the tooth fairy.</Msg><Username>jjjinglehimersmith</Username><Timestamp>1366598975055</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 22:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
