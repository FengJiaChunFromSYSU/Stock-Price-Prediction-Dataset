Romney’s plan calls for lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. “Of course it is on the table. That is probably not going to survive to get that rate down to 25 percent,” Romney said of the oil industry tax breaks at the University of Denver event. He spoke after Obama reiterated his calls for nixing tax breaks for oil companies; Obama said Exxon Mobil doesn’t need the money. Romney noted that much of the incentives flow to smaller companies, not the industry’s behemoths like Exxon, before noting that the tax breaks would be on the table in his plan to lower rates overall. The former Massachusetts governor also pivoted to bashing the increased federal support that the Obama administration has provided to green energy companies. The 2009 stimulus law included tens of billions of dollars for alternative energy programs. Romney cited the bankruptcy of the California solar panel company Solyndra, which collapsed in 2011 after receiving a $535 million Energy Department loan guarantee in 2009, and also cited the woes of several other administration-backed companies. “I had a friend who said you don’t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers,” Romney said. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349327744271</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 01:15:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349328103122-4</Id><Topic><Title>Obama got smoked</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1349325123980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 00:32:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When Obama is off the teleprompter there are times when he sounds almost lazy,like he really doesn't even want the job.Tonight was like that.Romney acted like a man on a mission and Obama was just listless.

The privately held U.S. wind power developer plans to begin construction of the $250 million, 30-megawatt (MW) Block Island project by early 2014, ahead of a farm proposed by Cape Wind long expected to be the nation's first offshore facility. "The Block Island project is on target to become the nation's first offshore wind project," Deepwater CEO William Moore said. Deepwater submitted the final state and federal permit applications for Block Island on Tuesday. The project, powered by five Siemens 6-MW turbines, will generate enough electricity for about 10,000 homes in Rhode Island. A U.S. unit of UK power company National Grid PLC will buy power from the Block Island wind farm for its Rhode Island customers. The company is also planning other projects off the Atlantic Coast, with three 1,000-MW projects currently in the works, each capable of powering about 350,000 homes. Deepwater, majority-owned by New York investment firm DE Shaw and minority-owned by Boston-based wind developer First Wind, gained the advantage over other offshore wind developers after Rhode Island picked the in-state Providence-based company as its preferred developer. Rhode Island was not the first state to consider the clean energy prospects offered by offshore wind farms, but it moved decisively over the past few years after concluding offshore wind should be part of its energy mix. While privately held New England power company Energy Management Inc still hopes its long embattled 420-MW Cape Wind project in Massachusetts will be the nation's first utility-scale offshore wind farm, Deepwater expects its small wind farm, about three miles southeast of Block Island, will be a stepping stone to bigger projects. "With Block Island we are gaining real-time information on what it will cost to build the bigger project. That is a huge competitive advantage as we look to transition to the 1,000-MW (Deepwater Wind Energy Center) we are hoping to build in federal waters," Moore said. The company hopes to get the federal lease for the project by the first quarter of 2013. The Center will be built in Rhode Island Sound south of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. "There are other companies interested in that federal lease, but we have an advantage because of our prior selection by Rhode Island as their preferred developer," he said. The larger Deepwater project is anticipated to cost over $4 billion and will consist of 150 to 200 turbines connected via cables to both New England and New York. "By being tied into two grids, we avoid the business risk of a single-point interconnection, and we get to move energy other than our wind power over the lines," Moore said. The company bid the Deepwater project into the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) request for proposals for new energy sources for its customers on Long Island, New York. Moore said the Rhode Island Sound project would be competitive with a new natural gas plant built on Long Island and could be in service by 2018 when LIPA wants the new supply. LIPA was expected to decide on its request later in the autumn. EYES ON THE BIG APPLE With New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pressing to shut the 2,065-MW Indian Point nuclear power plant north of New York City in 2013 and 2015 when its two reactors' operating licenses expire, Deepwater has also proposed to build a 1,000-MW wind project, dubbed Hudson Canyon, in waters south of the city. Entergy Corp, the nuclear plant's owner, wants Indian Point to run for another 20 years and is seeking new licenses for the reactors from federal nuclear regulators. Cuomo set up the New York Energy Highway task force to upgrade and modernize the state's electric system, spur economic growth and create jobs. Eighty-five companies responded with 130 proposals totaling more than 25,000 MW. The task force expects to announce a plan in the autumn. "Most everyone in New York assumes that replacing Indian Point was one of the main reasons for the Energy Highway initiative," Moore said. Deepwater proposed two wind farms for the Energy Highway - Hudson Canyon, which would be connected to both New Jersey and New York City, and the Rhode Island Sound project. Hudson Canyon would also cost about $4 billion and provide New York City with competitively priced wind power and electricity from the PJM grid, Moore said. PJM, formerly known as the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland grid, is the nation's biggest power grid, serving more than 60 million people in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states from New Jersey to Illinois and the District of Columbia. "Even if Indian Point remains in service," Moore said, "the New York region is growing and will need new sources of energy, and it can't all be natural gas. "It is great to have cheap natural gas. However, even if investing in new renewables seems expensive compared to today's gas prices, you need to take a longer view," he said. Natural gas prices have averaged nearly $6 per million British thermal units over the last decade, but a boom in shale gas production helped drive prices to 10-year lows below $2 in April. Prices currently are in the $3.50 area. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349358713663</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:51:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349359761522-18</Id><Title>SAUDI and $85 + Oil ?</Title><Msg>anything lower could be trouble for Saudi ? or not ?</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1349359761522</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:09:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349362364599-19</Id><Topic><Title>XOM: Will It Make You A Millionaire?</Title><Username>hammondflowers21</Username><Timestamp>1349357665945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I simply love this post....</Msg><Username>rodriquezalden19</Username><Timestamp>1349362364599</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:52:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349365223537-20</Id><Title>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report October 4, 2012</Title><Msg>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report October 4, 2012 October 4, 2012 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending September 28, 2012.

Petti Fong Western Bureau Liberal leadership hopeful Justin Trudeau played up his western roots during a visit to B.C. with a strong and forceful opposition to the route of the controversial Northern Gateway pipeline. Trudeau, who is making a run across the country in his first days after announcing his leadership bid to take over the Liberal Party of Canada, said Enbridge, the Calgary-based energy company proposing to build the pipeline from Alberta to the west coast, needs a “better plan.” RELATED: Liberal leadership candidates step aside for Justin Trudeau PHOTOS: Justin Trudeau through the years “I don’t think the Enbridge pipeline is a good idea,” said Trudeau after a speech before nearly 1,000 supporters in Richmond. “If you’re going to build a project that goes through one of the most vulnerable and beautiful ecosystems in the world in the Great Bear Rainforest and bring in congested tanker traffic...you have to have a better plan than what it looks like Enbridge is putting forward.” Trudeau said his default position is “pipelines sure, but not there.” In the room Wednesday night, Trudeau’s mother, Margaret, the former wife of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was the second most popular figure among the crowd with supporters lining up to take pictures with her. “He’s going to do great running a national campaign,” Margaret Trudeau told the Toronto Star Wednesday. “People are really going to get the chance to see the kind of person he really is.” Justin Trudeau’s aunt, Betsy Dening, said her nephew’s roots run deep in British Columbia. As someone who has campaigned with her father, Liberal MP James Sinclair, and her brother-in-law, the former prime minister, Dening said her nephew will surprise many people. “He is much warmer than his father and can connect with people in a way that his father couldn’t,” said Dening. Former Canadian Alliance MP Joe Peschisolido who represented the Richmond riding after jumping ship to the Liberals a decade ago said Wednesday night that Trudeau is bringing new energy into the party that has lost its former strongholds. In the last election, Peschisolido ran again for the Liberals in the riding but came in third behind the Conservative and the NDP candidates. “He is giving very good speeches about the values we have as Liberals and as Canadians,” said Peschisolido. “I believe that Justin will be able to bring people together again and we need that as a party.” thestar</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349365885848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 11:51:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349373963176-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama got smoked</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1349325123980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 00:32:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He got smoked because it is impossible to defend liberalism when confronted with conservative ideas.

During September 2012, the average number of rigs actively drilling for natural gas in the GOM each week was more than double the average weekly count for September 2011, according to data provided by Baker Hughes Incorporated. Virtually all of these rigs were positioned in shallow water (water depth up to 500 feet). The higher shallow water natural gas rig count reflects, in part, the resumption of well permitting by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). According to BSEE, 162 applications for new shallow water wells have been submitted since the June 8, 2010 implementation of new safety and environmental standards (in response to the Macondo well blowout in April 2010). Of these (and an additional 20 applications submitted prior to June 8, 2010), only 6 were pending approval as of October 3, 2012. A second factor likely helping to boost shallow water GOM drilling activity is the comparatively high prices producers fetch for natural gas liquids extracted from the natural gas production stream. Overview: (For the Week Ending Wednesday, October 3, 2012)•Natural gas prices posted increases across the board for the report week (Wednesday to Wednesday). The Henry Hub closed at $3.21 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) yesterday, up 29 cents per MMBtu for the week. Other spot prices rose roughly between 20 and 40 cents per MMBtu. •On Thursday, the November 2012 New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) contract moved into the near-month position. It increased from $3.023 per MMBtu last Wednesday to close at $3.395 per MMBtu yesterday. It traded above most spot prices for the duration of the week. •Working natural gas in storage rose last week to 3,653 billion cubic feet (Bcf) as of Friday, September 21, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR). An implied storage build of 77 Bcf for the week moved storage levels 272 Bcf above year-ago levels. •The Baker Hughes Incorporated natural gas rotary rig count fell by 19 to 435 active units on the week ending September 28, after increasing the week before. The oil-directed rig count increased by 8 to 1,410 units. more summary data Prices: Natural gas prices rose across most spot market locations. Henry Hub rose from $2.92 per MMBtu last Wednesday to $3.21 yesterday, an increase of 29 cents per MMBtu, or 10 percent. Other trading points also generally increased, with most showing gains ranging from about 20 to 40 cents per MMBtu. Algonquin Citygate, which delivers natural gas to Boston, saw price gains at the higher end of the range, likely owing to cooling New England weather. It began the reporting week at $3.18 per MMBtu and ended at $3.59 per MMBtu, a gain of 41 cents per MMBtu, or 13 percent. The NYMEX futures price increased week-on-week, persistently above most spot prices. The NYMEX price rose from $3.023 per MMBtu last Wednesday to $3.395 per MMBtu yesterday. On Thursday, the first day of the November near-month futures contract, the NYMEX closed at $3.297 per MMBtu, 29 cents per MMBtu higher than the Henry Hub spot price. The futures price continued to climb throughout the week, peaking at $3.531 per MMBtu on Tuesday, and before dropping back to $3.395 per MMBtu yesterday. The 12-Month Strip (average of November 2012 to October 2013 contracts) gained 19 cents per MMBtu, starting at $3.578 per MMBtu last Wednesday and landing at $3.771 per MMBtu yesterday. Total demand for the report week showed an overall slight decrease. According to estimates from BENTEK Energy LLC (Bentek), overall natural gas consumption for the nation fell by 0.3 percent. Consumption in the industrial and residential/commercial sectors fell by 1.3 percent and 4.4 percent respectively, which was nearly offset by an increase in natural gas consumed for power generation, which increased by 2.7 percent. The Southeast, which is the region with the largest consumption of natural gas for power generation, burned 11.7 percent more gas this week than last week. Texas, the state with the largest consumption of natural gas for power, burned 12 percent less gas this week, although the net result was a week-on-week increase in total U.S. natural gas demand for power. Total supply for the report week showed a slight overall increase. Bentek estimates that overall supply, which averaged about 70.2 Bcf per day across the report week, rose by 0.3 percent, driven by a 0.2 percent rise in production. Imports from Canada increased by 1.0 percent, having a slight positive effect on overall supply. This was driven by the West, where imports were up 8.2 percent over the previous reporting week and 23.8 percent above this week last year. more price data Storage Working natural gas in storage increased to 3,653 Bcf as of Friday, September 28, according to EIA’s WNGSR. This represents an implied net injection of 77 Bcf from the previous week. This week’s injection was 1 Bcf below the 5-year (2007-2011) average injection of 78 Bcf, and 24 Bcf below last year’s injection of 101 Bcf. Inventories are currently 272 Bcf (8.0 percent) greater than last year at this time and 281 Bcf (8.3 percent) greater than the 5-year average. All three storage regions posted increases this week. Inventories in the East, West, and Producing regions increased by 42 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 47 Bcf), 8 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 9 Bcf), and 27 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 23 Bcf), respectively. In the Producing region, working natural gas inventories increased 13 Bcf (5.6 percent) in salt cavern facilities and increased 14 Bcf (1.5 percent) in nonsalt cavern facilities. Temperatures during the storage report week were 0.4 degrees cooler than the 30-year normal temperature and 3.4 degrees cooler than the same period last year. Temperatures in the lower 48 States averaged 64.3 degrees, compared to 67.7 last year and the 30-year normal of 64.7 degrees. While overall temperatures were a little cooler than normal, temperatures varied somewhat across Census divisions. In the Midwest, temperatures in the East North Central and West North Central Census divisions were cool, averaging 5.1 and 4.1 degrees cooler, respectively, than the 30-year normal. In the West, the Mountain and Pacific Census divisions were particularly warm, averaging 4.6 and 4.0 degrees warmer, respectively, than the 30-year normal. eia</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349374728555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:18:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349374780039-24</Id><Topic><Title>Natural Gas Weekly Update for Week Ending October 3, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349374728555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:18:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Weekly Coal Production Data for week ended September 29, 2012 Release Date: October 04, 2012 | Next Release: October 11, 2012 For the week ended September 29, 2012: •U.S. coal production totaled approximately 19.1 million short tons (mmst) •This production estimate is 1.3 percent lower than last week's estimate and 14.7 percent lower than the production estimate in the comparable week in 2011 •Coal production east of the Mississippi River totaled 8.1 mmst •Coal production west of the Mississippi River totaled 11.0 mmst •U.S. year-to-date coal production totaled 764.9 mmst, 5.4 percent lower than the comparable year-to-date coal production in 2011 •As of the week ending September 15, 2012, all of 2011 production has been revised to match the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) final 2011 production and second quarter 2012 production has been revised to match MSHA production.

But the industry hardly rushed to support the idea. In Wednesday's first presidential debate, the GOP nominee said the incentives would “probably” not survive if he succeeded in lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. The industry has battled Democratic efforts to strip incentives such as expensing of drilling costs and the ability to claim a lucrative deduction on domestic manufacturing income, arguing that nixing the breaks would stymie production. But industry groups on Thursday said they’re open to discussion of the incentives' fate in a wider tax overhaul, while stressing that the specific tax breaks are important to their members. “We welcome a discussion about broad tax reform that would lower the corporate tax rate and get rid of certain incentives. We just can’t give you a definite answer on what we would support and what we wouldn’t until we see a proposal. As they say, the devil could be in the details,” said Carlton Carroll, a spokesman for the America Petroleum Institute. John Felmy, the group’s chief economist, appeared more skeptical on a call with reporters Thursday. While Felmy noted the group is open to discussion, he added that removing incentives would have a disproportionate impact on smaller, independent firms, adding it would be “counterproductive” whether the tax rate is 25 percent or 35 percent. Some Democratic proposals on tax break repeal would target only industry giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The White House, however, wants to raise roughly $40 billion over 10 years with a plan that would hit “Big Oil” and, in some cases, independent producers. The White House plan would repeal the so-called percentage depletion allowance, which isn’t available to the major integrated companies, as well as repeal expensing of “intangible” drilling costs, which is fully available to independent companies and partially for the others, among other proposals. Julia Bell, a spokeswoman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said in response to Romney’s comments that “comprehensive tax reform is needed.” “But it has to be accompanied by lowering the individual rate as well as the corporate rate, because many of America’s independent producers are small businesses that file as individuals or pass-through entities in the tax code,” she said. Kevin Book of the energy consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners, in a note, reiterated the company’s view that GOP control of the House, Senate and White House could still leave some tax breaks for major, integrated oil companies at risk. “At last night’s debate, Gov. Romney appears to have confirmed our thinking,” said Book, the firm’s managing director. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349376313193</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:45:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349376627921-27</Id><Title>Alaska-to-Asia natural gas pipeline plan timeline set</Title><Msg>Alaska-to-Asia natural gas pipeline plan timeline set By Zack Colman - 10/04/12 12:53 PM ET Three energy producers agreed on a plan Wednesday for a pipeline that would send Alaskan natural gas originally intended for the Lower 48 states to Japan and South Korea. Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, BP and pipeline firm TransCanada Corp. set a timeline for constructing one of the world’s largest natural gas pipelines, a $65 billion endeavor that would pump Alaska’s North Slope natural gas reserves to a port in the state's southern coast for export to Asia. The project puts the administration’s role in exporting natural gas back in focus, as it would need to approve pacts with South Korea and Japan. The administration sets a higher threshold for deals with countries that lack a free-trade agreement with the United States, such as Japan. So far, the administration has approved one non-free-trade agreement export, with 12 others still under review. The federal government set aside loan guarantees for pipeline construction when the North Slope’s natural gas was destined for the Midwest. But the flush of domestic natural gas reduced the need for that pipeline, in turn locking the North Slope’s reserves in Alaska. Now, Alaskans and their congressional delegation see the pipeline to Asia as the state’s best bet for making use of their reserves. “No other single project is as important to Alaska’s economic future as a gas line, so it’s critical that the state and the producers move quickly to take advantage of the potentially limited window of opportunity to sell gas into the Asian market,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in a Thursday statement. After years of silence, the Energy Department has seen an influx of natural gas export applications. Noting the trend, an Energy official told the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in November 2011 that the department must recognize that the “cumulative impact” of such exports “could pose a threat to the public interest.” And a federal law specific to North Slope exports requires the president to determine that “such exports will not diminish the total quantity or quality nor increase the total price of energy available to the United States.” Robert Dillon, Republican spokesman for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said the North Slope’s reserves are cut off from the Lower 48 states, so exporting it would have not affect prices there. He said natural gas export agreements are supposed to be judged by their effects on local conditions. Dillon also said the glut of natural gas in the Lower 48 has “changed the paradigm” there, making exporting North Slope gas more feasible. “There may be some squawking,” Dillon said. “But we believe exports are good for the economy ... and Alaska gas is stranded.” The energy companies still have many hurdles to overcome before they file an export application with the Energy Department. They still hope Alaska will reduce tax rates on natural gas production — which is taxed at the same level as oil — before proceeding with the financing stage. It also is unclear whether project backers will ask for public funding, despite the cost of the effort more than doubling since it was initially proposed, Dillon said. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349376627921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:50:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349376996496-28</Id><Title>EOX Emerald Oil doji on the bottom.
