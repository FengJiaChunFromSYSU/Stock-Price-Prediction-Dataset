The Brazilian and Argentine corn - mainly being used in Virginia and North Carolina as chicken and hog feed - is expected to keep flowing northward until September, when the new U.S. crop starts being harvested, they said. After the worst drought in decades parched the Midwest farm belt in 2012, U.S. commercial-use corn stocks are thinner than they have been since the 1990s. This is bad news for pork, poultry and beef producers facing historically high prices for corn-based animal feed. "The United States bought about 1.5 million tonnes of corn from South America between September 2012 and February 2013. That was mainly Brazilian corn," said a trader at a major exporting company, who asked not to be identified. "In the second half of the corn year, between March and August, the United States will buy 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes, mainly from Argentina. Eighty percent of this volume has been closed but not executed yet. The balance will be closed soon," said the trader, who has direct knowledge of the transactions. The data was confirmed by a Buenos Aires-based grains broker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Both said they did not anticipate a repeat of such big northbound trades next year, as U.S. corn stocks are expected to recover. "These days, Argentina is one of the cheapest sources of corn in the world," the broker said. "We expect to keep seeing Argentine corn go to the United States through June, when Brazil will take over again as the source through August." The U.S. government expects 3.2 million tonnes of corn imports this season, with Canada providing reutersDOTcom/article/2013/05/15/argentina-corn-usa-idUSL2N0DW2FR20130515 Cash c</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368769162027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 01:39:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368796365079-2</Id><Title>Sulfate aerosols cool climate less than assumed</Title><Msg>14.05.13 Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany “Sulfur dioxide is as antagonist of greenhouse gases less effective than previously assumed. It forms sulfate aerosol particles in the air, which reflect sunlight, and as so-called cloud condensation nuclei influence the chemical processes within clouds. Therefore, sulfate aerosol particles help to cool the earth, making them an important factor in climate models. However, a team around researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry found out that it is likely most models overestimate the cooling effect of these particles. The reason is a largely disregarded reaction pathway catalysed by mineral dust within clouds, which has a strong influence on the life span of sulfate aerosol particles and their ability to reflect sunlight.” “Harris’ measurements showed that sulfate in clouds forms mostly through the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by oxygen (O2). This reaction is catalysed by so-called transition metal ions (TMI) like iron, manganese, titanium or chromium. In addition, sulfate production mostly occurred in cloud droplets which formed on large mineral dust particles, the most important source of transition metal ions. Much less often the trail led to the oxidation of SO2 by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3). “As my colleagues and I compared the basic assumptions of climate models with my results we were very surprised, because only one of twelve models considers the role of transition metal ions in the formation of sulfate”, says the scientist, who is now working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA. Instead, most of the models used the alternative pathways of sulfur dioxide oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ozone (O3) and the hydroxyl radical (OH)”</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368796365079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:12:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368796557553-3</Id><Topic><Title>Oil Bulls, Russian Pacific Fleet Warships Enter Mediterranean, oil price spike coming</Title><Username>yainvestor2</Username><Timestamp>1368720443541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:07:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Total nonsense The Russian move (plus arming Israel's enemies with advanced S-300 surface to air missiles) makes war less likely, not more.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368796557553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368799529601-4</Id><Title>Rosnets</Title><Msg>Am I right here,,, is XOM doing a deal with Rosnefts on the North Slope in Alaska?</Msg><Username>whisperingpines1962</Username><Timestamp>1368799529601</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368799811569-5</Id><Title>Deutsche und Russisch waffen für die Moslem welt</Title><Msg>--Krauss-Maffei main battle tanks for Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries --German infantry arms, armored personnel carriers, and warships for Saudi Arabia and other Persian gulf states --Russian S-300 SAMs and other weaponry --and now Russian nuclear submarines, destroyers, and frigates, etc under the Russian flag to keep the peace.
