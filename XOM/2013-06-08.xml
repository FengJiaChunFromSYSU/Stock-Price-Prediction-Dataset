The two will get together Friday to discuss the idea of shipping oil from Alberta as far east as Saint John in their continued efforts to promote a development they say will bring jobs and ensure greater energy security for the country. Their meeting comes a week after the government of B.C. told a federal review panel that the Northern Gateway pipeline should not go ahead as it’s proposed – a declaration that Mr. Alward says could lift his case, though not at the expense of that project. “It brings into focus the importance of this project,” Mr. Alward said Thursday in an interview. “We need to see a project in British Columbia as much as we need to see a project go all the way to the East Coast because we need to see opportunities for diversified markets.” Ms. Redford will deliver a speech to the New Brunswick legislature Friday morning before heading to Saint John to speak with the city’s board of trade and tour the Irving Oil refinery, Canada’s largest. Her visit comes four months after Mr. Alward conducted a similar trip to Alberta, where he toured the oil sands. “I’m looking forward to her message about the potential of the pipeline and why she believes, just as I do, that it makes sense, not only for our two provinces, but for all Canadians,” Mr. Alward said. The meeting also comes before a June 17 deadline by TransCanada Corp. to receive binding commitments from oil producers.
