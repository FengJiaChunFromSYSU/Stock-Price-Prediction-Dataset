The B.C. Premier’s Aug. 3 address was one of her few public appearances since she returned from the Halifax premiers’ conference in late July. Outside the Delta hotel, a dozen reporters and camera crews waited to question her about the proposed Enbridge pipeline: an issue that had come to define Ms. Clark in recent weeks and which many Liberal partisans see as their best hope for re-election. After Ms. Clark confidently strode to the microphone in Halifax and demanded a cut of Alberta cash as one of five conditions even to consider allowing the oil pipeline across her province – many expected her tough talk to continue, and for her to outline her next steps. But back home, Ms. Clark has ceded the stage to Alberta Premier Alison Redford and the federal government; Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his senior B.C. minister, James Moore, spoke to local media in the past week about how important the pipeline project is to Canada’s future. Ms. Redford is expected to address the issue at a Vancouver conference on Monday. But when Ms. Clark’s Delta speech ended, she scurried out the back door into a window-tinted van with an RCMP driver while reporters clustered around what turned out to be a decoy vehicle in front. Have things got so bad for the Liberals that their leader is consigned to getaway cars? Poll results since the Halifax meetings continue to be grim, and questions about Ms. Clark’s leadership – temporarily dormant – have resurfaced. “There are always some people grumbling,” said former attorney-general Barry Penner, who stepped aside from the Clark government earlier this year. “But I hear a lot of people expressing concern, especially among business people. They ask me: ‘What’s going on? What’s going to happen?’ It’s clear that this government has a steep hill to climb.” Former solicitor general Kash Heed, now a Liberal backbencher and an independent voice within caucus, was one of those mystified by Ms. Clark’s decision not to capitalize on her strong performance at the premiers’ meeting. “As a leader, when you bring such public notice to these kind of contentious issues, you need to be around to explain your rationale,” Mr. Heed said. “It’s the people of B.C. who are going to vote for you. They’re the ones who are going to choose the next premier.” The Liberals are in more political trouble than ever before in the 11 years they have governed the province, most of them under Gordon Campbell. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/christy-clarks-vanishing-act-follows-enbridge-pipeline-posturing/article4475904/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344749543000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 01:32:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344752505000-2</Id><Title>New Solar Power Design Inspired by Telescope Could Produce Twice the Energy</Title><Msg>New Solar Power Design Inspired by Telescope Could Produce Twice the Energy August 9, 2012 By Nathan 6 Comments Researchers have designed a new solar power module that uses a curved mirror to focus sunlight onto a 5-inch glass ball that then spreads the light evenly across a solar panel, leading to twice the power output of traditional solar panels when combined with high-efficiency solar cells. The design was inspired by telescope technology and the high-efficiency solar cells used by space agencies. The module also tracks the sun and rotates with it to increase its efficiency. The whole module is mounted on a steel 10-ft by 10-ft rotating frame that moves with the sun. “The tracker is fully automated,” Blake Coughenour, a graduate student in the UA’s College of Optical Sciences, explained. “The system wakes itself up in the morning and turns to the East. It knows where the sun will rise even while it’s still below the horizon. It tracks the sun’s path during the day all the way to sunset, then parks itself for the night.” One of the most interesting parts of the system is the mirror. The researchers came up with a dish-shaped mirror design that works very well for concentrating sunlight specifically for photovoltaics, as opposed to a solar thermal system. “Most mirrors used in solar power plants are used for thermal generation by focusing light onto a long pipe used to heat water into steam. This requires the mirrors to be shaped like a cylinder. What we have learned here at the Mirror Lab is how to bend the glass to high accuracy so as to focus to a point or a line.” The panels are created out of solar cells that are usually only used in spacecraft. These cells capture a wider range of the solar spectrum than regular cells. The ball lens is coated to maximize transparency for the suns rays. When put together with the mirrors, this system works very well to concentrate light on the the solar cells, but it also concentrates a bunch of heat. So the researchers designed a cooling system consisting of fans and a radiator that keeps the array within 36 degrees of the outdoor temperature. Since the heat generated is itself a valuable resource the researchers are also “working on a way to use the mirrors to create an eco-friendly furnace that works like a toaster oven to burn a mold into a flat sheet of glass.” From tests done by the researchers, a tracker featuring two mirrors generates enough energy to power two homes, but they hope to place eight mirrors on each module. They say that “an array of sun trackers on an area measuring about seven by seven miles (11 x 11 km) would generate 10 GW of power during sunshine hours – as much as a big nuclear power plant. This technology has a lot going for it that makes it super promising.” “Unlike conventional power plants that use steam to power turbines, Angel’s photovoltaic prototype uses no water, making it especially suitable for desert regions,” the University of Arizona reports. ”The materials are cheap to produce and by concentrating sunlight with mirrors the plant’s footprint is smaller than that of PV panel-based plants.” Source: University of Arizona Image Credits: Blake Coughenour http://cleantechnica.com/2012/08/09/new-solar-power-design-inspired-by-telescope-could-produce-twice-the-energy/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344752505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 02:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344780923000-3</Id><Topic><Title>New Solar Power Design Inspired by Telescope Could Produce Twice the Energy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344752505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 02:21:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome improvement.

The announcement was made by Denise Bode, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) at the National Clean Energy Summit in Los Vegas, Nevada. So far this year, according to the AWEA, 2,800 megawatts (MW) of wind, along with 1,400 wind turbines have been installed across the US, helping the wind industry reach this fantastic achievement. Many of the new installations have come from new projects in Nevada, Idaho, Iowa, Hawaii Oklahoma, and California. Some of the key projects that are going in across six of these states, according to the AWEA include: Pattern Energy’s Spring Valley wind farm, 30 miles east of Ely, Nevada (151.8 MW) Enel Green Power North America’s Rocky Ridge wind farm in Oklahoma (148.8 MW) enXco’s Pacific Wind project in Kern County, California (140 MW) Utah Associated Municipal Power’s Horse Butte project in Idaho (57.6 MW) First Wind’s Kaheawa Wind II wind farm in Hawaii (21 MW) What has occurred in the wind industry with the US reaching that plateau is quite remarkable. Consider the following: Between 1981 and 2003, 5 GW of wind power was generated. That number doubled to 10 GW by 2006, then 25 GW by 2008, and now 50 GW in 2012. Nuclear energy was the last new energy technology to reach 50 GW, done in the late 1970’s and 1980’s. The next question you are going to wonder is how much 50 GW of wind energy gets you. This beautiful infographic below, supplied by the AWEA, shows just how much impact 50 GW of wind power can do: The most interesting fact I found out from this infographic was that wind potential is enough to take out coal power plants in the US. 50 GW of wind provides the same amount of energy as 44 coal fire power plants, or 11 nuclear power plants. The future potential to move at a lighting-fast pace and replace these sunset energy sources is very realistic, especially when you consider that 39 states now have utility-sized wind farms, according to the AWEA. Politicians were pleased with the US wind energy’s latest milestone. “This milestone for wind-energy production marks continued success for this clean, renewable and domestically produced energy source,” said Republican Senator Chuck Grassley in a statement. “Wind energy has exceeded expectations since I first authored the tax incentive, in 1992, and offers an ideal for expanded production and use of alternative energy sources in the future.” “It is amazing that 50,000 megawatts of our nation’s power is generated from clean and affordable wind energy,” Oklahoma Republican Frank Lucas Said. http://cleantechnica.com/2012/08/10/us-reaches-50-gw-of-wind-energy-capacity-in-q2-of-2012</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344812375000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344812385000-9</Id><Topic><Title>US Reaches 50 GW of Wind Energy Capacity in Q2 of 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344812375000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:59:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“This is a very big milestone for the wind industry, and I am proud the Rocky Ridge Wind Project has contributed to this great success. As a leader of Congress, representing Oklahoma’s Third Congressional District, I have supported the wind energy in the past, and I will continue to support it in the future,” he said. The impact of the wind industry isn’t just on the environment but also economically, on the domestic level. Most of the capacity growth has come from turbines made in the USA, around 60%, according to the statement. Mike Garland, CEO of Pattern Energy in the statement also agreed with the positive economic impact the wind industry has had. “We’re very proud that Spring Valley Wind is not only Nevada’s first wind power facility but also helps America reach 50 gigawatts of clean wind generation.” “Spring Valley Wind brought over 250 jobs to Nevada and will now power up to 45,000 local homes with zero emissions. This project will also generate significant tax revenue and community benefits for decades to come, demonstrating that wind energy is a meaningful long-term investment in the economic health of local communities.” However, uncertainty about the Production Tax Credit (PTC), credited for spurring the development of the domestic wind industry, has plagued wind developers and threatens jobs, according to Denise Bode: “These truly are the best of times and could be the worst of times for American wind power,” “This month we shattered the 50-gigawatt mark, and we’re on pace for one of our best years ever in terms of megawatts installed. But because of the uncertainty surrounding the extension of the Production Tax Credit, incoming orders are grinding to a halt,” “Layoffs have begun up and down our American manufacturing supply chain, which the industry has so proudly has built up in support of the U.S. economy and made-in-the USA manufacturing. And when incoming orders stop, so do factories. Congress must act now to give wind energy a stable business environment to keep producing all this homegrown power, and save 37,000 American jobs by the first quarter of next year.” However, hope is on the horizon, as the Senate Finance Committee on August 7th passed the “Family and Business Tax Cut Act.” The act would help extend the PTC, vital for further industrial growth. Overall, 50GW of wind electricity capacity is something to be celebrated by everyone.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344812385000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
