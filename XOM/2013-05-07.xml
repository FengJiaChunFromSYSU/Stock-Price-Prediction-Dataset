Produced by clean energy investment firm Armstrong Asset Management, the report entitled, Entering a New Phase of Growth: Renewable Energy in SE Asia, analysed the region for its potential for renewable energy, citing opportunities in solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, hydro and biomass or biogas, and interest from both debt and equity providers to invest in them. Compared to the price for power generation from marginal fossil fuel on an unsubsidised base, renewable energy offers Southeast Asia clean and secure power at fixed long-term rates that are lower in price. Here is an overview of the report’s findings, together with some highlights of the investment opportunities and why renewable energy is worth investing on. Some key points first: •It is now cheaper to produce renewable energy in some Southeast Asia countries than bulk grid power from imported natural gas and fuel oil; •The cost advantage of renewable energy continues to grow in SE Asia as pricing, environmental and security risks associated with imported fossil fuels are more accurately evaluated; •SE Asia has excellent renewable resources but rely on a high level of fuel oil for power generation due to their sprawling geographies and inadequate grid infrastructure; •ASEAN-5 (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia) will need to install between 168 and 192GW of new power generation capacity by 2025 to maintain its projected economic growth rate of 5.8%; •Governments in all Southeast Asian markets are significantly expanding their commitment to renewable energy as a proportion of the energy mix. From 2000 through 2006, however, the emerging markets of ASEAN-5 generally adopted a cautious approach to the development of renewable eco-businessDOTcom/opinion/renewable-energy-cheaper-imported-gas-and-oil/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367903958307</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 01:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367910818071-2</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Cowards Ban Guns Inside Convention.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1367891217948</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 21:46:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only FACT I can see is that "Guns are not allowed inside the convention" and yet, even THAT is of no surprise, as weapons are USUALLY banned by Insurance companies in virtually ALL meetings of this size.

As always, since you've got nothing else. Fact: “North Carolina State law prohibits the carrying of firearms in the Charlotte Convention Center, and the Time Warner Cable Arena,” the sign outside the convention hall reads. “In addition, the Rules and Regulations of the Charlotte Convention Center prohibit the carrying of firearms in the Center. And, from the NRA: "The large size of our event and the fact that many of the largest convention centers are in some of the most restrictive cities leaves us with relatively few convention centers large enough to accommodate the Annual Meetings. In an effort to provide all NRA members a better opportunity to attend the Annual Meetings, it is important that we move the event around the country as much as possible. While we will not consider bringing the Annual Meetings to a city with gun laws we feel are restrictive, we must however deal with convention centers that have restrictions simply because there are so few convention centers that both allow conceal carry and are large enough to host all of the events that comprise the Annual Meetings." Truth seems to be a problem for you, as always.

Russia has long dominated the market for natural gas in the Eastern hemisphere, with Iran being another major supplier. But booming production in the United States presents an opportunity to undercut those countries by selling more natural gas abroad, including to allies like Japan and India, boosters say. Supporters of increased exports are increasingly citing the geopolitical benefits as they try to win over Democrats, many of whom fear shipping more natural gas abroad would cause price increases back home. The issue will be front and center on Tuesday during a hearing of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that will feature testimony from two former Democratic senators — Byron Dorgan (N.D.) and Bennett Johnston (La.). Rep. Lee Terry (R-Neb.), who serves on the subcommittee, said the geopolitical aspect of the export debate has the potential to bring the two parties together. Terry was part of a bipartisan coalition of current and former lawmakers that met over the weekend with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. He said the Turkish officials indicated they would buy natural gas from the United States — instead of from Iran — if they had the option. “He told us that, if the U.S. would sell them natural gas, then he would buy it today, and he wouldn’t have to buy it from anywhere else,” Terry said of Yildiz. “That’s a way we can shore up an ally in an unstable region that we need as an ally.” The House hearing on Tuesday will touch on 20 proposals under Energy Department (DOE) review that would green light exports to nations that lack a free-trade agreement with the United States.

Jacobs and Jean Chemnick, E&amp;E reporters Greenwire: Monday, May 6, 2013 U.S. EPA will return to court tomorrow to defend its regulations for fighting climate change from multiple challenges by Texas and industry groups. At issue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit are two cases that center on EPA's implementation of greenhouse gas air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act after the agency determined the emissions endangered public health. Both center on EPA's efforts to review state permitting programs for planned major facilities to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions were considered along with other pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. In one case, Texas, Wyoming and several major industry groups argue that EPA rushed its review of the so-called state implementation plans, or SIPs, and "coerced" states into complying by threatening a ban on construction of new facilities. In the second, Texas is challenging EPA's decision to retroactively revoke its SIP because the Lone Star State refused to add greenhouse gases to its permitting program. The petitions are part of a concerted effort by opponents of EPA greenhouse gas regulations to win back some of the territory they have lost since 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that EPA must consider regulating heat-trapping emissions under the Clean Air Act, as well as subsequent similar rulings. The first case comes from a broad industry coalition, including the Utility Air Regulatory Group and National Mining Association. When EPA began regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act in 2010, the agency issued its "tailoring rule" -- providing a way for large stationary emitters to be phased into coverage.

The Democrats freely admitted their reason for their program that led to the wars with Mexico, Spain, and eventually across the Pacific in the Philippines: “Manifest Destiny.” Certainly it made no difference to the Democrats what actions Mexico took, except to provide a convenient pretext for war at the slightest provocation - and Mexico was deliberately provoked. The Democrats wanted Texas and the states they carved out of Mexico and whatever else they could conquer south of the Mason-Dixon line, so they could make slave states out of them. The motive was to advance the liberty and freedom of slaveholders. The beacon of freedom &amp; liberty in action. Personal profit combined warmonger, glossed over with self-righteousness. “Also, not being neutral is not the same thing as starting a war.” My statement is selling weapons to belligerents in a war was not very neutral. The meaning of the list is clearly stated: it is not a list of wars, but a list of actions not useful for world peace and harmony. You ignorance and inability to comprehend basis English is just appalling. No country gets perfect marks looking in hindsight but the US has done the best at expanding freedom and prosperity in the world…. irrelevant, unless one chooses to accept US justifications for its actions, and few outside the USA do. Hindsight is irrelevant too: feckless and or warmongering behavior in instance after instance when national gain, political profit, or the profit of some interest group is at hand is the point. That is sufficient to refute the totally nonsensical propaganda interpretation of the USA’s actions across its 200 years – one meant for American school children to encourage military enlistment, but unconvincing to most people on this planet. In the end you will get no support no matter how much you demand it. Carry on with your war plans and attitude and see where it gets you.

Here’s one of the latest, courtesy sister site Green Building Elements and Business Wire: NRG Energy, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary NRG Solar, announced that it will commemorate the opening of the Alpine Solar Generating Facility in Lancaster, Calif., at a ribbon-cutting event [late last week]. The 66 megawatt (AC) Alpine solar photovoltaic facility, which started commercial operations earlier this year, is currently the largest fully operational solar plant in California. The cost-competitive, renewable power generated by the facility is being sold to PG&amp;E under a 20-year power purchase agreement. “The opening of Alpine marks a dramatic shift in the way energy is generated in California,” said Randy Hickok, senior vice president of NRG Solar. “As the largest operating photovoltaic facility in the state, Alpine is not only providing PG&amp;E with a renewable source of energy, but contributing to cleaner air and a smaller carbon footprint for the state, ultimately helping meet California’s renewable portfolio standards.” Located in northern Los Angeles County, Alpine will generate enough energy to meet the annual needs of approximately 53,000 homes at peak daytime capacity. Because the facility produces electricity without fossil fuels, it helps avoid the annual emission of 36,000 tons of carbon into the atmosphere, or the equivalent of taking 6,600 cars off the road. Alpine is one of eight large-scale photovoltaic solar facilities owned by NRG that currently produces clean solar power for thousands of homes and businesses in three states. The other seven completed or partially completed plants are Agua Caliente (under construction) and Avra Valley in Arizona; Roadrunner in New Mexico; and Avenal, Blythe, Borrego and cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/05/07/largest-solar-pv-facility-in-california-opens/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367950967035</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 14:22:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367951545829-12</Id><Title>Green On-The-Go: A Portable Solar-Powered Electrical Outlet</Title><Msg>Jeff Spross on May 6, 2013 at 3:57 pm Mother Nature Network just flagged a fun diversion in the solar technology world: the Window Socket. It’s a portable solar charger, roughly the size of a hockey puck, which uses a suction cup to attach to any available window. It also has a standard electrical plug — though right now it’s only the European standard — so once it’s done charging you can plug an appliance into it right there on the window, or carry it around as a portable electrical outlet. Obviously, the device would be most useful on a trip, in a plane, a bus, a car, or outdoors — circumstances in which an outlet might be hard to come by. Besides the lack of an American outlet version, the Window Socket also has a few weaknesses. It takes five to eight hours to charge completely, which is a serious chunk of time, especially in travel situations — though it lasts ten hours after that. Furthermore, as Mother Nature Network notes, the design currently doesn’t deliver enough power for anything other than small electrical devices: As pointed out by more than a few commenters — the device’s initial appearance over at Yanko Design impressively garnered more than 300 comments — the big drawback here aside from the slow charge time is that the Window Socket’s battery is currently at 1000mAh which isn’t enough juice to really power anything save for a smartphone or other low-voltage mobile gadget. Though again, if travel situations are what’s primarily under discussion here, than enough juice for your smartphone may be all you need. And presumably, further improvements in technology will bring down the charge time and boost the power delivery. Other developments in the world of portable solar power include roll-up panels for the military, and a new ultra-thin solar panel design that may be able to fit directly on smartphones and other such devices. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/05/06/1969471/green-on-the-go-a-portable-solar-powered-electrical-outlet/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367951545829</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 14:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367967197923-13</Id><Topic><Title>☛☛☛HEY NUTJOBs....just like 1929...ZERO technical buying ! bwhahahahaha!</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1367945595434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:53:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Figured it out yet, dummy ?</Msg><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1367967197923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367972188930-14</Id><Title>★★★★HEY BERNANKE..Your "experiment" should have stopped 8 months ago !</Title><Msg>set-up for complete DISASTER....</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1367972188930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:16:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367972629162-15</Id><Title>Gas industry accuses EPA of procedural rush</Title><Msg>Julian Hattem - 05/07/13 06:23 PM ET The oil and gas industry is accusing the Obama administration of side-stepping its procedural rules and rushing a regulation on auto emissions. In the letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) accused the watchdog of violating portions of the Clean Air Act that require new rules to be published in the Federal Register, the government's official ledger for regulations and notices, before accepting comments from the public and holding public hearings. The proposal on auto emissions, which would require that refiners cut gasoline's sulfur content by more than 60 percent by 2017, was announced by the agency in March, but has not yet been published in the Federal Register. However, a supplemental notice was published in April announcing public hearings and the agency's acceptance of comments through June 13. "What EPA did was issue a pre-publication version and then start the comment deadline before the rule made it to the Federal Register," explained Patrick Kelly, the API's downstream senior policy adviser. "What they're doing is rushing the process in order to shorten the time for industry to be able to provide meaningful comment." In April, the EPA held two hearings on the proposal, in Philadelphia, Pa., and Chicago, Ill. The API testified at both to express its concerns about the procedural issues and its opposition to the rule. "There's a lot of justification that EPA has purportedly included that we've had scant time to review," added Kelly, who asserted that the EPA should accept comments for 90 days after formally publishing the rule, given the proposal's 938 pages. "A 37-day comment period, assuming the proposal was published today, would not be enough, and would subvert our statutory procedural rights," API Downstream Group Director Robert thehillDOTcom/blogs/regwatch/energyenvironment/298363-gas-industry-accuses-epa-of-procedural-rush</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367972629162</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:23:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367973659126-16</Id><Title>Gun crime plunges, though most Americans think it has risen</Title><Msg>(Reuters) - Gun-related homicides and other crimes involving guns have fallen sharply over the last two decades in the United States, but most Americans believe firearms crime is higher now than 20 years ago, according to an analysis and a separate poll released on Tuesday. Some 11,101 gun-related homicides were reported in the United States in 2011, a figure that is down 39 percent from the 1993 peak, the Justice Department reported. Nonfatal firearm crimes declined by 69 percent to 467,300 in the same period. Amid an intense national debate about gun control - which flared anew in the wake of a December shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 26 people dead - some 56 percent of Americans believe that gun crime is higher now than it was 20 years ago, the Pew Research Center said its poll showed. Only 12 percent of Americans realize that gun crimes have fallen, the center said in a statement. The Pew survey was based on a March 14-17 survey of 924 adults and had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points. The drop in gun crime mirrors a general fall in U.S. violent crime. The Justice Department study found that for fatal and nonfatal firearm crimes, most of the decline occurred from 1993 to 2002. In 2011, about 70 percent of homicides and 8 percent of nonfatal violent crimes, such as rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault, were committed with a firearm, mainly a handgun. From 2007 to 2011, about 1 percent of victims in nonfatal violent crimes reported using a firearm to defend themselves. The Justice Department findings were based on data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, and the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1367973659126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367975175783-17</Id><Title>Mark Sanford Proves How Hypocritical And Dumb South Carolinians Are..</Title><Msg>They Re- Elect a liar, a cheat and one who violates tone of you christians right wingers biblical rules.
