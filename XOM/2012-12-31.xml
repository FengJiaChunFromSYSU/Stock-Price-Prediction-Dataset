MANAMA - Saudi Arabia will need to reduce fuel subsidies that are becoming an ever-greater fiscal burden as its population grows, a former adviser to the country's oil minister said. The world's biggest exporter of crude has a domestic fuel subsidy bill exceeding SR162 billion ($43 billion) a year, according to Mohammad Al Sabban, an independent Saudi-based economist and energy consultant. Citigroup said in a report on September 4 that the kingdom may need to import oil by 2030 if its domestic crude use continues to outpace gains in production. "Reviewing fuel prices in Saudi Arabia is inevitable if not a priority," Al Sabban said on December 20 by e-mail from the Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah. "Rapid growth in consumption is a real problem that can't continue in any way. There is a general conviction on that on all levels in the kingdom." Three years after the Saudi government agreed with an initiative by the Group of 20 nations for inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies to be phased out, it has not yet announced plans to raise local fuel prices. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest consumer of oil per capita with 4.7 metric tonnes, or 35 barrels, a year, according to the International Energy Agency. The country, the de-facto leader of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is losing potential export revenue by selling oil domestically at $5 to $15 a barrel when international buyers pay more than $100, said Al Sabban, who was a senior economic adviser at the ministry of petroleum and minerals before retiring this year. Saudi Arabia depends on oil for 86 per cent of its annual revenue and is accelerating exploration for natural gas and planning to develop solar and nuclear power to preserve more of its valuable crude for export. The International Energy Agency, in this year's annual World Energy Outlook, said Saudi Arabia has the world's largest fuel subsidy after Iran, at $61 billion a year. Rapid population growth is adding to the gain in fuel consumption, which is increasing at an annual rate of seven per cent, said Al Sabban. The country's population is rising at 3.2 per cent a year, according to the central department of statistics and information. Saudi Arabia is among the nations feeling the least pain at the pump, with a gallon of premium gasoline costing Saudis one per cent of their daily income in October, 58th out of 60 countries, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It cost Americans three per cent, Kuwaitis 0.7 per cent and Venezuelans 0.3 per cent. The main problem with subsidies in Saudi Arabia is that they are becoming an economic burden on the government as they benefit all classes, including the rich and expats, and not only the low-income classes, Al Sabban said. equitiesDOTcom/news/headline-story?dt=2012-12-29&amp;val=875543&amp;cat=energy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356934075879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 01:07:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356953994585-2</Id><Topic><Title>A Purified Elite America</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356825754436</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 19:02:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nobumba to abolish all parties; just him the king.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1356953994585</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 06:39:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356958877686-3</Id><Title>Exxon Talks Continue On Splitz Announcement.</Title><Msg>We may get finalality soon,well before the anticipated April DeadLine.

The Wall Street Journal has the latest on a boardroom probe of Chesapeake Energy chief executive Aubrey McClendon. Bloomberg explains why the U.S. natural gas boom is “attracting a wave of investment that may revive profits in the steel industry.” AP reports that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is requiring state agencies to become more energy efficient. The Casper Star-Tribune recommends some energy words and phrases to abandon in 2013.

Most oil companies have returned the stock market's average return the past 100 years, except this one which managed to return a couple %/yr more. Looking back across the history though, you must know that there are enough cars in the United States for every man and woman to have one, and 100 years ago there were hardly any.

Manipulating GDP is very easy for a government to do. Making up prices, double counting intermediate goods as final goods, counting 15 warehouse "receipts" on one tonne of steel in the place of 1...that sort of thing. Real easy. One should be wary of the numbers the Chinese report. The Chinese government has at least as much power as the Soviet government, and modern communications has enhanced their propaganda powers considerably. It helps, too, to have a global capital market that responds to the numbers they make up. Their banks and puppet companies around the world can make good money trading off the manipulated numbers. There undoubtedly was growth in China the past decade, mainly caused by them ignoring Western environmental laws and exporting manufactured goods.

Markey joins lawsuit in defense of SEC oil payments rule</Title><Msg>Rep. Markey joins lawsuit in defense of SEC oil payments rule By Ben Geman - 12/31/12 12:19 PM ET Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) is entering the legal fray over new Securities and Exchange Commission rules that will force petroleum and mining companies to publicly disclose payments to foreign governments. Markey told a federal appeals court Monday that he plans to file an amicus brief to defend SEC rules, finalized in August, that oil industry and business groups have filed suit to overturn. Markey, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, is a longtime critic of oil companies. He announced last week that he will will run for the Massachusetts Senate seat that is slated to open if, as expected, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) becomes secretary of State. The disclosure rule will force SEC-listed oil, natural-gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments (including the U.S.) related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses, taxes, royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects.   It’s aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the “resource curse,” in which some impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth. But industry groups allege the rule will impose major costs and put U.S. oil-and-gas companies at disadvantage when competing for contracts overseas against state-owned Russian and Chinese energy producers that don’t face the same disclosure rules. The lawsuit also alleges that the mandated disclosure violates the First Amendment by “compelling U.S. companies to engage in costly speech on controversial matters in order to influence political affairs in other nations,” according to a court filing by the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups battling the SEC rule. Counsel for Markey, in a Dec. 31 filing announcing the amicus plan, said other current or former House members may add their names to his brief. Sens. #$%$ Lugar (R-Ind.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) are also filing an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief in defense of the SEC with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Lugar and Cardin inserted the provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law that required the SEC to write the rule. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/274991-rep-markey-joins-lawsuit-in-defense-of-sec-oil-payments-disclosure-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356980278704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:57:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356982897324-29</Id><Title>Looks like Xom went no where in 2012,, share price up about 1%</Title><Msg>Truly a dog of the dow..</Msg><Username>smkpit</Username><Timestamp>1356982897324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:41:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356983574212-30</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Xom went no where in 2012,, share price up about 1%</Title><Username>smkpit</Username><Timestamp>1356982897324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:41:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The average oil price was near a record too. The oil price has nowhere to go but down. China's phony GDP growth numbers, extrapolated out decades, are about the only thing it has going for it. US oil demand is headed down. Europe/UK demand will never go up again. Technology will improve, reducing oil demand relentlessly, and the reorganization of American society around high density urban conurbations, something already underway by the natural forces of supply and demand, will reduce it more. If China manages to grow at all it will need exports to pay for more oil, and it will get less and less money from those as global price levels are driven down by technology and their own saturation of markets...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356983574212</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:52:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356983655158-31</Id><Topic><Title>The newest board idiot = hanseteelyard</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356983478975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:51:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what a loss. truly...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356983655158</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:54:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356984641338-32</Id><Topic><Title>The newest board idiot = hanseteelyard</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356983478975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:51:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how did that take so long?? that rhodesbob clone went on "ignore" long ago after urped up economic "perspective" from college books that have data on "coal usage from various countries in the 1800s --reminds me of the rove "data" a new set of "facts" unto itself</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1356984641338</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 15:10:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356984833891-33</Id><Topic><Title>The newest board idiot = hanseteelyard</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356983478975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:51:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you must be the little communists ethnic clone.

Wind energy advocates have lobbied hard to prevent the production tax credit from expiring Dec. 31. The number of new wind projects has dropped sharply when the credit has been allowed to lapse in the past, which last occurred in 2004. Including the credit is a defeat for conservative groups that urged lawmakers to let it lapse and cast the incentive as undue federal intervention in energy markets. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Monday afternoon that he and Vice President Biden have agreed on the tax portion of a deal to avert the "fiscal cliff." President Obama, in remarks Monday, said the emerging agreement would extend “clean energy” credits but did not provide specifics. But a Senate GOP aide said the package would include a package of extensions of expiring tax provisions that the Senate Finance Committee approved over the summer. That committee plan provided a one-year extension of the wind energy tax credits. It also tweaked the way the credit is made available, requiring only that projects have begun construction within the next year. Wind industry officials have said that the Finance Committee language will expand the number of projects that can take advantage of the one-year window. That plan also extends a series of other soon-to-lapse or already expired credits, such as incentives for efficient homes, biofuels and other measures. Wind energy advocates off Capitol Hill said Monday that the plan also appears to include an extension of the wind credit, but they did not have details of the duration or structure.

The U.S. House has yet to pass the bill either. From the beginning they were the ones who would not agree, and conveniently the negotiations went over to the Senate which is far more liberal. If the House does agree to the bill, which will certainly come over the objections of most House Republicans, it sours prospects for successful negotiations of the debt ceiling fight ahead. If they vote the bill down look for total panic when the markets open. Personally, I don't care which happens.

The increase in FICA taxes will come to a lumpy $120B. This will rank as one of the largest YoY tax increases in history. This is a very regressive tax increase. There is a $108K cap on what is subject to FICA taxes, so high incomes do not feel the bite. But those who earn an average income will see a meaningful reduction in disposable income ($2,000 per household). This is a decidedly un-Democratic outcome. The rich avoid taxes, lower incomes pays a disproportionate share.</Msg><Username>tfmvance</Username><Timestamp>1356991406644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 17:03:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356992655900-41</Id><Topic><Title>The rich avoid taxes, lower incomes pays a disproportionate share...vote all the Dems out that ok this!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>tfmvance</Username><Timestamp>1356991406644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 17:03:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This will put money in your SS bank for your Sr years.
