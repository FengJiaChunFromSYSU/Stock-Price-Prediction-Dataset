Corn futures for July delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade settled down 9 1/2 cents or 1.5% at $6.40 a bushel, the lowest close for the front-month contract since April 24. U.S. farmers sowed corn at a feverish pace last week as warm, dry weather allowed producers throughout the Midwest to return to their fields, a government report showed Monday. Cold, wet weather from Nebraska to Ohio earlier this spring had caused a slow start to plantings, raising worries of tighter corn supplies after the fall harvest. VIDEO: Critical Weather for Corn Planting On Monday afternoon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the corn crop was 71% planted as of Sunday, up sharply from 28% a week earlier. The one-week percentage gain in seedings matched the record of 43 percentage points set in 1992. Wheat futures were pulled lower by the decline in corn prices and expectations for ample world wheat supplies this year. Analysts expect production to rebound from last year's drought-reduced levels in areas like the former Soviet Union. Soybean futures ended mixed, with nearby futures jumping on tight current supplies and strong demand from domestic processors. CBOT July wheat settled down 4 3/4 cents or 0.7% at $6.80 1/2 a bushel, the lowest close for the front-month contract since April 2. July soybeans rose 13 3/4 cents or 0.9% to $14.78 1/4 a bushel. agricultureDOTcom/markets/analysis/corn/plting-surge-sinks-cn-futures_9-ar31671</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369200495945</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 01:28:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369201627267-3</Id><Topic><Title>Senators warned of ‘narrowing’ opportunity to increase gas exports</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369159535454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:05:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...

He also addressed the Energy Department’s missions around power grid resilience, oversight of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile, nonproliferation, scientific research and more. Moniz is stepping into the Cabinet job at a time when President Obama has vowed new executive-level actions on climate. Moniz, in a separate speech Tuesday, vowed to focus heavily on energy efficiency initiatives, which he called a vital tool in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/301287-new-energy-secretary-need-to-address-climate-change-not-debatable</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369247329007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:28:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369247849725-30</Id><Topic><Title>Dow -750 next ????

Last week, gas prices went up .19 cents per gallon in Iowa with ending average prices at $3.70 per gallon. Spikes were even higher in Minnesota/St. Paul with prices averaging $4.21 across the state while the national average is around $3.60 per gallon. In response Absolute Energy, an ethanol plant located on the Iowa-Minnesota border, is offering Minnesota drivers some relief at the pump in the form of ethanol. Absolute Energy is offering E85, (85 percent ethanol / 15 percent gasoline), in bulk to gas marketers impacted by the recent shut-down of three oil refineries for mostly seasonal reasons. According to E85Prices this week, the published average statewide E85 price is averaging $3.08 and has been reported to be as low as $2.39 per gallon in Eagan, Minn. Rick Schwarck, CEO of Absolute Energy, said, “With gas prices spiking and ethanol plentiful in the Midwest, this will be the summer of the flex-fuel vehicle. Drivers of FFVs should be able to take advantage of serious savings at the pump by using E85. Not only will they be saving money, they will be choosing a fuel alternative that creates jobs and opportunities throughout Minnesota, Iowa and other states. E85 will drive us toward a cleaner, brighter summer sky thanks to lower greenhouse gas emissions while also strengthening our national security and economy.” domesticfuelDOTcom/2013/05/22/absolute-energy-offers-drivers-relief-at-the-pump/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369247865754</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:37:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369247928455-32</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SHOULD BE IMPEACHED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>wwwwwwwwwwwppppppppppp</Username><Timestamp>1369151184251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>commie #$%$</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1369247928455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:38:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369258234727-33</Id><Topic><Title>Closing in on a new 52 week high.</Title><Username>stockminder</Username><Timestamp>1369239689338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:21:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exxon closes at below where it was in Sept 14, 2012.

Today, the country announced the details of its first carbon trading program, which will begin in the city of Shenzhen next month. The southern city is one of seven cities and provinces, including Beijing, which will take part in the pilot program, set to be completely implemented by 2014. And according to one local news source, China could implement an absolute, nation-wide cap on its carbon emissions by 2016. China’s 21st Century Business Herald reported this week that the country’s State Council still needs to approve the carbon cap proposal submitted by the National Development and Reform Commission, a government entity that controls much of the Chinese economy. The proposal, which the State Council is reportedly likely to support, would ensure China’s emissions would not increase past the country’s target cap, regardless of economic growth — though it’s still unclear what that cap would be. The paper reported that the NDRC also predicts China’s greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2025, rather than 2030, as earlier predictions stated. If the cap is adopted, it would be a major step for the world’s top CO2 emitter, which desperately needs to slow its carbon production. China is experiencing the world’s fastest growth in energy production and CO2 emissions, while production and emissions in the U.S. and Europe are flat-lining or decreasing. China uses 47 percent of the world’s coal, a number that’s only going up: in 2011, China’s coal consumption grew by 9 percent, accounting for 87 percent of the world’s 374 million ton increase in coal consumption that year. The country’s emissions aren’t just a major contributor to climate change worldwide — they’re causing serious local problems as well. In Beijing, pollution has reached record levels, topping 775 in January — a number thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/05/22/2047111/china-carbon-cap/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369270044596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:47:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369270603883-37</Id><Title>Chu On Climate: ‘If We Don’t Change What We’re Doing, We’re Going To Be Fundamentally In Really Deep Trouble’</Title><Msg>Joe Romm on May 22, 2013 at 12:30 pm Dr. Ernest Moniz was sworn in as the new Energy Secretary this week. Last week, the previous Secretary, Dr. Steven Chu, gave an interview to Stanford where he is returning as a physics professor. The Nobel laureate was asked “What’s the No. 1 problem on your list?” His answer: Climate change. We’re heading into an era where if we don’t change what we’re doing, we’re going to be fundamentally in really deep trouble. We’re already in trouble. So we have to transition to better solutions. We’re not too far away from producing a lot of renewable energy, and doing it cheaply. Solar power is going to become cheaper and cheaper – costs have plummeted three-fold in six years, partly because of the dropping price of modules and electronics. Wind energy is within 15 percent of the cost of new natural gas energy, and the DOE predicts that that cost will cross over within one or two decades, so we need to start to plan the transition system that can conduct more wind energy. But right now, we’re not prepared. As technology continues to race forward – battery technology has advanced faster in the past five years than what I’ve seen in the [previous] 15 years – we need policy to guide and anticipate development. It takes decades to change things like infrastructure, and so people have to think about that today. Otherwise, progress slows down, and we emit more carbon and get into more trouble environmentally. Back in 2009, Chu said “Wake up,” America, “we’re looking at a scenario where there’s no more agriculture in California.” Chu did keep talking about climate change in the past 4 years, but neither the media nor the White House were paying much attention. And so we are “already in trouble” with much, much worse to come if we don’t act now. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/05/22/2021201/chu-on-climate-if-we-dont-change-what-were-doing-were-going-to-be-fundamentally-in-really-deep-trouble/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369270603883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:56:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369275085559-38</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's new Energy chief: Climate change ‘not debatable’</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369247329007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:28:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please-can the Democrats and Obama just shut up for awhile and explain where are the money went went their green initiatives?
