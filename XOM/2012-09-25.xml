The Department of Energy (DOE) last week delayed the release of a report on the economics of exporting natural gas until after the election, citing complexities in analyzing the fragmented global natural-gas markets. The report, which is being compiled by a third-party contractor, was originally scheduled for release in March. Republicans have been adamant that while Obama says he supports natural gas, his policies have failed to honor that declaration. They say Obama’s reluctance to push ahead with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reflects that dynamic. A bipartisan group of 44 lawmakers from Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas sent a letter to Energy Secretary Steven Chu in August pushing him to expedite LNG export terminal approvals, but have yet to receive a response. “I assume at this point that [President Obama] is just saying we’ll deal with that after the election. I’m asking the question, ‘Why?’ This is all held up in the executive branch,” Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), one of the letter signatories, told The Hill recently. Democrats fear that selling more natural gas abroad would raise costs at home, and they cite an Energy Information Administration (EIA) report that found increased exports would raise electricity bills by an average of 1 to 3 percent annually between 2015 and 2035. They also say it could cause environmental and health hazards by ramping up exploration through hydraulic fracturing, a process that injects a mixture of chemicals, water and sand into tight rock formations to release natural gas. Rep. Edward Markey (Mass.), the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, has been an outspoken opponent of selling more liquefied natural gas to other countries. “[Rep. Markey] believes that if we export large quantities of natural gas that we will also export jobs in manufacturing, and threaten our economic and national security advantages from this abundant, low-cost source of domestic energy,” committee spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder told The Hill in a statement. The EIA report concluded that the divide between low U.S. natural gas prices and higher-priced international markets would likely narrow in the coming years. It also said investment in LNG terminals would be costly. The manufacturing sector, which consumes large amounts of electricity, would feel the price pinch from exporting natural gas, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC). The Chemistry Council said that although it supports free trade, exporting liquefied natural gas “could artificially inflate the price of natural gas and erode the newfound competitive advantage that U.S. chemicals companies are experiencing.” But Rayola Dougher, an economist with the American Petroleum Institute (API), disputed the report that found LNG exports would raise electricity prices. Even if EIA’s projections were true, she said, the increases in electricity costs would be offset by job gains in the natural-gas sector. Dougher said API has pressed Republicans and Democrats alike to boost natural-gas production, and accused the administration and its allies of engaging in “a lot of scaremongering” about exports. Though firms can already export liquefied natural gas to nations with existing free trade agreements, deals with other countries require administration approval. So far, the administration has approved one non-free trade agreement export, with 12 others still under review. DOE also has final say over exports, even to countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement in place. Those export projects must be deemed in the public interest to gain approval, which DOE said is generally granted to free-trade-agreement nations. Of 18 such applications, 13 have been approved, while five are pending. Republicans want to accelerate that approval process, and they blame the sluggish pace on environmentalist interests that the GOP says have weighed too heavily on the administration’s decisions. “In an effort to slow gas production, environmentalists are seeking to ban the export of domestically produced natural gas,” Rep. John Sullivan (R-Okla.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power, told The Hill in a statement. “Limiting the global market for American-made natural gas would dampen industry growth, leading to reduced domestic production, fewer jobs and higher energy prices.” thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348553940479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 02:19:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348554616219-4</Id><Title>Ethanol Powered Muscle Cars Hit the Track In Kearney - street-legal cars running on E85 - proving that ethanol is a high-performance fuel</Title><Msg>Ethanol Powered Muscle Cars Hit the Track In Kearney Posted: Sep 24, 2012 4:57 PM MDT Updated: Sep 24, 2012 4:58 PM MDT By Emily Roehler, Weekend Meteorologist - bio | email Kearney- It's being billed as "8 Seconds of Corn-fed Madness."

At public hearings into the C$6 billion ($6.1 billion) project, Enbridge attorney Rick Neufeld told British Columbia economist Robyn Allan the company's market experts have shown that Northern Gateway will not restrict crude supplies in other markets on the continent, as she has concluded. Allan, former chief executive of the Insurance Corp of British Columbia, provided an economic assessment of Northern Gateway early this year for the Alberta Federation of Labour, which opposes the 525,000 barrel a day pipeline from Alberta to Kitimat, British Columbia, for crude oil shipment to Asia. Neufeld took issue with Allan's evidence that the export pipeline would result in $2-$3 per barrel annual increases in oil prices across the country between 2016 and 2046, including for Eastern refineries now supplied almost exclusively with imported oil priced against international benchmark Brent oil. "Indeed that's what you've told people around the country, and I'm suggesting to you, Ms Allan, that that's not the evidence of these witnesses," Neufeld said at the proceedings in Edmonton. "They did not suggest that Northern Gateway would increase the price of Brent crude, and you were here for that." The exchange was part of the first opportunity Enbridge has had to cross-examine its opponents. Most of the testimony in hearings before a federal Joint Review Panel into the contentious Northern Gateway project has so far been about environmental issues, but the Edmonton proceedings are delving solely into economic impacts and benefits. One aim of the project is to remove a price discount on Canadian oil that currently exists due to an oversupply of oil in traditional markets such as the U.S. Midwest. Enbridge said Canadian producers would benefit by diversifying their markets to include Asia, where prices are higher. The Alberta Federation of Labour opposes the pipeline because, the group says, it would mean the loss of oil processing and refining jobs in Canada as the raw material gets shipped across the Rockies to the Pacific. Neufeld said Enbridge's evidence, prepared by consultants Muse Stancil and Wright Mansell Research, did not show that the pipeline would restrict oil supplies in North America, push up gasoline prices for consumers, or have any impact on oil prices in other parts of the world, as Allan has concluded. Allan has argued that restricted supply in North American markets as a result of oil being redirected to Asia on Northern Gateway, and the international determination of crude prices, will push up prices for all supply bought by Canadian refiners. "In your view then, if Northern Gateway was to improve the price - or reduce the discounting of Canadian crude, put it that way - by $2 a barrel, the price of crude delivered by OPEC would increase by $2 a barrel. That's your evidence?," Neufeld said. Allan did not argue that point, saying she derived her contentions by taking numbers and assumptions in Enbridge's expert reports to their "logical conclusion." "Based on the analysis that was provided in both the Muse and the Wright Mansell reports, the redirection of supply takes oil out of markets and when the supply goes down, the price goes up," she said. "With the ... fact that the oil is going to be redirected from Ontario and Quebec, that is going to affect the Eastern Canadian market." However, her written evidence criticizes Enbridge's reports, saying they leave out a number of aspects that raise questions about their reliability. Those include analysis of sensitivities to prices, currency exchange rates, changes to supply as well as other risks to the forecasts. "All of those are standard business practice that would be undertaken if the proponent's analysis was delivered to an investor or a lender. In any of the other places where it needs to prove its case, those standards would have been delivered," she said. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348554906901</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 02:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348555562361-6</Id><Title>Praj Focuses on Second Generation Biofuel - global cellulosic ethanol market is estimated to be worth between $75 billion &amp; $140 billion by 2020</Title><Msg>Praj Focuses on Second Generation Biofuel UpFront/Breakpoint| Sep 25, 2012 | 446 views by Seema Singh The company is focusing on second generation biofuel as global demand rises As global players continue to debate the use of food crops for the production of biofuel, Praj Industries has chosen an alternative path. The engineering company has started work on second generation biofuel, which—unlike first generation biofuel—does not require any specific crop as feed. After three years of technology development and plant engineering, Praj is now building a commercial scale demonstration plant to produce ethanol—also called cellulosic ethanol—from biomass, which could be any form of agricultural waste, such as wheat and paddy waste, or wood chips. “For many years, people have been saying that cellulosic biofuel is ‘round the corner’, but now it’s a reality,” says Pramod Chaudhari, chairman of Praj. His company signed an agreement with Danish enzyme maker Novozymes in 2009 for joint R&amp;D on cellulosic ethanol. During this period, Novozymes reached its third generation enzymes. Apart from these enzymes, Praj uses a few other micro-organisms in its various downstream processes. Most cellulosic biofuel producers use enzymes, yeast or algae to break down biomass into sugars for fermentation. This has led many chemical companies to team up with oil or engineering services firms. For instance, Dutch chemical company DSM has tied up with America’s largest ethanol maker POET; DuPont with industrial contractor Fagen Inc.; Novozymes with Italy’s M&amp;G; BP Biofuels with DSM and Texas AgriLife Research. Gaining an edge As it faces stiff competition from global giants, Praj is banking on its integrated solutions—a mix of technology and engineering. Most other companies have standalone systems to produce biofuel, whereas Praj aims to provide bolt-on units that can be added to existing plants. The company also considers its multi-feed technology—which allows the use of biomass from different sources—to be a bonus. “As an integrated player, we can also be technology agnostic,” says Balu Sarma, its chief technology officer. He believes Praj’s offerings “will reduce Capex and improve operating time for its customers.” In 2003-04, Praj took up the concept of ‘smart distilleries’, with multi-feed and multi-product capabilities. Chaudhari says he is including some of these capabilities in cellulosic ethanol technology. Biofuel makers will get a choice in the kind of biomass and kind of product—ethanol and/or some other chemicals—they want to produce. This option, Chaudhari hopes, will give Praj a large share of the cellulosic ethanol market. The global cellulosic ethanol market is estimated to be worth between $75 billion and $140 billion by 2020, according to McKinsey &amp; Co. And this time, most companies are relying not on subsidy but the US government’s mandate to generate about 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. “New plants that are coming up may succeed in replacing corn-based ethanol, which is under considerable attack because of the impact of high corn prices on food and cattle feed markets,” says Robert Stone, managing director and research analyst at Cowen Group in Boston. However, any new biofuel will make sense only if it is less expensive to produce. “We think that plants whose economics depend on artificially high prices for cellulosic ethanol face significant risk, especially as more fully functional true [cellulosic] drop-in [replacements for gasoline and diesel] begin to be produced.” Unpromising home ground In India, theoretically, there’s sufficient biomass that can be used in various processes. A 2011 Bloomberg Energy Finance report says 125 to 183 million tonnes of biomass residue will be available in India by 2020 for making next generation ethanol, without any change in land-use patterns. This quantity of biomass could meet up to 59 percent of India’s petrol demand in 2020, and reduce road transport greenhouse gas emissions by 47 percent to 69 percent. Unfortunately, policy instability is a drag on market expansion. Although the current fuel policy necessitates a 20 percent ethanol blend by 2017, even the five percent blend that came into practice a few years ago is not fully implemented because there isn’t enough ethanol being produced. Even a small policy intervention can turn the tables, says Choudhari. If, every year, the government keeps aside even 30 percent of the 16 to 20 million tonnes of molasses for turning into ethanol, it would produce enough ethanol for a 10 percent blending. The demonstration plant that Praj is building can take 100 tonnes of feed per day, and manufacture up to 100 million litres of ethanol per year. This would vary according to feedstock and process configuration. It’s a good technology, and Praj can extract many value-added products from it, says P Padmanabhan, executive director (refinery coordination) at Bharat Petroleum. But he is not convinced that ethanol can make a dent in the overall demand for crude oil, primarily because the volumes are so high that it requires long-term mandated targets, policies and penalties to ensure its implementation. “The government has to give incentives to people for bringing biomass to collection centres; oil companies are not equipped for collection,” he says. The lack of government policy and its implementation is making Praj target the global market, especially regions in Europe, China, Latin America and the US, where several plants are being built. Nearly half of Praj’s 2012 revenue of Rs 880 crore is coming from abroad. But the Indian market does not seem to have woken up to the company as yet. Stocks remain at a three-year low. And the major reason for this, says Chaudhari, is the low level of awareness in India about the development of cellulosic ethanol technology and its potential, when compared to the US and Europe. “This [2013] will be a defining year for Praj,” says Chaudhari, as he expects his ethanol business to be dominated by second generation biofuel by 2015. forbesindia</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348555562361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 02:46:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348556351340-7</Id><Title>100% Green Power — An Option for Consumers under San Francisco Plan</Title><Msg>100% Green Power — An Option for Consumers under San Francisco Plan September 24, 2012 By Nathan 2 Comments The city of San Francisco is considering a new $19.5 million program that would allow consumers to buy 100-percent of their electricity from renewable sources, for a premium price.

This may be a poor metaphor, [b]but the good news is that Linn Co-op Oil Company, the first retailer to officially sell E15 in Iowa, has seen sales soar to more than 30 percent of the day’s sales after an open house event on Friday, September 21, 2012.[/b] The ethanol fuel blend is the most tested fuel blend in the history of the U.S. and is approved for drivers of owning a 2001 or new vehicle, SUV or light-duty truck. “Friday’s open house event at Linn Co-op proved to be a great success,” said Lucy Norton, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Managing Director. “Attendees showed a deep interest in E15, specifically asking for the fuel and provided a large uptick in E15 sales. Iowa motorists are excited to have another high-octane, low-cost ethanol option that supports local jobs and contributes to the state’s economy.” As part of the introduction of E15, Linn Co-op held an open house on Friday, September 21, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with lunch served from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. E15 customers received a 15 cent discount on each gallon of E15 purchased. To introduce E15 to Marion residents, the IRFA, Iowa Corn and the Iowa Power Fund Community Grant Program are sponsoring a media campaign that includes radio and print ads, billboards and direct mail. The campaign will run throughout September. A similar campaign is available to any Iowa retailer who offers E15 for 2001 and newer vehicle owners, says Norton. Retailers preparing to offer E15 in the future are urged to contact the IRFA for promotional assistance.

The integrated giant’s $35 billion buy of XTO Energy back in 2010 set the stage for the hydraulic fracturing revolution and made Exxon the biggest natural gas player in the U.S. More recently, Exxon has begun to make tactical inroads into new unconventional territory such as the Russian Arctic. All in all, these forward-thinking purchases and exploration efforts have allowed Exxon to zig when other firms have zagged — keeping it ahead of the energy curve. Well, Exxon hasn’t stopped dealing, and the latest couldn’t have come at a better time. With the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids — like propane and ethane — continuing to fall, Exxon has gone for the shale oil gusto. The latest blockbuster purchase nearly doubles the size of its acreage in the oil-rich Bakken shale and improves its overall energy mix. With the glut of natural gas and NGLs not subsiding anytime soon, Exxon has positioned itself to take advantage of any energy pricing scenario ahead. For investors, that strengthens the integrated giant’s appeal. The Largest Purchase Since XTO For only $1.6 billion dollars and the exchange of some assets, the world’s largest publicly traded energy company is seeking to boost its crude oil output. Exxon will acquire drilling rights on 196,000 net acres in North Dakota’s and Montana’s oil-rich Bakken shale from Denbury Resources (NYSE:DNR). This agreement will boost Exxon’s holdings in the region by about 50% to roughly 600,000 net acres and make it one of the region’s largest players. Overall, the purchased Bakken acreage is expected to produce nearly 15,000 barrels of oil and other hydrocarbons per day in the second half of this year. Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson expects the acreage to produce more as hydraulic fracturing technology continues to improve. The deal is worth $2 billion, if you include the two fields in Wyoming and Texas that Denbury is getting. That’s relatively tiny for Exxon, which produced an average of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. However, the purchase does mark its largest acquisition effort since the $35 billion XTO deal back in 2010. Drilling activity in the Bakken has soared in recent years, recently passing 610,000 barrels per day and now accounting for nearly 10% of total U.S. production. The Bakken alone has helped fuel the biggest jump in domestic oil production in more than 40 years, and North Dakota recently passed Alaska and California to become the second-biggest oil-producing state behind Texas. Output from the Bakken — which spans roughly 200,000 square miles across North Dakota, Montana and Canada — is expected to double to about 1.2 million barrels per day by 2015 as the use of technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling continue to get better. Bakken-benchmarked crude began trading at a premium to West Texas Intermediate this month as various producers skirted pipeline bottlenecks by shipping it to refiners by rail. A Great Buy The purchase makes a lot of sense for both Exxon and its long-term shareholders. The addition of Denbury’s fields will catapult Exxon into fifth place when it comes to the largest holders of Bakken acreage. That ties it with EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and gives Exxon a top spot in a critical oil-focused region. The XTO purchase made Exxon the king of the natural gas hill, but as hydraulic fracking has grown in prominence, natural gas and NGL prices have plummeted. Natural gas prices reached a 10-year low back in April on the New York MERC, and some analysts predict more pain coming for the sector. Overall, the purchase increases Exxon’s U.S. oil production by about 3%, and with oil prices continuing to stay high, the deal helps limit some of the short-term pain from gas. Another factor is that production at a variety of major energy firms has slipped during the past few years as legacy wells have begun to dry up. Generally, when exploration and production firms can’t find oil quickly enough, they’re stuck with aging fields where overall output is declining. That’s a very costly proposition. So while this new deal isn’t huge based on Exxon’s total size, any small addition to its production base helps replace all the hydrocarbons it’s extracted. Given Exxon’s expertise in advancing the science of fracking, the fields should produce quite a bit of shale oil for years to come. Finally, Exxon may have gotten a good deal when it comes to pricing. Denbury’s real forte is using carbon-dioxide to help pump out more crude oil from aging wells. Its Bakken assets didn’t necessarily fit into its overall business model and were some of “worst” performing based on internal rates of return. However, other smaller players in the region — like Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) — are very Bakken-specific firms. With analysts predicting that more of the majors will come hunting for Bakken and shale oil assets, paying for a firm like Continental will be a very expense proposition indeed. For roughly $2 billion, Exxon may have gotten away with a steal. Overall, the Bakken deal represents another forward-thinking purchase by Exxon and helps strengthen the idea that it should belong in your portfolio.

Edited by Marianna Avilkina Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) is one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies in the world. As the world's largest refiner and petroleum marketer, XOM engages in oil exploration, production, and refining around the world. The company strives diligently to capitalize on rising oil prices. After Exxon's revenues jumped by 28% and profits soared by 35%, XOM moved into the top spot in the Fortune 500 in 2012. To meet the world's demand for energy in the future, Exxon Mobil has already ventured into gas production. In 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy for $35 billion and became the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. As of September 23, 2012, XOM stock was trading at around $92, with a 52-week range of $67.93 - $92.50. It has a market cap of $426.2 billion. The trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 9.7 is below the forward P/E ratio of 11.3. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 2.6, 0.9, and 8.0, respectively. The operating margin is 16% while the net profit margin is 9.1%. The company has minor debt issues, with a debt/equity ratio of 0.2 that is far below the market average. Exxon Mobil pays solid dividends - the trailing yield is 2.26%, whereas the forward one is 2.48%. Upcoming dividends are expected to amount to $.57 per share. Over the last five years, the company has gradually increased its dividend amount by 63%. The five-year dividend history suggests that XOM is a strong dividend-growth company, as well as a regular dividend payer. XOM has a 3-star rating from Morningstar. Out of five analysts covering the company, two have a "buy" rating, and the other three indicated a "hold" rating. This is good reason to suppose that Wall Street holds diverse opinions on the company's future. The average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 12.3 %. What is the fair value of Exxon Mobil given the forecast estimates? We can determine XOM's fair value using the discounted earnings plus equity model, as follows. Discounted Earnings Plus Equity Model This model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period: V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal Value V = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings: Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / r While this formula might look intimidating for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my growth estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence. Valuation Historically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate. In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of TTM EPS along with the mean EPS estimate for the next year. E0 = EPS = ($9.52 + $8.16) / 2 = $8.84 Wall Street holds diverse opinions on the company's future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 12.3%. Book value per share is $35.27.
