The Liu’ao Hai wind farm will be located off the coast of Fujian province in southern China near the Liu’ao Peninsula. Fujian Datang has already invested 30 million yuan on the completion of a feasibility study and submitted the results to China’s State Energy Bureau for approval. The proposed wind farm will employ a number of three to five megawatt turbines for a total capacity of 300 megawatts, and is expected to generate between 0.6 and 0.73 terawatt hours of electricity per annum. The project will reap strong benefits from its location near the Taiwan Strait. The strait produces a funnelling effect which helps create strong winds, making coastal Fujian an ideal location for the development of offshore wind power sites. Due to its inclusion in the offshore wind development plan of Fujian province, which divides the sea area into four quarters each slated to provide up to 1.5 gigawatts of energy, it is hoped the project will avoid conflicts with other users of ocean resources. Such conflicts led to delays in the development of offshore wind farms further north in Jiangsu province. Other advantages to the selected location include modest water depth and a flat seabed in the site location, which will make the laying of foundations and cables far easier, and pre-existing land-based support facilities due to the presence of a nearby 101.6 megawatt onshore wind farm. Fujian Datang is a subsidiary of China Datang Corporation, a wholly state-owned enterprise which is one of the five key players in China’s energy sector. Fujian Datang was established in August 2009 for the specific purpose of developing wind power resources in Fujian province. China first began to develop offshore wind power in earnest in 2010, with the issuance of special project approvals via a tendering process. While several of the country’s main energy players already have offshore wind farms completed or in the works, the sector in general has struggled to achieve profitability due to high construction costs and technological constraints. designbuildsourceDOTcomDOTau/southern-china-to-invest-big-in-its-first-offshore-wind-farm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359358917276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 02:41:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359359877124-4</Id><Topic><Title>Court delivers blow to biofuel industry in ruling against EPA</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359162356709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 20:05:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mixed Messages for Advanced Biofuels 1 Comment Posted by Joanna Schroeder – January 25th, 2013 There are some mixed messages coming from the D.C. Circuit today as they ruled to vacate the 2012 cellulosic biofuel standard, yet affirmed the 2012 advanced biofuel standard as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The biofuels industry reacted to the decisions and noted that although the court vacated the cellulosic standard, it also rejected API’s argument that EPA was required to follow the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s projections in setting its own. The court also rejected API’s argument that EPA was not entitled to consider information from cellulosic biofuel producers in setting its projection, finding that cellulosic producers were an “almost inevitable source of information” for EPA. According to several biofuel organizations, these were important decisions that give EPA flexibility in setting cellulosic biofuel volumes in the future. The court vacated the cellulosic biofuel standard because it believed that EPA had impermissibly set the volume with the objective of promoting growth in the industry, rather than simply making an accurate prediction. The biofuels organizations strongly disagree with this characterization — EPA did not determine a reasonably achievable volume and then inflate it, they say. Rather, it set the volume based on the best information available to it at the time. In the end, EPA is free to reinstate the volumes that it had established, as long as the information available at the time would support the agency’s conclusion that those volumes were reasonably achievable. The court’s decision does not now require, or permit, EPA to set volumes based on hindsight. The D.C. Circuit also affirmed the EPA’s decision not to reduce the advanced biofuel volume, categorically rejecting API’s arguments that EPA must be support its decision not to reduce the applicable volume of advanced biofuels with specific numerical projections. In a joint statement, the biofuel organizations stated that, “although we disagree with the court’s decision vacating the 2012 cellulosic volumes, today’s decision once again rejects broad-brushed attempts to effectively roll back the federal Renewable Fuel Standard.” The biofuel organizations include the Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA), Advanced Ethanol Council (AEC), American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE), Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), Growth Energy, and Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). They are reviewing the court’s decision and assessing next steps in the matter. domesticfuelDOTcom/2013/01/25/mixed-messages-for-advanced-biofuels/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359359877124</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 02:57:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359377378900-5</Id><Topic><Title>XOM is horrendous.

Another billionaire wants to uplift third world poverty, and brings another into his scheme. They lobby for subsidized charity to make their philanthropic dollars go farther. Really if you add up all the dollars Americans allocate to charity in such haphazard ways (as the World Bank has done) it amounts to about 8% of US GDP which would be enough to balance your budget.

The oil firms and governors last week sent letters to DOE on the export issue, officially joining the cacophony of politicians, state officials, trade groups and businesses calling for more LNG exports. “This surge in clean, domestic, affordable energy is stimulating local economies, creating millions of jobs, and enabling new opportunities. But the opportunity could be greater and the impact more far-reaching,” McDonnell wrote to Energy Secretary Steven Chu. DOE is currently sitting on more than a dozen export applications, and feeling the heat from supporters and detractors of sending more LNG abroad. Much of the tug-of-war so far has centered on a DOE-commissioned study that concluded LNG exports would be an economic win for the United States. While the report garnered praise from export backers, some lawmakers and manufacturing firms worry sending too much LNG overseas would raise domestic energy prices. In their letters, the governors and oil companies said DOE should waste no time opening the gates for exports. Anders Ekvall, vice president of Shell Americas’ LNG operations, wrote that the U.S. “can play an important role in the global LNG market,” but warned “regulatory delays could allow this opportunity to bypass the United States.” Japan is hoping the U.S. moves fast on LNG exports. In comments on the export study, a group of Japanese utilities and businesses urged “expedited” action on outstanding permits. The island nation is trying to fill an energy supply gap caused by shuttering nearly all its nuclear reactors following the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown. Before that disaster, nuclear energy had supplied about 30 percent of Japan’s power. Meanwhile, Shell is positioning itself to export LNG from the East Coast. The firm announced Monday that it would partner with Kinder Morgan to convert its LNG import facility at Elba Island, Ga., into an exporting one. Shell said it planned to send LNG to nations that have a free-trade agreement with the U.S., as well as those without such a pact. DOE has readily approved LNG exports to free-trade nations, but has greenlighted just one to nations without free-trade status. In a statement, Shell said Kinder Morgan expects the terminal to get approval for transactions with non-free trade nations “in due course.” Under law, the department must determine whether exports to such countries meet the public interest. Export backers say the DOE-commissioned study solved that issue by saying sending supplies abroad would yield a net economic benefit. Shell’s planned terminal is welcome news to the more than 100 lawmakers who have advocated expanding exports. But several manufacturing companies and a handful of lawmakers want DOE to take a cautious approach on exports. Some senior Democrats are worried unfettered exports would raise domestic natural-gas prices, undercutting economic competitiveness. A coalition of manufacturers known as America’s Energy Alliance also wants DOE to exercise restraint. Those manufacturers, which include Dow Chemical and Alcoa, split with a bloc of trade groups pushing for more LNG exports. But export proponents contend domestic price increases would be minimal. They note the DOE-commissioned study said LNG processing costs would subdue export activity. “Therefore, Shell expects that North American LNG exports will increase, but at a far slower rate than the list of pending export applications would imply,” Ekvall said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/279609-oil-firms-governors-urge-natural-gas-export-expansion</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359399165625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 13:52:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359399498229-12</Id><Title>US review delays closing of big Chinese oil deal</Title><Msg>US review delays closing of big Chinese oil deal By Ben Geman - 01/28/13 10:38 AM ET A U.S. regulatory review has delayed completion of Chinese oil giant CNOOC’s $15.1 billion purchase of the Canadian oil company Nexen, a deal that triggered U.S. review because Nexen has oil-and-gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Nexen, in a statement Sunday, said both parties to the deal have agreed to extend the closing date by 30 days until early March. “Completion of the Agreement remains subject to the receipt of United States regulatory approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. Key regulatory approvals have been received from Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the People's Republic of China,” Nexen said. In the U.S., the deal has triggered review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the Treasury Department-led interagency panel that reviews foreign purchases of U.S. assets if the transactions could affect national security. Nexen is a multinational company active in Canada’s oil sands, off West Africa’s coast and elsewhere. CNOOC’s takeover has drawn interest on Capitol Hill due to Nexen’s Gulf of Mexico holdings and because Nexen is a significant player in Canada’s oil sands.

This represents a 33% increase over the 874 MW installed in 2011. Europe now has a total of 1,662 offshore wind turbines installed across 55 offshore wind farms in 10 European countries, for a total of 4.995 GW of capacity. The U.K. remains the leader in offshore wind, with nearly 60% of Europe's total offshore wind capacity, followed by Denmark (18%), Belgium (8%) and Germany (6%). The offshore wind turbines installed in 2012 represent a total investment of approximately 4 billion euros. The European offshore wind forecasts for 2013 and 2014 are positive, with 14 offshore wind projects under construction that are due to increase installed capacity by a further 3.3 GW and bring Europe’s total offshore wind energy capacity to 8.3 GW. According to EWEA, Siemens was the leading turbine supplier in 2012, Bladt was the leading substructure supplier, Nexans and JDR were the leading inter-array cable suppliers, Prysmian was the leading export-cable supplier and #$%$ Energy was the leading developer. The average size of an offshore wind turbine installed in 2012 was 4 MW, and the average offshore wind farm size was 271 MW. Although the average turbine size is not expected to increase over the next two years, the trend will likely be toward larger projects, EWEA says. Financing activity grew faster than the sector itself during 2012, EWEA notes. In 2012, four nonrecourse debt-financing transactions were closed, involving almost 20 banks. Seven equity deals were struck in 2012, and the year saw a broader pool of companies buying into the sector. "Offshore wind power is growing solidly,” says Justin Wilke, EWEA’s policy director. "But solid installation figures do not alter the fact that the wind industry is being hit by political and regulatory instability, the economic crisis, the higher cost of capital and austerity. Europe is a world leader in offshore wind energy and could be creating even more jobs if governments gave greater policy certainty to investors, and resolved grid connection problems."
