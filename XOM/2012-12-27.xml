Futures were little changed in London after rising the most in five weeks yesterday. President Barack Obama and legislators returned to Washington for talks aimed at averting more than $600 billion in tax gains and spending cuts that start Jan. 1. The U.A.E. coordinated with Saudi Arabian officials to arrest members of the terror group who had equipment needed for their attacks, according to the official WAM news agency. “The arrests in the U.A.E. appear to have had a big impact with lower liquidity in the oil market,” said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart, Denmark, who predicts Brent will average $112 a barrel in the first quarter. “Fundamentals look pretty balanced.” Brent for February settlement fell 39 cents to $110.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at 1:03 p.m. local time. The volume was 46 percent less than the 100-day average. Prices yesterday gained $2.27, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $111.07, the highest close since Nov. 30. West Texas Intermediate for February delivery was unchanged at $90.98 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The volume traded for all contracts was 39 percent below the 100-day average. Futures advanced $2.37 to $90.98 yesterday. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $19.67 to WTI. Mideast Tension The U.S. benchmark has dropped 7.9 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened the glut at Cushing, Oklahoma, America’s largest oil-storage hub and the delivery point for Nymex futures. That has left WTI at an average discount of $17.46 a barrel to Brent this year, compared with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s crude, has climbed 3.4 percent this year. “I think there can be some resolution and we can avoid the worst-case scenario” in the budget talks, said Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo. “We don’t see an issue for the terrorist news, but it was said to move prices on possible Middle East tension. It’s easier for players to move prices up and down in a thin market.” A failure to reach an agreement on the budget plan might push the U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer, into recession for the first half of 2013, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said. Debt Ceiling The U.S. government will hit its statutory debt ceiling on Dec. 31, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a letter to congressional leaders. To avert a default, the Treasury will create about $200 billion in headroom under the limit, which would normally last about two months. The letter adds urgency to the talks between Republicans and Obama, who has asked that raising the debt ceiling be part of a deficit-reduction plan. Oil may decline in New York as technical indicators show prices have probably risen too quickly for further gains to be sustained. Crude’s 30-day stochastic oscillators climbed above 70 yesterday for the first time since September, signaling futures are overbought, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The front-month contract also settled higher than the upper Bollinger Band, around $90.70 a barrel today, an indicator that has halted advances twice this month. Heating oil futures were little changed at $3.0522 a gallon in New York after increasing 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest gain in more than five weeks. A winter storm may have dropped as much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of snow and ice on New York City yesterday. A weather advisory was issued as the system neared the area, said Tim Morrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton, New York. The storm has dumped heavy snow across the Great Plains and Midwest and brought high winds and tornadoes across the South. Crude held on to yesterday’s gains because “it’s got a lot to do with a little bit of weather,” said Jonathan Barratt, chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity newsletter in Sydney. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-26/oil-trades-near-two-month-high-on-budget-talks-terror-arrests.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356614743717</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 08:25:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356615151896-7</Id><Topic><Title>Barney Frank To Take Senator Kerry's Seat!</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356144530095</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 21:48:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Frank, like Kerry will supported unlimited increases in foreign aid to the Middle East and Mexico while one in six children in the US go to bed hungry.

The board, a group of 260 biodiesel producers, users and marketers, has become a part of the Diesel Technology Forum, the groups announced this month. The move will help the groups in the “fight for clean diesel technology,” the groups said. The forum is a nonprofit advocacy group for clean diesel that is backed by BP and several engine manufacturers and automakers, including General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Mazda, Volvo and Volkswagen. Diesel fuel has come under fire from natural gas producers amid recent booms in production that brought gas prices this year to their lowest levels in 10 years. Although natural gas has, in years past, suffered from large price fluctuations because of inconsistencies in supply, producers have now made a case that supplies will remain high for decades because of shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing. That will bring with it a consistent stream of low-priced natural gas that fuel users can rely on, they say. The argument has caught the attention of the heaviest fuel users, long tied to diesel to move trucks, trains, oil field equipment and other heavy machinery. Diesel prices, meanwhile, are tied to currently high oil prices, making it an easy target for natural gas companies promoting the cost savings of their fuel. Natural gas users can save as much as 30 to 40 percent on fuel costs for the energy equivalent of one diesel gallon. A recent conference in Houston drew makers of some of the world’s largest engines along with their users to discuss using natural gas instead of diesel for high horsepower applications. In joining the Diesel Technology Forum, the National Biodiesel Board is hoping to create more awareness for the benefits of diesel over other fuels, the organizations said in a statement. “Many people do not realize that today’s new technology diesel engines with ultra-low-sulfur biodiesel blends provide tailpipe emissions as clean or cleaner than natural gas or gasoline, while providing superior fuel economy, horsepower, and durability,” said Steve Howell, technical director of the board. “In addition, when you combine the increased efficiency diesel engines with the low-carbon nature of an advanced biofuel like biodiesel, new technology diesel engines are positioned to become the clean – and green – technology of the future.” Biodiesel makers convert used cooking oils, discarded animal fat and other materials into fuel that can be used in cars, trucks and heavy machinery. They range in size from small operations that collect waste materials from local restaurants to large-scale producers. Traditional diesel fuel is made from oil and has long been associated with dirty emissions, despite years of improvements that have made it both cleaner and more efficient. Diesel makers have said they do not fear any loss of business to natural gas because of an established and growing global customer base. Still, Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the forum, said the group’s partnership with the National Biodiesel Board will help it make a stronger case to the public and policymakers about diesel. “This is an excellent partnership with the Diesel Technology Forum’s mission of educating policymakers about the economic importance, energy efficiency and environmental progress of clean diesel technology,” Schaeffer said. “We share the common goal of assuring that future energy and transportation policies recognize the unique value and capabilities of diesel technology, particularly as it relates to the energy security and environmental benefits of the use of high-quality biodiesel fuels in diesel engines and equipment.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2012/12/27/biodiesel-makers-join-fight-for-diesel-over-natural-gas/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356619194874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:39:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356619484194-11</Id><Topic><Title>Biodiesel makers join ‘fight’ for diesel over natural gas</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356619194874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:39:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hawaii Petroleum loads first tanker of distilled biodiesel By Pacific Biodiesel Technologies | December 27, 2012 Hawaii Petroleum's Stanley Kauwe loads biodiesel into the underground tanks at the HFN station at Shipman Business Park. Photo: Pacific Biodiesel Technologies. Hawaii Petroleum loaded the first tanker of fuel produced at the Big Island Biodiesel facility in Kea ’au. The fuel is bound for its nearby Hawaii Fueling Network station in Shipman Business Park, which offers 100 percent biodiesel and a 20 percent blend. HFN has been selling biodiesel produced at Pacific Biodiesel’s facilities on Maui and Oahu at its recently opened station. With Big Island Biodiesel up and running, all of Pacific Biodiesel’s fuel will now be produced at the new facility, which has the ability to process the most degraded recycled vegetable oil feedstock into the highest quality biodiesel available in the country. The plant incorporates the newest technology that removes virtually all trace impurities and results in biodiesel that is clear instead of amber. Hawaii Petroleum recognizes that meeting the energy challenges of today and tomorrow requires both traditional hydrocarbons and a growing range of alternative fuels that deliver cleaner energy. Mark Leong, Vice President and General Manager, was at the plant for the first fueling. “We are proud to be the first to offer biodiesel on the Big Island through our HFN network and bulk deliveries,” Leong stated. “Pacific Biodiesel is excited to provide the nation’s best quality biodiesel for our customers,” said Jenna Long, fuel sales manager at Pacific Biodiesel. “We’re thrilled that Hawaii Petroleum is making this renewable, sustainable fuel available across the island. Hawaii Petroleum offers dependable bulk fuel and lubricant delivery services to all districts of the island. In addition, its HFN network has five commercial card lock sites in Hilo and Kona, as well as six HFN retail locations around the island that provide a convenient network of fueling sites. Its sister company, Maui Petroleum, offers similar services with nine HFN fueling locations on the Valley Isle. Hawaii Petroleum is committed to offering clean, affordable biofuels in Hawaii. biodieselmagazineDOTcom/articles/8860/hawaii-petroleum-loads-first-tanker-of-distilled-biodiesel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356619484194</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356619780818-12</Id><Topic><Title>Biodiesel makers join ‘fight’ for diesel over natural gas</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356619194874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:39:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Algae-based biodiesel project sets off in Dubai 27 December 2012 Dubai-based Lootah Biofuels is set to work with AlgaOil to research using algae for oil extraction outside of man-made ponds.

Prices are too high in the United States, and most Western countries, and the reason is partly the welfare state, and partly speculators. The speculators are why land values and commodities are grossly inflated, which is bad for industry as the industry takes those prices as costs. The other reason is the welfare state. Giving money to deadbeats imposes high costs on the society as (1) the money that goes to the deadbeats is diverted from investment to consumption, (2) the high taxes and or debt levels that are required to pay for the welfare makes the country hosting the deadbeats less competitive, and (3) the deadbeats become lazier and lazier, and less and less productive, the longer they collect welfare from the government. National healthcare systems do not present an equivalent difficulty because nobody aspires to be sick or injured, and deadbeats do not get the money to pay for medical services anyway, professionals get it. High standards of health improve productivity anyway. Other important areas like infrastructure, education, scientific research, and advanced weapons programs boost productivity - they are supply side stimuli flowing from government. Demand side stimuli, like welfare to bums, is not helpful.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356623967186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:59:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356625200781-20</Id><Topic><Title>Flushing the welfare state...</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356623967186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:59:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do Obama and the Democrats have the political will to reduce welfare spending?

No. They don't have the ability to follow a rational energy policy either. Neither do they don't understand supply side economics - even from the perspective of government being the supplier. I expect the USA to slide into an enormous depression in 2013-2014 and drag the rest of the world with it as neither party in America knows how to follow rational policies. The government will just keep taxing more and more, and eventually a right wing government will get elected that will follow a true supply side policy, using the expanded tax base to implement it. The healthcare crisis, the infrastructure crisis, the cultural chaos caused by the minority community, and the oil crisis will force the country toward a path of big government along a right wing European model, or something close to Eisenhower's or Truman's America.
