This notice of registration comes as building of the Indian River BioEnergy Center has finished and is going through the commissioning phase. The facility is scheduled to begin producing bioethanol in the third quarter of this year, with full production reaching 8 million gallons a year, in addition to 6MW of renewable power generated from biomass such as local yard, vegetative and agricultural wastes. 'We have completed this new facility on schedule and on budget and look forward to further advancing this bioenergy technology and making it commercially available around the world,' says Peter Williams, CEO of Ineos Bio and chairman of INPB. 'Building more facilities and licensing this technology globally provides a new platform for waste disposal while providing energy security, local jobs and local bioenergy. New technologies like this will also move us further away from and eventually change the food versus fuel debate.' The centre is the first large-scale project in the US to receive registrations for a facility producing cellulosic ethanol from non-food vegetative waste materials. http://www.biofuels-news.com/industry_news.php?item_id=5262</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344952744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 09:59:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344953023000-11</Id><Title>California pours cash into alternative fuel vehicles</Title><Msg>California pours cash into alternative fuel vehicles As the US state leading the way in the green car movement, California has taken another step towards boosting its environmental commitments. The California Energy Commission has approved funding close to $2million for the upgrading of a biodiesel production facility and the buy down of alternative fuel vehicles. Yokayo Biofuels Inc (pictured) will benefit from $1,860,330 to help with the expansion and upgrade of its biodiesel production facilities: this will see capacity increase from 1,400 gallons a day to 2,000 gallons a day with the use of an enzymatic production process. At the moment, the company collects fryer oil from restaurants and other facilities across the state before converting it to biodiesel. Now this enzymatic process should be both cleaner and more efficient while producing a higher quality of biodiesel. Meanwhile, $114,000 has been awarded to Big Valley Ford Inc in Stockton, California. This will go to the buy-down of 19 propane gas vehicles with weights of 8,501-14,000lbs. The incentives will pay for the difference between the alternative fuel vehicles and conventional vehicles.

CEO Patrick Daniel told a radio audience Monday. “Everything that we say sounds defensive and self-interested, and on the other side, everything they say ... is really taken as gospel — and it isn’t,” Daniel said on the Rutherford Show. “I think we’re facing a very strong, almost revolutionary movement to try to get off oil worldwide, and it creates a lot of passion and drive in those revolutionaries that are trying to change the environment in which we work. “They know that going after the end user, going after you and I when we drive our cars, ... won’t work. So they’re coming after what they consider to be the weak link in the whole process, and that’s the infrastructure part of it.” Calgary-based Enbridge wants to build the pipeline to the B.C. coast to export Alberta’s oilsands products to booming Asian countries. The company is mounting its own public relations offensive, taking out newspaper advertisements and pressing its leaders into the public spotlight, highlighting the company’s long safety record and decades of “dependable service” to Canadians. The Enbridge advertisement published last week in B.C., Alberta and Ontario newspapers says the company has transported almost 12 billion barrels of crude oil in the last decade, with a safe delivery record better than 99.999 per cent. “That’s good, but for us, it’s not good enough. We will never stop striving for 100 per cent,” the ad says. “Decades of experience has shown that pipelines are by far the safest, most efficient method of transporting large volumes of oil.” In 2011 the company spent $400 million to ensure the integrity of its system, the ad says, a figure that will double to $800 million in 2012. Enbridge’s pipeline proposal is also under attack from aboriginal groups for its plan to build the 1,177-kilometre pipeline from Hardisty, Alta. to Kitimat, B.C. The criticism intensified last month when the U.S. National Transportation and Safety Board released a scathing report that said Enbridge’s handling of a massive spill in Michigan was akin to the Keystone Kops for its bumbling. In the wake of that report, B.C. Premier Christy Clark said her province wouldn’t support construction of the pipeline unless it gets its “fair share” of royalties in exchange for taking on the environmental risks associated with the project. http://www.edmontonjournal.com/opinion/blogs/Enbridge+says+environmental+groups+have+taken+control+pipeline+debate/7084411/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344969019000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:30:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344969032000-27</Id><Topic><Title>Enbridge CEO says environmental groups have taken control of pipeline debate</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344969019000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:30:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last week, former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan criticized government and oilsands producers for failing to come to Enbridge’s defence in the public relations battle. “The pipeline industry’s self-inflicted wounds, along with complete failure by the Alberta government and oilsands producers to understand the realpolitik of B.C., have made Premier Clark’s stance politically inevitable,” Morgan wrote. Travis Davies, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the organization is engaging Canadians through print advertising, public consultations and performance. “You can win (the public relations battle) with performance, and finding solutions, which is something they don’t do,” Davies said. “They’re not spending billions on research and development to figure out how to use less water and produce less emissions while increasing the amount of energy for North Americans. “They are profoundly not interested in finding ways to be more proficient with our oil and gas resources. We understand the onus is on us and it’s our role to find those solutions and throw resources at tough challenges. And that’s what we do.”</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344969032000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344969286000-28</Id><Title>Pipeline debate ‘entirely appropriate for people in B.C.’ Redford says</Title><Msg>Pipeline debate ‘entirely appropriate for people in B.C.’ Redford says But Alberta premier reiterates stand against sharing energy royalties By James Wood, Calgary HeraldAugust 14, 2012 11:14 AM Premier Alison Redford said Tuesday British Columbians are free to debate the merits of the controversial Northern Gateway pipeline proposal. But the B.C. government can’t make Alberta energy royalties a bargaining chip when it comes to whether the $5.5 billion project goes ahead, she told reporters in Vancouver. Redford spoke at the Canadian Bar Association’s annual Canadian Legal Conference Tuesday morning but had no meetings with Premier Christy Clark or any other member of the B.C. government. Alberta and B.C. are embroiled in a dispute over Northern Gateway after Clark demanded a “fair share” of the economic benefits of the project, including a potential slice of the energy royalties that would come to Alberta. That was flatly rejected by Alberta and at a tense Council of the Federation meeting in late July. B.C. refused to take part in provincial discussions around Redford’s call for a Canadian energy strategy. “It’s entirely appropriate for people in British Columbia to have a discussion with respect to whether or not this makes sense for people in British Columbia,” said Redford in a recording of a media scrum posted online by her communications staff. “What I’ve been saying as premier of Alberta is that it’s important for us all as political leaders to work together to ensure there is access to international markets and that there isn’t any particular province that should get more access or less access to international markets based on a geographical location.” If approved by regulators, the project by Calgary-based Enbridge will carry oilsands crude to the B.C. coast and Asia-bound tankers, opening vital new export markets for Alberta crude. Redford said she expected there would be discussions with B.C. in the future but noted that other provinces are onside with the Canadian energy strategy idea. “We have every other premier across the country understanding the importance of the energy economy and understanding that it’s important for all Canadians that we do work together,” she said. http://www.timescolonist.com/news/alberta/Pipeline+debate+entirely+appropriate+people+Redford+says/7088686/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344969286000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344969846000-29</Id><Title>RIM trading at half valuation of XOM, and will b taken out,</Title><Msg>This usually leads Oils lower</Msg><Username>causinginflation</Username><Timestamp>1344969846000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344970008000-30</Id><Title>No pipeline talks with Clark during Redford’s B.C. visit</Title><Msg>No pipeline talks with Clark during Redford’s B.C. visit The Canadian Press Published Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012 7:19AM PDT Friction over an oil pipeline between two western premiers isn't stopping Alberta's Alison Redford from visiting British Columbia. Redford, who's a lawyer, will be in Vancouver today to speak at the Canadian Bar Association's annual conference. But it seems the quarrelling leaders won't be meeting, as the spokesman for Christy Clark says she's on vacation this week and unavailable. Redford and Clark find themselves at odds over B.C.'s demand for a greater piece of the revenue pie from the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline that would deliver oil from the Alberta oilsands to tankers on the Pacific coast. Clark walked out of a premier's meeting last month, refusing to sign onto a national energy strategy until Ottawa and Alberta sit down to talk about royalties from the $6-billion project. Redford has said she sees no need for discussion between the two provinces on the matter. http://bc.ctvnews.ca/no-pipeline-talks-with-clark-during-redford-s-b-c-visit-1.913522</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344970008000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344971277000-31</Id><Title>GOP= pork for pigs/pigs for pork</Title><Msg>http://bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2012/08/13/paul-ryan-district-supported-energy-funds-while-decrying-stimulus-program/qkXIN2eHgyt4yyBSH81WEJ/story.html fiscal conservative porky pig what a joke the GOP has become and that people that support the hypocrisy</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1344971277000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:07:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344971799000-32</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Flopping like a Fish out of Water.

(APA) told shareholders in April that it disclosed information about “all the company’s U.S. hydraulic fracturing jobs” on a website last year. Actually, Apache’s transparency was shot through with cracks. In Texas and Oklahoma, the company reported chemicals it used on only about half its fracked wells via FracFocus.org, a voluntary website that oil and gas companies helped design amid calls for mandatory disclosure. Energy companies failed to list more than two out of every five fracked wells in eight U.S. states from April 11, 2011, when FracFocus began operating, through the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gaps reveal shortcomings in the voluntary approach to transparency on the site, which has received funding from oil and gas trade groups and $1.5 million from the U.S. Department of Energy. “FracFocus is just a fig leaf for the industry to be able to say they’re doing something in terms of disclosure,” said U.S. Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat. DeGette, along with Pennsylvania Senator Robert Casey, introduced legislation in March 2011 that would require companies to disclose fracking chemicals. The bills haven’t advanced in either the House or Senate. With FracFocus, “companies that want to disclose can do it but the other ones don’t have to,” DeGette said. 85% Fracked Bloomberg compared oil and gas well records from eight states -- Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming -- against disclosures that companies made for those states on FracFocus. While the state data didn’t reveal whether wells were fractured, regulators in each state said that at least 85 percent of their wells were fracked. The Congressional Research Service puts the national estimate at more than 90 percent. In the eight states, companies told regulators that 18,158 wells were readied for production or were newly producing from April 11, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2011. They disclosed 8,555 of them on FracFocus. If 85 percent of the total wells were fracked, that means 45 percent of the fracks weren’t disclosed on the website. Bloomberg’s analysis, covering states that accounted for 64 percent of U.S. gas production in 2010, shows the difficulty of getting a full picture of the industry’s transparency. Because there’s no official national database of fracked wells, Bloomberg chose states that had reliable records on when gas and oil wells started producing or were completed -- that is, made ready to flow -- and thus were candidates for posting on FracFocus. No Reports Oil and gas companies have gotten better at listing their fractured wells on the website over time, said Dan Whitten, a spokesman for America’s Natural Gas Alliance, one of two industry groups that help pay operational costs for the website. Some states now require companies to make disclosures on FracFocus, he said. “ANGA operators are committed to transparency, and http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/fracking-hazards-obscured-in-failure-to-disclose-wells.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344982417000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:13:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344985044000-38</Id><Title>No pipeline cash for B.C. from Alberta's piece of the pie: Redford</Title><Msg>No pipeline cash for B.C. from Alberta's piece of the pie: Redford The Canadian Press Published Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012 12:12PM EDT Last Updated Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012 5:24PM EDT VANCOUVER -- If the past month has been a cooling off period for B.C. and Alberta in the heated dispute over royalties from the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline, relations may be turning downright icy. Alberta Premier Alison Redford was in Clark's backyard Tuesday where she reiterated that she has not and will not be meeting with her B.C. counterpart to discuss any sharing of Alberta royalties from the proposed multibillion-dollar pipeline project. "She made her position very clear. Ours is very clear. Our position hasn't changed," Redford told reporters following a speech to the Canadian Bar Association. "We believe that it's very important for economic benefits to be spread across the country and we don't believe that fundamentally changing Confederation to allow that to happen is appropriate, and so wouldn't entertain any discussion with respect to sharing of Alberta royalties." A spokesman for Clark said the B.C. premier is on vacation. Redford's appearance at the legal conference was booked in May, well before Clark sparked the dispute with a list of criteria for B.C.'s support for the pipeline proposed by Calgary-based Enbridge (TSX:ENB) that included a greater share of royalties. The B.C. Liberal leader underscored the demand by walking out of a discussion on a national energy strategy at the Council of the Federation meeting last month. In a speech that made no direct mention of Northern Gateway or the simmering dispute between the two provinces, Redford championed a unified approach to Canada's economic future, in what appeared to be a subtle rebuke of the B.C. position. "We need to ensure that our actions are fiscally responsible and fair, not only to this generation but to those who follow and this means doing what's right for the long term, and not the next election cycle." Clark is set to go to the polls next May, in a province where the pipeline project has deeply divided the public. The proposal by Enbridge would see twin pipelines deliver diluted bitumen over 1,170 kilometres from the oilsands in northern Alberta to a terminal to be built for tankers near Kitimat, B.C. A federal environmental review panel has until Dec. 31, 2013, to complete its review. Asked after her speech how the impasse can be resolved if the two leaders do not meet, Redford said she was sure that at some point in the future the two will meet, but there are no plans for that as yet. "We have every other premier across this country understanding the importance of an energy economy and understanding that it's important for all Canadians that we do work together," she said. It's entirely appropriate for British Columbians to have a discussion about http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/no-pipeline-cash-for-b-c-from-alberta-s-piece-of-the-pie-redford-1.913734</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344985044000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344985077000-39</Id><Topic><Title>No pipeline cash for B.C. from Alberta's piece of the pie: Redford</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344985044000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:57:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's entirely appropriate for British Columbians to have a discussion about whether the Northern Gateway project is right for their province, she said. "What' I've been saying as the premier of Alberta is it's important for us all as political leaders to work together to ensure that there is access to international markets and that there isn't any particular province that should get more access or less access to international markets based on their geographic location," Redford told reporters. A spokesman for Clark said the premier was not available to comment on Redford's remarks, and that B.C.'s position hasn't changed in any event. "Our position is still that the ball is in Alberta's court. We laid out our five principles in Halifax and that stands today," Mike Morton said Tuesday. B.C. will receive about $6 billion of an estimated $81 billion in tax revenue over the 30 years of the project. Ottawa is expected to receive about $36 billion and Alberta $32 billion. In her speech, Redford said she continues to work with provincial and territorial leaders toward a national energy strategy, and she warned against tying that strategy to a single project. "Market access must be a part of that because it's a national imperative that's essential to Canada's economic health. It just doesn't make sense to have only one market for your biggest export, and it also doesn't make much sense for anyone, or any province, or any jurisdiction, to go it alone. We need to work together. That's when all Canadians benefit."</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344985077000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:57:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344993282000-40</Id><Title>demands consideration of 'Keystone Kops' report on Enbridge</Title><Msg>demands consideration of 'Keystone Kops' report on Enbridge http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/energy-resources/Northern+Gateway+pipeline+review+panel+demands/7089895/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344993282000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 21:14:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345001252000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Did Israel Assassinate FBI Agent Brad Doucette?</Title><Username>phil_garner_50</Username><Timestamp>1345000140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:09:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Strong message sent to any FBI/CIA agents with a integrity</Msg><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1345001252000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:27:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
