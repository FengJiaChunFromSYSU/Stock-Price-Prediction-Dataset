The Republican Party draws its support from areas of the USA with the lowest rate of University attendance, the lowest worker productivity, and lowest income so this is not surprising. Fossil fuels &amp; other high polluting industries, cigarette mfg, gun sports, a militaristic lifestyle, and religion are the defining characteristics of the Republican “heartland” of America. To the extent they value education they value American "science" (free market dogma): “Business” schools and accountancy or more lawyers. Things that really cost money like the education real scientists is of course not fitting with the ideology. The "Business" ideology merges with the dogma of "market knows best" and becomes a truism to them. The fact is “market” does not know best. This has been proven through mathematical game theory by people such as Nash and von Neumann and in practice by governments across Europe. The solution to the problem Bennett points out is state control of education and planning such as Germany has been doing for quite some time now. That works much better. University is certainly not the problem. Republican ideology is the problem.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368365905130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368366721664-6</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi, corrupt IRS----that's OBUMMER for you</Title><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1368281396004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 10:09:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'll say it again</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1368366721664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:52:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368372248164-7</Id><Title>racist exxon gas station owners</Title><Msg>slant eyed beeech treated me like I gave her a fake 20. racist #$%$.</Msg><Username>demsenate4obama</Username><Timestamp>1368372248164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 11:24:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368384300626-8</Id><Title>In the Spotlight: China leaves U.S. behind in pursuit of clean energy</Title><Msg>By Ramez Naam Slate Published: Sunday, May. 12, 2013 - 12:00 am China is an environmental mess. Smog in Beijing is so bad it's literally broken the air-quality index. In Shanghai, it's at times turned the city into a scene from "Blade Runner." Meanwhile, thousands of dead pigs – cause of death not yet known – have been floating down a river that cuts through Shanghai and provides part of the region's drinking water. More than half of China's water is so polluted that even treatment plants can't make it safe to drink. And China is now responsible for almost half the world's coal consumption. That coal burning not only contributes to climate change – it has also saddled China with severe cases of acid rain, something the United States dealt with a generation ago. All of that makes what I'm about to say sound even crazier: China may one day be the world's leader in combating climate change. In almost every way you cut it, China is already taking a much more aggressive approach toward climate change than the United States. This is important for two reasons. First, China is seeing the world's fastest growth in energy consumption and in CO2 emissions. In the United States and Europe, by contrast, energy usage is nearly flat and CO2 emissions are down. So China's policies exert a huge lever on future CO2 emissions. Second, one of the prime arguments against U.S. action on climate change has been that it doesn't matter what the United States does if China isn't on board. Well, China already is on board in a number of ways that the United States isn't. Consider the following: • China is launching a cap- and-trade plan. In the United States, the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade plan fizzled in the Senate in 2009. In China, authorities have moved forward with pilot cap-and-trade systems covering seven regions, including the manufacturing-hub provinces of Guangdong and Hubei, as well as the cities of sacbeeDOTcom/2013/05/12/5411938/china-leaves-us-behind-in-pursuit.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368384300626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 14:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368402693194-9</Id><Topic><Title>racist exxon gas station owners</Title><Username>demsenate4obama</Username><Timestamp>1368372248164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 11:24:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO....she just knew you were an "4 Obama A hole.

MCKINNON and SIOBHAN HUGHES WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative groups went beyond those that had "tea party" or "patriot" in their names—as the agency admitted Friday—to also include ones that raised concerns over government spending, debt or taxes, and even ones that lobbied to "make America a better place to live," according to new details of a government probe. The investigation also revealed that a high-ranking IRS official knew as early as mid-2011 that conservative groups were being inappropriately targeted—nearly a year before then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told a congressional committee the agency wasn't targeting conservative groups. The new disclosures are likely to inflame a widening controversy over IRS handling of dozens of applications by tea-party, patriot and other conservative groups for tax-exempt status. The details emerged from disclosures to congressional investigators by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The findings, which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, don't make clear who came up with the idea to give extra scrutiny to the conservative groups. The inspector general's office has been conducting an audit of the IRS's handling of the applications process and is expected to release a report this week. The audit follows complaints last year by numerous tea-party and other conservative groups that they had been singled out and subjected to excessive and inappropriate questioning. Many groups say they were asked for lists of their donors and other sensitive information.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1368405761619</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:42:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368405879724-11</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi, corrupt IRS----that's OBUMMER for you</Title><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1368281396004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 10:09:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'LL SAY IT AGAIN</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1368405879724</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368405907011-12</Id><Topic><Title>The Land of the Uneducated</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368365905130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your posts prove the point as to why no one wants to emulate Germany - it produces self-righteous but impractical nutcases like you.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1368405907011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:45:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368409851875-13</Id><Topic><Title>The Land of the Uneducated</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368365905130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL, good point Infernal. hansesteelyard is apparently from Germany.....OK on that point.
