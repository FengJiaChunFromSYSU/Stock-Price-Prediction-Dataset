The 194 nations now present are discussing an array of thorny matters that most notably include the ways and means by which the developed world will assist those less developed. No one is expecting a far-reaching agreement whereby the national governments would bind themselves to firm cuts in their greenhouse gas releases. That’s especially true as the major emitters -- the United States and China -- have never signed on to such a deal. Meanwhile, Canada, Japan and Russia, which inked the original Kyoto Protocol in 1997, are no longer onboard. That inertia, however, is now running headfirst into new warnings: Fifty-five scientists representing a cross-section of nations authored a UN report last week that says that the world must keep its rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius this century, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. But those same experts are saying that current national measures to reduce greenhouse emissions won’t cut it. “There are many inspiring actions taking place at the national level on energy efficiency in buildings, investing in forests to avoid emissions linked with deforestation and new vehicle emissions standards,” says Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General. He adds that those steps are occurring alongside new investments in renewable energies, which totaled $260 billion in 2011. “Yet the sobering fact remains that a transition to a low carbon Green Economy is happening far too slowly,” he adds, noting that the opportunity to meet the threshold from which to permanently slow down world temperatures is fast approaching. The need is urgent to fulfill the financial and technology transfers to those nations that must expand their economies in a responsible way. Two issues stand in the way those goals, says Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. The first is getting to an agreement on the amount of money to be transferred and the second is the language associated with any treaty as it pertains to exactly how much and by what methods carbon cuts would occur. Temperature Rise To that end, developed countries are supposed to give $100 billion to poorer ones by 2020, all to help them curb their heat-trapping emissions. But the richer nations are already over-extended, casting doubt on their near-term promises. “Washington knows that it cannot deliver massive sums of money in the next few years, and as a result, it will not sign up to financial pledges that others might push for,” writes Levi. As for Kyoto, it is requiring developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels before the end of 2012. The European Union (EU) has set out to accomplish this by enacting a renewable portfolio standard that includes energy efficiency measures of 20 percent by 2020. According to the European Environment Agency, 15 EU countries have cut such emissions by 10.7 percent below 1990 levels. However, carbon emissions are now rising -- a move that the agency says is being constrained because of moves away from coal and into natural gas and renewables. Europe’s strides, though, are not trending. Data compiled by the UN shows that global carbon emissions have increased by 25 percent since 2000. China has doubled its releases in the last decade while India's has risen by 50 percent. The UN is trying to see the glass as half-full, emphasizing that the rapidly developing countries of Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa have concrete plans to reduce their emissions. They will also allow their progress to be monitored and verified. China, for example, has set upon a course to increase its green and nuclear energy as a way to cut into its coal-fired power base. "Governments meeting in (Qatar) now need to urgently implement existing decisions which will allow for a swifter transition towards a low-carbon and resilient world,” says Christiana Figueres, executive secretary for the UN climate panel. “This notably means amending the Kyoto Protocol, developing a clear vision of how greenhouse gases can be curbed globally before and after 2020.” The current climate change talks are unlikely to produce a major breakthrough. But negotiations will likely resolve some critical details, which inlcude the technological and financial assistance required by the developing world. Whether those steps are enough to keep the escalation in the world’s temperatures below the threshold the UN would like, however, is still unknown. energybizDOTcom/article/12/11/us-mulls-financial-details-embedded-global-climate-change-talks</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354166112143</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 00:15:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354183173663-2</Id><Topic><Title>Heads Up Gentlemen !

U.S. Gulf Coast refineries are using these high-quality domestically produced streams to replace imported oil from West Africa and other sources. Flows of light sweet crude oil via rail to both East and West Coast refiners are also increasing. If U.S. light sweet crude oil production continues to rise strongly over the next several years, Gulf Coast refiners may be able to satisfy all of their current demand for light sweet crude oil with domestic production. Gulf Coast refiners could probably absorb additional volumes of light sweet crude oil to replace some imports of heavier crude oil streams that many of the refineries in the region are designed to use, but this could reduce the production of some high-value products and also reduce operating rates of some sophisticated refinery units used to convert low-quality, lower-priced heavy crudes into high-value products. Traditional price premiums for light crude would probably have to fall to incentivize such behavior. For this reason, increased exports may be a more attractive option for producers if an excess of light sweet crude oil in the Gulf Coast market actually develops. In the November Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that U.S. crude oil production will reach 6.85 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2013, a 0.52-million-bbl/d increase from the 2012 level that is itself projected to be 0.78 million bbl/d above the 2011 level. Currently, crude oil produced in the United States can be exported only when a license is granted by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which is a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, under regulations promulgated in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 15 Part 754.2. Notwithstanding these requirements, export volumes are growing. Year-to-date (through August) exports of crude oil averaged 58,000 bbl/d, more than twice the volume exported in 2007 (Figure 1). Most exported crude oil is shipped from the Midwest to Canada. According to the regulation, BIS will approve applications to export crude oil for the following kinds of transactions if BIS determines that the export is consistent with the specific requirements pertinent to that export: • Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet • Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein • Exports in connection with refining or exchange of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil • Exports of 25,000 bbl/d of California heavy crude oil • Exports that are consistent with findings made by the president under an applicable statute • Exports of foreign-origin crude oil where, based on written documentation satisfactory to BIS, the exporter can demonstrate that the oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil of U.S. origin. Outside of these conditions, the regulation stipulates that BIS will review all other applications to export crude oil on a case-by-case basis, and will approve such applications if it determines that the proposed export is consistent with the national interest and the purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). License exceptions are provided for certain types of crude oil exports, including Alaska North Slope crude transported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. When BIS grants a license to export crude oil, the license is granted for a defined period of time, limited to one year from date of issue, and for a specific dollar value, as opposed to a specific volume of crude oil. Licenses for export of crude oil to Canada are regularly requested, and BIS is obligated by statute to approve such requests so long as they meet the requirement that the crude oil be processed in Canada, rather than stored and then re-exported. As noted, exports of crude oil from the United States have been increasing and, at 58,000 bbl/d year-to-date through August, are on pace to be the highest since 1999, when the United States exported 118,000 bbl/d of crude oil, more than half of which came from Alaska. Most of the growth in export volumes has come from North Dakota. Year-to-date through August, North Dakota has exported 25,000 bbl/d of crude oil to Canada, up from just 2,000 bbl/d in 2007. Prior to the growth in North Dakota exports, the largest volumes came from Michigan for processing in refineries in Sarnia, Ontario. Other significant export flows from the United States to Canada have come from New York. Prior to 2007, licenses were also granted to export Alaskan North Slope crude to the Pacific Rim countries, most notably South Korea. Some limited volumes have also gone to Latin American countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica. Since 2011, applications received by BIS to export crude have increased along with the increase in light sweet crude production from tight oil formations in Texas and North Dakota (Eagle Ford and Bakken). As light sweet crude oil production in the United States continues to increase, applications to export crude oil are also likely to rise. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices both increase The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased a penny last week to $3.44 per gallon, 13 cents higher than last year at this time. Prices east of the Rockies increased, while those in the West decreased. The largest increase came in the Midwest, where the average price rose four cents to $3.39 per gallon, while both the East Coast and Gulf Coast prices increased a penny, to $3.49 per gallon and $3.17 per gallon, respectively. The Rocky Mountain price is now $3.47 per gallon and the West Coast price is $3.67 per gallon, both decreases of four cents from last week. The national average diesel fuel price increased six cents to $4.03 per gallon, seven cents higher than last year at this time. The only decrease came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price is down less than a penny to remain at $4.06 per gallon. The largest increase came in the Midwest, where the price increased 11 cents to $4.02 per gallon. The East and Gulf Coast prices both increased four cents, to $4.09 per gallon and $3.90 per gallon, respectively. The Gulf Coast is now the only region where the price is less than $4 per gallon. Rounding out the regions, the West Coast price remains the highest in the Nation at $4.12 per gallon, an increase of two cents from last week. Propane inventories post unseasonal build Total U.S. inventories of propane increased 0.2 million barrels last week to end at 72.8 million barrels, 22 percent higher than the same week a year ago. The Gulf Coast region led the gain, with 0.5 million barrels. Meanwhile, Midwest, Rocky Mountain/West Coast, and East Coast stocks each fell 0.1 million barrels. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.8 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating fuel prices increase, wholesale changes mixed Residential heating oil prices increased during the period ending November 26, 2012. The average residential heating oil price increased by 3 cents to $4.00 per gallon, nearly 11 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices rose less than 5 cents per gallon last week to reach $3.25 per gallon, almost 19 cents per gallon more than last year at this time. The average residential propane price increased by less than a penny last week to slightly more than $2.41 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices decreased by 2 cents to $0.92 per gallon for the week ending November 26, 2012, 53 cents per gallon lower than the November 28, 2011 price. eiaDOTgov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp --------------------------------- Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report November 29, 2012 November 29, 2012 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending November 23, 2012 Notes and Definitions The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is changing the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR) web products. The implementation of these changes will be preceded by a public testing period, commencing on November 27, 2012. An example of the new webpage and more information about the public testing period, including specific times, can be found at: eia Summary Working gas in storage was 3,877 Bcf as of Friday, November 23, 2012, according to EIA estimates. This represents a net increase of 4 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 26 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 190 Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,687 Bcf. In the East Region, stocks were 5 Bcf above the 5-year average following net withdrawals of 12 Bcf. Stocks in the Producing Region were 135 Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,152 Bcf after a net injection of 12 Bcf. Stocks in the West Region were 50 Bcf above the 5-year average after a net addition of 4 Bcf. At 3,877 Bcf, total working gas is above the 5-year historical range. Working gas stocks in the Producing Region, for the week ending November 23, 2012, totaled 1,287 Bcf, with 317 Bcf in salt cavern facilities and 970 Bcf in nonsalt cavern facilities.

The institute had petitioned EPA to craft the regulations in 2009 and says the public’s urgency for discussing climate change is heightened after Hurricane Sandy pounded New York, New Jersey and much of the rest of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. “The damage caused by superstorm Sandy was widely linked to some of the potential risks associated with a warming planet. It highlighted the need to work faster to bring down emissions,” Livermore said. The cap the group is seeking would limit the amount of fuel going into the U.S. economy from refiners and fuel importers, Livermore told POLITICO. “Covering fuels under a cap-and-trade program will create a disincentive to introduce carbon-heavy fuels into commerce and instead will promote innovation in low-carbon fuels as well as in more efficient vehicle designs,” the 2009 petition reads. “Each permit would allow the sale of fuel representing a certain amount of potential greenhouse-gas emissions. EPA would then cap the total number of permits auctioned off to fuel manufacturers. As with any cap-and-trade system, covered entities would pass along the cost of the allowances to consumers, who will take into account the increased prices when deciding how much and which fuels to purchase.” Livermore said consumers wouldn’t have to bear the brunt of such a system. “The standard worry is that when you do a price on carbon it’s bad for consumers,” but this rule can be done in a way that “protects consumers” from price increases, Livermore said. The institute’s plan “isn’t about changing the administration’s priorities for the next six months,” Livermore said. On the other hand, he said, “We want to make sure there’s still progress.” EPA has developed rules with the Transportation Department mandating a dramatic tightening of fuel-efficiency standards for new cars. But there are many more cars on the road, Livermore said, so more action is necessary. “If we really want to get serious … there’s going to have to be a cap,” Livermore said. The group cites Section 211 of the Clean Air Act as the main vehicle for its demands. In 2009, the institute filed a petition asking the EPA to use its Section 211 authority to “institute a regulatory cap-and-trade system on the sale and manufacture of fuels used in vehicles.” EPA hasn’t yet responded to the petition. “Section 211 of the statute authorizes EPA to regulate fuels and fuel additives used in motor vehicles and nonroad vehicles,” the center writes in a letter to the agency dated Nov. 28. It adds that “Section 211(c) provides sufficient discretion to EPA to ‘control’ or ‘prohibit’ the manufacture of fuel through a cap-and-trade program, after making an endangerment finding with respect to a fuel or fuel additive.” The group also wants to see EPA extend the cap-and-trade program to airline emissions, using Section 231 of the air act. Section 211 of the act is limited to the transportation sector — it doesn’t involve the electricity-generating sector. But “we think there are ways elsewhere in the act” to loop in other sectors, Livermore said. EPA didn’t have a detailed response to the group’s action Wednesday. “We will review the lawsuit and respond accordingly,” said agency spokeswoman Alisha Johnson. politicoDOTcom/story/2012/11/84346.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354208211259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:56:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354209337018-9</Id><Title>Texas Grid Sets New Wind Power Record &amp; Aims Much Higher Could Texas Reach 75% Wind?</Title><Msg>Texas Grid Sets New Wind Power Record &amp; Aims Much Higher Earlier this month, Texas set a new record for the percentage of electricity generated by wind power, a staggering 26 percent of total supply across the state’s main grid system. Wind turbines generated 8,521 megawatts (MW) of electricity just after 10:00 a.m. on November 10. More than 7,000 MW came from wind farms in West Texas, with around 1,100 MW coming from installations along the Gulf of Mexico coast. This mark beat the previous record by more than 150 MW, was enough to power 4.3 million average Texas homes, and represented 85% of the state’s optimal wind generation output, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Wind has represented around 9% of ERCOT’s supply for much of 2011, but that share is growing. “We have surpassed previous wind power records several times this year,” said Kent Saathoff, ERCOT vice president of Grid Operations and System Planning. “While added capacity is one reason for this growth, experience and improved tools are enabling ERCOT to integrate this resource into the grid more effectively than ever before.” ERCOT actual load and wind output Could Texas Reach 75% Wind? ERCOT manages the grid for 85% of the state’s total electric load, matching supply and demand for 23 million customers across 40,500 miles of transmission lines. Texas already has the most installed wind capacity of any state in America with a total of 10,929 MW and 10,000 MW within the ERCOT system. But more installed wind capacity than many countries isn’t enough for the state where bigger is better. Texas could conceivably triple the amount of installed wind capacity in the state. Roughly 21,000MW of new wind turbines are under review by ERCOT, and the state is nearing the completion of several massive transmission projects designed to move wind power from West Texas to eastern metropolitan areas where demand is highest. ERCOT wind installations 2000-2015 Winds of Economic Change Wind played a key role in limiting blackouts during freezing conditions in 2011, and could become an even greater part of the state’s energy and economic future. Considering the potential of West Texas wind turbines, it’s not hard to see an ideal situation where 30,000 MW of installed wind capacity could meet 75% of the state’s total demand – especially with 2,400 miles of new transmission lines improving the grid operator’s ability to move wind across the state. The Texas renewable energy industry report, released this summer, estimates the wind industry will help add 6,000 renewable jobs per year through 2020 and contributes to 1,300 companies and 100,000 jobs, in total. Imagine adding 200% more to those numbers. But, of course – Texas’ wind energy potential ultimately depends a great deal upon renewal of the federal Production Tax Credit. Combined with wind power records being set across the country, ERCOT’s newest announcement is proof once again that wind power make economic sense regardless of party affiliation.

The Demoncraps now totally "own" the USA economy, and everyone who can't readily accept this should just take a pill or a drink and relax as they continue to rape the USA until there is no more USA; in fact, it is now pretty much the USSA.

US ethanol production -- categorized by the EPA in the renewable fuel (D6) category consisting of corn-based ethanol, the main type produced in the US -- rebounded from the previous month's lowest recorded level as it climbed 71.629 million gallons, or 7.3%, to 1.055 billion gallons, according to the EPA data, on the agency's Moderated Tracking System website. Year-to-date, current year ethanol production totaled 10.884 billion gallons. The 2012 ethanol production target for the Renewable Fuels Standard-2 mandate is 11.7 billion gallons. With only two months left in 2012, year-to-date ethanol production is at 93% of the 2012 mandate target. October advanced biofuel (D5) production -- mostly comprising ethanol derived from feedstock sugarcane -- edged up 98,212 gallons, or 0.1%, to 77.497 million gallons. Year-to-date, however, current year production was at only 392.846 million gallons. The 2012 advanced biofuel target for the Renewable Fuels Standard-2 is 2 billion gallons, which means that total domestic advanced biofuel production in 2012 was at 19.6% of the mandate target. Although domestic advanced biofuel production faces a tough challenge the rest of the year to catch up to the mandate, imports from Brazil, where ethanol is derived from feedstock sugarcane, can help meet the mandate target. plattsDOTcom/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6851121</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354234852930</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 19:20:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354235964649-27</Id><Title>Monthly Biodiesel Production Report With Data for September 2012</Title><Msg>Monthly Biodiesel Production Report With Data for September 2012 Release Date: November 29, 2012 | Next Release Date: December 28, 2012 Highlights Production - U.S. production of biodiesel was 81 million gallons in September 2012. Biodiesel production from the Midwest region (Petroleum Administration for Defense District 2) was 73% of the U.S. total. Production came from 105 biodiesel plants with operable capacity of 2.1 billion gallons per year. Biodiesel production during January-September 2012 was 782 million gallons, which was up from production of 648 million gallons during the first 9 months of 2011. Sales - Producer sales of biodiesel during September 2012 included 61 million gallons sold as B100 (100% biodiesel) and an additional 17 million gallons of B100 sold in biodiesel blends with diesel fuel derived from petroleum. Feedstocks - Soybean oil was the largest biodiesel feedstock during September 2012 with 322 million pounds consumed. The next three largest biodiesel feedstocks during the period were yellow grease (62 million pounds), corn oil (55 million pounds), and tallow (49 million pounds). eiaDOTgov/biofuels/biodiesel/production/ Full Report pdf eiaDOTgov/biofuels/biodiesel/production/biodiesel.pdf</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354235964649</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 19:39:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354237838582-28</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Things Is On To Something</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354229553701</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:52:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when is it you are going to walk your talk and leave the USA since Obama got elected ?? step up/off for once in your life</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1354237838582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 20:10:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354245220795-29</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Things Is On To Something</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354229553701</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:52:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should wait until 2015 to buy.

A123, which is the sole battery supplier for the Karma, slowed production after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said. Fisker has enough lithium-ion batteries on hand in case an owner needs a replacement, Ormisher said. The company expects to have clarity on its battery inventory after December 6, when an auction to sell A123 is scheduled. Auto parts suppliers Johnson Controls Inc (JCI) and China's Wanxiang Group Corp are among the potential buyers who will square off to buy A123. Other companies that have expressed interest in A123 include NEC Corp of Japan and Siemens AG (SIE.DE) of Germany. The U.S. government said this week that A123 could not be sold without its consent. Fisker and A123 have both received funding under a federal program designed to create an advanced vehicle manufacturing base in the United States. Bloomberg reported news of the idled production earlier Thursday. Fisker has faced a series of setbacks this year, including a recall of batteries made by A123 and the U.S. Department of Energy's decision to block Fisker from accessing a portion of its $529 million loan. On Wednesday, the company pushed back its China launch for the $100,000-plus Karma to the first quarter of next year from the end of 2012.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354246100814</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 22:28:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354246283568-33</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Things Is On To Something</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354229553701</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:52:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Invest, you're an idiot.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354246283568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 22:31:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354246371898-34</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Things Is On To Something</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354229553701</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:52:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And you're a loser!
