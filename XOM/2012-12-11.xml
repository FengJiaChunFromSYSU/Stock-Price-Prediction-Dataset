Rather, it is a cost-effective way of meeting the advanced biofuel requirement in the renewable fuel standard (RFS). And by that, they mean it is cheaper than biodiesel. The two economists offered their analysis in the Dec. 7 issue of FarmDocDaily, “What’s Driving the Surge in Ethanol Imports?” They note that Brazilian ethanol, delivered to the U.S. Gulf was $2.85 on Nov. 29, when U.S.-produced ethanol at Gulf terminals was $2.60 per gallon. That same day CBOB was $2.52 per gallon -- a 33 cent spread. That is far more favorable than the spread between ULS diesel at the Gulf of $3.03 per gallon and B100 at $4.08, a spread of $1.05. “One final conversion must be done to make a fair comparison,” the analysis continues. “Since biodiesel is worth 1.5 gallons of ethanol in the RFS math, we need to divide the net profit for diesel blending by 1.5 to arrive at a net profit of -$1.05/1.5 = -70 cents per gallon. This makes biodiesel almost twice as expensive as imported Brazilian ethanol when it comes to meeting the advanced RFS mandate. And that is the reason why Brazilian ethanol imports are surging into the U.S. during recent months.” With Brazil ethanol imports adding to blend wall pressures, the authors also note that a reinstatement of the $1 per gallon tax credit for biodiesel blend would provide more room for U.S.-produced ethanol. ethanolproducerDOTcom/articles/9371/ethanol-imported-as-advanced-biofuel-competes-with-biodiesel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355207855562</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 01:37:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355207992764-2</Id><Title>Ethanol imported as advanced biofuel competes with biodiesel</Title><Msg>Ethanol imported as advanced biofuel competes with biodiesel By Susanne Retka Schill | December 10, 2012 Ethanol imports from Brazil have surged into the U.S. in recent months, University of Illinois ag economists Scott Irwin and Darrel Good point out, but not because it is cheap relative to ethanol.

"A man — seemingly by himself — had stood up at a town hall meeting in that country and denounced the installation of two Islamists who had just won positions in a municipal election. He said their election was illegal because the men were avowed adherents of Shariah law, which is in direct contradiction with Belgian civil law and the European Convention on Human Rights. The man was right, of course, but no one rose to his defense. When he left, the formal installation of the Islamists was completed as if nothing happened. Was this lone man one of the Lamed Vav? If so, I hope his thirty-five compatriots are paying attention. (And that the man himself has the good sense to watch his back from here on in. He doesn’t need to be the next Theo Van Gogh.) When you look at the faces of the others in the room visible on the video, you don’t exactly see “profiles in courage.” I would wager, however, that if you asked each of them individually whether they favored equal rights for women and homosexuals, as well as separation of church and state and liberal democracy and Enlightenment principles in general (all anathema to Shariah), they would uniformly say yes. Further I would imagine they would all be appalled at the idea of a global caliphate under Islam, and therefore the end of Belgium as a sovereign nation, the very intention of Shariah. Still, political correctness — leavened, to be sure, with a modicum of cowardice — overwhelmed their good sense and allowed the decent and courageous man to leave by himself.

(XOM) forecasts global energy consumption will rise 35 percent by 2040, driven by China and India, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing the company’s latest long-term energy outlook. Exxon projects North America will become a net energy exporter by 2025 because of an increase in oil and gas production and improvements in energy efficiency, the newspaper said. The Irving, Texas-based company is the world’s biggest energy producer by market value. The use of coal will decline 33 percent by 2025, compared with a previous estimate of 23 percent, as more natural gas- fired power stations are built, the report said. The growth of U.S. and Canadian oil and gas production may lead to an increase in international shipments, according to the report. Exxon compiles the outlook annually to guide long-term investment decisions. Demand in developed regions such as the U.S., Canada and Europe will be unchanged or decline as they become more efficient, according to the newspaper report. While developed nations by 2040 are forecast to generate 80 percent more economic output than in 2010, they will use the same amount of energy, the newspaper said, citing the outlook. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-11/exxon-forecasts-energy-demand-to-increase-35-by-2040-wsj-says.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355236041656</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 09:27:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355236216076-8</Id><Title>U.S. Solar Surges 44% in Third Quarter Driven by Rooftops VIDEO</Title><Msg>U.S. Solar Surges 44% in Third Quarter Driven by Rooftops VIDEO By Ehren Goossens - Dec 10, 2012 10:01 PM MT. Developers installed 684 megawatts of solar panels in the U.S. in the third quarter, 44 percent more than a year earlier, as residential projects rose to a record, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. About 3.2 gigawatts of solar energy will be installed in the U.S. this year, the Washington-based trade group forecast today in a statement. VIDEO 2:23 Dec. 11 (Bloomberg) -- James Evans, senior analyst in solar and wind power at Bloomberg Industries, discusses the outlook for the renewable energy industry in 2013. He speaks with Manus Cranny on Bloomberg Television's "On the Move." (Source: Bloomberg) Installations in the current quarter may almost double from the third quarter to 1,200 megawatts, which would be the most ever in a three-month period. Fourth-quarter installations have accounted for more than 40 percent of the annual totals in the past two years, driven in part by developers racing to qualify for expiring incentives, according to SEIA. “While Q3 2012 was remarkable for the U.S. PV market, it is just the opening act for what we expect to see in Q4,” Shayle Kann, vice president of research at GTM Research, said in the statement. The Boston-based consulting company collaborated with SEIA on the quarterly solar report. Fourth-quarter installation last year made up 42 percent of 2011’s almost 1,900 megawatts, according to SEIA. Developers were seeking to qualify for a U.S. Treasury program that expired at the end of the year and paid cash grants equal to as much as 30 percent of projects’ costs. Residential systems increased 12 percent in the third quarter from the prior quarter to 119 megawatts as falling panel prices and the growing popularity of solar-leasing programs made it easier and less costly for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels, according to the statement. Non-residential solar projects, comprising commercial and government systems, jumped 24 percent from the second quarter to 258 megawatts, driven by strong demand in California and Massachusetts. SEIA expects installations to rise 25 percent to almost 4 gigawatts next year and to reach 5.4 gigawatts in 2014. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-11/u-s-solar-surges-44-in-third-quarter-driven-by-rooftops.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355236216076</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 09:30:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355236272643-9</Id><Title>U.S. Solar Surges 44% in Third Quarter Driven by Rooftops VIDEO</Title><Msg>U.S. Solar Surges 44% in Third Quarter Driven by Rooftops VIDEO By Ehren Goossens - Dec 10, 2012 10:01 PM MT.

Ok, it’s hard to believe now, but with recent advances in wind and solar power, it may not be that far off. And, it may come within the next two decades, if researchers from the University of Delaware (UD) and Delaware Technical College (DTCC) have their way. A new report from the two institutions suggest that, by 2030, renewable energy could power a large electrical grid a stunning 99.9%, and at close to today’s energy costs! Analysts at UD and DTCC suggest a well-developed mixture of solar, wind, fuel cells, and battery storage would produce greater supply than electricity demand, plus keep energy costs low. “These results break the conventional wisdom that renewable energy is too unreliable and expensive,” said co-author, professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy in UD’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment Willett Kempton in the #. “The key is to get the right combination of electricity sources and storage—which we did by an exhaustive search—and to calculate costs correctly,” he said. Researchers used a model with 28 billion combinations of storage schemes, and renewable energy sources. Each combination was tested over historical hourly weather data and electricity use over a four-year span. Analysts used data for the model from PJM Interconnection, representing one-fifth of the US electricity grid, which spans 13 states, ranging from the Midwest (Illinois) to the East Coast (New Jersey). This report was a bit different than others in that it looked at cutting energy costs as much as possible, rather than simply focusing on matching energy generation to energy generation use. Meanwhile, the report found that, creating more electricity than required during regular hours to meet high energy use (but during low wind hours) would have lower costs compared to storing the excess energy for higher consumption later (of course, this is based on the assumption we won’t see any storage breakthroughs in that time). Storage can be more costly because storage mediation, hydrogen tanks, or batteries need to be bigger for an extra hour of energy held. So, one new finding that should warm the hart of clean-tech fans out there is researchers believe a huge electrical system could be running nearly completely on renewable energy. “For example, using hydrogen for storage, we can run an electric system that today would meeting a need of 72 GW, 99.9 percent of the time, using 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of offshore wind, and 115 GW of inland wind,” said Cory Budischak, instructor in the Delaware’s Technical Community College Energy Management Department and a U of D alumnus. Wind and solar energy generators need higher installed gigawatt (GW) capacity; unlike conventional generators, because renewable energy forms do not achieve maximum capacity as much of the time, the report found. One gigawatt would equal 250,000 rooftop solar systems, or 200 large wind turbines. Researchers gazed 18 years into the future on what a large-scale clean electricity system would look like and some of the findings are very interesting: The study sheds light on what an electric system might look like with heavy reliance on renewable energy sources. Wind speeds and sun exposure vary with weather and seasons, requiring ways to improve reliability. In this study, reliability was achieved by: expanding the geographic area of renewable generation, using diverse sources, employing storage systems, and for the last few percent of the time, burning fossil fuels as a backup. During the hours when there was not enough renewable electricity to meet power needs, the model drew from storage and, on the rare hours with neither renewable electricity or stored power, then fossil fuel. When there was more renewable energy generated than needed, the model would first fill storage, use the remaining to replace natural gas for heating homes and businesses and only after those, let the excess go to waste. Analysts, besides pointing to the possibility of a large, clean electric grid, pointed to such a grid being just as cost-effective. Researchers looked at technology costs in 2030, in comparison with fossil fuel prices today, not factoring subsidies. The report also factored as part of fossil fuel costs, external pricing, including air pollution due to fossil fuels. Meanwhile, estimates in the report point to capital costs in 2030 for wind and solar to be 50% less than today’s capital prices, while maintenance costs would be in line with current costs. “Aiming for 90 percent or more renewable energy in 2030, in order to achieve climate change targets of 80 to 90 percent reduction of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the power sector, leads to economic savings,” the report’s authors noted in the article.

The Fed took the lead in manipulating short term rates and Fannie took the lead in manipulating long term rates via the mortgage market. Now that Fannie is bankrupt the Fed has assumed both roles: now it manipulates both short term and long term rates. The stock market has returned nothing since this started. The Fed manipulated the market in the 1970s as well, trying to hold interest rates lower than they should have have after the oil embargo of 1973-1974. By the time they threw in the towel in '81 the stock market was at its Oct 1973 level yet again, and the economy in full blow depression. t-bills beat stocks over the period. The BOJ has pumping in Japan since 1990 and the Nikkei is now down about 80% thanks to their pains. The Fed pumped the stock market from 1921 till 1931-1932 and the result was the biggest financial collapse in world history. The Bank of England pumped the British markets from 1797 till about 1819 and stocks and real estate were lower in 1819 than in 1797. They pumped it again in 1822-1825 and that too failed. By Christmas 1825 the Bank of England, itself, was on the verge of collapse. No the adage "you should not fight the Fed" is just a worthless catch phrase made up by gamblers to assure themselves. Considering that Fed's strategy has never worked, fighting it is exactly what you should be doing. You win always by fighting it, you always lose by following it to completion...

In 1650 its public debt was around 150 million guilders. By 1811 it was up to 1.7 billion guilders, and about 60% of the Dutch economy was going to pay taxes to fund interest payments to a tiny number of uber-wealthy families, financier-Jews, and speculators in Amsterdam who owned the debt. The Dutch tax system was rigged by the financiers and the commercial community to exempt their activities from taxation, and consequently taxes were shifted to the backs of urban workers, farmers, and industry. By 1811, when 2/3 of the debt was defaulted on, 80% or more of the industry of the Dutch Republic had evaporated. Most of the financiers and traders had long since sold their debt, and wound up their enterprises, and cleared out of the Republic with their vast cash hoards, which probably exceeded 2 billion guilders...They nested in London mostly. Before 1650 the Dutch economy functioned quite differently. It was dominated by industry, peat digging to supply fuel for industry, and led the world in technology of all sorts. Trade was strong and vibrant but it was based on the importation of commodities to fuel the industries, and the export of the products of industry, not financial gimmickry and trade in paper. Things like the "tulip mania" were brief and irrelevant to the trend of progress. Then came a two decade long real estate boom starting in 1650s, then a huge upsurge in borrowing to pay for war on a vast scale, and of course the conversion of the economy into a playground for financial speculators during the 18th century. There are many similarities between America's economy, one which is being driven along by the interests of the financial speculators and bankers, and the Dutch one that failed so many years ago... It is not just America that has been hijacked by the speculators either. Of course it is worth mentioning that the Dutch prided their "freedom" and "liberties" above all, too... Yes they said that consistently until their economy was a ruin. The bankers, speculators, and their ilk always harped on freedom when it rallied the mobs to their corner, and made sure the state kept out of their dealings, until the game was over... The Dutch are around today but not thanks to such policies. A new Age of Industry, in contrast to the Age of Financier Capitalism that came before it lifted the world to prosperity.</Msg><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1355247628716</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 12:40:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355251349536-23</Id><Title>Energy diversity will power our economy</Title><Msg>Energy diversity will power our economy By Rob Gramlich, American Wind Energy Association - 12/11/12 01:00 PM ET Benjamin Zycher’s Congress Blog post gets several facts wrong about wind power. Let’s set the record straight. While Zycher, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, invokes Ronald Reagan, it’s worth noting that support for extending the federal wind energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) crosses party lines at every level of leadership. A bipartisan coalition of the nation’s governors formed the Governors’ Wind Energy Coalition to work for extension of the PTC before it expires at the end of December, and congressional delegations from every region of the U.S. include majority, if not unanimous support for extension. Leading Republican governors such as Mary Fallin (Okla.), Sam Brownback (Kansas) and Terry Branstad (Iowa) and GOP senators including Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Jerry Moran (Kansas) and John Boozman (Ark.) know the PTC has led to the creation of 75,000 jobs and over 500 manufacturing plants in 44 states. Adding wind energy to the power system drives electricity prices down, as it has zero fuel cost and so displaces the most expensive power plant currently operating. This is great news for consumers, even though lower prices may elicit objections from those who own competing forms of electricity production. A recent analysis by Synapse Energy Economics confirmed that adding wind energy to the grid saves Midwest consumers $65 to $200 per year. While wind power does reduce electricity prices, the PTC on its own simply enables more wind generation to be built, and does not have a major impact on real-time electricity markets. With or without the PTC, once a wind farm has been built, the electricity it generates is going to enter the real-time electricity market as one of the lowest cost options available. Instances of power prices being lowered so far that they go negative are very rare, accounting for only 1 out of every 4,500 electricity market price points last year. Moreover, many of those were caused by hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants, which also have very low fuel costs. Even the few instances that actually were linked to wind will be largely eliminated over the next several years as new transmission allows low-cost wind energy to reach more consumers. Zycher’s claims about how wind is reliably integrated onto the power system are incorrect. Changes in wind output are generally gradual and predictable, while outages at conventional power plants occur suddenly and without warning. All forms of energy have their incentives; wind is no exception. However, with the right support, American wind power will continue to diversify our energy mix, invest billions of dollars more into our economy, and create thousands of quality jobs that can’t be outsourced.

The John Muir Trust (JMT), one of Scotland's leading conservation bodies, has challenged the common assertion that wind farms run at an average of 30 per cent capacity over a year. A study carried out for the Trust into the energy generated by dozens of wind farms, the majority of which are in Scotland, between November 2009 and last month, found they actually ran at 22 per cent of capacity. Campaigners insist the figures, drawn from data provided by the National Grid, challenge the role of wind farms as an efficient source of renewable energy. They said hundreds of wind farms had secured planning permission across Scotland based on inaccurate assumptions of their output. "This analysis shows that over the course of a year, the average load factor fell well short of what the industry claims, yet the 30 per cent figure is peddled at every public inquiry into a proposed wind farm," said Helen McDade, head of policy at the JMT. "This data is needed to counter that hype."</Msg><Username>dai_gul_dai</Username><Timestamp>1355254091086</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 14:28:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355254123104-28</Id><Title>Get Ready, Utilities: Solar Is Coming</Title><Msg>Get Ready, Utilities: Solar Is Coming December 10, 2012 John Farrell Quick question. Your state has good sunshine, lots of open rooftops, and the cost of solar energy has been falling by 10% per year. Do you think it will take 13 years to double the 10 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power? Yes, if you’re the largest corporate utility in my state, and willfully ignoring the economic trend. But ‘no’ if you make decisions based on data, because the price of unsubsidized solar electricity will undercut most utility retail electricity prices within a decade, enabling 200 times more solar (4,400 MW) than found in this utility’s plans. Solar rooftops via Shutterstock That’s just one utility’s wake-up call in a new report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), Commercial Rooftop Revolution, and it’s far from the only one. By 2016, over 100,000 MW of unsubsidized rooftop solar will able to match grid electricity on price. Within 10 years, it will be 300,000 MW, enough to provide 10% of the nation’s electricity. This affordable solar future presents a stark challenge to traditional utility planning and a clarion call for better electricity policy. Some utilities have responded by clinging to the 20th century paradigm of centralized control. Virginia’s Dominion Power, for example, expressed satisfaction at a recent conference at introducing standby charges on solar producers, ostensibly to help them recover the cost of “backing up” solar power. On the other hand, many utilities and state regulatory commissions are finding the value in solar and realizing that perceived barriers aren’t as large as they had feared. Austin Energy, a Texas municipal utility, now pays a non-subsidy premium for solar because it helps them offset expensive peak power purchases. In Hawaii, utilities who two years ago argued that the distribution grid was at its limit have been managing to accommodate thousands more solar projects on their grid systems. Regardless of their predisposition toward solar power, utilities, regulators, and policy makers need to recognize that there’s a revolution in electricity systems coming soon. Solar will become so affordable in the next 5-10 years that as many as 38 million homes and businesses will elect to produce their own power more cheaply from unsubsidized solar rather than buy it from their utility. That means policies that limit distributed generation will have to change: net metering limits must rise, permitting must be simplified, archaic “15% rules” will have to be driven by data not speculation. Ultimately, as one Hawaii public utility commissioner has said, the paradigm for the electricity system will flip. Utilities will need to transition from being inflexible to being flexible. They’ll switch from primarily running slow-response coal and nuclear power plants to finding the right mix of flexible natural gas or energy storage systems that can partner with low-cost wind and solar and advanced demand response to supply reliable electricity. The forthcoming revolution in solar power promises more change in the next 10 years than utilities have faced in the last 100. And they had best get ready.

In May, Interior floated draft rules that would force drillers, when operating on federal lands, to disclose chemicals used when employing the method dubbed “fracking.” Interior officials had previously said they that planned to complete the rules by the end of 2012. Fracking involves high-pressure injections of water, chemicals and sand into shale formations to open seams that enable hydrocarbons to flow. The method is enabling an oil-and-gas production boom in a number of states, but is bringing fears of water pollution alongside it. The proposed rules for federal lands have faced heavy criticism from industry groups and some Republicans, who say state oversight is sufficient. The draft rules also contained requirements on oil-and-gas well integrity to verify that fluids from the fracking process aren’t escaping into nearby water supplies, and requirements for management of large volumes of so-called flowback water. Androff on Tuesday defended the planned rules and President Obama’s record on oil and natural gas, noting U.S. production increases in recent years. “[A]s we continue to offer millions of acres of America’s public lands for oil and gas development, it is important that the public have full confidence that the right safety and environmental protections are in place,” Androff said in a statement. “Building on preliminary input from industry and other stakeholders, the BLM proposed a sensible and achievable rule that supports these goals by leveraging technologies already in use by companies to protect important water resources and through the disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing,” he said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/272307-interior-pushes-back-fracking-rule-timeline</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355272425995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 19:33:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355272655427-35</Id><Title>Union Thugs</Title><Msg>represent the Demoncrap Party very well.

Boxer announces plans to form ‘climate change caucus’ By Ben Geman - 12/11/12 03:17 PM ET Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that she’s forming a “climate change caucus,” and argues that Hurricane Sandy “changed a lot of minds” on the topic. The move signals that Democrats might again be ready to aggressively promote bills to curb greenhouse gas emissions, even as the political prospects for global warming legislation remain remote in Congress. “I am going to form a climate change caucus, because people are coming up to me, they really want to get into this. I think Sandy changed a lot of minds,” Boxer told reporters in the Capitol. “It is going to work with all the committees and all the committee chairmen to make sure we can move forward legislation that reduces carbon pollution and also works on mitigation and all of the other elements,” she said. Boxer and some other Democrats are already seeking measures to improve coastal resilience to storms such as Sandy; many scientists say climate change is making weather events more dangerous. But Boxer also indicated that Democrats might also push measures to address greenhouse gas emissions head-on, although she did not provide specifics. A cap-and-trade bill narrowly passed the House, then controlled by Democrats, in 2009. But even a scaled-back version collapsed in the Senate in 2010 without ever coming up for a vote. “I think you are going to see a lot of bills on climate change,” Boxer told reporters. “I don’t know whether [they will include] cap-and-trade, but there will be a lot of different bills. I have already spoken to three colleagues that have bills in the works,” she said. Boxer said she was hopeful that Republicans would participate. “We are sending out feelers,” she said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/272273-sen-boxer-to-form-climate-change-caucus</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355273782443</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 19:56:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355286783637-37</Id><Title>Interior delays ‘fracking’ rules</Title><Msg>Interior delays ‘fracking’ rules By Ben Geman - 12/11/12 04:16 PM ET The Interior Department no longer plans to finalize rules this year that will impose new controls on the controversial oil-and-gas development method called hydraulic fracturing, a spokesman said. “In order to ensure that the 170,000 comments received are properly analyzed, the Bureau of Land Management expects action on the [hydraulic fracturing] proposal in the new year,” Interior spokesman Blake Androff said.

A committee panel will hold a hearing on energy efficiency tax incentives, but discussion could veer into the battle over whether lawmakers will renew the wind energy production tax credit that will lapse Dec. 31. The Finance Committee passed a bill earlier this year to extend the wind credit and incentives that have already lapsed for efficient homes and buildings. A copy of the bill is available here. Witnesses at the hearing will include Dan Arvizu, the director of the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Click here for more. THE REST OF WEDNESDAY’S AGENDA: Dems to talk sequestration in House floor speeches A handful of House members plan to use floor time Wednesday to warn about possible environmental and energy cuts through sequestration. The members are part of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, whose 52 members all are Democrats. Sequestration refers to automatic spending cuts set to occur through the next 10 years, beginning in 2013. The caucus has said sequestration could curtail access to national parks and other public lands, reduce clean-energy research and energy efficiency funding and dial back an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) water pollution program. "Now is the time to end the more than $50 billion in special tax breaks and subsidies to Big Oil and instead invest in manufacturing and green renewable energy projects here at home," Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who plans to speak on the floor, told The Hill in a Tuesday statement. Bipartisan push for clean-energy tax bill A bipartisan group of lawmakers will highlight a bill that would unlock a cost-saving tax structure for clean-energy investors during a Wednesday Capitol Hill press conference. Sens. Chris #$%$ (D-Del.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), along with Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas), Mike Thompson (R-Calif.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), will speak at the event. The lawmakers plan to send a letter to President Obama advocating for the measure, which is known as a master limited partnership. Those arrangements, which are currently open only to fossil fuels, are taxed like a partnership but traded like a stock. The lawmakers all have sponsored bills to extend the financing method to clean-energy projects, contending it would lower financing costs. Energy trade controversies get airing The Washington International Trade Association will hold an event Wednesday titled: “U.S. Trade and Energy Policy: Coherence or Conflict?” A range of experts will tackle two hot-button topics: whether the U.S. should expand exports of natural gas, which is growing in abundance, and trade in renewable energy-related goods, the subject of trade battles between the U.S. and China. Inglis to push carbon tax Former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.) will bring his campaign for a carbon tax — offset by reductions in income taxes — to Johns Hopkins University for a mid-day event. Inglis heads the recently created Energy and Enterprise Initiative at George Mason University. Nuclear group to offer 2013 outlook The head of a nuclear energy trade group will detail the industry’s outlook for 2013 during a Wednesday media conference. Marvin Fertel, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, will discuss the industry’s policy objectives, top regulatory concerns and the U.S. electricity sector. Oil industry to attack soot rule An oil industry group will hold a press call Wednesday to make the case against a looming EPA rule to tighten air quality standards for fine particulate matter, also known as soot. American Petroleum Institute officials will discuss the rule’s “impact on job growth, our nation’s economic recovery, and air quality.” EPA is under a court-ordered deadline to complete the rules by Dec. 14.
