Merkel has already mentioned that multiculturalism has failed. It was only a couple of days ago that efforts to extend citizenship to the aliens were defeated. The right is all powerful in Germany. The aliens are already being encouraged to leave by taxes. Their power bills are being increasing to build solar &amp; wind power facilities to profit industry and middle class Germans. They are immobile because most cannot afford to drive, and the state police and local police watch their every move… They will eventually get the message – act German or face the consequences. The UK will soon tire of their idiotic experiment in multiculturalism. 200 years ago they were a police state. They could simply change British law to exclude all non-British people, , from the political process, defined however Parliament - or Royals - decided, and pass laws to tax aliens, bar them from collecting state benefits, and deport them or execute them for infractions of the law - like stealing a loaf of bread. England once had a “blood code” that executed criminals by the tens of thousands yearly – English law is quite powerful when provoked. US law is not nearly so formidable...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371356322569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 00:18:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371384925971-2</Id><Topic><Title>Energy prices plummeting in Germany…</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368537956602</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:25:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump.

Other activities are being built up in Berlin pursuant to the war on fossil fuels - especially in polymers - which I've enumerated on other threads. See Fraunhofer Polymer Surfaces Alliance for info. This buildup of professionals creates a demand for upper middle class real estate. In short Berlin is a better buy than Hamburg.

Obedient lapdogs Clinton and Blair parroted the demands of the Zionists for the just elected coalition government in Austria to drop its suspension of immigration for two years. The globalist bankers attack any and all patriotism/nationalism and demand a multi-cultural globalist apparatus that cannot unelect the UN, EU apparatchiks. Goldman Sachs has its minions in the EU and UN on the brink of ushering in a global tax to fund the New World Order's army and governance. Resist and you will be detained indefinitely without trial as a terrorist sympathizer.</Msg><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1371440387184</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 23:39:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
