No commercially viable method of producing oil shale exists, but American Petroleum Institute CEO Jack Gerard turned heads earlier this month when he predicted a game-changing technological breakthrough could allow the use of oil shale. Gerard’s remarks caught many by surprise as doubts abound on oil shale’s future. “To date, what we’ve seen is 100 years of promises and taxpayer funds for projects that have all gone belly up,” said Ellynne Bannon, a spokeswoman with spending watchdog group Checks and Balances Project. Environmentalists abhor the prospect of trying to harness oil shale, which would involve extracting oil that is contained in rocks. Extraction methods so far use a considerable amount of fossil fuels and water, which is scarce in the West. Yet before fracking — which injects a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals into tight rock formations to capture oil hidden under the rocks —many had thought accessing the oil and gas buried deep underground was too expensive. Now — largely because of fracking — the U.S. is now projected to overtake Saudi Arabia to become the number one oil producer in the world by 2020. Fracking allowed drillers to tap more natural gas, helping drive U.S. prices from $13.19 per million British thermal units in June 2008 down to $3.14 per million Btu as of Wednesday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That has industry and lawmakers alike bullish on finding technological breakthroughs to develop other energy sources once thought too expensive to access. The developments are likely to put further political pressure on President Obama to allow more fossil fuel access, particularly given the slow U.S. economy. Gerard thinks oil shale could be the next bonanza. “Oil shale alone in three western states is three times the proven reserves of what Saudi Arabia holds today. The key to it is to access the ability to develop it, to find the technologies to extract it for domestic consumption and even potential exports going down the road,” Gerard said. Tapping oil shale would mean heating rocks under intense pressure to separate the fuel contained within them. Energy firms have had some success in doing this in Estonia, but the practice is heavily subsidized. A handful of firms are operating in the U.S. on research, development and design leases from the Interior Department. But many others have wound down or ended their U.S. oil shale activities. The Obama administration’s approach so far has been to offer funds for research and development of oil shale, but not commercial leases, a policy praised by Bobby McEnaney, a senior lands analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “There is no sort of known way to get it out of the ground. So I think the administration is approaching this from a cautious perspective,” McEnaney said. But Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) thinks the administration is going too slowly. He said he is likely to reintroduce legislation in this Congress that would call on the Interior Department to open up more land for oil shale development. Lanborn’s PIONEERs Act would have Interior open 2 million acres for commercial oil shale development with a federal royalty rate of 5 percent. It passed the House with 237 votes, 216 of which were Republicans, in the last Congress but did not receive a vote in the Senate. Lamborn said the Obama administration has kept too much land off-limits to oil shale development. He said that has deterred investment, making it harder to strike a technological breakthrough. “There’s tremendous potential there. It’s not yet in a commercially viable stage, but it is at least something that should be allowed to move forward in the research and development stage,” Lamborn said. Potential can be elusive, said McEnaney, who noted that many energy firms have backed out of oil shale development. He said Chevron has largely abandoned its research, development and design lease, and noted that Shell is curtailing its activities. Bannon said many Coloradans are suspicious of oil shale promises after Exxon left overnight in 1982 in what became known as “Black Sunday.” The company had entered Colorado hoping to harness oil shale, but failed, and took more than 2,000 jobs when it left. “I think there’s a lot of people who have lived through the boom and bust, and they’re naturally skeptical,” Bannon said. Still, McEnaney said the domestic energy boom might also have emboldened fossil fuel-friendly lawmakers to trumpet oil shale’s possibilities. “So long as you have this what I would call mythical expectation that Colorado would be some Saudi Arabia of oil shale, this probably isn’t going away,” McEnaney said. Energy firms are taking a “wait and see attitude before spending any big bucks to move the industry forward,” Glenn Vawter, executive director of the National Oil Shale Association, told The Hill. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276755-fracking-success-sparks-talk-of-oil-shale-boom</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358087295179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 09:28:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358089395833-3</Id><Topic><Title>Composite Indicators Signal</Title><Username>geniesulsgcz</Username><Timestamp>1300639590000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-03-20 12:46:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing</Msg><Username>josephw169</Username><Timestamp>1358089395833</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:03:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358094756100-4</Id><Topic><Title>Big government science</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358018054592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 14:14:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...continued. The period 1880-1910 has been widely noted as a "golden age of bacteriology." During this period the classification and systematic study of bacteria, scientific disease control, and modern pharmaceutical research really began. It, too, was driven by government. German government financed education at the level of the Gymnasium and University produced the scientists. State finance from Germany's Imperial Health Office, the military sanity corps, and state and local governments funded the research the scientists conducted. The objective was to improve the efficiency of the military and reduce disease and thereby increase the population and productivity of it - useful for the economy and military and power projection. Notable figures included Adolf von Baeyer (1835-1917) who became the Master par excellence of test-tube chemistry, and the "king of dyes." The discoveries were commercialized by Bayer and BASF. Massive research labs at Ludwigshafen, on the scale of small cities, appeared. New dyes, chemical products, and pharmaceutical products appeared by the thousands. The relentless advance of German science alarmed the British and they began a huge university building, general education, and subsidy program to try to match the German advance - falling behind a major military power was not something the British could allow. During the 1920s the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry, creatures of German government investments from the beginning, merged into IG Farben. During the Nazi period IG Farben received the equivalent of a blank check from German government to push forward science in the area of plastics, synthetic rubber, coal chemistry, synthetic fuels research, pharmaceuticals, and medical research. Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) conducted a joint research program IG Farben during the Nazi Era, too, something they were condemned by Congress for in a witch hunt. Exxon's involvement, however, consisted of basically writing large checks to gain admittance to the Ludwigshafen labs and transfer as much German technology to America as possible - technology such as synthetic rubber. The vast treasure trove of advances was opened to American pharmaceutical companies and industry, free of charge by the American military government, after World War II...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358094756100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:32:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358102039205-5</Id><Title>Big government science - energy</Title><Msg>A useful thought experiment for the libertarian extremists who rest blithely confident in their belief that government cannot push forward technology in whatever area it wishes.

The pace of American advance from 1945 till about 1960 was so fast some people think aliens were behind it. Really? No... The U.S. government just transferred the fruits of several decades worth of big government science into America, from Germany after 1945, and more importantly copied the German government's approach to directing science in the interest of the state - except with maybe 10X as many resources...

Murkowski heads for Japan to talk gas exports, nuclear power</Title><Msg>Sen. Murkowski heads for Japan to talk gas exports, nuclear power By Ben Geman - 01/13/13 06:31 PM ET Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Senate’s top Republican lawmaker on energy policy, will shortly travel to Japan for meetings about nuclear power and exporting natural gas from her state. “She is going to meet with Japanese officials and take a look at what they have done since Fukushima on nuclear policy,” said Robert Dillon, Murkowski’s spokesman. Almost every Japanese reactor is offline following the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which occurred after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck the island. Dillon said Murkowski will speak with Japanese officials about exporting Alaskan natural gas to the energy-thirsty island nation. Murkowski will also lay a wreath at the grave of an Alaskan teacher who was killed in the Japanese tsunami, Dillon said. Japan is the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and the nation’s need for fossil fuels has risen since the March 2011 catastrophe. The long-term future of nuclear power in Japan is highly uncertain, although Japan’s new government may scrap its predecessor's plan to phase it out in coming decades, according to reports in the Guardian and other outlets. Murkowski, the top Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is a strong advocate of proposed pipeline and liquefaction projects to send Alaskan gas to Asian markets. ConocoPhillips, Exxon, BP and the pipeline company TransCanada are considering a massive project to bring gas from Alaska’s North Slope to its southern coast for transport as LNG via tanker. The U.S. previously supplied LNG to Japan for 40 years from ConocoPhillips’ Kenai plant in Alaska. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276873-sen-murkowski-heads-for-japan-to-talk-gas-exports-nuclear-power</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358126381251</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 20:19:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358130518492-14</Id><Title>U.S. LNG profit seen elusive as price gap closes</Title><Msg>U.S. LNG profit seen elusive as price gap closes U.S. LNG profit seen elusive as price gap closes Posted on January 11, 2013 at 6:41 am by Bloomberg Comments(0) The liquefied natural gas tanker Inigo Tapias makes its way through Boston Harbor past downtown Boston on Jan. 24, 2004. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Profits from selling U.S. liquefied natural gas abroad may be elusive, belying the $60 billion race for export licenses as the price gap between Asia and North America shrinks from record levels. The difference between U.S. and Asian gas is poised to drop by more than 60 percent by 2020, leaving exporters facing a loss of as much as $6 million per tanker, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on data from Rice University in Houston. The U.S. share of the global LNG market will be in “single digits,” according to Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which has stakes in more than 25 percent of the world’s liquefaction capacity. As many as 16 applications for LNG export projects from Texas to Maryland and Oregon are being considered by the U.S. Department of Energy as companies look to follow Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) in exploiting record price differentials between the U.S. and Japan, the world’s largest consumer. Buyers from Tokyo to London are seeking supplies in the U.S., where prices are less than a third of those in Europe and a fifth of Asian costs. “The idea that the world will be flooded with spot LNG is not going to happen,” said Frank Harris, global head of LNG at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Returns are already getting squeezed. By the end of the decade, the LNG market looks better supplied, and spot cargoes from the U.S. won’t necessarily look so attractive.” Losses Increasing U.S. natural gas has risen 70 percent from a decade-low in April to $3.24 a million British thermal units in electronic trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S. exports to Asia would help damp the Platts Japan-Korea Marker, a daily price assessment of Asia-bound LNG known as JKM, to a mean of $8.08 through 2020, from $17.80 yesterday, Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy said in a study. The average cost of shipping U.S. natural gas to Japan will be $9.05 from 2011 to 2020, assuming a U.S. price of $3.98, leaving a loss of $0.96 per million Btu taking into account the costs of transportation and liquefaction, the study shows. Losses widen to $1.77 per million Btu in the decade to 2030 as the price at Louisiana’s Henry Hub, the U.S. benchmark, rises to an average $4.69 and the JKM falls to $7.98, according to the study, published Aug. 10. The loss to the U.K. is $0.49 through 2020 and $1.23 from 2021 to 2030. U.K. next-month gas, the European benchmark, today rose 0.7 percent to the equivalent of $10.90 on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Domestic Use “Applications for export licenses are around 29 billion cubic feet a day,” Kenneth B. Medlock III, the study’s author, said from Houston. That’s equivalent to about 48 percent of domestic consumption in October, according to the Energy Department. “I doubt we’ll see more than 6 billion,” he said. The economic rationale for delivering LNG to Asia would be significantly diminished at a U.S. price of about $6 per million Btu, while in Europe it disappears at about $5, according to James, Henderson, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Interest in U.S. LNG exports blossomed in recent years as growing supplies of gas from previously inaccessible shale rocks and the fourth-warmest winter on record cut Henry Hub prices to a 10-year low of $1.902 per million Btu on April 19 from as high as $13.69 in 2008. The average Japanese LNG price was $16.92 in 2012 to October, peaking at $18.07 in July, according to data from the nation’s Finance Ministry. Prices soared from a mean of $9.04 in 2009 as utilities were forced to switch to natural gas in the wake of the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster that led to the temporary closure of all the nation’s reactors. Price Gaps “The arbitrage opportunity that is driving actors to seek export permits and licenses for new liquefaction facilities is based on current price differentials,” said Iain Grant, a manager of special projects at Athabasca University in Canada who has written about the political economy of natural gas trading. “But should we expect either the low Henry Hub prices or the high Japanese prices to last long enough to justify the massive effort that is underway to capitalize on it?” Cheniere, based in Houston, is investing about $5 billion in its 18 million metric ton facility at Sabine Pass in Louisiana, which in April became the first facility in almost half a century to receive approval to export to countries that the U.S. doesn’t have a free trade agreement with. Shipments are scheduled to start in late 2015 with 11 percent of capacity available to the spot market and the rest tied up in long-term contracts with Korea Gas Corp., GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) and BG Group Plc. (BG/) Louisiana Coast Main Pass Energy Hub LLC applied in September for authorization to export 3.22 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, or 23.5 million tons of LNG per year, from a site 16 miles off the Louisiana coast, according to the Energy Department’s website. Gulf Coast LNG Export LLC in January 2012 requested permission to build a 2.8 billion cubic feet LNG terminal at the Port of Brownsville, Texas. In total, 29.21 billion cubic feet a day of projects have applied for licenses to export LNG, according to the Energy Department. Assuming investment costs similar to those at Sabine Pass, they have a value of almost $60 billion. Half of North America’s 120 million tons a year of LNG export potential will be built, Andy Brown, upstream director at Shell, the world’s largest shipping operator of the fuel, told reporters On Dec. 5. The U.S. share of the global LNG market will be “modest,” he said. The world’s biggest LNG tankers, known as Q-Max vessels, can carry as much as 122,000 tons of the liquid fuel, or about 6.3 trillion Btu of natural gas. NERA Report All outstanding applications were waiting until after a Department of Energy report into the probable effect on domestic prices published on Dec. 5. Exports would have “net economic benefits” for the U.S., according to the study, written by NERA Economic Consulting. While U.S. regulators decide how much gas they are prepared to send overseas, export projects are coming online from Australia to Angola. Some 221 billion cubic meters of annual liquefaction capacity will be added to the 413 billion currently in existence over the next four years, according to Barclays Plc. Of that, 115 billion will come from Australia. U.S. natural gas prices will rise to $4.80 and $8.70 per million Btu by 2035 with a reference case of $6.30, according to the NERA study. The price increases by 14 percent above the base case by 2020 and 6.4 percent by 2035 assuming low expansion of LNG exports. Under a high and rapid expansion scenario, the increase will be 20 percent by 2020 and 14 percent by 2035. ‘Different Economics’ Long-term buyers of U.S. LNG who invest in shipping and liquefaction infrastructure may be able to make significant savings, according to Jonathan Whitehead, global head of commodities markets at Societe Generale SA in London. “It’s completely different economics for spot versus long- term contracts,” he said. “A spot-shipping rate of $3 to Japan from the U.S. Gulf coast is probably true, but over 20 years it’s probably $1 and a bit. Liquefaction might be $2.” Korea Gas (036460), the world’s biggest LNG-buying company, agreed last January to buy LNG from Sabine Pass based on Henry Hub prices. The contract may help the utility pay 30 percent less than supplies in Asia, which are traditionally indexed to oil, the state-owned company said in April. Exports to Asia would cost $9.35 per million Btu, based on a Henry Hub price of $3, Cheniere said last year. The introduction of contracts linked to Henry Hub instead of crude will help speed a move away from oil indexation, according to the Oxford Institute’s Henderson. “Even if the volumes of North American gas that actually arrive in Asia and Europe are relatively small, their impact on prices and price formation across the globe could be significant and long-lasting,” he said. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/01/11/u-s-lng-profit-seen-elusive-as-price-gap-closes/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358130518492</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 21:28:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358134328294-15</Id><Topic><Title>60 degrees in New Jersey today (January).</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1358111833183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 16:17:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you have to believe the inferno numbers and how he knows better than all the others--its the same way his hero karl/blossom rove knows the vote count better than others of course its nonsense but for the fringe like inferno its true</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1358134328294</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 22:32:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
