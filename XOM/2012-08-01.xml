Many of the predicted dates the world would "run out" of raw materials have come and gone. The think is they got the dates wrong but have the theory is sound. We may have already seen the maximum oil production the world is ever going to make, and are taking false comfort that there is ample oil since the recession has slowed demand. I agree we dont just wake up one day to find no more oil, but its going to get much more expensive, once we get passed these economic slumps.</Msg><Username>manylumen</Username><Timestamp>1343794823000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 00:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343795981000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Jimmy Carter in 1976 said we'd have no more oil by 1990</Title><Username>sirola1</Username><Timestamp>1343754249000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:04:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be most interesting to see a chart of discovered reserves by year, and perhaps % recoverable oil discovered by year.

Monthly data for May from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirm two trends: U.S. refineries continue to run at high levels, and disparities in the regional economics of the U.S. refining market persist. U.S. refineries have run 330,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) (2.3 percent) more crude oil year-to-date through May in 2012 compared to 2011 (Figure 1). This increase in crude runs has been concentrated in the Midwest, Gulf Coast, and Rocky Mountain regions, areas which have access to discounted land-locked crude oils or which have refineries with substantial upgrading capacity. In 2012, the U.S. refining sector has generally been refining more barrels of crude oil than at any point since the large drop in petroleum prices in 2008. In May, U.S. refineries as a whole ran 15.2 million bbl/d of crude oil, a 3-percent increase compared to a year earlier. With the addition of the May data, 2012 year-to-date crude runs at U.S. refineries have averaged about 14.7 million bbl/d, the highest runs during the first five months of the year since 2008, and 220,000 bbl/d (1.5 percent) higher than the five-year average. Looking only at the national level of U.S. refinery runs, however, reveals just part of the picture. There are significant regional disparities in the underlying economics leading refinery runs to vary greatly among regions. Refineries in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains are running at record-high levels to take advantage of lower-cost feedstocks available as a result of surging tight-oil production in those areas, along with some capacity expansions which have allowed for the processing of more heavy, sour Canadian crude. In 2012, the refiner acquisition cost of crude oil (RAC) for the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains has averaged $11 per barrel and $15 per barrel, respectively, below the U.S. average RAC. This price advantage has resulted in increased margins for refiners with access to the discounted crude oil, encouraging persistently high crude oil runs and refinery capacity utilization. Midwest refineries have run an average of just under 3.5 million bbl/d of crude oil through May in 2012, a 5.7-percent increase over 2011 and an 8.6-percent increase over the average from 2007 through 2011. In April, Midwest runs were the highest of any month since July 2000. Runs have been particularly high in Kansas and Oklahoma, where refineries are closely linked to the Cushing trading hub for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which has been discounted for much of the past two years compared to global benchmarks such as Brent. Although they have a much smaller total capacity, refineries in the Rocky Mountains have run 559,000 bbl/d of crude oil in 2012, a 4.7-percent increase from 2011. Gulf Coast refineries are also running at higher levels than they have been in recent years. Although crude oil input costs are not as low for Gulf Coast refiners as they are for those in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains, the Gulf Coast refining complex has added capacity in recent years leading to increased crude oil runs. The Gulf Coast produces more refined products than required to satisfy regional demand, and refineries in the region tend to have deep-conversion capacity. This abundance of relatively sophisticated capacity allows refiners to produce a high-value product slate which, given the Gulf's location, can be efficiently exported to serve other regions of the United States, as well as growing Latin American markets. http://www.eia.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343842089000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:28:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343842099000-16</Id><Topic><Title>This Week In Petroleum August 1, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343842089000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:28:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The East and West Coasts are the exception to the trend of higher refinery runs. Those regions' reliance on relatively expensive crude oil, along with reductions in capacity over the last several years, has led to below-average runs. West Coast crude runs are down 0.9 percent in 2012 compared to last year, and have been 5.7 percent below their five-year average. On the East Coast, runs are down 9.9 percent year-over-year through May. This decline can be largely attributed to the East Coast having less operable capacity this year than last. In addition, East Coast crude oil costs have been about $12 per barrel above the U.S. average in 2012. These high crude oil costs were part of the reason behind the 2011 announcement of the potential closure of three of the regions' refineries in 2012. However, recent developments indicate that only one of these three refineries - Sunoco's Marcus Hook plant - will be closed permanently. The former ConocoPhillips Trainer facility, now owned by Delta Air Lines, was closed in September 2011 and is expected to return to service later this year. Sunoco's Philadelphia refinery is expected to remain in operation following the formation of a joint venture between The Carlyle Group and Sunoco. Once Trainer restarts, crude runs on the East Coast will likely increase. The impacts of these changes in crude runs are becoming apparent. Increased gasoline and distillate production in the Midwest, a traditional market for Gulf Coast products, has reduced the requirement to ship products up from the Gulf. As a result, more products produced in the Gulf are available for export or delivery to the East Coast. See the July 5 edition of TWIP for additional discussion of distillate exports. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices both increase for the 4th consecutive week The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased a penny this week to $3.51 per gallon, 20 cents per gallon lower than last year at this time. Prices decreased by one cent on the West Coast and three cents in the Rocky Mountain region to $3.71 per gallon and $3.47 per gallon, respectively, but increased in all other regions. The Midwest saw the largest increase, with the price up three cents to $3.52 per gallon. The Gulf Coast price is $3.31 per gallon, up 2 cents from last week, and the average price on the East Coast is up a penny to $3.50 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price increased a penny to $3.80 per gallon, 14 cents per gallon lower than last year at this time. Prices decreased on the Gulf and West Coasts and increased in all other regions. The Gulf Coast price is down two cents to $3.70 per gallon to become the lowest in the Nation, while the West Coast price decreased less than a penny to remain at $3.90 per gallon. The Midwest and Rocky Mountain prices both increased three cents to $3.78 per gallon and $3.73 per gallon, respectively. Rounding out the regions, the East Coast price is $3.84 per gallon, up two cents from last week. Propane inventories show another rise Total U.S. inventories of propane grew by 1.4 million barrels last week to end at 67.5 million barrels, 18 million barrels (37 percent) higher than a year ago. The majority of new stocks went to the Gulf Coast region, which grew by 1.1 million barrels. Meanwhile, the East Coast and Midwest regions were up 0.2 and 0.1 million barrels respectively, while Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks drew slightly. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 7.3 percent of total propane inventories.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343842099000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343842804000-17</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>Only oil stock not up.

"The need is there; the opportunities are there," said Pete Grannis, New York State first deputy comptroller, addressing environmental groups at the Island's first Offshore Wind Conference. Environmentalists at the Melville conference criticized federal officials for not embracing the green energy promised by the offshore farms. None currently exist in the United States, energy leaders say, while they are abundant in Europe. Deepwater Wind, an energy company based in Rhode Island, has proposals pending for at least four offshore wind farms on the East Coast, including a 1,000-megawatt farm 30 miles east of Montauk. Bill Moore, the company's chief executive, said creating the farms has become more profitable thanks to larger turbines. Officials from the New York Power Authority discussed their plans -- a partnership with Con Edison and the Long Island Power Authority -- to build a 350- to 700-megawatt wind farm off the coast of the Rockaways. Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign, one of the groups that sponsored the conference, criticized NYPA for moving too slowly. "It could and should move faster, if there was political will." NYPA's Robin Shanen, who is managing the Rockaways project, said the plan is in "its early stages." Industry leaders are hopeful opponent's concerns over noise and aesthetics will be eliminated by building farms farther off shore. http://www.newsday.com/long-island/state-leaders-tout-offshore-li-wind-farms-1.3873894</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343867297000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 20:28:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343867485000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon</Title><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1343851816000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 16:10:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If one is not satisfied with a stock's performance, and has identified one which is more to their liking in the same industry, I say switch horses.

By Julie Cart, Los Angeles Times July 25, 2012, 1:51 a.m. The Obama administration unveiled plans Tuesday to ramp up solar energy production, offering incentives for solar developers to cluster projects on 285,000 acres of federal land in the western U.S and opening an additional 19 million acres of the Mojave Desert for new power plants. The long-awaited plan also appears to rewind previous land-use decisions by the federal government. The pending policy rules out a long list of environmentally sensitive lands where the government — seeking to fast-track construction — had allowed solar development over the objections of environmentalists. The plan places 445 square miles of public land in play for utility-scale solar facilities. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters on a conference call that the country had no solar projects in the planning stages when Obama took office, contrasting the situation with the current rush to build plants. "We have turned that around," he said. "Three years later we stand at a proud moment in American history. It's hard to overstate what a significant milestone this is for our administration." The plan establishes 17 solar energy zones in six Western states, including 154,000 acres in California. The zones were chosen because they avoided major environmental, cultural or other conflicts. The policy encourages developers to select sites within zones by promising minimal environmental reviews and expedited permitting. In addition, the administration is completing work on a range of additional financial incentives, such as lower land lease payments and reduced costs of bonds. The first-of-its-kind plan was hammered out over two years by an array of federal, state and local groups. The new rules include a list of areas where development is forbidden because of environmental or cultural sensitivity. On the exclusion list is the entire Ivanpah Valley, a biologically diverse swath of desert that straddles the California-Nevada border. Conservation groups had fought to prevent approval of utility-scale projects in the region, contending that the desert — home to scores of endangered plants and animals — was not capable of absorbing industrial-scale change. Despite opposition and an unexpectedly large population of federally protected desert tortoises, the Ivanpah Valley now has at least two large projects underway, including the world's largest solar thermal power facility, being built by BrightSource Energy. "We had to learn the hard way from BrightSource that it is a sensitive area," said Ileene Anderson of the Center for Biological Diversity. An alliance of environmental groups, utilities and solar companies praised the new plan, saying it provided the industry needed certainty and guidelines while preserving the Mojave's most cherished places. The support is an about-face by developers, who had earlier opposed the zone approach as too restrictive. Critics contend that the policies are too late, coming after years of free-for-all leasing that encouraged rampant speculation. Since leasing began, the Bureau of Land Management has been working to process more than 300 solar applications. http://www.smartgridnews.com/artman/publish/Technologies_DG_Renewables/Solar-farm-land-rush-Interior-targets-17-sites-in-the-Southwest-5013.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343870954000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:29:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343870966000-35</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. solar plan creates energy zones, excludes sensitive lands</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343870954000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:29:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many of those are for land in California's Mojave Desert, where counties have seen the cost of private land soar and the desert given over to thousands of acres of mirrors. The state has 2 1/2 times more acreage in solar zones than other states. While the zone concept is intended to guide development, it allows some flexibility for companies to construct plants on millions of acres included in designated "variance" zones. Developers may win approval to build in those areas but will have fewer government incentives to do so. California has three-quarters of a million acres in variance areas. The fast-tracking of solar facilities on public lands is expected to generate nearly 24,000 megawatts of power by 2030, according to Mike Pool, acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. But so far, the unprecedented urgency given to solar energy projects on public land has yielded only 50 megawatts, said Interior official Steve Black. The plan will be finalized after a 30-day comment period. Officials said that whatever rules are eventually adopted will apply only to new projects and not the 17 solar facilities already awarded permits or the 78 currently in the approval pipeline.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343870966000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343871136000-36</Id><Title>Obama signs bill to expedite tribal development</Title><Msg>Obama signs bill to expedite tribal development The Associated Press Posted Jul 31, 2012 @ 02:13 PM Albuquerque, N.M. — President Barack Obama on Monday signed a bill designed to expedite home building and energy development on tribal lands. The law, sponsored by Rep. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., enables tribes to approve trust land leases directly, rather than waiting for approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The so-called HEARTH Act is expected to open the door to badly needed housing development on reservations, as well as wind and solar energy projects that tribes have been eager to launch. Land on American Indian reservations cannot be bought and sold because it is held in trust by the federal government. Previously, if a tribe or tribe member wanted to build a house or business, the Interior Department had to approve a “lease” of the land or mortgages. That process sometimes took years. “Tribal communities should be able to make their own decisions about how to use their own land, and the HEARTH Act will give them the freedom to do so,” Heinrich said in a statement. “The last thing the federal government should do is stand in the way of a family who wants to buy a home, and this bill will help make it easier for Native families to buy and build houses in the communities where their families have lived for generations.” Heinrich said the law will bring much-needed housing and businesses to Indian Country. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the legislation underscores Obama’s commitment to empower Indian nations and strengthen their economies. “This legislation complements the work we are doing at Interior to undertake the most comprehensive reforms of Indian land leasing regulations in more than 50 years,” he said in a statement. “These parallel efforts will have a real impact for individuals and families who want to own a home or build a business — generating investment, new jobs and revenues.” http://www.sooeveningnews.com/newsnow/x1629581849/Obama-signs-bill-to-expedite-tribal-development</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343871136000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:32:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343878072000-37</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. solar plan creates energy zones, excludes sensitive lands</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343870954000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:29:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thousands of years ago, prosperous conditions in fertile river locations throughout the world motivated nomadic people to form sedentary, agrarian communities. The inhabitants of these areas built cities, learned to fabricate pottery and to use metals, invented writing systems, domesticated animals and created complex social structures. In short, civilization was born when hunters and gatherers became settlers and farmers. Except for energy: today’s civilization is still based on gathering different forms of fossil energy, just like our ancestors, that collected berries and hunted animals until resources were depleted and they had to move elsewhere. Today, fossil energy resources are still sought and gathered until the last drop is spent. It becomes more and more evident that this is not a civilized behaviour, and certainly not a sustainable one, because there is no other planet in view to move to after resources are depleted and the atmosphere is spoiled. However, our hunting and gathering ancestors found a solution to that dilemma: they became farmers, sowing seeds in springtime and harvesting corn and fruits in autumn, making use of technical know-how and the abundance of solar energy for their survival. That’s exactly what is overdue in the energy sector: we must become farmers for energy, sow wind farms, wave and hydropower stations, biomass and geothermal co-generation plants, photovoltaic arrays, solar collectors and concentrating solar power plants and harvest energy for our demand. http://www.nerc.gov.jo/Download/AQUA-CSP-Executive-Summary-English-01.pdf Know the risks going forward, and the solutions: http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Stocks_%28A_to_Z%29/Stocks_E/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=26534&amp;tid=457809&amp;mid=457809&amp;tof=41&amp;frt=1</Msg><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1343878072000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 23:27:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343878376000-38</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. solar plan creates energy zones, excludes sensitive lands</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343870954000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 21:29:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The same is true for freshwater: if the freely collectable natural resources become too scarce because the number of people becomes too large, we have to sow rainwater-reservoirs, wastewater reuse systems and solar powered desalination plants, and harvest freshwater from them for our daily consumption.
