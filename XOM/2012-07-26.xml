The legislation will likely go nowhere in the Senate and the White House has issued a veto threat, but as with the tax and regulatory bills the House is also taking up this month, it puts lawmakers on the record on the issues that divide the two parties. Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, said the bill would offer lawmakers a choice between Obama's restrictive plan and the far more expansive Republican version that opens up areas off the Atlantic and southern California for drilling. The Republican proposal passed 253-170 with 25 Democrats supporting it. The House also voted 261-164 to reject the president's plan. The Interior Department on June 28 announced its 2012-2017 offshore oil and gas leasing program that schedules 12 potential lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and three off the coast of Alaska. The White House, in its veto threat issued earlier this week, said its plan makes available for development more than 75 percent of estimated, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in U.S. oceans. The House bill, by contrast, provides for 29 lease sales over the same five-year period, and includes areas of the Atlantic coast from Maine to Virginia, and areas off the southern coast of California as well as Alaskan and Gulf areas. Hastings said the administration's plan proposed fewer leases than any administration since the Jimmy Carter presidency. Singling out an election swing state, he said "Virginia will be left out in the cold" until 2017 at the earliest, cheating the commonwealth of thousands of jobs. The Obama plan, he said, keeps 85 percent of America's offshore areas off-limits to energy production. He and other Republicans said the Bush administration, responding to $4 gas prices in the summer of 2008, had newly opened nearly all offshore areas to energy production, but that Obama tossed that decision aside when he took office in 2009. The Obama administration, he said, has spent the past 3 1/2 years on a plan "that effectively re-imposes the drilling moratoria lifted in 2008." Hastings said the GOP plan would generate $600 million in additional revenue and create tens of thousands of new jobs. http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78973.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343278923000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343278935000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Offshore drilling plan rejected by House GOP</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343278923000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:02:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, chided Republicans for bringing six "giveaways to Big Oil" to the House floor, "all far too extreme to pass the Senate." The Republican bill, he said "would place drill rigs right off our beaches in Southern California" as well as off beaches in Maine and other eastern states. Democrats also argued that more domestic oil is in production today than at any time during the past 14 years and that oil companies already have leases in the Gulf that contain 18 billion barrels of oil and are sitting idle. The White House said the GOP bill would mandate Outer Continental Shelf lease sales in areas "without regard for significant issues such as state and local concerns and impacts on important fishing areas and with inadequate consideration of military use conflicts." Congress has 60 days from the time the Interior Department issued the proposal to reject or change it. Without congressional action, the plan will go into effect. Alaska's Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Wednesday introduced a companion to the House bill that adds lease sales off the mid-Atlantic coast, allows exploration from existing oil wells in southern California and provides revenue sharing to states with energy production off their coasts. Virginia's two Democratic senators, Jim Webb and Mark Warner, were among her co-sponsors.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343278935000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:02:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343278960000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Offshore drilling plan rejected by House GOP</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343278923000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:02:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans again deny Americans jobs in the near term.

The British oil and gas giant is trying out two new advanced biofuels in hopes that they will hit the market by 2014, according to a recent Bloomberg article. BP has a working demonstration biobutanol plant in Hull, England. BP is also planting grasses to support a proposed 36-million-gallon-a-year cellulosic ethanol plant in Florida, the article said. For those who are looking for some background, Biobutanol is created by fermenting biomass. Biobutanol can mix with higher concentrated gasoline, while current bioethanol can be retrofitted to produce biobutanol, the article said. Cellulosic ethanol, meanwhile, comes from various plants, grasses, or inedible plant parts. The article points to cellulosic ethanol being advantageous over sugarcane-based fuels because grass material needed for the fuel can be grown anywhere in the world, compared to sugarcane, which is limited to countries in the equator area. Demand for biofuels will increase in the future. BP estimates that, by 2030, 9% of the world’s transportation fuel sources will come from biofuel, up from 3% now. The Bloomberg article cites climate change, potential for increased market revenue for depressed farming communities, and energy security concerns as the driving catalyst for biofuels’ upward future trend. Philip New, CEO of BP’s biofuels unit, also states: “If you believe that demand for transport fuels is going to grow significantly, if you believe that for the foreseeable future we’re going to carry on using internal combustion engines and liquid fuels, then biofuels are going to be the only complement to crude oil that’s out there.” In the near future, BP is looking at Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, in which grass can be grown in order to support biofuel plants, New said. He also said BP, by 2024, is aiming to have barrel costs between $60 and $80, compared to today’s barrel value within the $140 to $150 range.

On July 25, the USDA and U.S. DOE announced it would invest $4.25 million in the project as part of the Biomass Research and Development Initiative. “We would be producing three items,” Delayne Johnson, the plant’s general manager, told EPM. “One is cellulosic ethanol the second one is additional corn oil— beyond what is a standard oil extraction system would do—and the third one is a higher value feed product that has high protein and low fiber.” The company spent the last three years developing the process. It was invented by Travis Brotherson, who is the plant engineer and is also in charge of research and development, Johnson said. Commercial cellulosic enzymes marketed by multiple companies were successfully utilized during testing. This isn’t the first time the company has received financial support for the project. Last summer, the company was awarded a $1.45 million grant from the Iowa Power Fund to build the bolt-on cellulosic ethanol production plant. Johnson declined to provide a total cost-estimate for the project but did say the company would be spending some of its own money. “We’re very excited about it,” he said. Quad County Corn Cooperative is currently working to finalize engineering plans and obtain the necessary permits. The company hopes to begin construction by next spring and reach operational status by the third or fourth quarter of 2013. The facility will produce about 1.8 MMgy of cellulosic ethanol, ramping up the plants total capacity to 31.8 MMgy, Johnson said. The process will result in 1.6 pounds of corn oil per bushel, up 1.1 pounds from the 0.5 pounds the ethanol plant is extracting currently. Due to the change in composition, the animal feed coproduct produced won’t exactly be distillers grains and will have similarities to corn gluten meal. In addition, output will reduce to about 85 percent of the distillers grains produced currently. “We expect that we’ll come out with a new name for the high protein, low fat product,” he said. The project at Quad County Corn Cooperative is one of 13 investments announced “as part of the Obama Administration’s all-of-the-above strategy to enhance U.S. energy security, reduce America's reliance on imported oil and leverage our domestic energy supply,” the DOE and USDA said in a joint statement. In all, $41 million was invested in five projects intended to diversify the energy portfolio of the U.S. and displace gasoline and eight projects with the goal of applying biomass genomics to improve biofuel feedstocks. More information about the other projects is available through Energy.gov. “If we want to develop affordable alternatives for oil and gasoline that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we need investments like these projects to spur innovation in bioenergy,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “By producing energy more efficiently and sustainably, we can create rural jobs, boost rural economies and help U.S. farmers, ranchers and foresters prosper.” On the same day, the DOE also released a new video that lays out how biofuel efficiency is advancing and production costs are decreasing. http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/8971/quad-county-receives-4-25-million-for-cellulosic-ethanol-add-on</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343324158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:35:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343324196000-28</Id><Title>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report July 26, 2012</Title><Msg>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report July 26, 2012 Released: July 26, 2012 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending July 20, 2012.

That’s becoming more and more evident as the heavy hand of heat and drought tightens its grip on the nation’s breadbasket. Ironically, for cattlemen at least, one of the victims of the widening disaster is biofuels production, which is finding high prices and low supplies of its feedstocks too much to bear. In fact, almost two-thirds of bankers in a sample of small, rural communities report a cutback or closing of local ethanol/biodiesel plants due to Mother Nature’s scorched earth policy. That’s according to a monthly survey of rural bankers in a 10-state area conducted by Ernie Goss, the Jack A. MacAllister chair in regional economics at Creighton University in Omaha, NE. From his monthly survey, Goss calculates a Rural Mainstreet Index (RMI), which gives a real-time indication of the economic health of ag- and energy-dependent rural communities, with 50.0 representing growth neutral. For June, the RMI declined to 47.9, its lowest level since September 2010 and down from last month’s 56.7. Drought is the driver, Goss says. Bank CEOs were asked about the impact of the drought on ethanol/biodiesel production. Of bankers with plants in their area, 64.3% reported negative impacts with 21.4% indicating plant closures and 42.9% detailing cutback in operations. Only 35.7% reported no impact from the drought. “The lack of available crops and higher prices for corn and soybeans are having significant and negative impacts on ethanol and biodiesel producers in the area,” Goss says. Cattlemen know something about that. The impacts of the drought are particularly negative for livestock producers. Korey Schow, CEO of the Bank of Keystone in Keystone, NE, says, “Persistent hot and dry conditions are causing cow-calf producers to sell a portion of their herd due to lack of pasture.” According to Goss, “The drought is putting a dent into the economies of the ag-dependent areas of the 10-state area. Just as the region has benefited mightily from very healthy farm income over the past few years, we are now detecting warning signals of a significant economic reversal for rural areas.” Which means bankers and their clients are feeling the heat. “The drought is severe in west-central Illinois. Conditions are like those in Steinbeck's “Grapes of Wrath,” but no one today wants to move to California,” says Jim Ashworth, president of Carlinville National Bank in Carlinville, IL. There is concern even in areas not suffering from drought. Pete Haddeland, CEO of First National Bank in Mahnomen, MN, expressed the view of the minority of areas with solid crops, “Our crops look good up here, but we still need rain.” RMI results Here are the results of the most recent RMI survey: http://beefmagazine.com/ethanol/drought-high-corn-prices-force-ethanol-shutdowns</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343337544000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343340388000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer bashes XOM ...</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1343315695000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 11:14:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the best contra indicators around.
