REAP provides vital cost-share assistance to help petroleum marketers make upgrades or install new equipment at retail stations, ensuring consumers have access to renewable and affordable fuels such as ethanol. Today’s vote highlights strong bipartisan support for market access to E15 and midlevel blends, such as E30 and E85. We will encourage Congress to include this provision in the final Farm Bill as well,” said Jennings. hoosieragtodayDOTcom/index.php/2013/06/10/ethanol-group-praises-senate-farm-bill-for-blender-pumps-and-e15/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370928733816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 01:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370956832518-2</Id><Title>CSU studies natural gas pipeline methane emissions</Title><Msg>Excessive emissions of the greenhouse gas could take away 'a lot of the potential benefits' of natural gas usage, CSU professor Bryan Willson says. Jun. 10, 2013 Written by Bobby Magill How much methane do natural gas pipelines release into the atmosphere? Colorado State University is working with both the natural gas industry and an environmental group to find out and to define what the national emissions rate is for natural gas transmission lines and storage facilities. CSU mechanical engineering professor Bryan Willson at the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory is leading the study, which will collect data from possible methane sources in natural gas transmission lines, including compressor stations and underground storage facilities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the nation’s natural gas industry is responsible for 25 percent of U.S. methane emissions, with transmission and storage accounting for 30 percent of that total. Methane is the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities, according to the EPA. “Natural gas can be a reduced CO2 solution if done right; but if there’s excessive methane leakage, it takes away a lot of of the potential benefits,” Willson said Monday. “There’s huge uncertainty about the actual loss from the industry, from the well head to the burner tip, so this is a part of a major effort to understand what that total methane loss profile is for the natural gas industry.” The study will provide an independent and peer-reviewed assessment of natural gas industry methane emissions, Willson said. He and his team expect to release their results in the first six months of 2014. The study is being paid for by both natural gas companies and the Environmental Defense Fund, but details of that funding are confidential because the money is coloradoanDOTcom/article/20130610/NEWS01/306100038/CSU-studies-natural-gas-pipeline-methane-emissions?nclick_check=1</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370956832518</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370960133253-3</Id><Topic><Title>New Allocations, War on Fossil Fuels Investments</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370616094229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 10:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bonds &amp; deposits – 11% 10 year German government bonds @1.628% ytm – 10% euro deposit – 1% allocation Residential Real Estate - 89% ...no change.

It is surprising that anyone would actually believe that an argument (their and the ECB's argument) based on the success of a program would carry any standing. By such logic one could justify any bank or investing firm ignoring regulations, misusing depositors funds, taking extreme risks with the money, and so long as the bets paid off they were legal... No... the bets were illegal in the first instance. The Court has the power to put an end to the ECB's policies too by prohibiting the Bundesbank from cooperating with them, and in fact a majority of Germans want them to do just that. You can be certain the Wall Street gamblers will not be pleased if they do so. They probably put an end to them too. Oil will plummet as will all stocks on such a ruling.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370961077051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:31:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370965903184-5</Id><Topic><Title>New Allocations, War on Fossil Fuels Investments</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370616094229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 10:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bonds &amp; deposits – 11% (10 year German government bonds @1.60% ytm – 10%,) sold; +0.26% change in price 3-month German t-bills, 10% euro deposit – 1% allocation A nice little snack</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370965903184</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:51:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370966824600-6</Id><Title>OPEC sees increased oil demand in second half of 2013</Title><Msg>OPEC said the world's oil demand will grow faster in the rest of 2013 than during the first half due to economic recovery and higher seasonal consumption, reports Reuters.</Msg><Username>stockminder</Username><Timestamp>1370966824600</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 12:07:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370978817680-7</Id><Title>Madoff Fool makes Propaganda after Propaganda call.
