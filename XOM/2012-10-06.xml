"We haven't used one penny -- one penny -- of the civic fund in this campaign because it's not allowed by law," Kilpatrick said in a 2001 televised debate that was shown to the jurors. Kilpatrick's words were contradicted by the testimony of Daniel Gotoff, a New York-based public opinion research expert who told jurors that he did polling and survey work for Kilpatrick's exploratory campaign committee in 2001 to help decide if it was viable for Kilpatrick to run for mayor and if subsequent campaign themes were working. Gotoff testified that he was hired by the Kilpatrick for Mayor group for his work, but was paid by the Kilpatrick Civic Fund, a nonprofit that was designed to help the community, kids and enhance voter participation. Jurors saw the invoices, which were billed to Kilpatrick for Mayor. They also saw the checks, which were cut by the Kilpatrick Civic Fund and signed by Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick's former chief of staff and ex-lover Christine Beatty. Kilpatrick's attorney James Thomas argued that the work the polling firm did was issue-related -- not just tied to Kilpatrick -- and never directly told anyone to vote for Kilpatrick. But Gotoff testified that his firm's research was done to help Kilpatrick decide if he should run for mayor, and if he could win. "This was done specifically for one candidate," Gotoff testified, adding that his research gave Kilpatrick some helpful information. "We found that there was a real opening for Kilpatrick in the race." According to Gotoff's testimony, before Kilpatrick decided to throw his hat in the ring for mayor, his polling firm helped draft a telephone survey of 500 likely voters in Detroit asking them about various issues and how they felt about certain negative and positive statements about Kilpatrick. The purpose of the phone survey, he testified, was to give Kilpatrick's campaign committee an idea on whether he could win. The phone survey, Gotoff testified, cost $21,930 -- which was paid to his firm in two installments by the Kilpatrick Civic Fund. After Kilpatrick decided to run for mayor, Gotoff's company conducted focus group research for the Kilpatrick for Mayor group to see, for example, if his advertising was working and to see what kinds of attitudes voters had about Kilpatrick. The focus group research cost $14,000, which was paid for with a check by the Kilpatrick Civic Fund, according to his testimony and the check flashed on a courtroom screen. That check also was signed by Beatty and Kilpatrick.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349526263013</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 08:24:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349526566822-9</Id><Title>We built 41 ethanol plants in Iowa, refineries, I call them, and we’re a net fuel exporter</Title><Msg>Up Front, Near the Action … Again Sen. John “Jack” Kibbie, D-Iowa, always manages to find himself in the middle of everything, whether it’s working to bring cellulosic ethanol to his home county, commanding tanks in Korea or sharing a ballot with John F. Kennedy. By Tim Portz | October 05, 2012 Q&amp;A Jack Kibbie, president of the Iowa Senate, has represented the citizens of north central Iowa in various capacities over the past six decades. First elected to public office in 1960, the Emmetsburg area farmer and legislator took a hiatus from public service only to raise his two sons. He shares his observations of the growth and future of the ethanol industry, his time in uniform and the beginnings of his political career. The next generation of ethanol production coming to your town as Project Liberty is currently under construction in Emmetsburg. Why do you think Poet LLC chose Emmetsburg as the home for its first cellulosic ethanol facility? Well, that’s hard to say. Some would say I had something to do with that. Poet has six plants in Iowa. At the time they were choosing the site for their plant, Gov. (Chester “Chet”) Culver had the Iowa Power Fund, which was $100 million over four years, for grants and low-interest loans for energy research. Poet got the largest award, which was close to $15 million. And of course, in our part of the state, I don’t think there has ever been a crop failure here. It’s a good area. They expect to get stover from within 30 miles of the Emmetsburg plant and to collect about 85,000 tons this fall, at about a ton to the acre. That’s only about 20 to 25 percent of the stover that is there. You drive by a field that has already been baled and picked up and you hardly know that they’ve taken off any stover. As thick as we plant corn nowadays, we’ve got to get rid of some of this stover anyway. So it’s time to look at other ways to produce ethanol and in Iowa, if you are going to look at biomass, corn stover is what is available. How important is ethanol to the agricultural economy in your district? To me, ethanol and the related businesses have really made Iowa and Iowa’s economy what they are today. We built 41 ethanol plants in Iowa, refineries, I call them, and we’re a net fuel exporter. We used to ship all of our corn down the Mississippi River and now most of it is processed locally. The jobs that has created, whether that is in the trucking industry or rail, it’s been a tremendous asset for the state of Iowa. It’s an important part of our economy and I think most people realize that. Coproducts like distillers grains are being shipped all over the world. Your sons now operate your farm. How did the crops turn out? There’s more crop there than we anticipated with this drought. They are combining beans now and they are running between 40 and 50 bushels per acre. On our corn, we’re hoping to average between 160 and 170 bushels per acre. Do you and your sons plan to deliver corn stover to the facility once the plant is operational? They are baling stover right now, this morning. They’ve got a contract with Poet to deliver those bales. So the community is buzzing with balers, because there is a lot of demand for stover bales. How important has acting as a representative for your constituents been to you? I feel very good about being able to work with my colleagues in both parties and what I’ve done in the renewable fuel area, both biodiesel and ethanol. But also important is work since 2006 on legislation to help veterans and their families. Iowa has probably passed more bills for veterans than any other state and we’ve been recognized for that nationally. It’s been very rewarding to me and the results are noticeable. What has been the most rewarding about serving as president of the Iowa Senate? After the 2004 election we had a 25-25 tie in the Iowa Senate so we had two presidents, one Republican and one Democrat, both picked by their peers. I was picked by the Democrats and we changed off. One week I would be president and one week the Republican would be president. My job was working with members of both parties, especially when presiding over the Senate. I tried to make rulings in which the minority party got a fair shake and most people gave me credit for that. People talk quite a bit about how partisan politics has become. You’ve been in and around politics in six different decades. Is there truth in that statement or have politics always been partisan? I think it’s true, it’s getting worse, and it’s too bad. Some of these elections get pretty negative. You can hardly expect people to do what they do in November and come to work in January and hold hands. We ought to work together more. Legislation, whether it’s state or federal, it’s a compromise. That’s getting tougher to do. Both parties say we are going to do more of that, but it’s not happening. Senator, when this issue of Ethanol Producer Magazine goes to press, Veteran’s Day will be just around the corner. Thank you for your service to our country. Thank you. I was drafted in October of 1951 and served in Korea from June of ’52 to June of ’53 and when I got there the 38th parallel was already established. I was on the front line most of the time that I was there. I was on Heartbreak Ridge from October of ’52 until I came home in June of ’53 in a tank for the 45th division. Our main goal up there was to protect infantry that went out on patrol every night. Can you talk a little bit about how your life as an elected official started? I understand the first ballot you appeared on also featured John F. Kennedy for president. When I came home from the military in July of 1953, for the ’54 election my mother was somewhat active in the Iowa Democratic Party as a precinct person in Palo Alto County. She asked me to get some names filled out on nomination papers. A few months later she came home from a meeting and said we had a new county chairman. I said, “Who’s that?” and she said, “You.” So, that’s how I got started. In 1960, when John F. Kennedy was running for president, it was my job to get people to run for office and we couldn’t find anybody to run for state representative so I put my name on the ballot. When I found someone I [thought I] would take my name off. Well, that didn’t happen and I got elected. It wasn’t a good year for Democrats that year in most places, especially in the Midwest. Iowa has 99 counties and Kennedy only carried five. One of those was our county. ethanolproducer</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349526566822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 08:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349526676501-10</Id><Title>Texas Rangers Choke AGAIN!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Hahahahahahahahaha!!

The new grid-scale flow batteries can store huge amounts of energy from wind turbines, which basically eliminates the herky-jerky, unpredictable nature of “raw” wind power straight from the skies and packages it into a steady, reliable stream. Unfortunately, that new battery could find itself all dressed up and nowhere to go, because “the usual suspects” in Congress are stalling a crucial tax credit for the U.S. wind power industry. What is a Redox Flow Battery? Basic redox flow battery technology has been around since the 1970s (redox stands for reduction-oxidation). They work by storing power in the form of liquid chemicals kept in two separate tanks. The system literally does “flow,” since to generate electricity the liquid electrolytes are pumped from the tanks through a reactor. Aside from being able to store vast amounts of energy from intermittent sources like wind and solar power, flow batteries can be idled for long periods without losing capacity, and they can be activated quickly when needed. The problem until recently has been that flow battery technology has been bulky, expensive, and unable to handle a reasonable range of temperatures. PNNL researchers solved these problems by focusing on a type of flow battery that uses two different vanadium ions (vanadium is a soft, silvery gray metallic element). Image: Courtesy of PNNL Conventional redox flow technology relies on sulfuric acid. The PNNL team gained a 70% increase in storage capacity by adding hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid also enabled the flow battery to operate in a wider range of temperatures. The result is a flow battery that requires tanks far smaller than previous technology, without wasting energy on extra equipment needed for temperature control. UniEnergy Built This! So Did We! UniEnergy has entered into a licensing agreement with PNNL to tweak the technology a little further for developing commercial products that can be used by electric utilities, industry customers, and power generators, including wind farms and solar installations. PNNL, of course, is a taxpayer-funded facility under the Department of Energy, so if the battery is a success and fortune smiles on the good folks at UniEnergy, we can all give ourselves a pat on the back. Sandia National Laboratory is working on another flow battery based on liquid salts, too, by the way. About that Wind Energy Tax Credit… Come to think of it, let’s not count our chickens before they hatch. The federal wind tax credit is the alternative energy industry’s equivalent of the kind of taxpayer support that has been showered on the fossil fuel industry for generations. There is nothing new or controversial about it. This kind of support is meant to sustain a vital industry and create new jobs, and given recent job growth in the wind industry (including a cool wind power jobs for veterans program) it has been a smashing success. Nevertheless, a routine extension due up this year has turned into a political firefight, because the aforementioned usual suspects in Congress (yes, leadership in the Republican party) are refusing to grant it. Aside from provoking outrage from the wind power industry and major corporate supporters like Starbucks, the lack of support for the wind industry has caused a rift in the Republican Party. The controversy intensified last summer after Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney declared his opposition to the wind tax credit. He also threw more fuel on the fire during the first presidential debate by supporting the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, while also stating that he would be open to eliminating subsidies for the oil and gas industry.

It’s a largely straightforward peg for an attack that some Democrats hope will appeal to centrist voters that may be swayed if they see the Republican candidate as part of the party’s extreme. In the Maine and Nebraska Senate races, the independent and Democratic candidates, respectively, have focused in on their opponents’ position, that man has little to no role in climate change, to argue that they are too far outside of the mainstream for voters in their states. In Maine, independent Senate candidate Angus King recently launched an ad featuring him telling the camera that Republican opponent “Charlie [Summers] … doubts climate change science, favors taxpayer subsidies for big oil, and thinks Washington isn't broken.” Summers said at one of the candidates’ debates, which was focused solely on energy and the environment, that he doesn’t believe that climate change is caused primarily by humans, and cited other factors -- like volcanic eruptions -- that he believes affect the environment. It’s a position that King spokeswoman Crystal Canney said offered a contrast between the two candidates, and one that she believes Maine voters -- who live in a state with a strong green energy sector and leans Democratic -- will consider in November. “I think when someone makes a statement that climate change is caused by volcanoes, I think you have to alert the public,” to what they believe, she said. Summers’ campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In Nebraska, Democrat Bob Kerrey focused in on Republican Deb Fischer’s doubts that humans play a role in climate change during a debate to question her ability to solve Nebraska’s problems. The state has, in recent months, been hit by severe droughts that have impacted much of the agricultural sector. “I do not think you can solve any problem unless you begin by saying there's a problem,” he said during the debate. Kerrey’s lagged Fischer by double digits in most recent polls, and faces an uphill battle in a state that has grown increasingly conservative over the years. But he did once serve as the state’s senator, and Nebraskans have historically been known for splitting the ticket to vote for more moderate lawmakers, so this is one issue where Kerrey believes he can create a useful contrast between himself and Fischer. Kerrey spokesman Chris Triebsch added that Fischer’s position seems to be a part of a larger pattern on Fischer’s part to “bury her head” on facts. “I think it speaks, in a larger context, to how she doesn't look at the facts on a number of issues, and lets the facts just hang out there and not address them,” he said. But Fischer’s spokesman Daniel Keylin said that the candidate is focused less on the why of climate change and more on improving the economy. “Senator Fischer’s top priority is turning our economy around and creating jobs, not finding ways to tax the middle-class and increase energy prices,” he said. Both Canney and Triebsch agreed that the focus on the climate change issue was a way to frame the Republican as extreme. And that’s the effort Democrat Elizabeth Warren has launched in Massachusetts, albeit in a slightly more roundabout way. She’s tied Sen. Scott Brown’s re-election to Republican control of the Senate and argued that, if Republicans controlled the Senate, climate-change denier Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) would chair the Environment and Public Works Committee and oversee the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s a strong argument in a state as blue as Massachusetts, and if Warren can successfully argue that Brown’s win would ensure far-right Republicans would gain control of the Senate, she could topple Brown’s campaign. And in a race as close as that in Massachusetts, climate change could be a niche issue that could drive voters to the polls in favor of one candidate or the other. Stanford professor of political science Jon Krosnick, who authored a study on the effects of climate change communication on races nationwide, said that there are subsets of voters who tend to focus in on one issue that could be compelled to turn out if candidates appeal to them on climate change. “They can actually be activated to vote by hearing the Democrat take a green position,” he said. “[Candidates] may actually enhance turnout as well as attract voters over to their side by discussing climate change.” He added that the current political climate, where neither candidate is a clear winner on significant issues like the economy and jobs, is ripe for issue voters to be swayed on a topic like climate change. But the presidential race is one in which the candidates have largely stayed silent on climate change -- Republican nominee Mitt Romney and President Obama have barely made mention of the environment, only commenting on environmental policy in terms of energy policy at stops in swing states where issues like the Keystone Pipeline resonate. Though environmental activists have expressed chagrin over the omission, the presidential race, played out over a much larger and more diverse spectrum, is unlikely to see much discussion of the issue before November. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349549250341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 14:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349555841982-21</Id><Topic><Title>Where's your money, Romney believers ?</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1349398373610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a complete fraud.

BRODER Published: October 6, 2012 WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney vowed in a campaign appearance earlier this year to “take a weed whacker” to the thicket of federal regulations adopted by the Obama administration and promised to impose a rigid freeze and cost cap on all new government rules. He has pledged to reverse a half-dozen major Environmental Protection Agency pollution and public health rules, to swiftly approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, to rewrite the ambitious new vehicle fuel efficiency standards and to open untouched coastal and wilderness areas to oil and gas exploration. Mr. Romney envisions a nation in which coal-burning power plants are given new life, oil derricks sprout on public lands and waters, industry is given a greater say in the writing and enforcement of environmental rules and the Code of Federal Regulations shrinks rather than grows. But as President Obama learned in his first years in office as he tried to undo some of his predecessor’s industry-friendly energy and environmental policies, such promises are easier to make than keep. They require the rewriting of decades-old laws, the assent of a balky Congress, favorable rulings from courts and a bureaucracy that works smoothly and swiftly to advance a president’s goals. That is a steep hill in today’s Washington. Cutting the regulatory state down to size has been a mainstay of Republican campaign oratory for years, and the basis of an avalanche of bills passed over the past 18 months by the conservative House Republican majority, all of which have died in the Democratic-led Senate. For a President Romney to succeed in his pledges would require a significant revision to the Clean Air Act and other landmark environmental laws enacted over the past 40 years. It would also mean overcoming longstanding political opposition to oil drilling off the Florida coastline and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. His administration would have to undergo a time-consuming process of withdrawing current and pending federal rules and resubmitting them through the complex regulatory system. While Mr. Romney blames the Obama administration for the edifice of federal law and regulation that he argues is choking off economic recovery, many of these rules go back decades. “It’s not just Obama he’s attacking, but past acts of Congress,” said Rena I. Steinzor, a specialist in administrative law at the University of Maryland and the president of the Center for Progressive Reform. “This does not all spring from the frenzied imagination of Obama’s E.P.A. It all comes down from statutes.” She noted that the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, and that while many conservatives and business lobbyists believe some of its provisions are costly and onerous, there is no groundswell to repeal it. Mr. Romney advocates changing one of its key provisions, requiring that human health standards be set without regard to cost, a shift supported by many House Republicans. But such a change would probably fail in the Senate if Democrats retained their majority there, and it would certainly be challenged in court. The sharpest contrasts between a second Obama term and a first Romney term might come in the way air pollution and fossil fuels are treated. Mr. Obama postponed a decision in 2011 on a stricter new standard for smog-causing ozone pollution that would have thrown hundreds of cities out of compliance with clean air rules, requiring costly new plans for limiting pollution from transportation and industry. But the president said he intended to allow the rule to go forward in 2013 or 2014. Mr. Romney has said that the rule is too expensive and that he will not pursue it. The Obama administration has also signaled that it intends to regulate the disposal of coal ash from power plants and to continue efforts to limit mountaintop-removal coal mining, a particularly destructive form of extraction. Mr. Romney says such potential rules will hurt coal-producing regions and has promised to encourage coal production. On hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas, which has led to a boom in domestic production, Mr. Romney has complained that federal rules are too strict and permitting is too slow. He wants to turn all permitting on public lands over to the states, an approach Mr. Obama has so far rejected because it would impose different standards across the country. Mr. Romney has also said that he will reverse the Obama administration’s proposed regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that contribute to climate change. In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, he described such rules as an “assault on coal and gas and oil” that is driving up energy costs. The Obama administration’s efforts to address climate change arise from a finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases endanger human health and the environment, based on the landmark 2007 Supreme Court decision Massachusetts v. E.P.A., brought by a dozen states, including Massachusetts when Mr. Romney was governor. A federal appeals court panel recently upheld the rules adopted by the E.P.A. as a result of that ruling, saying that the agency’s interpretation of the law and the Supreme Court decision were “unambiguously correct.” In responses to a recent questionnaire, Mr. Romney allowed that the world was getting warmer, that human activity contributes to the warming and that some action may be required to deal with it. But he opposes significant steps to combat climate change. He also has said he would revisit a recently announced fuel economy standard for cars and light trucks that would double fuel efficiency to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year while markedly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new target was the result of years of negotiation among automakers, the Department of Transportation, the E.P.A. and regulators in a number of states, led by California. Mr. Romney characterized the new mileage goals as “extreme,” saying they would limit vehicle choices for consumers and drive up the cost of new cars. Automakers, however, are not eager to renegotiate the standards and are already adopting designs and technology to meet them. The administration says that consumers will save as much as $8,000 in fuel costs over the life of the new vehicles, more than covering the added cost of the more efficient technology. As part of his critique of the Obama administration’s approach to regulation, Mr. Romney has asserted that the government has added tens of thousands of workers to write, review and enforce new federal rules. In an address at the University of Chicago in March, Mr. Romney said that Americans’ freedom is threatened by unelected, unaccountable regulators who he said were “always on the prowl.” “And under President Obama,” he said, “they’re multiplying like the proverbial rabbits. I mean, the number of federal employees has grown by 140,000 people under this president. And those regulators, they do a lot of damage.” Mr. Romney implied that all those new hires were regulatory jobs. In fact, almost all of the growth of the federal work force under the Obama administration has come in the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, according to PolitiFact, which based its analysis on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On one pending regulatory matter, the Keystone XL pipeline, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama are likely to arrive at the same conclusion, although by different mechanisms and on different timetables. Mr. Romney has frequently said that on his first day in office he would approve the pipeline, a much-contested project to carry heavy oil from tar sands formations in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Mr. Obama has approved a nearly 500-mile section of the pipeline from Oklahoma to the gulf and has signaled that he intends to green-light the rest of the project in 2013 after environmental and routing reviews are completed. For Mr. Romney to make good on his pledge to approve the project on Jan. 20, 2013, he would need a determination from the State Department — which would still be led by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton until noon on that day — that the project was in the national interest. The department is not yet ready to issue that finding.
