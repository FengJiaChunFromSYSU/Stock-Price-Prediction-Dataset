I do believe there will be an independence day celebration for one tormented soul after all now... The dear sweet American Fräulein who is staying with us broken down emotionally yesterday evening – 4 July – and expressed herself in the most revealing of ways for a woman. She cried over her terrible prospects in the USA. She blames the people, that is the races other than her own, who put Obama in and maintain control of the US today. Out of the sweet lips of a damsel came things I could not write on this board or they would surely be censored. Her platinum blonde hair contrasted with her flushed face and shined magically. Her blue eyes overflowed with tears. She was very vulnerable and sexy. But I’m impervious to attraction to a female when I have my luscious Freyja right near by. So I phoned a friend of mine from my gymnasium days, in Düsseldorf, who I know shares sentiments exactly like she does. Although he does not have to put up with people like Obama. His father worked in the defence industry and he does too. He is single. Once she cleared up some I placed her on the video phone. The two of them spent several hours talking together. He’s coming to visit today for the weekend to meet her in the flesh. He surely knows how to unlock the door to her secrets now. I think she will be on her way to Düsseldorf by Monday. He’s a gentleman and can take care of her problems easily. Obama should apply for a role as Cupid. He’s missed his calling.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372994597539</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 23:23:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372996203061-5</Id><Title>Victoria Justice - Gold (Audio)</Title><Msg>Victoria Justice - Gold (Audio) 220,056 views 2 weeks ago YouTube ----------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- Victorious Cast feat.
