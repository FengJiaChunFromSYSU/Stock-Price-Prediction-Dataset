Even at this early stage of a much belated evolutionary process, empirical evidence and ongoing technological advances, as well as pro clean energy and sustainable development polices and market developments, highlight the fallacy of their arguments. Observed evidence (two examples here and here) indicates that coupled with adequate grid infrastructure and energy policy reform, solar and wind power generation — on and off-grid — can reduce carbon and greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the security and resiliency of power supplies without putting an excessive burden on consumers. Not only does this benefit the environment and the health, well-being, and opportunities of current and future generations, it’s also generating thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue each year. Renewable Energy &amp; Clean-Tech Paves the Pathway Among developed countries, sunny Germany’s been at the forefront of the global drive towards building low-carbon societies based on clean, renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energy. Private sector and government actions and policies that all but brought down the banking and financial system caused global recessions, led to wars, conflicts, growing inequality, and a pervasive sense of uncertainty and fear in the US. In contrast, federal government actions and energy policy reform in Germany have created an environment and conditions that have diversified, expanded, and made Germany’s economy more dynamic, robust and resilient, driving employment to record-high levels and improving social and environmental conditions. No doubt Germany is struggling to overcome obstacles and resistance to Premier Angela Merkel’s plan to eliminate reliance on nuclear power by building out solar and wind power generation capacity as replacements. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who cares to familiarize themselves with such revolutionary challenges. In fact, they make Germany’s success in this regard all the more remarkable. Just yesterday, Bloomberg reported that contracts to deliver electricity for 2014 in Germany and France dropped to record-low levels. The reason? “Rising solar output is expected to cut demand for other electricity sources.” Paraphrasing a research note from Per Lekander – an analyst at UBS’s Paris office — “As much as 18 percent of electricity demand may be replaced by solar panels not connected to Germany’s grid, reducing demand for other sources by 6 to 10 percent by 2020.” “The unsubsidized solar growth should drive wholesale power prices further down,” Lekander added. The availability of electricity generation capacity in Germany is expected to rise, with national electricity production forecast to increase to 64,200 megawatts (MW) on January 21 from 63,600 MW today, according to data from the European Energy Exchange’s Transparency Platform. sDOTtt/1yCto</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358485967442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:12:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358487123430-2</Id><Topic><Title>Rising Solar Energy Output Drives German &amp; French Power Prices To Record Lows</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358485967442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:12:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>German Power Tumbles to Record Low as Solar Damps Demand By Julia Mengewein - Jan 16, 2013 10:44 AM MT 0 Comments Power for 2014 delivery in Germany and France dropped to records as rising solar output is expected to cut demand for other electricity sources. German power, a European benchmark, fell as much as 1.5 percent, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The equivalent French contract declined 0.3 percent. Electricity for Germany next year lost 65 cents to 43.30 euros ($57.93) a megawatt-hour, it’s biggest decline since March 6, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The French equivalent lost 15 cents to 46.20 euros. As much as 18 percent of electricity demand may be replaced by solar panels not connected to Germany’s grid, reducing demand for other sources by 6 to 10 percent by 2020, Per Lekander, a Paris-based analyst at UBS AG (UBSN), said in a research note. “The unsubsidized solar growth should drive wholesale power prices further down,” he said. European power demand was unchanged in 2012 and will decline 0.7 percent this year on a “still weak economic outlook,” Paolo Coghe, a Paris-based analyst at Societe Generale SA (GLE), said in an e-mailed note. While the bank’s model represents 63 percent of European Union demand, it doesn’t include Germany. In France, Electricite de France SA has an unplanned shutdown at its 1,495-megawatt Civaux-1 nuclear reactor, the company said on its website. In Germany, RWE AG will resume output at its 634-megawatt Weisweiler-G lignite plant later tonight after halting the unit Jan. 14 on a boiler fault, according to the company’s website. Generation availability in Germany is expected to rise. The nation’s power output is forecast to climb to 64,200 megawatts on Jan. 21 from 63,600 megawatts today, European Energy Exchange AG said on its transparency website. In France, nuclear production will stay unchanged at 58,900 megawatts until Jan. 21, according to data from grid operator RTE. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-16/european-power-for-february-rises-on-freezing-weather-forecasts.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358487123430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:32:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358487246159-3</Id><Topic><Title>Rising Solar Energy Output Drives German &amp; French Power Prices To Record Lows</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358485967442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:12:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Contact your senators senateDOTgov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm Contact your representatives houseDOTgov/htbin/findrep</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358487246159</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:34:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358487787956-4</Id><Title>Energy Department Announces New Funding to Support Sustainable, Cost-Effective Biofuels from Algae</Title><Msg>Energy Department Announces New Funding to Support Sustainable, Cost-Effective Biofuels from Algae January 17, 2013 As part of the Energy Department's efforts to diversify the nation's energy portfolio and support America's energy entrepreneurs and innovators, the Department today announced up to $10 million to help unlock the potential of biofuels made from algae. The funding will support research projects aimed at boosting the productivity of algae cultivation systems and developing and demonstrating effective, energy-efficient, and low-cost algae harvest and processing technologies, such as centrifugation and extraction. These research projects will help maximize yield from algae and improve production of biofuel intermediates—the product of algae cultivation and pre-processing. Increasing the yields of biofuel intermediates will help lower the cost of biofuels by decreasing capital and operating costs, while enhancing the sustainability of algal biofuels by capturing energy from every available part of the feedstock and reducing water resource requirements. At a large-scale, these technologies could help speed commercialization of domestically-produced, cost-competitive biofuels from algae. The Department encourages applicants from industry, universities, and national laboratories. A cost share of at least 20% of the total project cost is required.

( SLB ) Friday reported a fall in profit for the fourth quarter, hurt partly by seasonal slowdowns and contract delays, but revenue grew on strong international performance. The company had warned last month that its fourth-quarter earnings would be hurt by continued contractual delays in the Europe, CIS and Africa as well as weaker than anticipated drilling activity in North America. Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said today, ''Our fourth-quarter results showed continued growth in key markets in addition to typical year-end product, software and multiclient sales. Performance was driven by international areas where service quality was strong, and service capacity tight for certain product lines.'' Schlumberger noted today that its results were impacted by the previously announced seasonal slowdowns and contract delays as well as by mobilization and new project start-up costs. In North America, strong performance in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico overcame lower-than-expected activity in Canada and further weakening in the U.S. land markets. Net income attributable to the company slid to $1.36 billion, from $1.41 billion a year before. On a reported basis, income from continuing operations totaled $1.37 billion, versus last year's $1.40 billion. The company said it recorded charges of $0.06 per share during the recent quarter, compared with $0.06 per share in the prior-year period. Schlumberger recorded charges of $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012, same as last year. Cost of revenue increased 10 percent to $8.8 billion. Excluding charges and credits, adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger was $1.44 billion or $1.08 per share. On average, 32 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings per share of $1.07 for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-time items. Revenue for the quarter advanced to $11.17 billion from last year's $10.30 billion and $10.61 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Analysts estimated revenues of $10.82 billion for the quarter. Reservoir Characterization generated $3.15 billion in the quarter, while Drilling revenues amounted to $4.14 billion. Production revenues were $3.92 billion. Geographically, North America generated $3.41 billion and Latin America$2.07 billion. Europe/CIS/Africa revenues were $2.96 billion and Middle East &amp; Asia revenues totaled $2.58 billion. For the full year, net income grew to $5.49 billion from $5 billion and revenue increased to $42.15 billion from $36.96 billion. On January 17, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a 13.6 percent increase in the quarterly dividend. SLB closed on Thursday at $73.37. nasdaqDOTcom/article/schlumberger-q4-profit-slides-amid-seasonal-slowdowns-contract-delays-20130118-00105</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358518554456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:15:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358518765691-10</Id><Topic><Title>Schlumberger Q4 Profit Slides Amid Seasonal Slowdowns, Contract Delays</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358518554456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:15:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McMoRan posts loss as failed well tests add to costs Morgan Stanley posts profit on surging equity trading 8:12am EST Fri Jan 18, 2013 8:27am EST (Reuters) - McMoRan Exploration Co (MMR) reported its fourth straight quarterly loss on higher costs resulting from repeated failures to launch a key gas well, a delay that has prompted bidder Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc (FCX) to lower its offer. Freeport-McMoRan reduced its takeover offer by 5 percent to $14.75 per share on December 28 after McMoRan failed to unclog the Davy Jones No.1 well in the Gulf of Mexico. McMoRan's exploration costs shot up 80 percent to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter. The company has sunk in nearly $1 billion in the 29,000-foot Davy Jones No.1 well. The company is evaluating plans to pump a mixture of fluids including proppants, used to hold open fissures in wells, to facilitate movement of gas into the well bore, the company said on Friday. McMoRan holds a 63.4 percent working interest in Davy Jones field. Energy XXI (Bermuda) Ltd, Japan's JX Nippon Oil Exploration (Gulf) Ltd and oil and gas tycoon William "Tex" Moncrief Jr's Moncrief Offshore LLC own the rest. The company said recent operations confirmed that perforations were open. Mineral deposits clogging the well had delayed the flow-test by more than a year, adding to the company's costs and straining its balance sheet before Freeport-McMoRan stepped in with its bid. Freeport-McMoRan unveiled its deal to buy McMoRan and Plains Exploration &amp; Production Co (PXP.N) for $9 billion in early December. Plains owns nearly a third of McMoRan. A deal would reunite Freeport-McMoRan and McMoRan Exploration after more than two decades. Freeport-McMoRan and the company now known as McMoRan Exploration Co were spun off in the 1980s and 1990s from the former Freeport-McMoRan Inc. McMoRan shares have risen about 8 percent since the deal was announced on December 5. McMoRan reported net loss of $1.2 million, or 1 cent per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $28.4 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 31 percent to $84.2 million. Fourth-quarter production fell 30 percent to average 119 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/01/18/us-freeport-plains-mcmoranexploration-idUSBRE90H0O120130118</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358518765691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:19:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358519556560-11</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Filth and Glenn Beckistan...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1358472714325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:31:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If a 20 year old gets drunk and kills a 6 year old with a car should we pass a law that 20 year old people USA wide can't drive?

Brent Erickson, executive vice president of BIO, opened the call by noting that the advanced biofuels industry is waiting for the EPA to release the 2013 volume obligations. “We don’t know when exactly that will happen, but it should happen fairly soon,” he said. Erickson stressed that the yearly RFS volume rulemaking is vitally important to biofuel companies and their investors. He also commended the industry for recent strides towards commercialization, as numerous companies are breaking ground, making construction progress, and even entering the commissioning phase at commercial-scale biorefineries. “The visible progress of these companies represents not just years of research and development and millions of dollars in investment, but also future opportunities for economic growth, investment, and most importantly, employment opportunities, job creation, and economic growth for our country,” Erickson said. The accomplishments of the industry cannot be overstated, he continued, noting that the sector has moved from the drawing board to pilot- and demonstration- and commercial-scale production within a decade. “To do so during a severe economic downturn is all the more amazing,” he said. The RFS is working as it was designed to do, Erickson said. It needs to keep working consistently and with timely rulemakings to provide assurance to those investing in the industry, he continued. Representatives of Abengoa Bioenergy, Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels, and DuPont Industrial Biosciences were also on hand to discuss progress made with their cellulosic biofuel projects. Chris Standlee, executive vice president of Abengoa Bioenergy spoke about the 25 MMgy facility his company is constructing in Hugoton, Kan. Much of the construction work on the plant is already complete, including the installation of four 1.5 million gallons fermentation tanks, two 6 million gallon waste water treatment tanks, distillation columns, and other structures. Virtually all the equipment required for the project is either onsite, installed or ordered. “Frankly, startup is just a few months away,” he continued. Standlee also spoke about the economic impact of the plant, noting that it is supporting 300 construction jobs, 65 permanent jobs with a combined payroll of approximately $5 million, and providing $17 million in payments to local farmers for feedstock. Wade Robey, a board member at Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels, spoke about the cellulosic ethanol plant under development by his company in Emmetsburg, Iowa. The project is moving ahead on schedule he said, with completion scheduled for the end of 2013. Finally, Jan Koninckx, global business director for biorefineries at DuPont Industrial Biosciences, provided an update of the 30 MMgy facility his company is developing in central Iowa. We plan to start-up the plant during the second half of 2014, he said.

Businessweek The agency also established the Agua Caliente Solar Energy Zone, 2,550 acres in the state with strong sunlight and few resource conflicts that are well-suited for solar projects, according to a U.S. Interior Department statement today. Agua Caliente is the third solar zone in Arizona and the 18th in the nation. Establishing such areas will facilitate development by identifying sites where projects are unlikely to face environmental hurdles and other potential problems. Creating zones for renewable energy “lays a solid foundation for making sure it happens in the right way and the right places,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in the statement. The agency is working with environmentalists, local communities, American Indian tribes and other groups “to reduce potential resource conflicts and expedite appropriate projects.” The U.S. is promoting wider use of renewable energy to reduce consumption of foreign oil and create clean-energy jobs, Salazar said. The agency has approved 34 utility-scale wind, solar and geothermal projects on public land since 2009 with more than 10,400 megawatts of capacity. businessweekDOTcom/news/2013-01-18/u-dot-s-dot-establishes-renewable-energy-zone-on-public-land-in-arizona</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358536397568</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:13:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358536462112-27</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Filth and Glenn Beckistan...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1358472714325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:31:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ref-Sturmabteilung the Redneck Voice of Amerika speaks again.

See more photos of ranchers from in and around Spalding, Neb. from photographer Michael S. Williamson. By Juliet Eilperin and Steven Mufson, Published: January 17 The State Department is close to completing a draft of an environmental review that will help determine whether President Obama approves the Keystone XL pipeline, as environmental and energy industry groups sought to bolster their position with new information. Pipeline opponent Oil Change International released a report Thursday saying that estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands development have failed to include the full emissions from a byproduct of refining oil sands crude — a coallike substance known as petroleum coke. At the same time, the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group funded partly by oil and gas firms, issued an economic analysis that said the 1,700-mile pipeline connecting Alberta’s oil sands to Texas refineries would generate $580.2 million in direct spending over two years in Nebraska. And 10 Republican governors and Saskatchewan’s premier sent a letter to Obama that urged him to approve the pipeline, which would ship 700,000 barrels of crude daily from Canada to the United States. The State Department’s draft Environmental Impact Statement, which could come in the next few weeks, will be open to public comment before it is finalized. Obama initially rejected the project a year ago on the grounds that his administration needed more time to review its effect on the ecologically sensitive Sand Hills region in Nebraska. The pipeline’s builder, TransCanada, revised the route and moved it farther east of Nebraska’s Ogalalla Aquifer, a key water supply. Gov. Dave Heineman (R) is expected to endorse the project. But environmentalists still question the climate impact of extracting bitumen, a viscous oil that comes from formations of sand, clay and water. The process produces more carbon emissions as well as petroleum coke, or petcoke, a byproduct that can be burned like coal and is sometimes sold at low prices to power plants or industries such as aluminum and steel. The Oil Change International report said that burning petcoke emits 5 percent to 10 percent more carbon dioxide per unit of energy than coal, so petroleum coke use would raise estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands development 13 percent above earlier State Department estimates. The State Department analyzed this issue in its initial environmental review and concluded that burning petcoke could increase emissions by up to 14 percent, but added that, since in many instances this combustion would be replacing coal, the emissions difference would be “much smaller.” TransCanada said that “there is nothing new” in Oil Change International’s report. The company said crude derived from oil sands was no worse than heavy oils from California, Mexico or Venezuela, and moving that oil by pipeline would be more energy- efficient than transporting it by rail or truck. Weighing the project’s carbon impact poses a challenge for Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), Obama’s nominee to become secretary of state. Kerry has devoted his career to fighting global warming. Regarding Keystone XL, he told the Hill newspaper in October that “there’s a lot at stake here, and I’ll do my best to leave no question unanswered, including every possible economic and environmental consideration, before a final decision is made.” Kerry has shown a detailed grasp of issues surrounding the pipeline application during his initial meetings with State Department officials, according to individuals familiar with the sessions who asked not to be identified because Kerry has yet to be confirmed. Officials are currently analyzing how several factors, including increased U.S. oil production and greater vehicle efficiency, affect the market analysis they prepared for their initial assessment of the project. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson said that the draft assessment will be ready “in the near future” and that the department is conducting the permit review “in a rigorous, transparent and efficient manner, using existing analysis as appropriate.” Supporters of the pipeline, such as Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, say it will produce jobs and enhance the nation’s energy supply. “It once again boils down to a political decision by the White House: Will they follow what’s in the best interest of the country, or will they follow other political pressures?” Gerard asked. The Consumer Energy Alliance analysis showing the benefits to Nebraska says the project would produce 1,343 jobs for two years in sectors that include pipeline and power line construction. It would inject more than half a billion into the economy during that time as TransCanada employed workers, bought land, compensated farmers for damaged crops, rented hotel rooms and installed pump stations and terminals, the study says. It also assumes the state will collect income tax not only from Nebraskans working in the state on the pipeline but also those Nebraskans working on portions of the project in Montana and South Dakota. Harvard University environmental economist Robert Stavins wrote in an e-mail: “The general finding that there are financial benefits to residents of the state of Nebraska of construction of the pipeline is not surprising. The key question is whether the construction of the pipeline is in the long-term interest of the country as a whole, when all factors — financial and other impacts, including environmental ones — are considered.” washingtonpostDOTcom/business/economy/in-keystone-xl-debate-environmental-group-wants-petcoke-counted-in-impact-statements/2013/01/17/d6b45f0a-609e-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_story_1.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358537142520</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:25:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358537542284-30</Id><Topic><Title>Predictions for next week !!</Title><Username>jamessims59</Username><Timestamp>1358528179845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:56:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great report!</Msg><Username>michaelandrews642</Username><Timestamp>1358537542284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:32:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358538223385-31</Id><Topic><Title>Rising Solar Energy Output Drives German &amp; French Power Prices To Record Lows</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358485967442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:12:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vote Solar: Net metering to provide over USD 92 million in benefits to California ratepayers Vote Solar Director Adam Browning: “We've got a long way to go in revamping an antiquated energy grid” On January 15th, 2013, Vote Solar Initiative (San Francisco, California, U.S.) announced that it has released a July 2012 California Solar Initiative (CSI) report. The report finds that net-metered rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) will provide more than USD 92 million in annual benefits to ratepayers of California's three investor-owned utilities. "When someone decides to put solar panels on their roof, they not only generate clean power, but also reduce strain on the electric grid while offering financial benefits to all ratepayers. We've got a long way to go in revamping an antiquated energy grid and growing California's clean economy and net metering is critical to those efforts," Vote Solar Initiative Executive Director Adam Browning stated. A key driver for solar PV across California's rooftops Net metering has been a key driver of the rapid expansion of solar PV across California's rooftops, with two-thirds of home installations now occurring in low and median income neighborhoods, according to the report. The report finds that the financial benefits of net metered power outweigh the costs with a total net benefit value of more than USD 92 million annually by the time the state's net metering program is fully subscribed. solarserverDOTcom/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2013/kw03/vote-solar-net-metering-to-provide-over-usd-92-million-in-benefits-to-california-ratepayers.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358538223385</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:43:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358538494011-32</Id><Title>Solar Power Purchase Agreements</Title><Msg>Solar Power Purchase Agreements Fact Sheet File(s): Download PDF version What is a solar power purchase agreement? A solar power purchase agreement (PPA) is a financial agreement where a developer arranges for the design, permitting, financing and installation of a solar energy system on a customer’s property at little to no cost. The developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate that is typically lower than the local utility’s retail rate. This lower electricity price serves to offset the customer’s purchase of electricity from the grid while the developer receives the income from these sales of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system. PPAs typically range from 10 to 25 years and the developer remains responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system for the duration of the agreement. At the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the PPA, have the developer remove the system or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer. Benefits of PPAs to Solar Customers •No or low upfront capital costs: The developer handles the upfront costs of sizing, procuring and installing the solar PV system. Without any upfront investment, the host customer is able to adopt solar and begin saving money as soon as the system becomes operational. •Reduced energy costs: Solar PPAs provide a fixed, predictable cost of electricity for the duration of the agreement and are structured in one of two ways. Under the fixed escalator plan, the price the customer pays rises at a predetermined rate, typically between 2% - 5%. This is often lower than projected utility price increases. The fixed price plan, on the other hand, maintains a constant price throughout the term of the PPA saving the customer more as utility prices rise over time. •Limited risk: The developer is responsible for system performance and operating risk. •Better leverage of available tax credits: Developers are typically better positioned to utilize available tax credits to reduce system costs. For example, municipal hosts and other public entities with no taxable income would not otherwise be able to take advantage of the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit. •Potential increase in property value: A solar PV system has been shown to increase residential property values. The long term nature of these agreements allows PPAs to be transferred with the property and thus provides customers a means to invest in their home at little or no cost. Market Adoption and Policy PPAs provide a means to avoid the upfront capital costs of installing a solar PV system as well as simplifying the process for the host customer. In some states, however, the PPA model faces regulatory and legislative challenges that would regulate developers as electric utilities. A solar lease is another form of third-party financing that is very similar to a PPA, but does not involve the sale of electric power. Instead, customers lease the system as they would an automobile. In both cases, the system is owned by a third party while the host customer receives the benefits of solar with little or no up-front costs. These third-party financing models have quickly become the most popular method for customers to realize the benefits of solar energy. Colorado, for example, first entered the market in 2010 and by mid-2011 third-party installations represented over 60% of all residential installations and continued to rise to 75% through the first half of 2012. This upward trend is evident throughout states that have introduced third-party financing models. PPA Considerations •SRECs: Solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) show that a certain amount of electricity was produced using solar energy. They are typically bought and sold by load serving entities (typically regulated utilities) to meet obligations associated with state-level renewable energy standards. SRECs are also used by consumers who voluntarily purchase them for marketing claims or other use. Most often in PPAs , SRECs are owned by the developer. When entering into a PPA, it will be important for a customer to clearly understand who owns and can sell the SRECs generated from the PV system, the risks attendant to SREC ownership, and the tradeoffs with respect to PPA price. •How to finance: While both third-party financing models provide numerous benefits, purchasing a PV system outright has its own benefits. Anyone considering installing a solar PV system should consider each of the financing options available to find the best fit. •Site upgrades: While the developer is responsible for installation, operation and maintenance of a solar PV system, the host customer may need to make investments in their property in order to support the installation of the system, lower the cost of installation or to comply with local ordinances. This might include, for example, rooftop repairs or trimming trees that shade the PV system. •Possible higher property taxes: While a PV system may help to raise the site’s property value, there is also a potential increase in property taxes when the property value is reassessed. Different states, however, have different policies in regards to these possible property tax increases. seiaDOTorg/research-resources/solar-power-purchase-agreements</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358538494011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:48:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358539182038-33</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Filth and Glenn Beckistan...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1358472714325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:31:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you noticed?

Interior said Friday that it will float a new version of draft rules first issued last May and take new comments on the proposal that will govern “fracking” on public lands. “In response to comments from stakeholders and the public, the [Bureau of Land Management] is making improvements to the draft proposal in order to maximize flexibility, facilitate coordination with state practices and ensure that operators on public lands implement best practices,” Interior spokesman Blake Androff said Friday. The decision to issue another draft, which is expected to surface in the first quarter of this year, marks a significant delay in the plan. Interior initially floated the draft rules last May, and had earlier intended to finalize them by the end of 2012, although that timeline had already slipped. “The agency intends to publish a new draft proposal in the first quarter of this year and will seek additional comments," Androff said. "Once comments on the updated draft have been collected and analyzed, the BLM expects to issue a final rule that will ensure that operators apply proven cost-effective safety and environmental protection processes when engaging in hydraulic fracturing on our public lands,” he said. Interior did not provide a new timeline for finalizing the rules. The American Petroleum Institute (API), a powerful petroleum industry lobbying group that has attacked the rules, praised the decision to pull back the earlier plan. “API asked the administration to reconsider the rules, and we welcome this move as a positive first step,” said API President Jack Gerard in a statement. “However, the real test will be in the substance of the re-proposal. We hope the administration will recognize the strong oversight provided by existing state and federal regulations and take sufficient time to review the many thoughtful comments provided by the oil and natural gas industry and others.” Fracking involves high-pressure injections of water, chemicals and sand into shale formations to open seams that enable hydrocarbons to flow. Interior expects to send the revised draft regulation to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review next week. The revision is expected to maintain the three principal elements of the plan, although it’s not clear what the specific alterations will entail. The plan requires energy companies to disclose chemicals used in the fracking process. The draft rules also contained requirements on oil-and-gas well integrity to verify that fluids from the fracking process aren’t escaping into nearby water supplies, and require companies to have management plans for large volumes of so-called flowback water. “Building on preliminary input from key stakeholders, the Bureau of Land Management proposed a commonsense and achievable rule in 2012 that leverages technologies already in use by companies to protect important water resources and improve transparency through disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Many companies are already implementing these best practices,” Androff said.   “In response to comments from stakeholders and the public, the BLM is making improvements to the draft proposal in order to maximize flexibility, facilitate coordination with state practices and ensure that operators on public lands implement best practices.” The method is enabling an oil-and-gas production boom in a number of states, but is bringing fears of water pollution and other ecological harms alongside it.   The proposed rules for federal lands have faced heavy criticism from industry groups and some Republicans, who say state oversight is sufficient. While much of the U.S. production boom enabled by fracking has occurred on private and state lands, the energy industry fears that Obama administration officials will tighten regulation along a number of fronts beyond the federal lands rule. Interior’s draft rule has also attracted some attacks from the left by critics who say it is too weak. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/278107-interior-pumps-brakes-on-gas-fracking-rule-plans-revision</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358555325107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:28:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358556235474-42</Id><Title>Dow Chemical cuts trade group ties over gas policy</Title><Msg>Dow Chemical cuts trade group ties over gas policy Jan. 18, 2013, 4:09 p.m. EST By Tennille Tracy WASHINGTON--Dow Chemical Co. /quotes/zigman/224698/quotes/nls/dow DOW -0.03% severed ties Friday with one of Washington's most powerful groups representing the manufacturing industry, citing differing opinions over whether the U.S. should export its newly abundant supplies of natural gas. Dow's decision to split from the National Association of Manufacturers marks a new chapter in the increasingly fierce battle over natural-gas exports, demonstrating how divisive the issue has become for some of the nation's largest companies. In a letter to NAM President Jay Timmons on Friday, and obtained by Dow Jones, Dow Chemical accuses the group of siding with member companies that are in the natural-gas industry, rather than adopt "a position of neutrality on an issue that clearly splits its membership." Dow Chemical is responding to a statement NAM posted earlier this week in support of natural-gas exports. In it, NAM said sales of natural gas to foreign buyers would create opportunities for U.S. businesses. A spokesman for NAM wasn't available for immediate comment. Dow Chemical, by contrast, is pushing for limits on natural-gas exports. Its chief executive, Andrew Liveris, has said unchecked exports will increase domestic prices and threaten investments in the U.S. manufacturing sector. "The unfettered export of natural gas is widely understood to have serious implications for the cost and volatility of manufacturing feedstock prices," Dow says in its letter to NAM. "NAM's decision therefore places the views of oil and gas producers above the interests of its manufacturing members." Exxon Mobil Corp. /quotes/zigman/203975/quotes/nls/xom XOM +0.67% , another NAM member company, is proposing to build a natural-gas export terminal in Texas. It has accused Dow and other companies opposed to limitless exports of being "protectionist." Dow Chemical spokeswoman Nancy Lamb declined to comment on the letter. But she said the company's membership in another influential group, the American Chemistry Council, "remains to be seen." The fight between Dow, Exxon Mobil and, now, the groups that represent their interests in Washington comes as U.S. regulators consider more than a dozen proposals to ship U.S. natural gas to countries that lack a free-trade agreement with the U.S. marketwatchDOTcom/story/dow-chemical-cuts-trade-group-ties-over-gas-policy-2013-01-18</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358556235474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:43:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358562269344-43</Id><Topic><Title>Wide open borders as both parties saturate the world with armaments</Title><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1358493649549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:20:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are old enough to remember the GOP Presidential primary elections in 1980 you clearly recollect the hatred and disdain George Bush projected on Ronald Reagan.
