It is very easy to organize an urban economy so that the automobile is not needed, and is only a luxury. The reason this is happening is simple: The modern economy places a very high value on skills suitable for controlling technology, creating new knowledge and technology, and controlling the financial and corporate system. One’s genetic endowment makes them either much more powerful or much weaker in this economy. Most people don’t have the genetic endowment to succeed either. Nature is not egalitarian. Manual labor is not of use, so “hard (sweating) work” is not and will never be rewarded. In places where human capital agglomerates – big cities – rents and property values are pushed higher and higher, pushing those with inferior genetic endowments into relative poverty. This creates a situation where those with genetic endowments unsuitable for the economy cannot easily reproduce. No or few offspring results in steadily declining demand for oil and other commodity type goods. Meanwhile small towns away from the major centers of high quality human capital age and depopulate. The elderly don’t work and so, irrespective of their genetic endowment, they cannot sustain an economy and oil demand in their area. They live off transfer payments much of which is collected by a relatively few service workers clustering in centralized areas. The small towns will eventually not exist at all and will produce no oil demand. Most of the land will eventually go over to agriculture and forestry. Wolves are a favorite addition to the rural economy because they eat deer who kill seedlings. Seedlings turn into new trees which have economic value. Deer are a nuisance and when the wolves kill them they provide a service. The wolves use no oil. The products of the expanding forests will eventually find their way into bio-fuels.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373120177829</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 10:16:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
