They need to spend our money wisely and stop wasting the hard earned money of taxpayers. Entering in the discussion is the function and size of Government. You need to know how much you need to run the Government before you can set revenue targets. Common sense things like this are seldom talked about. Instead, all the ignorant talk about is taxing those that work hard and have achieved.

Europe crashed, too, as London, Ruhr, Hamburg, and Paris coal prices are rose in tandem devastating the economy. The Great Depression was not caused by an energy price spike but it was ended by the reverse: exceptionally cheap natural gas, oil, and hydro-electric projects (TVA and Hoover Dam). The most likely culprit for the Great Depression, in the first instance, was the gold standard and a very foolish attempt by the Federal Reserve to use cheap money on Wall Street to make price levels converge between the USA and British Empire. In recent history there is the 1974, 1980-1982, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009 depressions all of which were preceded by enormous increases in energy prices. Europe is back in depression now, too. Its non-oil energy prices are closely tied to oil due to contracts with Russia on natural gas. So Europe leads the way into depressions now whenever oil prices rise... 2011-2012 energy prices are even higher than the average for 2007-2008. The result will be the same, or worse.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352736245087</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:04:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352737343918-10</Id><Topic><Title>Cost Over run</Title><Username>dukdre23</Username><Timestamp>1352685221887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 20:53:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The reason they spend tens of billions of dollars on LNG projects, apparently irrespective of cost, is they do not have access to oil reserves sufficient to sustain their production or profit. The reason for that is fairly simple: OPEC and National Oil Companies control most of the remaining oil reserves on the planet, and most importantly the ones that can be produced cheaply. Places like Iraq are effectively worthless to the multinational oil companies as almost all the profit will go to the Iraqi government, and the same holds true for places like Libya. Other places like the Fmr. Soviet Republics use export taxes to extract the majority of the profit, or forced buy outs by state oil companies. Windfall profit taxes are routinely used worldwide, either before the fact or imposed after the fields are developed to expropriate most of the profit from oil production. The result is the oil companies are forced to climb further and further out on the limb developing marginal fields at higher and higher costs...Projects with vast fixed costs selling one commodity based on the price and economics of another -oil -, as in the case of LNG, seem better given the alternatives. Corporations do not really know how not to invest - management is not needed for that and it know it, so it will continue to squander shareholder funds on high risk money losing projects until either the company goes out of business or conditions improve.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352737343918</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352738504686-11</Id><Title>California's landmark global warming law becomes real this week with first cap-and-trade auctions</Title><Msg>California's landmark global warming law becomes real this week with first cap-and-trade auctions Nov 11 - McClatchy-Tribune Regional News - Paul Rogers San Jose Mercury News</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352738504686</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:41:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352739852358-12</Id><Title>Good Div coming up for Susser Petroleum Partners</Title><Msg>Nov. 19th x dividend date almost .44/share</Msg><Username>fubarcentury</Username><Timestamp>1352739852358</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:04:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352739905812-13</Id><Title>CONGRATS VETS</Title><Msg>much thanks for your service perhaps someday all the people will return to military for military purpose--not occupation perhaps someday all the people will realize the need to pay taxes to show support for troops perhaps someday all the people will want the bogus "war powers act" removed and return to the Constitution but until that day we can only pray that elected leaders will only use our troops/treasure as a last resort based on ALL the facts until that day--Godspeed</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352739905812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:05:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352740006349-14</Id><Title>World Energy Outlook 2012 (Released on 12 November 2012)</Title><Msg>World Energy Outlook 2012 (Released on 12 November 2012) Table of Contents Acknowledgements Executive Summaries Arabic | Chinese | English | French | German | Italian | Japanese | Korean | Polish | Portuguese | Russian | Spanish See Related Material: Press Release ieaDOTorg/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2012/november/name,33015,en.html Presentation to Press worldenergyoutlookDOTorg/media/weowebsite/2012/PresentationtoPress.pdf Fact Sheets worldenergyoutlookDOTorg/media/weowebsite/2012/factsheets.pdf The 2012 edition of the World Energy Outlook was released on 12 November and presents authoritative projections of energy trends through to 2035 and insights into what they mean for energy security, environmental sustainability and economic development. Oil, coal, natural gas, renewables and nuclear power are all covered, together with an update on climate change issues. Global energy demand, production, trade, investment and carbon dioxide emissions are broken down by region or country, by fuel and by sector. WEO-2012 presents in-depth analysis of several topical issues, such as: the benefits that could be achieved if known best technologies and practices to improve energy efficiency were systematically adopted; the dependence of energy on water, including the particular vulnerabilities faced by the energy sector in a more water-constrained future; how the surge in unconventional oil and gas production in the United States is set to have implications well beyond North America; and a detailed country focus on Iraq, examining both its importance in satisfying the country’s own needs and its crucial role in meeting global oil and gas demand. Furthermore, it analyses the implications of energy trends on climate change, quantifies the cost of subsidies to fossil fuels and renewables, which are both coming under closer scrutiny in this age of austerity, and presents measures of progress towards providing universal access to modern energy services.

The fate of TransCanada Corp.’s proposed Alberta-to-Texas pipeline is shaping up as a major post-election battle. Environmentalists oppose Keystone and will stage a Nov. 18 demonstration at the White House, while a number business groups and unions want the State Department to permit the project. “We believe the White House will reverse course and approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would ship crude from Canada’s western oil sands to the Gulf Coast,” the ratings agency said in a wide-ranging report Monday on the implications of the elections. However, the Moody's Investors Service report adds: “[A]pproval will not be quick. A prolonged permitting process risks missing the very oil price boom that inspired Keystone XL in the first place. Still, even if Keystone XL went into operation in 2015 or 2016, Gulf Coast refining and marketing companies would benefit from wider light/heavy crude price differentials.” More broadly, the report says the election will bring risks for the oil industry. The industry, in the elections, was much more supportive of Republicans, who are seeking to scuttle or nix some environmental restrictions and open up more areas to drilling than the White House allows. “Energy regulation may tighten in general as well, with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expanding its regulatory reach. Hydraulic fracturing will likely come under more scrutiny, and federal oversight of deepwater production will remain strict following the tightening of the permitting process for deepwater [exploration and production] after the [BP] Macondo accident in 2010,” Moody’s states. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/267329-moodys-obama-will-approve-keystone-xl-pipeline</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352746949997</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:02:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352749447809-20</Id><Title>"USto become energy independent..."</Title><Msg>news today on daily ticker, article by a Ms Korn, says us to become worlds largest oil producer in a few years and will surpas Saudi production for a time.

The fact that management failed in its job of estimating the costs for the project in question and then made up the difference with billions more in shareholders monies. 2. The fact that OPEC controls most of the world's oil reserves and the cheapest ones. 3. The fact that oil companies face massive taxes on their production all around the world, something you can find in their SEC oil reserve disclosures down to the dollar, or by simply googling public source material put out by major accounting firms on the operations in question. 4. The fact that oil production has declined steadily at these same oil companies for well over a decade now, their attempts to obfuscate the issue with deceptive terms such as "oil equivalent" production to describe natural gas, aside. A BTU from natural gas is not the same as a BTU from oil by value. At a barrel of tar sand or heavy crude reserve is not the same as a barrel of conventional oil in any economic sense. 5. The fact the LNG projects routinely sell their output on oil price linked contracts, something that fundamentally divorces the economics of the item they are selling from its price - a unique conception of business planning and risk management to be sure. 6. The fact that Russia, has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to force the sale of oil company properties as an when it wishes, or if it chooses concoct criminal fraud charges and kangeroo courts to collect oil properties in its state owned companies.

They are assuming natural gas output can keep rising without an market for it and using those projections of more BTUs there to make the U.S. energy independent. Further, if one assumes U.S. oil demand keeps declining one implicitly assumes the economy crashes into ruin, something that would crash the oil price as well wiping out the new production. Highway freight, in particular, has seen next to no improvements in fuel economy for years so the efficiency argument does not fly. If one suspend reality and assumes the oil price stays high while the demand keeps falling with an imploding economy it becomes possible to make nonsensical future scenarios of energy independence.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352750878900</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:07:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352752635652-23</Id><Topic><Title>"USto become energy independent..."</Title><Username>manylumen</Username><Timestamp>1352749447809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:44:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dont think Obama will let that happen from fosil fuels, he wants to do it with green energy so dont bet you house on it.</Msg><Username>smkpit</Username><Timestamp>1352752635652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:37:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352766844318-24</Id><Title>EPA Official Hopeful on Gas Drilling Study - progress report on the study — mandated by Congress in 2010 — should be released before the end of the year</Title><Msg>EPA Official Hopeful on Gas Drilling Study By KEVIN BEGOS, Associated Press Monday, November 12, 2012 PITTSBURGH (AP) — A top official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is optimistic that a nationwide project examining natural gas hydraulic fracturing and potential drinking water impacts will provide comprehensive guidelines to help scientists and the public identify the key issues to focus on. But the industry said past studies have already shown the process is safe. Glenn Paulson, the EPA's science advisor, said Friday that a progress report on the study — mandated by Congress in 2010 — should be released before the end of the year, and a final report in 2014. He spoke at a University of Pittsburgh conference on health impacts of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Paulson said the study of fracking and drinking water "is one of the most aggressive public outreach programs in EPA history." He said the progress report will show the "range and depth" of what EPA is looking at, and will be open to public comment. "It will really be a lot for experts to chew on in their particular fields," Paulson said, noting that EPA is reaching out to geologists, academic experts, the industry, environmental groups, and even Indian tribes. "I think the drinking water study is going to be useful to local governments, and state governments, too," Paulson said. He added that "a lot of people have their minds made up" about fracking, even though many aspects of research are still in the early stages. Paulson said the Obama administration is providing enough support to study the issue. The EPA says in the project overview that natural gas "plays a key role in our nation's clean energy future" but that serious concerns have been raised about potential impacts to the environment and human health. The fracking process has made it possible to tap into deep reserves of oil and gas. Large volumes of water, along with sand and hazardous chemicals, are injected underground to break rock apart and free the oil and gas. Contaminated wastewater from the process can leak from faulty well casings into aquifers, but it's often difficult to trace underground sources of pollution. Some studies also have shown air quality problems around gas wells, while others have indicated no problems. Dan Alfaro, a spokesman for Energy in Depth, an industry group, said it believes the EPA study will show that gas drilling and fracking are safe. "There have been numerous studies and a multitude of research on oil and natural gas extraction methods," Alfaro said. The EPA study "will confirm once again previous findings that current industry practices used in development are safe, responsible and effective means of extracting and producing our natural energy resources." Environmental groups and some scientists say there hasn't been enough research on fracking. The industry and many federal and state officials say the practice is safe when done properly, and many rules on air pollution and disclosure of the chemicals used in fracking are being strengthened. In Pennsylvania, the EPA study is focusing on water quality and quantity issues in Washington, Bradford and Susquehanna counties. chemDOTinfo/News/2012/11/Environmental-Controls-EPA-Official-Hopeful-on-Gas-Drilling-Study/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352766844318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 19:34:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352771269279-25</Id><Title>GOP will be moving left to win elections</Title><Msg>Reagan normalized illegal aliens with his 1986 amnesty and put a nail in the coffin of fiscal conservative Republicans by escalating the national debt threefold in eight years followed by George Herbert Walker Bush doubling it in only four years.
