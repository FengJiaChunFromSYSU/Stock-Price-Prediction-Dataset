The event, The Tar Sands Come to Ontario: Stop Line 9, will be held from 10a.m. to 5p.m. at Sidney Smith Hall, 100 St. George St. Featured guests will include Maude Barlow (Council of Canadians), Art Sterritt, (Executive Director, B.C. Coastal First Nations), Wes Elliott (Haudenosaunee land defender), Aaron Detlor (Haudenosaunee Development Institute), and Vanessa Gray (Aamjiwnaang First Nation). Enbridge built Line 9 in 1975 to pipe imported oil west to Sarnia refineries. On October 11, Enbridge applied to the National Energy Board (NEB) for permission to reverse Line 9's flow. Enbridge has been evasive as to its purpose. On October 23, however, it told the NEB that it may use the line for "heavy oil," a category that includes "dilbit" (diluted bitumen) from the tar sands. In the past, Enbridge has talked of its plans to pipe dilbit to the Atlantic Coast for export via the now scrapped "Trailbreaker" project, and this seems the evident purpose of "Line 9 reversal." To make dilbit, tar sands are thinned by a cocktail of chemicals, heated, and put under pressure. The mixture included benzene, arsenic and naphtha, known carcinogens, mutagens and endocrines. Piping dilbit "is like moving hot, liquid sandpaper that grinds and burns its way along," says a 2012 Environmental Defence report ("Enbridge's Tar Sands Pipeline Plan,” p. 2). Aged infrastructure has proven unable to carry dilbit, and in 2010 Enbridge had the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history with the rupture near Kalamazoo of its 6b pipeline carrying tar sands dilbit. Enbridge plans to pipe hazardous dilbit through Line 9 across twelve major watersheds including the Grande and Thames rivers, violating Haudenosaunee land rights and imperilling our shared water supply. Line 9 endangers many First Nations in Ontario and passes close to the province's largest population centres, including Sarnia, London, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto, Kingston, Cornwall, Ottawa, before reaching Montreal. In Toronto, Line 9 angles north-east across Etobicoke and then cuts across the communities of Jane/Finch, Rexdale, and Scarborough and through the Rouge River valley. Enbridge already processes an estimated 225,000 barrels of dilbit per day in Sarnia. In 2010, when the Enbridge 6b pipeline ruptured in Michigan, it spilt more than one million gallons of dilbit into the Kalamazoo River. "The heavy bitumen sank to the river bottom, leaving a mess that is still being cleaned up," reports David Sassoon in the New York Times. “Meanwhile, the chemical additives evaporated, created a foul smell that lingered for days. People reported headaches, dizziness and nausea. No one could say with certainty what they should do." 'Breakdown of safety' According to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the 2010 spill showed "a complete breakdown of safety at Enbridge." Enbridge had left 15,000 known defects on the pipeline uncorrected for up to five years. ("Enbridge Line 9 Fact Sheet") Yet Enbridge, unrepentant, now seems ready to expose Ontario, Quebec and New England to these risks, in order to ship dilbit from the Atlantic Coast to overseas markets in Europe. Meanwhile, the extraction, marketing, and burning of Canada's tar sands oil is devastating Alberta's landscape, degrading the atmosphere, and tilting climate change toward disaster. The tar sands industry is part of what Art Sterritt calls a "war on nature, on the very foundation of life -- on the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soils that provide us with the food we eat." (Globe and Mail, co-signed with David Suzuki). Sterritt will be sharing more of his perspective with participants at the event on the 17th. Speaking alongside Sterritt in Victoria October 22 in an anti-pipeline rally of 4,000, Maude Barlow said, "These pipelines mean that you’ll need to keep them full and that means a massive expansion of the tar sands and that means that we will never be able to get the alternative energy future we need ... Going after these pipelines is the most important fight we can have right now." Indigenous peoples are leading the campaign against the tar sands menace. Sterritt was a key spokesperson for the massive October 22 action in Victoria by "Defend Our Coast." This Indigenous-led coalition has united 132 First Nations, 23 municipalities and residents across B.C. in a campaign that poses a huge obstacle to tar sands pipeline projects in that province. In Alberta, the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Beaver Lake Cree have taken Shell and the Alberta government, respectively, to court. In Ontario, the Haudenosaunee Development Institute, Aamjiwnaang First Nation, and Oneida Nation all submitted concerns to the National Energy Board against Line 9. (See "Stopping Line 9: Communities Mobilize"). The People Versus Line 9 group points out, "Communities in British Columbia and Texas, as well as Indigenous peoples across the continent, all have stopped or slowed down other tar sands pipelines. It's time to play our part…. Let's stop Enbridge's plans for Line 9. Ontario cannot be the weak link in the chain … Take action in your community." On November 17 the Tar Sands Come to Ontario event will encourage such community action trough workshops and a peoples assembly. The Tar Sands Come To Ontario: No Line 9! is jointly organized by the Center for Social Justice, Climate Justice Working Group/Science for Peace, the Council of Canadians Toronto, Common Frontiers, Latin American and Caribbean Solidarity Network, OPIRG-Toronto, Toronto Bolivia Solidarity, and Trinity-St. Paul's United Church Public Witness Circle. The conference forms part of the November 15-18 OPIRG Toronto+York Rebuilding Bridges conference.

Ltd., has signed a deal with TransCanada Corp. to build a 500 kilometres pipeline between the producing area northwest of Fort McMurray and Fort Saskatchewan, near Edmonton. TransCanada will operate the system and Phoenix has entered into a long-term commitment to ship crude oil and diluent, with each party owning a 50 per cent stake in the project. The proposed dual pipeline will have the capacity to move up to 900,000 barrels-a-day (bbl/d) of crude oil and 330,000 bbl/d of diluent The final pipeline route and design will be determined with Aboriginal and stakeholder input, as well as consideration for environmental, archaeological and cultural impacts, land use compatibility, safety, constructability and economics. TransCanada expects to apply for regulatory approval for the project in 2013. “Phoenix is committed to developing its Dover and MacKay River oilsands assets through multiple phases,” said Zhiming Li, Phoenix’s president and chief executive officer. “Given that transportation in the Athabasca region has become a bottleneck, working with TransCanada to build a pipeline system in a timely fashion is crucial to implement our development strategy.” Even though a route for the pipeline has yet to be determined, it is expected to transport oil from the MacKay River and Dover projects, which are largely owned by PetroChina. Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. sold 60 per cent of the MacKay River and Dover oilsands projects to joint-venture partner PetroChina for $1.9 billion in 2009. The company decided to sell its remaining 40 per cent stake in the MacKay River oilsands project to PetroChina for $680 million in January. PetroChina activities in Canada are carried out under a series of names, including Dover Operating Corp., which awarded a contract to SNC-Lavalin in December 2011 to provide detailed engineering and procurement services for the MacKay River Central Plant Project. Construction of the central processing plant, which will be located about 40 km west of Fort McMurray, is underway. It is designed to process 35,000 barrels per day of bitumen steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) production. The MacKay River Commercial Project is expected to produce 150,000 bpd bitumen with an initial phase of 35,000 bpd projected for 2014 start-up. The project is expected to recover 1.7 billion barrels of bitumen over its projected 45-year lifespan. The Dover Commercial Project, which is located about 95 kilometres northwest of Fort McMurray, will also utilize SAGD technology, as well as a phased construction strategy with an ultimate design production capacity of 250,000 bbl/d of bitumen. This project is in the final stages of regulatory approval. Subject to approvals, fieldwork could begin as early as this year. The project will recover an estimated four billion barrels of bitumen over its projected production lifetime of 50 years. PetroChina wanted partial ownership of the Grand Rapids Pipeline project to ensure it will be constructed because the company needs to transport production from these projects. journalofcommerce</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352555462379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 08:51:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352555949048-8</Id><Topic><Title>Light a Candle for Obama</Title><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352514713134</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 21:31:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your point in is well taken: All interest and dividends paid to foreigners (including Americans who renounce their citizenship) should face a withholding tax of 50%.

Divide Gov't Debt by GDP to guide you. Whenever that ratio is falling you should be bullish on stocks. Whenever that ratio is rising you should be running for the exits. You can ride bubbles for a time, like the W bubble and the Reagan one, but they always collapse. And no there is no example of a country's economy failing because it balanced its budget. The Dutch were the leaders in finance for centuries and that commercial ascendancy was possible thanks to the highest taxes in the world to pay the debt - up to 60% of income for the average worker. Borrowing does not come for free. England was built on finance and massive taxation to fund the debt. And finally the USA was very prosperous during the periods when it figured out the novel idea of balancing its budget. Periods such as World War I and post World War I period when it lapsed on these principles brought many difficulties. The golden age came when the wars wrapped up and the people applied themselves to paying their debt... The time has come for that now. We can thank divine providence for providing Obama at this moment - he's the perfect man for the job of taxing. Of course the idea that small government actually works better is total nonsense. Perhaps if you wake up from your propaganda channels you will be able to make some money in the coming year - a great opportunity is coming to invest in America once Obama and the Democrats finally get the books in order.</Msg><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352556980878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 09:16:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352558008230-10</Id><Title>Gold &amp; Silver Speculator Tax</Title><Msg>The tax rate on collectibles such as gold and silver should be raised to 90%.

Just how much damage can they do to you and yours in the process of "balancing the books?" Time will tell... I am more sanguine on the prospects of them bringing it to balance.

The Repubs are in control there for at least two more years and they will not grant tax or revenue increases without spending cuts to which Obama will not agree.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352585393305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 17:09:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352585998874-26</Id><Topic><Title>Give Wahleee and Maxwizard Props</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1352550703810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 07:31:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I do grant you the point that the GOP is an obstacle to tax increases. They would have leverage on that point if it was possible for the government to continue running without the Senate passing and Obama signing a debt limit increase bill. The Senate Democrats will write the bill whatever way Obama says, you can be sure of that, and it will include all the taxes Obama wants in it. If the GOP refuses to pass the bill, the government will close down and default on its debt, military contractors will go unpaid, and the Social Security recipients will not get their checks. The media will blame the GOP for the impasse. They House Republicans are up for election in two years, too, and Obama is not. His bargaining position is very powerful. As for the Bush tax cuts - Obama need only do nothing and they will go away. Really there's nothing to negotiate about there at all, except whether the GOP wants to trade military spending for continuing low income tax breaks... I don't expect Obama to spend much effort on the issue. The GOP should able to stop spending bills, but that is about it. If they fail in that task it will simply mean even higher taxes in the future...</Msg><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352585998874</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 17:19:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352587383758-27</Id><Topic><Title>Allen West--more tea bag flushed</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352340710350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 21:11:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep</Msg><Username>makesnosense99</Username><Timestamp>1352587383758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 17:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352596523147-28</Id><Title>Nigeria Rig Shutdown !!!</Title><Msg>XOM is going to tank on Monday !

The result was one of the biggest orgies of debt, stock speculation, real estate speculation, and finally economic collapse in a century. You protest too much methinks to complain about the methods that will be necessary to balance the Federal Budget. If you don't want it balanced on your back, sell.

Nobody is forcing you to own a stock." The nice thing about EARNING my way and learning along the way is knowing that I can EASILY hold my stock while forgoing income for many years. No income, 3 years of cash, and everything paid for means I qualify for free handouts while the nestegg grows tax free. So enjoy your pipe dream, junior.</Msg><Username>tucstargzr</Username><Timestamp>1352608708967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:38:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352608977467-32</Id><Topic><Title>Nigeria Rig Shutdown !!!</Title><Username>bull_no_bear</Username><Timestamp>1352596523147</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 20:15:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's the capacity of that rig?</Msg><Username>water_skipper</Username><Timestamp>1352608977467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:42:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352609162428-33</Id><Topic><Title>$3 billion Alberta pipeline planned</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352555462379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 08:51:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How will it affect XOM?</Msg><Username>water_skipper</Username><Timestamp>1352609162428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:46:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
