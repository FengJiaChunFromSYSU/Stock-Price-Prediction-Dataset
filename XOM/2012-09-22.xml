Enbridge lawyer Bernard Roth stressed the company respects the rule of law and urged the Joint Review Panel to shut down questioning by Brenda Gaertner, lawyer for the Coastal First Nations, who noted that B.C has a history of conflict over environmental issues, such as protests several years ago at Clayoquot Sound. Gaertner pressed the company on whether it would go ahead with the pipeline if the federal government gave is approval but Coastal First Nations oppose the project. Gaertner repeatedly asked if Enbridge has taken into account the impact of potential conflict over the project on its reputation and shareholder interests, given B.C.’s history of protests. Alberta and British Columbia are also at odds over the project, she noted. After repeated questioning, Roth raised objections that the questions about potential conflicts were “irrelevant” and “inflammatory” and amounted to “haranguing” witness Jack Ruitenbeek, a spill expert who works for Enbridge. “The panel has to assume respect for the rule of law ... and our society resolves these conflicts in a respectful” manner, said Roth. “I suggest you shut down this line of questioning now.” Panel chairman Sheila Leggett allowed one last question on the topic, stressing that the panel “takes seriously respect for the rule of law.” While the panel at times deals with “emotionally charged” issues, Leggett warned those present “to keep in mind this is lawful process.” “I was not suggesting any lack of respect for the rule of law,” Gaertner responded. She then asked Enbridge if the disagreement between Alberta (which supports the project) and B.C. government (which is opposed) “might make a difference to getting investors?” John Carruthers, president of Northern Gateway, the company that will build the pipeline, rejected that notion, saying if “people become more informed their positions will come closer together.” “We can’t just quit because it’s hard,” said Carruthers, noting that people in B.C. also use gasoline. He agreed that some investors have asked questions about support in B.C. for the project. Gaertner asked Enbridge if it would “respect the views of First Nations” if they turn down the project, but the National Energy Board and federal government give it the green light. Carruthers said the company would respect the views First Nations and continue working with them. “I do not see the Joint Review Panel decision as the end of the process.” When pressed, he said: “We will respect their views and this panel’s decision and the board and the Government of Canada,” and the company will continue to seek support among the 46 First Nations, including from those that oppose the project. Gaertner asked Enbridge to release the names of First Nations bands that support the project and have signed on for a possible equity position in the pipeline. Enbridge has said 60 per cent of First Nations along the 1,200-kilometre route support the project and will take equity interests. But the names cannot be released due to commercial confidentiality, said Paul Fisher. Gaertner stressed the names were needed to test the accuracy of the company’s assertion it has 60 per cent support. But Leggett ruled the question out of order, saying the panel does not need the information for its consideration. Earlier in the day, Enbridge clarified its figures showing the probability of spills from one of three sources — a pipeline rupture, a tanker spill off the coast or a spill at the marine facility. Initially, Enbridge officials agreed with Gaertner’s calculations that the company’s figures suggest a 93-per-cent chance of some kind of spill over the 50-year life of the project. But Enbridge later provided new figures that suggest a 70-per-cent chance of a spill from any source over that period. edmontonjournal</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348291503736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 01:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348310454139-3</Id><Topic><Title>All I hear on MSNBC &amp; CNN</Title><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1348278475984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:47:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well your pretty f--kin stupid you #$%$</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1348310454139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 06:40:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348314768044-4</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Booed At Senior Event</Title><Username>westsbest0304</Username><Timestamp>1348274216221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Newly released emails reveal the 'nonpartisan' group's stealthy White House alliance on health care. When Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan address the AARP on Friday, good manners will no doubt keep them from asking this question: How can that lobby claim to speak for American seniors given its partisan role in passing ObamaCare? Thanks to just-released emails from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, we now know that AARP worked through 2009-10 as an extension of a Democratic White House, toiling daily to pass a health bill that slashes $716 billion from Medicare, strips seniors of choice, and sets the stage for rationing. We know that despite AARP's awareness that its seniors overwhelmingly opposed the bill, the "nonpartisan membership organization" chose to serve the president's agenda. The 71 pages of emails show an AARP management taking orders from the White House, scripting the president's talking points, working to keep its board "in line," and pledging fealty to "the cause." Seniors deserve to know all this, as AARP seeks to present itself as neutral in this presidential election. The emails overall show an AARP leadership—Policy Chief John Rother, Health Policy Director Nora Super, Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond, Senior Vice President David Sloane—that from the start worked to pass ObamaCare, before crucial details pertaining to seniors had been addressed. This crew was in constant contact with Mr. Obama's top aides, in particular Nancy-Ann DeParle and Jim Messina. As early as July 2009, Mr. Sloane was sending the administration—"as promised"—his "message points" on Medicare. Ms. DeParle assured him "I think you will hear some of your lines tomorrow" in President Obama's speech—which he did. Mr. Rother advised the White House on its outreach, discouraging Mr. Obama from addressing seniors since "he may not be the most effective messinger [sic] . . . at least to the McCain constituency." Better to manage these folks, he counsels, through the "authoritative voices of doctors and nurses." AARP had long lambasted cuts in fees to Medicare doctors because reduced payments would mean fewer doctors who accept patients with the insurance. Yet in its campaign for ObamaCare, it argued the money the health law strips from Medicare—by imposing price controls on hospitals—would improve "care." When the organization tried to sell the line to its own people, it didn't go well. Ms. Super told Obama officials in June 2009: "It was actually a heavy lift for us to convince many at AARP that Medicare 'savings' (which they read as cuts) is not bad for beneficiaries." Note the "savings" quote marks. Even in November 2009, as the ObamaCare debate progressed, Ms. LeaMond worried that the Medicare spin wasn't working against public criticism of the bill. She emailed Mr. Messina and Ms. DeParle that she was "seized" with "concerns about extended coherent, strong messaging by Republicans on the Medicare savings." To pull off the legislation, she mused, "we"—the White House and AARP—will need a "concerted strategy." Lobbying for Seniors, or for Obama? In August 2009, AARP had already unveiled a national advertising blitz for ObamaCare, to ensure that "every member of Congress knows the 50-plus community wants action to fix what's wrong with healthcare." The group made this claim despite weeks of daily tracking showing its members in revolt against the president's plan. July 23, 2009: AARP reported to the White House that 1,031 members called in against the proposed health-care changes; 77 called in support. July 28, 2009: 4,174 opposed; 36 in support. July 29, 2009: 2,656 opposed; 23 in support. Mr. Sloane told the White House that AARP lost 1,897 members in a single day "in disagreement over our position on health reform." All the reports to Team Obama were accompanied by AARP's request to keep the information "close," apparently so word didn't leak that seniors hate ObamaCare. And the ad blitz went on. Was AARP sending these tracking reports to its outside board of directors—its governing body? Maybe not: AARP staff seemed to view the board as a problem. In June 2009, Ms. Super emailed Obama budget guy Keith Fontenot: The AARP board is meeting, she said, and we "need to get their buy-in on several proposals," including the president's Medicare cuts, which "as you might imagine, they are a bit concerned about." Could he share ideas with her? "It would really help get them on Board." When Mr. Rother was asked in December 2009 by the White House to attend an event with Mr. Obama, he declined. "I am presenting to my Board on health reform" on the same day, he wrote. "I think you want me to keep my Board in line, so please understand my need to regret."</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348314768044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 07:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348314813945-5</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Booed At Senior Event</Title><Username>westsbest0304</Username><Timestamp>1348274216221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AARP was, however, on 24-hour alert to do the White House's political bidding. Typical is a March 2010 email exchange about Rep. Larry Kissell, a North Carolina Democrat who remained a "no" vote as ObamaCare neared its endgame. Labor boss Andy Stern emailed Mr. Messina—"Kissel [sic] a Problem"—and advised bringing in the AARP guns. Mr. Messina forwarded the note to Ms. LeaMond, with the word "Help." "On it," she quickly responded. Soon after: Does Mr. Messina want AARP to have its board chairman arrange a meeting, or just call the congressman "right away?" "Both?" Mr. Messina asked. "Will do," she assured him. Rep. Kissell voted no. In an interview, AARP spokesman Jim Dau and Legislative Policy Director David Certner noted that the lobby was committed to health-care reform long before Mr. Obama's election, that it pushed for policy additions to the bill that were crucial for seniors, and that it did not endorse legislation until AARP's priorities were met. They said that the board was kept informed and that AARP faced similar criticism when it worked with the GOP on a drug benefit in 2003. "We get criticized, but we never take our eye off the ball when it comes to pursuing things that are good for our members," says Mr. Dau. "We make no apologies for our advocacy." AARP's ardent efforts on behalf of ObamaCare bear a resemblance to the work of the drug and health industry in 2009—with one significant difference. Those industries' backroom dealing was motivated by financial self-interest. What motivated AARP, given that its membership of 37 million people 50 years old and older was clearly opposed to ObamaCare, since they recognized that it would hurt them? The answer appears to be: pure ideology. In October 2009, Ms. Super expressed frustration that the Senate might strip more spending from the bill. She declared to colleagues: "I'm heading up to the House now where at least Democrats are Democrats (sort of)." Ms. Super is now working for Mr. Obama's Health and Human Services Department. In November 2009, Mr. Rother declined a White House request to have an AARP person take part in a roundtable. "I think we will try to keep a little space between us and the White House," he explained, adding that AARP's "polling" shows the organization is more "influential when we are seen as independent." He wanted "to reinforce that positioning," said the man working daily to pass ObamaCare, since "the larger issue is how to best serve the cause." Mr. Rother has left AARP and now leads the liberal National Coalition on Health Care. When the health-care reform bill passed the House in March 2010, Ms. LeaMond exuberantly emailed Mr. Messina: "This is the new AARP-WH/Hill—LeaMond/Messina relationship. . . . Seriously, a great victory for you and the President." But not one for America's seniors, who had looked to AARP to oppose ObamaCare's cuts and rationing. That's worth remembering come the next AARP bulletin to seniors offering its "balanced" view on issues.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348314813945</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 07:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348320031168-6</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Booed At Senior Event</Title><Username>westsbest0304</Username><Timestamp>1348274216221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah sure Wahleeee.

But our fuel supply has been getting greener with California gasoline blended today with 10 percent ethanol, up from 5.7 percent, and as of last month, Fresno diesel shipments are being blended with 5 percent biodiesel. That’s what one of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline owners and the largest refinery and pipeline operators in California — Kinder Morgan — began doing in August at their key Fresno terminal that connects Bay Area refineries to the mid-state’s downstream users. Kinder Morgan spokesperson Emily Mir said the company began blending ”in response to strong interest from ... customers,” with the company investing “several million dollars to allow both its Fresno and Colton terminals to blend up to 20 million gallons per year of B100 [biodiesel]. In both terminals, Kinder Morgan has invested in offloading capabilities, Mir said, and is now blending the B100 at a 5-percent ratio into the incoming diesel pipeline that goes to their customers. In a Kinder Morgan financial report, the company said it is spending $16.2 million to build biodiesel blending facilities in four Western U.S. cities that include Fresno. Kinder Morgan is not alone. Major players like Chevron and Exxon are helping to push the new fuel standard to 5 percent biodiesel in response to both federal and state mandates. Kinder Morgan is doing the same in other states. These new rules help the diesel fuel supply to "green up" on both its carbon content to reduce global warming and on the toxicity of its pollutants with vegetable or animal fat-based biodiesel estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency to be 78 percent cleaner than petroleum-based diesel when it burns. In a move coordinated with Kinder Morgan, Fresno entrepreneur Jeremy Eslinger has filed for a conditional use permit from the city for a 45-million-gallon biodiesel manufacturing facility next to the same Fresno Kinder Morgan terminal on Malaga and Maple avenues west of Highway 99. Eslinger said his start-up company will lease 15 acres for the project from Kinder Morgan to supply biodiesel for blending into California diesel. "We have a memorandum of understanding,“ said Eslinger, suggesting they hope to get the green light on their CUP application around Oct. 1. The first phase of the project that is expected to be operational next summer is pegged at about a $20 million investment, Eslinger said. Construction could start in January. Plans for the production plant have been in the works for several years, originally slated for a site in Firebaugh. But locating the production plant next to Kinder Morgan is literally a pipeline to the market, and Eslinger’s business plan calls for Kinder Morgan to utilize 15,000 gallons a day within six months on the way to gearing up to 135,000 gallons a day. There is no hazardous waste or water use associated with the 18,500 square-foot plant, he said. The facility would employ 48. Eslinger said the biodiesel would be made from various biomass feedstocks including algal oils, seed oils, animal fats and waste vegetable oils. Eslinger and family are in the custom-harvest business in Dos Palos, and expect to supply the plant with some Valley grown feedstock — another economic benefit of the project. Initial production is set at 5 million gallons a year in what will be a three-phase project offering a “continuous supply” of biodiesel for Kinder Morgan to pass on to their customers, which include Chevron, Shell, Valero, Conoco Phillips and Tesoro, according to Eslinger’s application. As with ethanol blends, the industry wants a standard blend that will go to most customers. Eslinger believes teaming up with Kinder Morgan will help cut transportation costs to customers. Cutting costs will help keep the price of biodiesel — a few cents higher than diesel — from getting out of hand, he said. thebusinessjournal</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348321916122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 09:51:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348326261129-11</Id><Topic><Title>Another Day Another Obama Lie</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1348320421777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 09:27:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What else is new.
