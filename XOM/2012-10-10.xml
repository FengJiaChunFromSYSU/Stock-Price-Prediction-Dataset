The Paseo plant, which opened in 2008, produces 40 million gallons of biodiesel and 30 million pounds of food-grade glycerin annually, using soybean oil as its primary feedstock. The expansion is expected to be complete by March 2013, Cargill said in a statement Tuesday. The biodiesel facility is connected to a Cargill soybean processing plant. Paseo was launched in 2006 with an equity drive in which more than 650 agricultural producers in Missouri purchased shares in Paseo Biofuels LLC. climatespectator</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349846437281</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 01:20:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858218367-2</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Religious Psychopath Should Be Given Shock Therapy</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1349805642783</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:00:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wahleee is so f--ked up the only way to explain his behavior is that his soul is possessed by the devil.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349858218367</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 04:36:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858293760-3</Id><Topic><Title>Where's your money, Romney believers ?</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1349398373610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxipad is broke, the commie POS dos'nt have 2 nickels to rub together.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349858293760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 04:38:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858369873-4</Id><Topic><Title>Want to see gas fall by $2 a gallon???</Title><Username>bimmy.beoris</Username><Timestamp>1349802682631</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:11:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stupid wahlee needs another lobotomy.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349858369873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 04:39:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858526433-5</Id><Topic><Title>How Much You Wanna Bet This Guy's A Republican?</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1349805339087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:55:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>commie POS wahlee.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349858526433</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 04:42:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349868372519-6</Id><Title>76% OF XOM UNION EEPLOYEES SAY THEY WILL VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY</Title><Msg>2222222222222222222</Msg><Username>mickeymouse854</Username><Timestamp>1349868372519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 07:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349869074624-7</Id><Topic><Title>76% OF XOM UNION EEPLOYEES SAY THEY WILL VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY</Title><Username>mickeymouse854</Username><Timestamp>1349868372519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 07:26:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does that include their foreign workers which make up most of their work force?</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1349869074624</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 07:37:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349870557193-8</Id><Topic><Title>76% OF XOM UNION EEPLOYEES SAY THEY WILL VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY</Title><Username>mickeymouse854</Username><Timestamp>1349868372519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 07:26:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ commie wahleeeee.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349870557193</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 08:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349874000451-9</Id><Title>hearing company ioc may be doing deal with xom</Title><Msg>anyone else?

Projected household expenditures are 5 percent higher for electricity and 13 percent higher for propane this winter. Average expenditures for households that heat with heating oil are forecast to be higher than any previous winter on record (see EIA Short-Term Energy and Winter Fuels Outlook slideshow). •The forecast for higher household expenditures primarily reflects a return to roughly normal winter temperatures east of the Rocky Mountains compared with last winter's unusual warmth. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) most recent projection of heating degree days, the Northeast, Midwest, and South will be about 2 percent warmer than the 30-year average (1971 - 2000), but still 20 percent to 27 percent colder than last winter, while the West is projected to be only about 1 percent colder than last winter. •Projected residential heating oil prices average 2 percent higher and natural gas prices 1 percent higher this winter. Winter average electricity and propane prices average about 2 percent and 4 percent lower than last winter, respectively. •EIA expects U.S. total crude oil production to average 6.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.7 million bbl/d from last year. Projected U.S. domestic crude oil production increases to 6.9 million bbl/d in 2013, the highest level of production since 1993. •Forecast U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) grows by 2.2 percent this year and by 1.7 percent next year. Projected world oil-consumption-weighted real GDP grows by 2.7 percent and 2.5 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively, similar to last month's Outlook. EIA expects Brent crude oil prices to fall from recent highs over the rest of 2012, averaging $111 per barrel over the fourth quarter of 2012 and $103 per barrel in 2013. EIA expects WTI spot prices to average $93 per barrel in 2013, with the WTI discount to Brent narrowing to $9 per barrel by the end of 2013. •Natural gas working inventories ended September 2012 at an estimated 3.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), about 8 percent above the same time last year. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011, to average $2.71 per MMBtu in 2012 and $3.35 per MMBtu in 2013. eia Full Report eia URLs available at talkstock</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349885563212</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349885899942-16</Id><Title>From gas to oil: Michigan governor joins protest to block pipeline switch</Title><Msg>From gas to oil: Michigan governor joins protest to block pipeline switch Posted on 10/09/2012 by Jeff Kart The route of the Trunkline Pipeline. (Map via Energy Transfer Partners) Michigan’s governor is speaking out against a plan by operators of a major natural gas pipeline to use it to move bottlenecked crude oil to the Gulf. Gov. Rick Snyder and others have filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to “intervene and protest” the move by Trunkline Gas Co., arguing that abandoning a natural gas pipeline that supplies nearly a third of Michigan’s natural gas would not serve citizens’ energy needs as furnaces are firing up for the winter. The plan by Energy Transfer Partners would reverse its 770-mile Trunkline system to carry crude oil south, an effort to beat companies like Enbridge and TransCanada to move landlocked Canadian and Bakken oil to the Gulf of Mexico, according to Petroleum News. “They are projecting that the switch to a Gulf-bound crude pipeline could expand Trunkline’s capacity to 400,000 barrels per day from 150,000 bpd.” Financial website the Motley Fool calls the plan “The Newest Top-Secret Pipeline Project,” noting that Energy Transfer Partners is “racing against time and the competing projects of its peers. While there is a glut of oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, right now, analysts expect that if all planned pipeline projects are built on schedule, there may not be a need for the Trunkline reversal.” Heating up Snyder says the pipeline in question is a key piece of the natural gas infrastructure in Michigan. His formal protest notes several negative impacts from the proposed switch, including a “potential emergency” if other remaining natural gas infrastructure were to be damaged after the existing pipeline is switched over. “In short, this infrastructure is vital to the energy supply and reliability in Michigan, with major ramifications for the ability to heat Michigan’s homes at an affordable price,” Snyder writes. “I also have concerns regarding the implications this would have on the state’s economic development and energy policy as a whole.” Also, one less pipeline is bound to drive up natural gas prices, the governor says, and that’s especially bad for “the most vulnerable” residents who are already having trouble paying their bills. “Michigan has had high demand for energy assistance during the winter – in fact, the number of individuals seeking heating assistance in the territory most affected by this pipeline saw more requests for assistance in October and November of 2011 than they had in the previous year, despite a warmer winter,” the motion reads. Michigan a key natural gas hub Neighboring states also should take notice, Synder says, because Michigan has about 12 percent of the nation’s overall underground storage capacity for natural gas. “Michigan supplies natural gas to neighboring states during the high-demand winter months. Therefore, anything that reduces the ability to move natural gas in and out of Michigan could easily impact the ability of the country to economically utilize its best and most important storage resource.” There are environmental concerns as well, about having to build another pipeline in the future if this one is abandoned. Trunkline filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy in July. Most recently, Consumers Energy Co. has joined Michigan’s governor, the Michigan Public Service Commission and others to oppose Trunkline’s application. Trunkline, for its part, says “the sky is not falling,” and the pipeline switch should be approved for numerous reasons, including that “Sufficient capacity will remain post-abandonment for Trunkline to meet all of its firm contracted-for capacity, thus ensuring continuity of service” and the company’s core market area north of Tuscola, Illinois to the Michigan border “will continue to be served by looped facilities.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could decide on the application this month. midwestenergynews</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349885899942</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:18:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349887075054-17</Id><Title>Sacrificing energy independence is not the solution</Title><Msg>Sacrificing energy independence is not the solution By James C. Greenwood, president and CEO, Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) - 10/10/12 09:30 AM ET This past summer, as parts of the Midwest faced historic droughts and farmers and ranchers struggled with the impact of failing crops, a group of governors petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend the federal Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) as a way to provide relief. As temperatures cool and the drought stabilizes, it’s clear that government programs to provide emergency assistance for farmers and ranchers worked as intended. Yet, the call to suspend the RFS remains. Indeed, certain special interests are not allowing this crisis to go to waste. In a move cynical even for Washington, they are scapegoating the renewable fuels industry, attempting to use the drought and its impact as a way to undo the progress that has been made by the biofuels industry under the RFS.. The RFS opens the U.S. fuel market to alternatives to foreign petroleum by setting specific annual requirements for petroleum refiners to make first and second generation biofuels available to American consumers at the pump. It sets real-world targets for a transition to more secure domestic sources of motor fuel and it offers refiners a number of options for meeting this requirement. Data from the Energy Information Administration and EPA clearly show that U.S. biofuel production saves consumers money at the pump, reduces our dependence on foreign oil and contributes to a cleaner environment. Indeed, we are at a critical turning point for domestic energy production in this country, and we need all forms of US transportation fuel. Waiving the RFS, even for just one year, will destabilize advanced biofuels development for years to come. It could sideline new biorefinery construction in this growing field, not only hindering future innovation in transportation fuel that will help consumers save at the pump, but also holding back job creation. [b]Biorefinery projects have opened in Nebraska, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota; construction is underway in Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi and New Mexico; and new projects are looking to break ground in Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin.[/b] Each of these projects represents hundreds millions of dollars in investment and economic growth, and each has already generated employment opportunities for researchers, construction and process engineers, and many others. These biorefineries create permanent employment in operations, transportation and agriculture for local communities in these states. The EPA should not be short-sighted when it comes to the RFS. Rushing into long-term policy changes to the RFS could have an unintended economic impact on family farmers, biofuel producers and consumers. Additionally, waiving the RFS requirement could reduce the momentum that has been building toward producing other second-generation fuels made from cellulosic biomass, such as wheat straw, fast-growing trees from tree farms, switch grass, municipal solid waste and algae. Now is the time to act rationally, not rashly. The first gallons of cellulosic biofuel have been produced in the United States this year and will help build energy security for the future, preserving our freedom to travel. Giving in to political interests and suspending the requirement will set our nation back years in the quest to end our reliance on foreign oil – and it could cause job losses at a time when the economy is in peril. The RFS is working to drive investment in advanced biofuels. Changing course will hurt our nation now and in the future.

The Consumer Energy Alliance, a coalition of oil companies and groups representing energy-consuming industries such as chemical manufacturing and trucking, will release the report later this week. The report says opening more U.S. and Canadian onshore and offshore lands to drilling could bring in $803 billion in revenue for the federal government and create 1.4 million jobs by 2030. That, along with demand-reducing technologies such as wind power and biofuels, as well as policies such as vehicle fuel economy standards, would bring North America closer to energy self-sufficiency, it said. “In order to significantly and effectively lower U.S. imports of overseas crude, the United States must focus on both decreasing the demand for transportation fuels and increasing North American supply of fuel,” the report said. One of the biggest hurdles to achieving energy self-sufficiency is the ability to tap “undiscovered, technically recoverable oil resources,” the report said. The report cited a 2011 Congressional Research Service report that said 134.5 billion barrels of oil and 1,176.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could be locked away in currently unreachable deposits. “While the production of these resources is technically feasible, economic conditions and other factors may limit how quickly these resources come online,” the report said. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has hit the Obama administration for keeping some of those potential reserves off-limits. The main plank on the Republican’s energy platform is to expand fossil fuel drilling in such areas. The Obama administration has said its five-year offshore leasing plan leaves 75 percent of identified hydrocarbon resources open for development. The administration also says oil-and-gas production has risen during Obama’s White House stay. Republicans and industry groups say that 85 percent of offshore land mass is off-limits under Obama's leasing plan, and note that fossil fuel production on federally controlled areas has dropped under Obama, with the production increase carried by drillers on private and state lands. The GOP and industry point to the recent shale gas boom as reason for expanding drilling, as those reserves were once considered too difficult to recover or not known to exist. But the GOP has also proven resistant to offering tax incentives for energy efficiency upgrades and also to wind power, which the report said are necessary to achieve energy self-sufficiency. The report praised the impact recently finalized fuel economy standards of 54.5 miles per gallon for light-duty vehicles beginning in 2025 would have on reducing oil consumption.

The analysis, conducted by Cardno-ENTRIX and commissioned by the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), finds that if a waiver of the RFS resulted in reduced biofuel output, the minor reductions in corn prices would be partially or fully offset by increased prices for other feed ingredients like distillers grains (DDGS) and soybean meal, according to a release from RFA. “When viewed in the context of changes in the prices for other key feed ingredients such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and soybean meal, the change in total net feed costs for livestock, dairy and poultry feeders would either increase slightly or decrease by a negligible amount if a waiver was granted,” according to the study, conducted by economist John Urbanchuk. “This is due to the fact that if a waiver reduced biofuel output, it would also reduce the available supply of DDGS and soybean meal, which would naturally lead to higher prices for those key feed ingredients.” The analysis shows that if ethanol and biodiesel production were each reduced 500 million gallons in 2013 under a waiver of the RFS, total feed costs would increase 4.1 percent for dairy, 0.8 percent for layers, 0.5 percent for hogs, and 0.2 percent for broilers. For beef cattle, feed costs might fall by just 0.6 percent with a waiver. These results are corroborated directionally by a recent study by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri. FAPRI found a 1.3 percent reduction in ethanol output under a waiver could lead to slightly higher distillers grains and soybean meal prices. According to FAPRI, “Lower corn price means lower feed costs for livestock producers, unless offset by slightly higher soybean meal and distillers grains prices.” Cardno-ENTRIX RFS analysis Thursday, October 11, is the deadline for providing comments to the Environmental Protection Agency on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) waiver request and stakeholders are urged to make their voices heard before the end of the day tomorrow. domesticfuel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349888322145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:58:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349888405962-24</Id><Topic><Title>Study Indicates RFS Waiver Could Increase Feed Prices</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349888322145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:58:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>High Heat and Drought this Summer Decimated Corn Crops, Straining Utah’s Farmers and Ranchers by Matthew Harakal Published - 10/10/12 - 09:49 AM | 0 | 1 | | U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) (Salt Lake City, UT) – U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) wrote to Lisa Jackson, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to urge her to waive the corn-ethanol requirements as part of the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS). The RFS program was created under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005, and mandated the quantity of renewable fuel that must be used in the United States. “The corn-ethanol requirements are placing considerable strain on Utah’s farmers and ranchers during an already difficult season,” Hatch said. “Waiving the mandate after one of the worst growing seasons in decades just makes sense. I implore Administrator Jackson to give Utah’s ranchers and farmers some relief as they attempt to recover from this summer’s terrible conditions.” The RFS originally mandated 7.5 billion gallons of biofuels (primarily derived from corn) to be produced in the year 2012, but the mandate was later increased to 13.2 billion gallons. In the letter, Hatch cites United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data which shows that 23 percent of U.S. corn crop yields are in good or excellent condition, and 50 percent are rated as poor to very poor. This 23 percent is in contrast to a 70 percent good or excellent rating by the USDA earlier this year. Hatch also notes that the USDA expects the problem to continue to worsen, and predicts corn yields will be 146 bushels per acre with food prices increasing 3 to 4 percent by next year. kcsg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349888405962</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:00:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349891965531-25</Id><Topic><Title>Oil up again, Oil stocks up, Exxon did not warn!!!

A pro-life, family-values congressman who worked as a doctor before winning election as a Tea Party-backed Republican had an affair with a patient and later pressured her to get an abortion, according to a phone call transcript obtained by The Huffington Post. The congressman, Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, was trying to save his marriage at the time, according to his remarks on the call, made in September of 2000. And, according to three independent sources familiar with the call and the recording, he made the tape himself. DesJarlais, who was provided a copy of the transcript by HuffPost, did not deny its contents, but in a statement released through his campaign characterized it as just another sordid detail dredged up by the opposition. "Desperate personal attacks do not solve our nation's problems, yet it appears my opponents are choosing to once again engage in the same gutter politics that CBS news called the dirtiest in the nation just 2 years ago." That race featured charges culled from DesJarlais' divorce from Susan DesJarlais, which was finalized in 2001.

Romney told an Iowa campaign audience on Tuesday about a chance encounter with a Navy SEAL during a Christmas party in San Diego, although he did not invoke Doherty by name. Romney owns a home in California and Doherty was stationed there, serving in the military. Romney cited the SEAL's dedication to the Middle East and his commitment to foreign service as a way to draw a contrast with President Barack Obama's response in the region, which Romney has criticized as lacking in leadership. As Yahoo News's Holly Bailey reported: Citing a CNN report that Doherty had been killed while trying to help others at the consulate, Romney expressed his admiration—and likened it to the leadership he says the country needs now in Washington. "When he and his colleagues there heard that the consulate was under attack ... they went there. They didn't hunker down where they were in safety. They rushed there to go help," Romney said. "This is the American way: We go where there's trouble. We go where we're needed. And right now we're needed. Right now the American people need us." After Romney's remarks, Barbara Doherty told Boston's WHDH 7News that the GOP nominee shouldn't invoke her son that way again. "I don't trust Romney," she said. "He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama."</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1349897653356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:34:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349897929306-37</Id><Title>Sorry, We Have Two Crazy Republicans Of The Day!</Title><Msg>The Arkansas Republican who has called for deporting all Muslims and for instituting the death penalty for rebellious children is also calling for the state to sterilize parents who are neglectful.

The current round of the Federal Joint Review Panel hearings,which continue today in Prince George, are focusing on the emergency planning along the proposed 1,200-kilometre route across central B.C. Former B.C. attorney general Geoff Plant says he wants to know if Enbridge really can mount an effective spill response in remote wilderness locations. Plant says the province is concerned that even a small leak of heavy, sticky bitumen will foul pristine creeks and flow into larger rivers — causing a lot of harm very quickly. Meanwhile, a former B.C. energy minister who supports the pipeline project is criticizing Enbridge's handling of the proposal, saying Enbridge has failed to sell a good project to the public. Bad PR for good project, says senator Conservative Senator Richard Neufeld was the energy minister for the B.C. Liberal government through much of the last decade. Now he is particularly critical of Enbridge's announcement that it plans to spend an additional half a billion dollars improving the safety of the pipeline. Enbridge announced the upgrade shortly after a U.S. report criticized its handling of a serious spill on the Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010 that cost $800 million to clean up. "Why wasn't that $500 million there to start with? They obviously must have known that, because they announced it pretty quick. So that really sent a huge red flag up to me. What is going on? Where did they start with their safety? I don't know," said Neufeld. The final hearings in Prince George this month will focus on environmental and socio-economic effects, impacts on landowners and land use, routing, design and construction, and operation safety. The hearings then move to Prince Rupert in November where they will focus on aboriginal rights and interests, environmental and socio-economic effects from the marine terminal and shipping, marine safety and accident response, and public and community consultation. Final arguments will be presented to the panel next spring, which must make a recommendation by the end of 2013. Ottawa is expected to make a decision within six months of the panel's review. cbc</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349900002997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349901367991-41</Id><Title>XOM says invest in teachers!?

HIRE ONLY, Teachers who have real life experience. Sorry, but eduMAcation has inbred itself now for over a century. The person who typcially could do little else, became a teacher. That person learned HOW to be a teacher and then occupied a classroom. Regardless of management, leadership, or social skills, this person was left to teach our kids. No life experience, no way to RELATE the subject to students thus highlighting importance/relevance. Nothing like having a BUSINESS TEACHER who has no experience in business. A chemistry teacher who has nothing more than a degree in chemistry/teaching. Why education has insisted on maintaining basically the same teacher selection process since the 1800's when log cabin schools were being built nationwide is beyond comprehension. It is outrageous that education has not policed itself and now hides behind teacher unions. The finished product is flawed except for self motivated students which of course, validates my accusation that teachers do little to motivate students by making their subject matter relevant thus really REACHING the students they have been TASKED to TEACH. Our educational system is a farce. Most of our teachers graduate with NOTHING MORE than a teaching degree and an acceptable level of education in the subject they want to teach. NO LIFE/WORK experience in said subject matter and therefore, little chance of REACHING students who fail to see the relevance. So while the teacher issues grades each quarter, our system continues its tail spin into the ground because no one seems to think we should be grading our teachers.

Carlos Slim, World’s Richest Man, Gets Richer Supplying ‘Obamaphones’ to Poor A Mexican telecom mogul who holds the title of world's richest man, and one of President Obama's top donors are both getting even richer from the U.S. government program that supplies so-called "Obamaphones" to the poor. Carlos Slim, who has an estimated net worth of $70 billion, owns a controlling stake in TracFone, which makes $10 per phone for each device it provides to poor Americans. The company, whose president and CEO is Frederick “F.J.” Pollak, also makes money from extra minutes and data plans it sells to subscribers who get phones and service through the government's Lifeline program. The program, which began in the mid-1980s, has exploded in the past four years after being expanded from supplying landlines to the poor to providing cellular phones. The phones came into the national spotlight after a viral video surfaced on YouTube in which a Cleveland, Ohio, woman praised the president, saying he needed to be re-elected because he gives out free phones. “Everybody in Cleveland, every minority, got an Obama phone. Keep Obama as president. He gave us a phone. He gonna do more,” the woman said in the video. Slim’s Movil America owns TracFone and recently snapped up service provider Simple Mobile for $100 million. TracFones and Simple Mobile service are huge players in the Lifeline program through the company's “SafeLink Wireless” brand. TracFone had 3.8 million subscribers through the federal program as of late 2011. Pollak has donated at least $156,500 to Democratic candidates and committees this cycle, including at least $50,000 to the Obama campaign. His wife, Abigail, is a campaign bundler for Obama and has raised more than $632,000 for the president this cycle, and more than $1.5 million since 2007. She has personally contributed more than $200,000 to Democratic candidates and committees since 2008. The Pollaks hosted Obama at their Miami Beach home in June for a $40,000-per-plate fundraising dinner, and hosted a similar event with Michelle Obama in July 2008. The couple personally donated a combined $66,200 to Obama’s re-election effort that year. U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin, (R-Ark.), who has been one of the biggest critics of the Lifeline program's explosive growth, said he can't blame Slim for doing lucrative business with the federal government. “I’m not against a company making a profit," Griffin said. "If they are making money off the program, the blame goes to the federal government for creating the program." Griffin recently introduced a bill on Capitol Hill to end the Lifeline program, which cost $1.6 billion in 2011, up from $772 million in 2008. While not technically a tax, the program is funded by mandatory fees tacked on to consumers' phone bills, then disbursed through the Federal Communications Commission and states. “This program is rife with waste and abuse," Griffin said. "It’s set up in a way where people can receive multiple phones for free.” Griffin said he has seen cases in which single individuals obtained dozens of the phones, and said under the lax requirements, more than 80 million Americans are eligible.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1349903956652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:19:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349905796719-46</Id><Title>Chart Pattern Analysis on (XOM) 10-10-2012</Title><Msg>A stock alert and chart pattern analysis has been issued on (XOM) Watch the video on YouTube: youtu.be/ufuIImwhzUA</Msg><Username>stockchump1</Username><Timestamp>1349905796719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:49:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349905865135-47</Id><Topic><Title>Draft Dodger Romney Angers Dead Vet's Mother After Politicizing Her Sons Death</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1349897653356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:34:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And yet you choose to continue lying in all you write.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1349905865135</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349906513905-48</Id><Topic><Title>Now CEO's Threatening Employees...

Demoncraps should be rounded up, shipped offshore, and sunk forever in the ocean: Fishfood seems like the environmental friendly alternative. "If you want to know how Obamacare will affect future U.S. employment, look no further than this week's Orlando Sentinel report on Darden Restaurants -- the company that owns popular chains like the Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Currently, all 185,000 Darden employees are offered health insurance, but that's about to change, thanks to Obamacare. Obamacare fines large companies that fail to offer health insurance to their full-time employees. This would not be a problem for Darden, except that many of its employees have affordable health plans whose coverage is not robust enough to fulfill the requirements of Obamacare's individual mandate. Such plans are popular with restaurants, whose profit margins tend to be small, because they let employers offer benefits at a very reasonable cost. But such plans have coverage limits and other features that Obamacare bans, so they will likely be discontinued beginning in 2014, if not sooner. And so in order to avoid paying fines or buying massively more expensive health plans that are Obamacare-compliant, Darden is now experimenting with limiting its employees' hours instead. By keeping workers to fewer than 30 hours per week, Darden can categorize them as "part-time." Thus, the company avoids the Obamacare fines and leaves employees to the new government health insurance exchanges, where they may receive subsidies to purchase insurance. At least two other restaurant chains -- White Castle and McDonald's -- are considering similar plans. So to sum up, Obamacare is leading to fewer hours worked, less tax revenue for the government and bigger government subsidies for health insurance for people who were already insured in the first place. If enough companies do this, Obamacare will become a massive dead weight on the federal budget, even as it does little more than shuffle people from one insurance plan to another, whether they like it or not. The Congressional Budget Office estimates, at the high end, that 20 million workers could see their health plans dropped thanks to Obamacare."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1349906614903</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 18:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349907212953-50</Id><Topic><Title>Want to see gas fall by $2 a gallon???</Title><Username>bimmy.beoris</Username><Timestamp>1349802682631</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:11:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While true if you could get enough people to stop using gas for long enough (2 weeks is not long enough.

The members want the Government Accountability Office to perform a full audit of energy-related subsidies to see how they interact with markets. The lawmakers want the review to include subsidies for all energy technologies between fiscal 2003 and 2012. “Despite the expansion and extension of federal support for energy technologies, there is not a thorough understanding of how such federal interventions and subsidies are impacting — either positively or negatively — the energy sector and corresponding energy markets,” the letter signatories said. Signatories included House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.); Energy and Power subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.); Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.); and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). The request comes after Upton said the federal government should remove tax breaks for both oil and green energy, saying he wants to put those energy technologies “on an even footing.” And last week, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said oil tax breaks could face the budget axe. Both Upton and Romney said such actions would likely need to be complemented by reducing the corporate tax rate. Senate Republicans resisted cuts to oil-and-gas subsidies in March. They, along with House Republicans, have also sought to limit federal spending on clean-energy technology. GOP lawmakers contend Democrats and the Obama administration have unwisely intervened in energy markets by providing subsidies to technologies that could not compete without federal support. Romney attacked President Obama’s energy policies in last week’s debate. He recalled the bankruptcy of California solar panel maker Solyndra, which went bust in 2011 after receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee from an Energy Department stimulus program. The administration and some Democrats say subsidizing clean-energy technology will help U.S. firms remain competitive in a growing global market. Obama partially blamed Solyndra’s failure on state-backed Chinese firms flooding the market. He has responded by waging a trade battle with China on the issue, imposing tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels. The administration and Democrats have also charged that oil-and-gas subsidies are no longer necessary given their profitability and market presence. They say clean-energy technologies should keep receiving subsidies to catch up with legacy technologies, such as oil and gas, that have had a head start with infrastructure.
