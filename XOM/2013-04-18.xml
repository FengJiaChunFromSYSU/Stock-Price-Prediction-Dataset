At the time, an official announcement was expected a week later. A couple months later, the incentive seems to be fully determined and is set to start on May 1. As reported in February, the focus is on battery storage technology for solar PV systems. For year one, €25 million is being set aside. The money is going to be dished out by German state bank KfW, which just announced a record profit of €2.4 billion (yes, billion with a ‘b’) for last fiscal year. “The state bank will provide the financing, thus initially covering the necessary funds for the support program. Overall, the funding program is expected to run for two years; €25 million should also be made available in 2014,” PV Magazine writes. “From May 1, the purchase of new battery storage for photovoltaic systems will be subsidized up to €660/kW of solar power, said Germany’s solar industry association, BSW-Solar, in a statement released. Plant operators can apply for financial support for photovoltaic projects that are installed in 2013 and have a maximum capacity of 30 kW.” Here are some more rules: The incentives can cover about 30% of the battery costs. The “soft loans” can be for 5, 10, or 20 years. The PV power plant that the battery system supports must send at least 60% of its power capacity to the grid — a requirement that sticks throughout the course of the power plant’s life. And, lastly, the battery systems granted these incentives must have a guarantee of at least seven years. The policy certainly doesn’t seem to leave room for manipulation, and its targeted use seems pretty clear.

And one of those big impacts is reducing the price of electricity. As we’ve been writing for years, due to the merit order effect, wind power lowers the price of wholesale electricity. At the same time, due to technology improvements and cost reductions from economies of scale, the overall cost of wind power has been coming down. As an example of that, the cost of wind power in Brazil has fallen 41% since 2009! Wind farms have won 55% of contracts awarded by Brazil’s national energy agency, Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica, and wind power now costs about $45/MWh (4.5 cents/kWh) in the country. This has been deterring the construction of gas-fired power plants, prompting the decline of some bids from wind farms so that at least some gas-fired plants are built. When the wind picks up, wind farms generate electricity very cheaply. So cheaply that they undercut the prices of the rest of the power plants. Furthermore, as noted above, there’s the merit order effect. Here’s a short explanation of the merit order effect: “Electricity providers bid in order to sell their electricity on the electric grid. Because solar and wind don’t have fuel costs, the extra cost to supply electricity (when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing) is basically $0. With subsidies or feed-in tariffs, they can even sell for negative prices and make a profit. As a result of these clean energy sources’ $0 fuel costs, they can outbid every other energy source. And the overall effect from down-bidding everyone is that the wholesale price of electricity is lowered.” Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica is now introducing separate categories for the electricity market, where fossil-fueled power plants can bid against other, and wind projects compete in a... cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/04/18/cheap-wind-power-disrupting-brazilian-energy-market/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366291578928</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366292091496-9</Id><Topic><Title>Cheap Wind Power Disrupting Brazilian Energy Market</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366291578928</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:26:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wonder how much the government subsidizes that industry?

Pilot and demonstration plants to commence in late 2013. 15 Apr 2013 Carin Hall Ethanol is the most widely acclaimed alternative or additive for gasoline used for running vehicles, and the US ranked as number one producer of this biofuel using natural waste feedstock, states new analysis by research and consulting firm GlobalData. According to the latest report, the US is the global leader in cellulosic ethanol production, manufacturing 5.42m gallons in 2012. Bio-ethanol is produced through the fermentation of cellulosic feedstock such as forest and agricultural waste. The US boasts an abundance of this biomass feedstock, and dedicated energy crops such as Switchgrass and Miscanthus are grown exclusively for conversion into cellulosic ethanol to help the nation’s ambition to meet fuel needs while reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The US is the only country currently working to promote the cellulosic ethanol market, with the US Department of Energy (US DOE) providing grants to help companies establish a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant. As a result, several companies have set up pilot and demonstration plants and a few commercial plants are expected to be commissioned in late 2013. The US has also mandated the addition of 10% ethanol in gasoline fuel, setting steady domestic demand for the industry, while certain recently released cars are able to run on a 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline mix. Corn stover and wheat straw are among the most freely available types of feedstock used in countries producing cellulosic ethanol, and growing ethanol demand may see these nations utilizing the residue of their corn crop for ethanol production, creating a sizable market for agricultural waste.

The numbers show a total of more than 127 million gallons of Biomass-based Diesel for March, but that total also includes production of renewable diesel. With the March numbers, year-to-date biodiesel production stands at just under 259 million gallons. Made from an increasingly diverse mix of resources such as recycled cooking oil, soybean oil and animal fats, biodiesel is the first and only EPA-designated Advanced Biofuel that's produced on a commercial scale across the U.S. It is produced in nearly every state in the country and is used in existing diesel engines without modification.
