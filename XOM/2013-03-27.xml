Tolkien’s books. Tolkien was an absolute master of Germanic lore and culture and painted its dark and bright aspects. The USA liked the Old Germany of folklore much better than the violent militarist Prussian version they defeated – a Germany run amok by bad wizards and elves gone wild making nasty “orcs” “trolls” and other devilry. So the USA would get to specialize in war, and some master elves taken to the USA would help with the hard stuff: jet planes, ICBMS, moon rockets, satellites… The Elf Kingdom hates pollution and likes things “green,” just like the ones in Tolkien’s books, and has declared war on fossil fuels. Quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and super computers work the magic in the labs of Germany’s Über Elves. Germany uses American mass production, and elf “magic” (science and education) to make cars, machinery, and endless products few can compete with. Even China can barely break even in trade with Germany, even with high polluting coal and cheap labor. The Elf Kingdom keeps a tiny military, only 5% of the cost of the USA’s force, and sells only a few weapons on the side – and just to people the USA so are “OK.” The Elf Kingdom is particular about its culture and discipline, and its Master Elves like their women pretty, playful, and smart which ensures pretty, smart, cultured little elves. But for wars, and course “Prussian” dark Germanic pursuits – the USA has things whatever way it wants there. The wise USA – smart, very smart… This arrangement has worked out fantastically.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364385152932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 07:52:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364388198998-3</Id><Title>BIG NEWS OUT ON--BCCI-- READ YAHOO NEWS HEADLINES$$$</Title><Msg>facts</Msg><Username>strongmovers655</Username><Timestamp>1364388198998</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 08:43:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364394839521-4</Id><Title>Rumors.....

Just like if you take money out of the bank and give it to your kids, it ultimately only reduces their inheritance. Why is it YOUR needs that should be accomodated. I want the dividend cut and buybacks increased. That allows XOM to give me cash when I want (and when I want to be taxed) or I can let my % ownership increase and capture that value later (again, when I want.) If YOU want cash now, sell a few of your shares. Keep the rate at X% of your shares per year and your invesment value over time will remain the same and you get your cash. Meanwhile, i don't have to pay taxes on divies I dont' want. divies do not inherently raise the stock price. A stable, ongoing dividend is a 'continuous' return of capital to ownership. It is the stability of this cash stream AND the fact the the companies return on capital is high is what drives long term value. Have you ever noticed that every time a dividend is given, the share price drops accordingly the next open? I am not saying divies are bad. But they are only the company giving you back your own money (and getting taxed for it.)</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1364420827087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 17:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364421143963-14</Id><Topic><Title>higher dividends?</Title><Username>hrant4005</Username><Timestamp>1364087805846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A constant dividend with a falling share price gets you a great yield%. Of course it also eventually gets you a worthless investment. Not saying the above is true for any of the companies you mentioned. Just pointing out that if all you look at is divy yield, you can wind up in real trouble. and THAT is why some will buy XOM before TOT, BP, RDS, COP, CVX, etc.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1364421143963</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 17:52:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364423209408-15</Id><Topic><Title>We are headed into a WORLDWIDE Economic DEPRESSION!!!</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1364404524719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 13:15:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do you expect with all the yellow cabs in New York changing to Nisson by 2014.
