During his presentation, Tonsager underscored the important role renewable fuels play in President Obama’s “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, which is designed to reduce America’s reliance on foreign oil. Tonsager said the U.S. cut net oil imports by 10 percent, or one million barrels a day, in 2012. “As domestic oil production expands we will also need to blend it with our domestically produced biofuels, whether cellulosic ethanol or drop in, biodiesel or aviation, and the sooner the better,” Tonsager added. The Renewable Fuel Standard, with a goal to use at least 36 billion gallons of bio-based transportation fuels by 2022, lays the foundation for reducing imported petroleum, and encouraging the development and expansion of our nation’s renewable fuels sector. “Midwestern renewable fuels are helping to pave the way toward our goal of solidifying and enhancing a renewable energy future,” Tonsager said. “I look forward to a continued partnership to build a stronger rural economy, and a cleaner, more secure energy future.” This past year USDA Rural Development’s investment in Iowa helped create or retain more than 1,600 jobs, aided 2,400 families in buying their own homes and assisted more than 60 communities as they made improvements to their facilities, services and infrastructure. USDA Rural Development is an equal opportunity lender with a variety of grant and direct and guaranteed loan programs for single and multi-family housing, community facilities, water and sewer development and business and industry programs.

Under the President’s leadership, these investments in housing, community facilities, businesses and infrastructure have empowered rural America to continue leading the way – strengthening America’s economy, small towns and rural communities. USDA’s investments in rural communities support the rural way of life that stands as the backbone of our American values. President Obama and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack are committed to a smarter use of Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities. USDA, through its Rural Development mission area, has an active portfolio of more than $176 billion in loans and loan guarantees. These programs are designed to improve the economic stability of rural communities, businesses, residents, farmers and ranchers and improve the quality of life in rural America. loansafeDOTorg/usda-importantance-of-renewable-fuels-for-a-more-secure-energy-future</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359609837807</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 00:23:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359622844882-3</Id><Topic><Title>US recession right on time...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1359554168801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:56:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and the dumb poor people going to get a lot hungrier.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1359622844882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 04:00:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359630385560-4</Id><Topic><Title>Downgraded - just the beginning</Title><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1359592028189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 19:27:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I'm aware that most small-time investors like yourself who have a limited view don't know about any firms without a brand name.

Dlouhy in Electricity, Energy demand Comments(0) The extension of a wind production tax credit leaves some eligibility rules unclear. A jump in natural gas usage combined with big gains in energy efficiency have helped the United States make strides in cutting emissions over the past five years, according to a report released Thursday. The “Sustainable Energy in America” factbook documents a 6.4 percent slide in total energy use between 2007 and 2012. During the same time frame, the amount of electricity generated both by natural gas and renewable sources climbed, and coal-fired power generation declined, helping to trim carbon dioxide emissions produced when fossil fuels are burned. “Significant changes are occurring in the US energy sector that are boosting investment and accelerating deployment of a range of commercially available clean technologies,” said Lisa Jacobson, president of Business Council for Sustainable Energy, which developed the report with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Perhaps the biggest change documented in the report is America’s transition toward lower- and zero-carbon power sources, especially natural gas, which provided nearly a third of the nation’s electricity in 2012. That’s a big jump from five years earlier, in 2007, when natural gas was used to generate just about a fifth of electricity in the United States. Renewable energy generation — including not just wind and solar, but also geothermal and hydropower — has climbed from 8.3 percent to 12.1 during the same five-year span, adding more than 17 gigawatts. Total U.S. installed capacity of natural gas and renewables is now at 629 gigawatts (442 of that coming from natural gas), representing about 58 percent of the total power generating mix. The evolution in the United States’ electricity supply will necessitate big changes down the road, as regulators work to ensure reliability and balance intermittent wind and solar supplies. According to the report: Ensuring ongoing reliability will become an even tougher challenge for electricity market operators and regulators, given the diminished role for coal and the increased presence of variable resources (ie, intermittent renewables). Yet other changes afoot – including reduced electricity demand through energy efficiency; the introduction of smart grid technologies for improved grid management; and the growing role for dispatchable resources such as natural gas plants, hydropower, and demand response – can help the electricity industry meet this challenge. Of course, emerging power sources don’t always exist in harmony, even though natural gas — which can more easily be used to generate power with a moment’s notice — is generally cast as a strong partner for intermittent renewables. The relatively low price of natural gas has made it tough for wind power to compete economically (though that industry has gotten a boost through a federal production tax credit, just extended for another year by Congress). fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/01/31/report-transformation-in-u-s-power-supply-breeds-new-challenges/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359660352281</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:25:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359660847251-24</Id><Topic><Title>The Turbo Tax Element and 100 + oil.</Title><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1359645185028</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:13:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm German Protestant...

(AP file photo/John Moore) OPEC crude oil production declined to a 15-month low as Saudi Arabia reduced output because of waning demand from consumers, a Bloomberg survey showed. Output in the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slipped 525,000 barrels, or 1.7 percent, to an average 30.479 million barrels a day this month from a revised 31.004 million in December, the survey of oil companies, producers and analysts showed. The December total was revised 430,000 barrels a day lower mostly because of the change to the Saudi number. “OPEC members are cutting because of concern about demand and a surplus in stockpiles and are responding to a lack of market interest,” said Sarah Emerson, managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “They are getting to that magic number of 30 million and won’t have to cut much more.” Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest oil producer, pumped 9.1 million barrels a day this month, the lowest level since May 2011. Output was down 100,000 barrels a day from December and 800,000 barrels from May, when production reached the highest level since at least January 1989. December production was revised 370,000 barrels lower. Ibrahim Al-Muhanna, an adviser to Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi, said Jan. 14 that his country reduced December output because customers asked for less. Al-Muhanna denied what he said were suggestions that it cut oil production last month to push prices higher and accused unidentified media of misinterpreting the kingdom’s response to weaker demand. Gulf Production “They got to the fourth quarter and saw where demand was and responded by cutting production,” Emerson said. “It looks like all the Gulf producers are reining in output.” Libyan output tumbled 320,000 barrels to 1.11 million this month, the least since January 2012, the survey showed. It was the biggest decline of any member. Production has slipped because protests shut the country’s Zueitina export terminal early this month. The port handled about 150,000 barrels a day of exports in 2010, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Production in Libya plunged to 45,000 barrels a day in August 2011 from 1.585 million that January, the last month before an uprising that overthrew the government of Muammar Qaddafi disrupted output. OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s oil, maintained its official production ceiling at 30 million barrels a day at a meeting Dec. 12 in Vienna. Ministers from the group’s members are next scheduled to gather on May 31. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/01/31/opec-january-crude-production-falls-to-15-month-low-in-survey/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359661023832</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:37:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359661655242-27</Id><Title>EPA Proposes 2013 Renewable Fuel Standards</Title><Msg>EPA Proposes 2013 Renewable Fuel Standards Release Date: 01/31/2013 WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing the 2013 percentage standards for four fuel categories that are part of the agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2). The proposal announced today will be open for a 45-day public comment period and EPA will consider feedback from a range of stakeholders before the proposal is finalized. EPA continues to support the use of renewable fuels within the transportation sector through the RFS2 program, which encourages innovation, strengthens American energy security, and decreases greenhouse gas pollution. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established the RFS2 program and the annual renewable fuel volume targets, which steadily increase to an overall level of 36 billion gallons in 2022. To achieve these volumes, EPA calculates a percentage-based standard for the following year. Based on the standard, each refiner and importer determines the minimum volume of renewable fuel that it must ensure is used in its transportation fuel. The proposed 2013 overall volumes and standards are: Biomass-based diesel (1.28 billion gallons; 1.12 percent) Advanced biofuels (2.75 billion gallons; 1.60 percent) Cellulosic biofuels (14 million gallons; 0.008 percent) Total renewable fuels (16.55 billion gallons; 9.63 percent) Overall, EPA’s RFS2 program encourages greater use of renewable fuels, including advanced biofuels. For 2013, the program is proposing to implement EISA’s requirement to blend more than 1.35 billion gallons of renewable fuels over the amount mandated for 2012.

EPA raised how much cellulosic biofuel — those made from non-edible feedstock — it expected refiners to blend this year as part of the renewable fuel standard. EPA set the mark at 14 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel, up from about 8.65 million gallons last year. The new figure pleased the biofuels industry, but did not satisfy API. The two sides are tussling over a recent court decision that said EPA needs to set more realistic projections for cellulosic biofuel. Biofuels groups said the goal reflects new production coming online, while API maintained it was too lofty. The biofuels industry contended more cellulosic facilities came online at the end of last year, and that the industry output would reach commercial levels in 2013. “U.S. EPA worked hard to ensure that the cellulosic biofuels volume standard for 2013 would be tied directly to the commercial production of cellulosic biofuels expected to come online this year,” Brooke Coleman, executive director with the Advanced Ethanol Council, said in a Thursday statement. But API charged EPA’s projection is still too ambitious, as just about 21,000 gallons of cellulosic biofuel were produced last year. The oil-and-gas lobby shop is concerned that its members will be forced to buy credits if enough cellulosic fuel is not produced, as has been the case in the past. “The court recognized the absurdity of fining companies for failing to use a nonexistent biofuel. But EPA wants to nearly double the mandate for the fuel in 2013. This stealth tax on gasoline might be the most egregious example of bad public policy, and consumers could be left to pay the price. EPA needs a serious reality check,” API Downstream Group Director Bob Greco said in a Thursday statement. The attack on the cellulosic biofuel target is just one aspect of API’s effort to tear down the biofuel mandate. The rule requires refiners to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuel into traditional transportation fuel by 2022. API wants Congress to repeal the rule, and is weighing other court challenges as well. The biofuels industry is vehemently defending the mandate, saying any changes to it could deter investment. The industry contends API is mostly concerned about the rule’s accelerating blending targets cutting into oil profits. Along with the cellulosic projection, EPA released targets for biomass-based biodiesel, advanced biofuels and total renewable fuels. Those marks were 1.28 billion gallons, 2.75 billion gallons and 16.55 billion gallons, respectively. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/280455-biofuel-blending-battle-rages-on-as-epa-releases-new-projections</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359678972856</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 19:36:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359683767813-32</Id><Title>Go Short and Get Rich....</Title><Msg>Doesn't Everyone know the golden goose post earnings drop in Exxon????</Msg><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1359683767813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:56:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359685409727-33</Id><Topic><Title>hes vlo earning big beats suggests xom cvx big beats</Title><Username>jmcchen</Username><Timestamp>1359551574571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:12:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really, you want to use a refining company as the bell weather for the upstream production dominated industry. (Major integrated oils are upstream dominated. I work for one on the downstream side and can promise you that upstream dominates in nearly every aspect.) While far from a perfect model, the two parts are almost counter opposed. On a short time frame, frequently what is good for refining is bad for production. Oil price goes up, it cost the refiners more to buy (bad thing) but oil goes up increases revenue for production (good thing). Only if the finished product prices are pushed up as much or more is it good for both. Similar (but often much more accurate) on falling prices. What is good for one can often be bad (or neutral) for the other half. But what is bad for one is usally bad for the other in the near term. While certainly not in current favor (ala COP/PSX and MRO/MPC), it is the (somewhat) counter opposed aspect that (used to) be considered as an advantage in oil (and generally) vertical integration.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1359685409727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 21:23:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359693512006-34</Id><Topic><Title>US recession right on time...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1359554168801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:56:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When the value of the dollar becomes equal to one-ply toilet paper (approximately two-ply now) and hungry Americans are begging for a new currency, the banking elite working with the political global leaders will gladly give it to them.

Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and several colleagues floated the bill as the Energy Department (DOE) reviews 16 applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to countries that don’t have free-trade deals with the U.S. Federal law, according to DOE, generally requires approval of exports to nations that have such trade deals with the U.S., but other applications face much more scrutiny from regulators. The “Expedited LNG for American Allies Act” would put NATO allies and Japan, which is seeking to expand imports as most of its nuclear capacity remains offline, on equal footing with the formal free-trade partners. But the prospect of a major export expansion has generated opposition from some big U.S. manufacturing and chemical companies, who fear higher domestic prices, and has drawn pushback from some environmentalists as well. A slew of oil-and-gas industry and business groups, however, are strongly backing the export plans. Barrasso called exports good for Wyoming, a natural gas-producing state, and the nation as a whole. “This will expand economic opportunities across America and help lower our nation's trade deficit. Our bill will also promote the energy security of key U.S. allies by helping reduce their dependence on oil and gas from countries, such as Russia and Iran,” he said in a statement about the new bill. The bill expands on legislation floated late in 2012 by now-retired Sen. #$%$ Lugar (R-Ind.) that would provide automatic approval for exports to NATO countries. In addition to Japan and NATO countries, the new Senate bill would also require DOE to approve exports to other countries if the State Department, in consultation with the Defense Department, determines that it would promote U.S. security interests. With debates on exports heating up, many eyes are on new Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has expressed skepticism about a major expansion. He has said that Congress should step in to help ensure that regulators find the “sweet spot” on the level of exports allowed. Wyden’s office did not provide immediate comment on Barrasso’s new bill. Begich, in supporting the bill, highlighted Japan’s push to import more gas. “In addition to being a key strategic ally for our nation, Japan has been Alaska’s number one trading partner for decades. When I talk to members of the Japanese parliament or officials from Japanese utilities, concern for the security of their natural gas supply always comes up. The U.S. and Alaska have plenty of natural gas to sell to Japan and our NATO allies, and I can’t think of a better place to sell it than to our strategic and economic partners,” Begich said in a statement. Japan is already the world’s largest LNG importer, and the 2011 nuclear disaster has further increased its need for outside energy supplies. Almost all of Japan’s nuclear plants remain offline in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which led to meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The other initial sponsors of Barrasso's bill are Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and David Vitter (R-La.). thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/280429-senate-bill-would-green-light-gas-exports-to-nato-allies-japan</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359694120859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 23:48:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
