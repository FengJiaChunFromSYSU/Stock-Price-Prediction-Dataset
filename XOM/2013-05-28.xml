General Electric Co. is opening a new laboratory in Oklahoma, buying up related companies, and placing a big bet that cutting-edge science will improve profits for clients and reduce the environmental and health effects of the boom. “We like the oil and gas base because we see the need for resources for a long time to come,” said Mark Little, a senior vice president. He said GE did “almost nothing” in oil and gas just over a decade ago but has invested more than $15 billion in the past few years. GE doesn’t drill wells or produce oil or gas, but Little said the complexity of the fracturing boom plays into the company strengths. Wells are being drilled horizontally at great depths in a variety of formations all around the country, and that means each location may require different techniques. There are also big differences in how surrounding communities view the boom. There’s been little controversy in traditional oil and gas states such as Oklahoma, but nearby landowners in Pennsylvania, Colorado and other states have complained of environmental and health effects. “My own view is there things can be managed,” Little said of concerns about drilling, adding they need to be managed carefully. He drew a parallel to GE’s work with the aircraft industry, since many decades ago flying was considered a risky business, but the industry evolved so that even as the speed, distance and number of flights increased, overall safety improved greatly. Little also pointed out that GE fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/27/industry-giant-ge-aims-to-improve-fracking/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369718301534</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 01:18:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369760060516-2</Id><Topic><Title>Germanic themed Prometheus story – told by Americans</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369579076667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:37:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Scarlett Johansson, if you look her up in google, is part jewish but is indeed nordic looking and one of the world's most beautiful women.Theron is another Olympian stunner.Myself, I prefer Penelope Cruz.</Msg><Username>aeskylosa</Username><Timestamp>1369760060516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:54:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369763745209-3</Id><Title>Exxon buy under $87 in july......</Title><Msg>too high now!!!</Msg><Username>madmoneycramer</Username><Timestamp>1369763745209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:55:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369764770006-4</Id><Title>EPA extends comment period on controversial gasoline rule</Title><Msg>EPA extends comment period on controversial gasoline rule By Ben Geman - 05/28/13 11:54 AM ET The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the public comment period on draft gasoline and vehicle emissions rules that the refining industry alleges the EPA is ramming through without enough input. The agency is extending the comment period by 18 days — from June 13 until July 1 — on draft rules that will force refiners to sharply cut the sulfur content of gasoline. The EPA unveiled the rules in late March, but published them just last week in the Federal Register, a step that formally opened the comment period. The extension announced Tuesday wasn't enough to satisfy the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group that opposes the rules and says the formal comment period should be 90 days. “We think EPA still is not allowing for a reasonable period for public participation,” said Patrick Kelly, a senior policy adviser with the industry group, said Tuesday. “This is one of the most complicated rules EPA has ever issued.” The auto emissions and gasoline rules are aimed at cutting smog-forming soot and toxic pollution. Public health advocates have cheered EPA's recent action to move ahead with the long-delayed “Tier 3” rules, which the EPA says will bring major benefits through avoided respiratory ailments and other gains with scant effect on gas prices. But oil industry groups say they will impose major costs on refiners and raise gasoline prices, and argue that existing standards have already led to steep reductions in sulfur content. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/302121-epa-extends-comment-period-on-controversial-gasoline-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369764770006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369765620783-5</Id><Title>Come Hell Or High Water, Great Green Fleet Will Sail</Title><Msg>May 28, 2013 Tina Casey The US Navy plans to launch an entire biofuel-enabled Great Green Fleet in 2016, complete with fighter jets, helicopters, destroyers, and other ships, despite attempts by certain members of Congress to block it from buying biofuels. The notorious budget sequester hasn’t proven to be much of an obstacle to the military biofuel program, either. In the latest development, the Department of Defense has just nailed down $16 million in matching funds for three companies to build biofuel refineries to the tune of 150 million gallons in capacity by 2016, all using non-edible sourcing including animal fats and other waste from food processors. More Biofuel For The Department Of Defense The military biofuel program cuts across all branches of the Armed Services, but the Navy has been the most aggressive in pursuit of a new fuel future. That’s a particular imperative as US national security pivots attention to the Pacific theater. With that in mind, let’s take a look at those new contracts. We were tipped to this story by Jim Lane over at Biofuels Digest, who got it from Nick Taborek at Bloomberg last week. According to Taborek, the goal for the three refineries is to produce biofuel at cost parity with conventional fuel, at less than $4.00 per gallon. The cost parity issue is absolutely vital, because the anti-biofuel contingent has been able to use the relatively high cost of military biofuel purchases as the hook for its legislative agenda. If and when the cost differential evaporates, so do the objections. The other anti-biofuel legislative strategy has been to prohibit the Navy from building its own biorefineries, and the new private sector biorefinery contracts effectively make that a moot point. The refineries will be built by Emerald Biofuels of Illinois, Natures BioReserve of Nebraska, and Fulcrum Brighton Biofuels of California... cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/05/28/military-biofuel-program-gets-three-new-biorefineries/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369765620783</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:27:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369765772412-6</Id><Title>stock splits are good</Title><Msg>I know it's been posted before on this board that stock splits don't matter.

Dlouhy A federal mandate for renewable fuels is doing little to slash greenhouse gas emissions, according to the oil industry’s biggest trade group. Recent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions tied to climate change “are the result of a decrease in vehicle miles traveled and improvements in vehicle fuel economy, not the renewable fuel standard,” said the American Petroleum Institute, which has been battling the mandate in the courts and on Capitol Hill. Future projected declines in emissions also are tied to vehicle technology improvements, not the federal renewable fuel requirement, API said. API’s comments were delivered to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has asked stakeholders to weigh in on the environmental effects of the eight-year-old mandate that forces refiners to blend an increasing amount of alternatives into petroleum-based fuels, including corn-derived ethanol, advanced biofuel and biomass-based diesel. Ethanol: Bill would add natural gas-based ethanol to federal mandate In a white paper issued earlier this month, the committee acknowledged the challenges in calculating the total greenhouse gas emissions over their entire lifecycle, from their initial production to their eventual combustion in cars and trucks. Some environmentalists critical of the RFS say a full lifecycle emissions calculation should include the greenhouse gases tied to clearing land for agricultural use around the globe to replace the retirement of U.S. acres that were growing corn for food, as some American farmers shifted to crops for ethanol production. “Diverting acres away from food production to RFS feedstock growth is expected to lead to increased food production elsewhere,” sometimes on newly cleared lands, the Energy and commerce Committee said. But the panel acknowledged that “the calculation of emissions... fuelfixODTcom/blog/2013/05/28/api-renewable-fuel-requirement-causes-more-emissions/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369766334014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:38:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369776018158-8</Id><Topic><Title>Come Hell Or High Water, Great Green Fleet Will Sail</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369765620783</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:27:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This scale of this is a drop in the bucket for big oil.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday urged Interior to extend the public comment period on revised draft rules to regulate the process called hydraulic fracturing. The industry group, which opposes the rules floated on May 16, wants the public comment period quadrupled to 120 days. Interior is already under pressure from the bipartisan leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee to extend the comment period. In a Tuesday letter to Interior, API calls the proposed delay “reasonable” because the rule “has the potential to significantly impact domestic energy production, as well as national, state, and local economies.” Extending the comment period by three months would add to delays that have plagued the regulation, which Obama administration officials initially hoped to complete by the end of 2012. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/302221-interior-faces-pressure-to-slow-down-fracking-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369785125798</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 19:52:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369792582679-10</Id><Title>CNN confused over photos of John McCain french kissing al qada members in Syria</Title><Msg>The freedom fighters in Syria are al qada terrorists that the US taxpayers are eagerly bankrolling.
