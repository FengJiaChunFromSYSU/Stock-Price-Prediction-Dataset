(Photo by CERTs via Creative Commons) Correction appended This could be the year major solar legislation sees the light of day in Minnesota. A Democratic sweep in November has clean energy advocates optimistic about their causes following two years of legislative control by conservative Republicans. The top priority on their agenda: a bill that would require Minnesota utilities to generate a tenth of their electricity from solar by the year 2030. “Our top energy priority is the 10 percent solar standard,” said Steve Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, a coalition of more than 75 environmental and conservation groups. “We have a tremendous untapped resource, and we have the stars aligned to make major headway in ramping up our solar distributed generation here in the state,” Morse said. The Minnesota Solar Energy Act [PDF] was first introduced in May 2011 by Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, and former Rep. Kate Knuth, D-New Brighton (Knuth did not seek re-election this term). The act would supplement the state’s existing 25 percent by 2025 renewable electricity standard, which has primarily been met by large-scale wind farms. It’s among a handful of ideas being discussed to give solar power the kind of policy boost that wind energy has received in the state for the last two decades. “I know it’s a long process and you never know what’s going to come out of the meat grinder at the end of the day, but I will be very shocked if we don’t pass significant solar legislation this year,” said Ken Bradley, chair of the Solar Works for Minnesota coalition, which has led the charge for the 10-percent solar mandate. Fresh Energy, which publishes Midwest Energy News, is a member of both the MEP and the Solar Works for Minnesota coalition. What’s in the bill Bradley said the coalition of supporters backing the bill, especially among unions and businesses, is stronger than the one that helped push through the state’s 2007 renewable energy standard. As it’s written, the solar standard would be phased in more slowly than the renewable standard. Utilities would be required to get just 2 percent of electricity from solar by 2022, with the remaining 8 percent coming between then and 2030. The proposal calls for using a “buy all, sell all” model for utility integration. Solar system owners would sell all of the power they generate to their utility, which would credit the amount towards the customer’s electric bill. The rate utilities pay for solar power would be set by the state’s energy office using a valuation formula laid out in the legislation. The price would attempt to reflect the value of the electricity as well as solar’s benefits to the grid and the environment. The cost to residential ratepayers would be in the “tens of cents” per month for the first several years and increase to about $1 per month during later years, Bradley said — small, he argued, compared to the $9 monthly rate increase Xcel is asking for to cover nuclear repairs and upgrades. ‘What is the right policy mechanism?’ Bradley said he hasn’t received any indication of hesitation from legislative leaders about the bill. “We’re definitely going to talk about [the solar standard],” said Rep. Melissa Hortman, D-Brooklyn Park, who chairs the House Energy Policy committee. But she also said she’s keeping an open mind about whether it is the best way to boost solar installations in the state. “The question is: what is the right policy mechanism to incentivize growth in solar in Minnesota? It may be we do a 10 percent by 2030 mandate, and that may be the way we choose to stimulate the market and send a signal, but that might not be the most effective method right now.” Solar lobbyists are hoping for a mix of policies and incentives that can put solar on a stable growth path in the state — which the industry is more in need of since Xcel Energy’s decision last year to end its solar rebate program after 2015. “One major push will be to find an alternative source of funding for solar financing incentives in Minnesota,” said Bob Long, a lobbyist with Larkin Hoffman who represents two Minnesota solar manufacturers, tenKsolar and the Rural Renewable Energy Alliance. Long said one idea that’s been discussed in the weeks leading up to session was letting solar projects tap into financing from the state’s Renewable Development Fund, which has supported wind farms since the mid-1990s. Other energy issues Other parts of the legislature’s energy agenda are still coming together. Hortman and her counterpart in the Senate, John Marty, D-Roseville, said last week they were still meeting committee members and hadn’t seen specific legislation yet. There’s talk about amending the state’s Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing law to extend the maximum payback time to 20 years from 10 years, which would help more industrial efficiency projects qualify. Transit funding and electric vehicle infrastructure may come up in transportation committees. An energy storage standard may be introduced, Long said, though it doesn’t have the momentum of the solar standard bill. Marty, chair of the Senate Environment and Energy committee, said he wants to review the legislature’s 2007 accomplishments, which included the renewable standard and an efficiency mandate, and have a discussion about what comes next. “We’re trying to make our energy system sustainable for the long run, in a way that works for people,” Marty said. “I think now is the time when, in a very thoughtful matter, we take a serious look what’s going on, what we should be changing, and how we change it as aggressively as we can.” Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Rep. Melissa Hortman would be House author of the bill. Also, Rep. Hortman is from Brooklyn Park, not Brooklyn Center. midwestenergynewsDOTcom/2013/01/09/in-minnesota-solar-tops-clean-energy-agenda/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357794500870</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 00:08:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357798838270-2</Id><Topic><Title>'Antagonistic to Israel'</Title><Username>choc_0late</Username><Timestamp>1357543593731</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 02:26:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Johnny bullies Tom.

The governor also announced plans to create a $1 billion green bank, as well as his appointment of Richard Kauffman as New York’s chairman for energy policy and finance. Launched last year, NY-Sun is intended to help quadruple the amount of customer-sited solar in New York. This initiative is aimed at providing additional certainty to solar developers, attracting significant private investment in solar photovoltaic systems, enabling the sustainable development of a robust solar power industry in New York, creating additional quality jobs, improving the reliability of the electric grid, and reducing air pollution. “Today’s announcement shows New York State is making tremendous strides in its commitment to expanding solar deployment and growing its clean energy economy,” said Carrie Cullen Hitt, senior vice president for state affairs at SEIA. “We applaud Governor Cuomo for advancing policies that promote clean energy innovation, create jobs, protect the environment, and help ensure our nation’s energy security and independence. The NY-Sun Initiative has put New York State at the forefront of new solar deployment, creating clean economy jobs while containing energy costs for consumers. This expansion of the NY-Sun Initiative, the creation of a $1 billion green bank, as well as the appointment of former Department of Energy official Richard Kauffman as New York State’s chairman for energy policy and finance, will ensure that solar becomes an increasingly significant component in New York’s energy portfolio while supporting solar’s affordability for more New York State families and businesses. We look forward to working with the governor and the legislature to move this initiative forward.” Since 2008, the amount of solar powering U.S. homes, businesses, and military bases has grown by more than 500 percent – from 1,100 megawatts to more than 6,400 megawatts today, which is enough to power more than one million average American households. Solar is the fastest-growing and most affordable, accessible and reliable clean energy technology available today. America’s solar industry now employs more than 119,000 workers at 5,600 companies – most of which are small businesses spread across every state in the union. New York State is currently ranked 12th among states in terms of installed solar capacity, according to the latest U.S. Solar Market Insight® report. There are approximately 3,300 solar professionals working at 338 companies in New York. seiaDOTorg/news/seia-praises-governor-cuomo-expanding-new-york-solar-energy-program -------------------------------- U.S. Market Installs 684 MW in Q3 2012; Continues Record Year CHARTS The third quarter 2012 was the third largest on record for the U.S. solar industry and raised the total installed capacity through the first three quarters of the year to 1,992 megawatts (MW)- already surpassing 2011’s annual total of 1,885 MW. There were 684 MW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity installed in Q3 2012, representing a 44 percent increase in deployment over the third quarter of 2011. SEIA forecasts that an additional 1,200 MW of PV capacity will be installed in the fourth quarter of 2012 alone, bringing the total for the year to 3,200 MW.

War was a key stimulus to building up the state and its power, and the uniquely aggressive and militaristic culture of Western Civilization was important to the carrying the trend forward. The uses of state power have branched into many other areas besides militarism over time, however, leading the economy and economic development as they have done so. The trend of rising government power has been interrupted by periods of 'conservative' governance which are referred to above as 'limited government' for want of a better term for it. Before the modern era such a style of government was the practical result of the end of warfare, the military being the only area of government conservatives would indulge. Today, as in the past, conservatives wish to roll back government or stop it growing. It is only necessary for them to control a blocking power in government, a blocking power such as the US House enjoy, to achieve their aims... Of one goes to the trouble of placing the depressions and recessions that have tormented the economy one will find that the vast majority fall with the periods when collectivism is being obstructed by conservative forces. We are in one of those periods now. 2014 should be the end of it.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357831708483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:28:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357831866176-11</Id><Topic><Title>Trends in collectivism in detail: 1651-2014</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357831708483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:28:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*period 12 runs from 1784 to 1791 - the period between the American Revolutionary War and French Revolutionary War</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357831866176</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357831885365-12</Id><Title>Feds say wind farms could work off Cape Fear coast</Title><Msg>Feds say wind farms could work off Cape Fear coast By Kate Elizabeth Queram Kate Queram StarNewsOnline Published: Wednesday, January 9, 2013 at 9:33 p.m. Last Modified: Wednesday, January 9, 2013 at 9:33 p.m. Parcels of water off the North Carolina coast could be leased for offshore wind farming as early as 2014, though construction may not begin for up to five years after that, officials said Wednesday. "I think there will be offshore wind in North Carolina," Maureen Bornholdt, renewable energy program manager for the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, told a packed conference room at the Courtyard Marriott. "It's a matter of, in what area? That will morph depending on the type of comments we get and the ongoing discussions." Representatives from BOEM held the informational meeting at the Wilmington hotel to give area residents a chance to learn and ask questions about offshore wind farms. The event, officials said, doesn't guarantee that wind development will definitely happen in Tar Heel State waters, but represents a more tangible sign of progress than the discussion that's hummed among environmental groups for years. As of now, three sites off the coast have been identified as potential sites for wind development. One is in the Outer Banks and the other two – roughly 17 miles south of Bald Head Island and 11 miles southeast of Sunset Beach – flank Oak Island. Because the continental shelf drops off relatively slowly from the shore here, North Carolina has an exceptionally large block of water less than 30 meters deep, making conditions ideal for wind turbine installations. "We have the largest resource off the East Coast for wind," said Jen Banks, wind energy project coordinator for the state Solar Center at N.C. State University. No one spoke against the proposal Wednesday, though opponents of wind power have historically worried that the presence of wind farms off the coast could negatively affect tourism. Officials addressed those concerns Wednesday, noting that the sites are miles offshore and that visibility tends to hinge on more than just distance. About a dozen audience members, many affiliated with environmental groups, spoke in favor of the proposed sites. Among them was David Rogers of Environment North Carolina, who voiced his own support and then relayed a message from a relative. "My folks live in Holden Beach and I talked to my mom about it, and she said she likes windmills and thinks they're pretty," Rogers said. "She wanted me to tell you that. She said she'd rather look over the water and see a turbine than an oil rig." starnewsonlineDOTcom/article/20130109/articles/130109720?p=1&amp;tc=pg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357831885365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:31:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357832232730-13</Id><Title>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report January 10, 2013</Title><Msg>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report January 10, 2013 January 10, 2013 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending January 4, 2013 Summary Working gas in storage was 3,316 Bcf as of Friday, January 4, 2013, according to EIA estimates.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wants the Energy Department (DOE) to redo a natural-gas export study to address “shortcomings," setting the stage for a likely hearing on the matter. Wyden, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said he is concerned the DOE-commissioned report by NERA Consulting failed to properly #$%$ market demand and exports’ impact on natural-gas prices. “Although the NERA study acknowledges that some sectors of the economy will be hurt by exports, the NERA study fails to fully #$%$ the impacts of rising natural gas prices on homeowners and businesses,” Wyden wrote in a Thursday letter to Energy Secretary Steven Chu. The report concluded natural-gas exports would yield a net economic benefit. It also said the economic activity from exports would outweigh modest price increases that concern some Democrats and the manufacturing industry. But several Democrats and the manufacturing industry have urged caution on natural-gas exports because of cost concerns. They contend resulting price increases would harm manufacturing, which has benefited from cheap natural gas, and raise electricity rates for homeowners. Robert Dillon, spokesman with committee ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), said he expects many of the pricing issues to be aired in a hearing early this Congress. Dillon downplayed the effect of price increases, telling The Hill that the hearing would help people "get beyond the hysteria," adding, "If exports are going to raise prices, the public deserves to know that." Wyden’s office said a hearing on natural gas exports is likely, but said the committee has not finalized anything. President Obama appears to back expanding natural-gas exports. He has said he wants to send more oil and gas abroad in hopes of turning the U.S. into an energy powerhouse during his second term. Currently, DOE readily approves natural-gas exports with free-trade nations, but has a longer vetting process for countries without such a pact. Exports to those nations must be in the “public interest,” and many lawmakers and export supporters have said the study showed exports meet the criteria. But Wyden, who wants the administration to examine all natural-gas exports, said the study used two-year-old domestic market data that understated demand. He said the report did not account for the amount of natural gas used at export terminals. He also said natural gas is expected to become a bigger player in transportation fuels, and he questioned the study’s treatment of U.S. and Canada as a single North American export market. “The shortcomings of the NERA study are numerous and render this study insufficient for the Department to use in any export determination,” Wyden said. The report, however, said expanding natural-gas exports would not detract from supply for domestic use. Instead, it would encourage additional production specifically for export markets. And while more than a dozen export applications are on file at DOE, it is unlikely all of those will be greenlighted, Dillon told The Hill. Dillon said that while it is relatively inexpensive to submit a plan with DOE, the next step in the process — going through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — requires a significant investment. At that point, developers must file an environmental impact statement, contract with a buyer and perform other steps that add up, Dillon said. “Once you get to the FERC stage, that’s where you've got to put your money where your mouth is. And that’s where a lot of these projects will probably disappear,” Dillon said. Dillon noted exports also might facilitate a gold rush because of how costly it is to convert gas to liquid form, ship it and then turn it back into gas. He said that while natural gas is fetching about $3 per million British thermal units (Btu) and $14 per million Btu in Japan, those aforementioned costs slim profit margins. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276525-wyden-criticizes-doe-natural-gas-export-study-calls-for-do-over</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357845581226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:19:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357845722630-25</Id><Topic><Title>Trends in collectivism in detail: 1651-2014</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357831708483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:28:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Things went well for the economy during a few of the Bush years.

A neocon like Bush can always be expected to spend on war. Conservatives have indulged in that sport for hundreds of years as you can see. Aside from the warring, the Bush years were not big government years, though. The tax cuts fatally undermined any long-term plan to spend on government, aside from the warring that was mentioned.

"Americans are back to believing that something is happening with our climate and that mankind has a role to play in that. These are not natural phenomena," said Jackson in her first newspaper interview since announcing on Dec. 27 that she would leave the EPA. Climate change is "a simple scientific statement," said Jackson, who was in San Francisco on Tuesday to tour the city's new energy-saving Public Utilities Commission building. She said the EPA's so-called "endangerment finding" that greenhouse gases pose a public threat, upheld despite court challenges, has enabled the agency to use the Clean Air Act to start reducing their emissions and "help businesses to look forward to a different future." During her tenure, EPA has proposed emission limits on new power plants and has nearly doubled the fuel efficiency standard for new cars and light trucks by 2025. There's still a way to go, she acknowledged. She said the nation has to get to the point of accepting scientific evidence. She cited the EPA's recent rules that set stricter standards for fine particle or soot pollution, which were based on EPA research -- done at the request of the National Academy of Sciences -- showing that soot is a cause of premature death. "And yet you have people argue about whether soot standards are beneficial," she said. Another challenge, she said, is Congress. Jackson repeatedly tussled with congressional Republicans and the fossil-fuel industry over anti-pollution regulations. "One of the questions everyone is asking themselves is whether the U.S. House of Representatives is actually going to reflect the will of the people on a lot of these issues, and the will of the people is awfully clear." But people in Washington continue to argue about them "and that's not good for out country," she said. Many environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation, had hoped for stronger and more decisive action from President Obama, the first Democratic president in eight years. They criticized the White House for not lobbying harder for passage of a cap-and-trade bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions and for delaying tougher standards on ozone pollution, both of which Jackson wanted. "We didn't back away from those challenges," she said in defending Obama. "And the president, even as we were growing out of a recession, didn't ask us to back away from those challenges." She said Obama had "the enormous challenge of trying to bring our country together around a plan for growth that is resilient and that focuses on everyone in the country — not some people doing well, but, as he says, "growing from the middle out." Jackson was careful not to assign blame, saying her agency addressed several issues that had "either been neglected or done, as the courts later found, not in compliance with the law." Two other highlights Jackson listed from her four years heading up the nation's environmental agency was expanding the EPA's decades-long effort to ensure that all communities, rich and poor alike, get the benefits of clean air, clean water and clean land. The work of environmental justice is to ensure that "we don't simply transfer a problem from one community to another" and that one community doesn't pay for the clean water of another, she said. Finally, she said, she was pleased with the beginnings of EPA's work on sustainability, a conversation the agency will launch later this month. "We're not looking to regulate it, this isn't another set of mandates," she said. Rather, she said, her agency sees the hundreds of Fortune 500 companies with sustainability officers and wants to make sure that it's helping those efforts. "Clearly, if a business is using less water or less energy or less toxics, that's clearly helping the economy," she said. Why leave now? "Part of the decision in deciding to go now was to give myself the space and time to think about where I can make a difference next," Jackson said. She hasn't set a date yet for her departure nor has she announced what she'll do after leaving the EPA. mDOTusatodayDOTcom/article/news/1818857?preferredArticleViewMode=single</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357848082651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 15:01:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357856696367-28</Id><Title>Manufacturers go to war with oil industry over gas exports</Title><Msg>Manufacturers go to war with oil industry over gas exports By Ben Geman - 01/10/13 03:14 PM ET The petroleum industry and several big manufacturing companies are warring over whether U.S. regulators should allow a major expansion of liquefied natural-gas exports. Dow Chemical, Eastman Chemical, Alcoa and others have launched a coalition called “America’s Energy Advantage” to warn against “unfettered” exports, alleging it would harm U.S. manufacturing growth and cost jobs. The new coalition is calling on the Energy Department to “disregard” a federally commissioned consultant’s recent study that said exporting gas will be a net economic win for the nation, calling it inaccurate. Energy-thirsty manufacturers have welcomed the U.S. gas production boom and low costs, and fear price spikes if the Energy Department approves a slew of pending applications to export gas from the Gulf Coast, Oregon and elsewhere. The coalition drew a strong rebuke Thursday from the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful lobbying group that represens oil and natural-gas companies. “Short-sighted efforts by a few industrial users to restrict exports in an apparent attempt to control prices would deprive American families of the wider benefits of lower costs and increased job creation,” said API President Jack Gerard in a statement. “Restricting exports of energy as a ‘strategic resource’ makes no more sense than unnecessarily restricting the export of chemicals, agriculture products or cars, and such a backward move could violate international trade rules,” he said. The public jousting between big industries is just one front in growing political and lobbying battles over gas exports. A pair of senior Democrats, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), are also warning that the exports could harm consumers and domestic manufacturing. In the near term, the lawmakers and the new coalition are both attacking the DOE-commissioned report, which concluded that exports would put some upward pressure on prices but won’t pose a major threat to domestic industries. America’s Energy Advantage has launched an online petition drive with messages to DOE alleging the study underestimates the effect that exports would have. It “fails to recognize the significant increase in demand from manufacturing that is a direct result of more affordable natural gas supplies,” the petition states. The other members of the new coalition are the chemical company Celanese and the American Public Gas Association, which represents publicly owned local gas utilities. The group says federal officials should “move cautiously on permitting natural gas exports in order to measure impact on price, security and jobs.” DOE is weighing over a dozen applications to export more than 22 billion cubic feet of per day to nations that don't have free-trade agreements with the U.S., and has said the study unveiled last month will help inform its reviews.   Federal law, according to DOE, generally requires approval of exports to nations that have the deals with the U.S., but other applications face more scrutiny. While there are divides over exports among industries, the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce favors sending U.S. gas abroad, Chamber CEO Tom Donohue said in his annual “state of American business” address Thursday. But Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, urged Energy Secretary Steven Chu to redo the study in a letter Thursday. He said the study, conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, did not properly account for natural-gas demand. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276585-oil-industry-manufacturers-lock-horns-over-gas-exports</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357856696367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 17:24:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357861678655-29</Id><Topic><Title>Manufacturers go to war with oil industry over gas exports</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357856696367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 17:24:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what we are witnessing in this news item is the staged event in the future of vastly higher energy prices.

The expanded project will cost C$5.4 billion ($5.5 billion), up from a most recent estimate of C$4.1 billion, Houston-based Kinder Morgan said in a statement today. The increase came after additional shippers signed long-term contracts in a supplemental open-season round, according to the statement. Kinder Morgan announced plans in April to more than double the line’s capacity to 850,000 barrels a day from 300,000, and reduced the scope of the expansion in May to 750,000 barrels a day, saying not enough shippers had signed up. After Kinder Morgan decreased the size of the proposal, shippers told Canada’s National Energy Board they were concerned about their ability to “access the process” to sign up for the pipeline, Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said on a conference call. The company held a third sign-up period for the pipeline in December, Anderson said. Thirteen customers have signed commitments to ship 708,000 barrels a day and about 180,000 barrels a day will remain open for customers who want short-term, or “spot” access, Kinder Morgan said said in an e-mail today. The project still must receive federal approval. Bigger Pipe The larger project will require 36-inch (91-centimeter) pipe instead of 30 inches, and will lead to more ship traffic at the company’s Westridge dock in Vancouver Harbor, Anderson said. The pipeline stretches 715 miles (1,150 kilometers) from Alberta to Vancouver and is the only one connecting Canada’s oil-sands region to the West Coast, according to the company. Expanding it would allow more Canadian oil exports to Asia. Other pipelines that would increase shipments as oil-sands production expands, such as Enbridge Inc.’s Northern Gateway and TransCanada Corp. (TRP)’s Keystone XL, have faced delays because of environmental opposition. Trans Mountain may be able to open quicker than competing routes since it involves building a second pipeline and using existing right of way where possible, Anderson said. If approved, the expanded Trans Mountain is may be operational in 2017, according to the statement. Environmentalists and Canadian First Nations groups have said they oppose Kinder’s plan because it may lead to oil spills in Vancouver harbor. Challenging Opposition Kinder Morgan expects the most challenging opposition to the pipeline expansion from local groups in Vancouver, one of Canada’s busiest harbors. There are no plans to add additional marine safety procedures, Anderson said. Kinder Morgan has been watching Enbridge Inc. (ENB)’s efforts to build support for its Northern Gateway pipeline “with great interest,” Anderson said. Demand from producers to get crude to Asian markets is the most important factor driving demand for such pipelines, he said. The company has support from communities along the route and is working with groups to address concerns about environmental impacts, Anderson said. The pipeline, operating since 1953, traverses Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains as well as some of Canada’s most productive farmland in the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver. Canada exported C$68.3 billion worth of oil products in 2011, more than the nation’s other main products that include vehicles, logs and metals, according to Statistics Canada, a federal agency. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has made increasing Canada’s oil exports a national priority. The federal government passed new rules last year to speed up and simplify environmental reviews on projects like pipeline expansions. businessweekDOTcom/news/2013-01-10/kinder-morgan-increases-size-of-trans-mountain-pipe-expansion</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357862115192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:55:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357863026909-31</Id><Title>Sen. Sanders, after US hits heat record, floats new climate bill</Title><Msg>Sen. Sanders, after US hits heat record, floats new climate bill By Ben Geman - 01/09/13 02:59 PM ET Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is floating legislation to impose fees on greenhouse gas emitters, a plan that’s highly unlikely to advance but shows that liberal lawmakers intend to ramp up calls to tackle global warming in the new Congress. Sanders announced the bill a day after federal officials reported that 2012 was the hottest year on record in the lower 48 states, smashing the record set in 1998 by a full degree Fahrenheit. The bill from Sanders would create a “transparent fee on greenhouse gas emissions from the biggest polluters,” his office said in a brief summary. “After the hottest year on record and extreme weather disturbances such as Hurricane Sandy, we must take strong action to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and move toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy,” said Sanders, a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “I intend to introduce legislation in the Senate to do just that.” Cap-and-trade legislation collapsed on Capitol Hill in 2010, and political prospects for new measures to cap or tax emissions face extremely grim prospects. But the record heat and violent weather is nonetheless leading Democrats to seek the political offensive on climate change. Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) recently said she’s establishing an ad-hoc “climate change clearinghouse” with two other Senate committee chairmen that will promote administrative action and legislation. Environmentalists are pressing President Obama to take tougher steps using his administrative powers, including establishment of first-time carbon emissions standards for existing power plants. Sanders' plan also aims to boost green energy development and nix tax incentives for oil companies. “It will call for an historic investment in efficiency, sustainable energy, advanced transportation infrastructure, and clean energy research and development. The measure also would end fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks,” his office said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276353-sen-sanders-after-us-heat-record-floats-new-climate-bill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357863026909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:10:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357863551660-32</Id><Title>TransCanada plans $5.1 billion pipeline to LNG terminal</Title><Msg>TransCanada plans $5.1 billion pipeline to LNG terminal TransCanada plans $5.1 billion pipeline to LNG terminal Posted on January 10, 2013 at 7:40 am by Bloomberg (AP file photo/Grand Forks Herald, Eric Hylden) TransCanada Corp. (TRP), builder of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, was selected to construct and operate a C$5 billion ($5.1 billion) natural-gas conduit to Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s planned export terminal in British Columbia. The Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project has a proposed initial capacity of 2 billion cubic feet a day from the Montney region to the planned liquefied natural gas terminal in Port Edward, British Columbia, TransCanada said today in a statement. The pipeline may begin operation in 2018, subject to government and corporate approvals. Progress Energy Canada, purchased by Petronas last month for C$5.2 billion, selected Calgary-based TransCanada to build the Prince Rupert pipeline, which will be capable of expansion to 3.6 billion cubic feet a day, according to today’s statement. The project is TransCanada’s second proposed pipeline to an LNG export terminal on the West Coast, following its previously announced Coastal GasLink pipeline. “From a trading perspective, we view today’s announcement as an unexpected positive development that should provide support for TRP’s shares,” Pierre Lacroix, an analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc., said in a note to clients today. TransCanada, which trades under the symbol TRP, rose 2.4 percent to C$48.39 at the close in Toronto, and earlier rose to C$48.40, its highest intraday since it began trading more than 30 years ago. ‘Competitive Process’ Gas producers in British Columbia’s Montney Shale, far from North American population centers, are seeking Asian markets for the heating and power-plant fuel. Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, as Malaysia’s state-owned energy company is known, has said a final investment decision on the terminal, with an estimated cost C$9 billion to C$11 billion, is expected late next year. Progress Energy Canada, purchased by Petronas last month for C$5.2 billion, selected Calgary-based TransCanada to build the Prince Rupert pipeline. Spectra Energy Inc. (SE) was involved in a “competitive process” to build a pipeline to the Progress Energy terminal, Caitlin Currie, a Spectra spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview today. Spectra already is planning a pipeline to serve a terminal proposed by BG Group Plc (BG/) in Prince Rupert. Winning Contracts “It looks like TransCanada is going to be the builder of choice to get gas to the West Coast, with two pipelines running two separate paths, one to Prince Rupert and one to Kitimat,” said Steven Paget, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. TransCanada was selected in June to build Coastal GasLink, the C$4 billion supply pipeline for an LNG export terminal proposed in Kitimat, British Columbia by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Mitsubishi Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and PetroChina Co. That pipeline also still requires corporate and government approvals. TransCanada probably won the contracts because of its ability to build big gas pipelines and the option it provides for British Columbia gas producers to sell into North American gas markets via its existing system, if LNG facilities don’t require all the supply at any given time, Paget said. Recoverable gas in western Canada has risen to 400 trillion cubic feet and reserves could be larger than that, attracting export opportunities, said TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling, speaking by phone from Prince George, British Columbia. TransCanada, which currently transports 1 to 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day from British Columbia, expects its host of expansion projects in the region will let it move 2.5 to 3 billion cubic feet a day from the province’s northeast next year, Girling said. “That gas has to find a market in advance of the development of the infrastructure required to move it to export markets,” he said. TransCanada has spent about C$1 billion expanding its gas pipeline network in northeastern British Columbia over the last five years, he said. Boost Earnings The Prince Rupert pipeline will help TransCanada boost earnings later in the decade, after its Keystone XL line, set to deliver oil-sands production to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners comes into service, Lacroix said. Taken together, spending on the two LNG pipelines would amount to C$9 billion, more than the $7.6 billion cost of Keystone XL. “We’re still hoping Keystone XL gets built, but we were looking past 2014 to 2015 and without Keystone XL they were just going to be generating huge amounts of cash and now they have a place to spend the cash that will help them earn more money,” said Michael Formuziewich, who helps manage C$2.2 billion at Leon Frazer and Associates Inc. in Toronto, including shares in TransCanada. Mainline Gas The Prince Rupert line will connect British Columbia gas to TransCanada’s existing network of gas pipelines including Canada’s longest conduit, the 8,763-mile (14,101-kilometer) Mainline, which moves western Canadian gas as far as Quebec’s border with Vermont. The viability of TransCanada’s Alberta-to- Quebec Mainline has been threatened in recent years by declining gas volumes in Alberta and competing supply from the U.S. Northeast that have led to a doubling of tolls on the line. TransCanada also plans a C$1 billion to C$1.5 billion extension of its Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. pipeline to reach additional gas supply in the North Montney region, according to today’s statement. That pipeline could begin operation in 2015. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/01/10/transcanada-plans-5-1-billion-pipeline-to-lng-terminal/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357863551660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:19:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
