Wrong answer. PSX is NOT the production piece from COP. It is the Refining and marketting arm. Plus, post COP/PSX spin off, refining margins went up significantly. But they have since contracted just as much. BTW, Bufett has also called his investment in COP (and subsequently PSX via the spinoff) a mistake. Then he called his reduction in that position a mistake. Etc. WEB is a heck of a value investor with a heck of a long term track record. But a) even he makes mistakes and b) he does not invest in something because it is "just around the corner". He is the forever buy and holder.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1355383451317</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 02:24:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355398651552-2</Id><Topic><Title>New Year's Investments</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355326873879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 10:41:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Greedful, if Israel only nukes Iran, I don't agree that all HLLLL would break loose in the markets; other than for oil, gold, oil stocks, and gold stocks shooting through the roof.

The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) proposed Wednesday extending the 2.2-cent per kilowatt-hour credit for wind power production by one year, then phasing it out through the next five. Fiscal conservatives on and off Capitol Hill have targeted the incentive this year, saying ending it would help reduce the deficit. But the industry and its congressional allies say that ending the incentive now would be too abrupt and thwart wind power expansion. AWEA CEO Denise Bode said the wind industry could become cost-competitive with other energy sources by the end of the proposed phaseout. “With the policy certainty that accompanies a stable extension, the industry believes it can achieve the greater economies of scale and technology improvements that it needs to become cost-competitive without the” incentive, Bode said Wednesday in a letter to lawmakers. The industry has consistently said it supports a phaseout. But until Wednesday it had been tight-lipped on the structure while it works to get an extension before the incentive expires Dec. 31. The Truman National Security Project’s Operation Free campaign, which has worked closely with AWEA to secure an extension, supported the plan. “Operation Free is proud to support the policy proposal announced by the American Wind Energy Association today, which would provide the long-term business certainty needed for the wind industry to continue to thrive,” Truman Project Executive Director Mike Breen said in a Wednesday statement. And for her part, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources — has suggested such a five-year phaseout.

Bank on it. If the required rate of return on the 490 odd stocks in the S&amp;P 500 unrelated to oil doubled because of the war, and crashed 50% to reflect the doubling, the other 10 would lose half their value unless the market believed their earnings were going to be twice as much thanks to the war. Nobody is going to buy an oil company whose shares only offer X% when they can get 2X% from another stock that has dropped 50% to factor in more risk. Most of the value of oil stocks is not coming from the profit they earn in the next 6 months or year, either, it is based on expectations of profit over the coming decades. A middle east war that throws the entire world economy into an other Great Depression will not be helpful to those expectations. I suggest you research production sharing contracts and the tax structure oil companies face with rising oil prices too. If you prefer the company annual reports look at those as well. You will find they pay higher and higher taxes and shares of revenue the higher the oil price goes. That is by design. The oil companies have bargained away most of their rights to profit from extremely high oil prices to assure themselves a higher rate of return at moderate oil prices which their risk modelers take as far more likely. This is why Exxon Mobil is not making more money at $110 than it was at $65/$70 just a few year ago. Indeed, it is probably make substantially less as it is costing them far more to replace a barrel of oil now in development costs than it did only several odd years ago... If you want to gamble on oil buy oil, not oil stocks. The same applies to gold. I don't think there will be a war though. Obama will not allow one. He proved who was in charge in the Gaza offensive when he ordered Bibi to back off and Bibi said Yes Sir!!</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355410754579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 09:59:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355412400065-7</Id><Topic><Title>Corporate Split</Title><Username>rudolph0720</Username><Timestamp>1355155744133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:09:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My guess is the value unlocked by COP splitting up came from market expectations that someone will buy up the pieces.

If, for example, you look at the level of stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from 1850 till 1945 and somehow track down all the dividends and market values year to year you could construct a rate of return on "equity" on the NYSE. The problem is what you have constructed does not represent the rate of return on equity in society. What you have constructed indicates the rate of return on stocks listed on the NYSE. An investment in American business equities in 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910, 1920... would have entailed buying shares the myriad farms, general stores, and other businesses that dominated the economy but which did not trade on the NYSE. A few insurance companies and railroads that did trade on the NYSE did not represent the American economy in 1850 or in the years after, and the industrial companies that cropped up around 1900 do not represent all of it either. The share of income going to farming and the businesses that were not listed on the NYSE declined steadily from 1850 till 1945, which an absolute fact readily available in U.S. Economic Census reports. The reason for that is those areas of business activity returned far less, or in the case of farming effectively nothing above the cost of labor, compared to the equities that happened to be listed on the NYSE. By only looking at the equity traded on the NYSE, year to year, you cherry pick, by design, the winners and ignore the losers. If one had actually invested in equity across the economy over time one would have found that the return was far lower than the return from the stocks on the NYSE or any other stock market in the past. If you fast forward from 1945 to today you will seem a similar thing going on. As you get closer and closer to the present you will find that the stock market much more closely matches the equity available to invest in America than it did in the past. However, since the stock market returns from investing in equity in the past do no represent the return from investing in American "equities" or world "equities" the stock market's past performance does not indicate its future return. The correct approach to predicting a rational return from stocks would be to figure out what the actual rate of return from investing in American business equity or international equity actually was in the past. If one does that they will be very disappointed. Mathematically it cannot be more than the rate of increase in GDP plus whatever share can be pried away from labor income and interest income... With debt spiraling up with no end in sight, the interest share will only rise squeezing out the share that could go to stocks. As labor's share declines politicians like Obama get elected on a mandate to redistribute shareholder's income to others... The stock market's return as pathetic as it is in the past 15 years is actually quite typical of what one could have expected from investing in businesses on a diversified basis in the past. Only the period 1945 to 1980 shows strong returns - that is a product of rebuilding the world economy after World War II and much higher returns on capital until was rebuilt.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355415719722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:21:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355419837078-9</Id><Topic><Title>The Cult of Equity Fraud</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355415719722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:21:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...as for the period after 1980, when the companies on the stock market already were substantially equivalent to "American business," some that could not be said for the century before that, the return was the same as buying 30-year U.S. government bonds at the start of the year, selling them at the end of the year, and buying more 30-year bonds for the next year. At this point the return is so low its pointless to do that though. In other words the stock market was a effectively worthless investment vehicle from 1980 till now - it failed to meet the superior risk characteristics of bonds, and did not offer excess return over bonds. In Japan, whose equity market was actually equivalent in size to America's equity market in the 1980s, Japanese government bonds decisively beat Japanese stocks. German Bunds beat German stocks.

The organizations pushed back against proposals for a "revenue neutral" carbon tax, a design that some policy experts have floated as a way to win support from fiscal conservatives. That structure would use revenue from taxing emissions to reduce other tax rates or would return that money to consumers. But the 14 groups sending the letter warned lawmakers not to believe those claims. “Promises of revenue neutrality will be broken” they argued. They added that “reducing U.S. emissions won’t stop or delay climate change.” Some outside conservative groups had floated the idea of a carbon tax as a way to both curb emissions and raise revenues to close the deficit. Climate activists joined those calls, saying pricing carbon would create momentum for increasing efficiency and expanding clean energy. Proponents of a carbon tax believe their proposals could enter the conversation if Congress takes up tax-code reform. But many congressional Republicans have swatted away the carbon tax concept, saying it would harm U.S. economic competitiveness relative to fossil fuel-burning China and India. And some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said Congress should not institute a carbon tax merely to raise revenues for the Treasury Department. Democrats have said passing such a tax would be difficult. Attempts at getting comprehensive climate legislation through Congress have been absent since 2010, when a cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate after passing the House. Instead, the Obama administration has pushed ahead with various rules aimed at reducing emissions. Those measures include finalizing vehicle fuel-efficiency rules and imposing the first-ever air pollution standards at new coal-fired power plants. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions have fallen on their own because more power plants are burning natural gas instead of coal. Natural gas has half the carbon intensity of coal, and the abundance of supply from the shale gas boom has driven prices to record lows. Congressional Republicans have used that as a basis to call for more natural gas drilling, putting pressure on the White House to open federal lands for natural gas development. The groups writing to Congress, which include The Heartland Institute, Freedom Action and Competitive Enterprise Institute, made that point in their letter. “This decline is accelerating as low‐cost natural gas, made possible by the shale gas revolution, induces utilities to replace high‐carbon coal power with lower‐carbon natural gas power. Other market factors also are inducing a long‐term decline in carbon intensity, and no new taxes are necessary to continue this trend,” they said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/272773-conservative-groups-urge-congress-to-avoid-carbon-tax</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355421654036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:00:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355422159791-14</Id><Title>B20 Powering Navy Building</Title><Msg>B20 Powering Navy Building Comment on this post Posted by Joanna Schroeder – December 13th, 2012 The first Navy plant in the Mid-Atlantic region to use B20 is located in St. Julien’s Creek Annex in Portsmouth, Virginia. The biodiesel blend will provide steam to heat 16 office buildings and 13 warehouses. Over the course of the winter, 235,000 gallons of B20 are expected to be used to create the heat. Previously the plant used traditional, petroleum-based fuel oil. According to the National Biodiesel Board, the B20 blend is priced competitively with the petroleum based diesel, and will not increase the Navy’s costs to heat the base, while helping to meet the Secretary of the Navy’s goals for greater energy security. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy) Tom Hicks recently experienced a first-hand look at how biodiesel is being used to heat a Navy base. “The Navy uses an annual average of 30 million barrels of fuel per year which equates to about $4 to $5 billion of fuel cost,” Hicks said during the tour. Because of this, it is important to explore additional and alternative sources like we see here today at St. Julien’s Creek.” Hicks continued, “This is a perfect example of what the Navy is trying to do by using B20, a 20 percent biodiesel, 80 percent conventional fuel to run the steam plant from domestic sources that are competitively priced.” domesticfuelDOTcom/2012/12/13/b20-powering-navy-building/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355422159791</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:09:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355423100457-15</Id><Title>4skinner v. wahleee boy</Title><Msg>The feud was entertaining while it lasted.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, both the level and the range of Brent prices were similar to current levels (Figure 1). That price environment continued into January of 2012 before prices increased sharply in February and March, resulting in the second consecutive year of substantial first-quarter crude oil price increases. However, despite the similarity between prices in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, physical markets are somewhat less indicative of higher prices than at this time last year. The U.S. Energy Administration's (EIA) December 2012 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts the Brent spot price to fall during the first quarter of 2013 rather than rise as it did in early 2012. For 2013 as a whole, EIA expects Brent to average $104 per barrel, an $8-per-barrel decrease from the expected 2012 annual average of $112 per barrel. In its current STEO, EIA forecasts the call on the combination of global inventories and crude oil from the member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Counties (OPEC) to decline through the first half of 2013. This call on inventories and OPEC production is projected to average 30.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in the first quarter of 2013 and fall to 29.8 million bbl/d in the second quarter, declines of 0.3 million bbl/d and 1.2 million bbl/d, respectively, from the 2012 fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2011, the call on inventories and OPEC decreased only 0.5 million bbl/d to average 30.8 million bbl/d in the second quarter of 2012. This reduction in the call on inventories and OPEC is largely the result of growing liquids production from non-OPEC members. In the December STEO, non-OPEC supply is projected to average 53.7 million bbl/d in the second quarter of 2013, about a 0.8-million-bbl/d increase from the expected fourth-quarter average. Forecast non-OPEC production growth is largely driven by expected increases in production from U.S. tight oil formations and Canadian oil sands. Last year, geopolitical events in Sudan and Syria disrupted production and non-OPEC supply was 0.2 million bbl/d lower in the second quarter of 2012 from the fourth quarter of 2011. EIA also expects that OPEC crude oil production in the first half of 2013 will slightly outpace the combined call on inventories and OPEC crude oil production, leading to expected global inventory builds during the first half of 2013. Notwithstanding expectations for easing in physical markets and growth in global spare capacity during 2013, current macroeconomics are uncertain and there are risks to the forecast that could push prices higher or lower. EIA projections do not assume any significant economic deterioration in the United States or the European Union (EU) next year, but oil prices could move lower on concerns about the downside risks to future consumption from the so-called "fiscal cliff" in the United States, or from concerns about EU economic stability. Oil prices could move higher as well. In China, the economy has shown signs of improvement over the past two months, as key manufacturing indexes, export volumes, and refining runs have increased, although a sustained rebound is tentative. In early 2012, geopolitical disruptions helped bolster Brent prices. Similarly, events in Libya contributed to higher prices in early 2011. While EIA does not forecast geopolitical developments, any new geopolitical threat to supply security would affect global crude markets. Financial market indicators also suggest that market expectations of a first-quarter price increase in 2013 are lower than in the fourth quarter of 2012. While the Brent options market is not sufficiently liquid to provide meaningful information on implied volatility beyond the prompt month, options written on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contracts offer a rough idea about market participants' assessment of the likelihood of a major price move. As of the five trading days ending December 6, implied volatility for the WTI contract settling in March 2013 averaged 28 percent. At current market prices this volatility yields a calculated 95-percent confidence interval of $71 to $113 per barrel. Last year at this time, implied volatility for the March 2012 WTI contract was 41 percent, yielding a much wider calculated 95-percent confidence interval of $69 to $142 per barrel. While Brent prices are higher than WTI prices, Brent implied volatility has also decreased recently, settling at 25 percent on December 6, about a 3-percentage-point decrease from November 1, and its lowest level since the second quarter. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices fall again The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline decreased five cents to $3.35 per gallon, six cents higher than last year at this time. Prices decreased in all regions of the nation for the second consecutive week, with the largest decrease coming in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price fell eight cents to $3.33 per gallon. The West Coast price has decreased 87 cents since reaching a high for the year in October, and is now $3.54 per gallon, down seven cents from last week. The East Coast, Midwest, and Gulf Coast prices all declined four cents from last week, to $3.42 per gallon, $3.28 per gallon, and $3.12 per gallon, respectively. The national average diesel fuel price decreased four cents to $3.99 per gallon, 10 cents higher than last year at this time. The U.S. average diesel price has been below the $4-per-gallon mark three out of the last five weeks. Prices decreased in all regions of the nation, with the largest decrease coming on the West Coast, where the price declined six cents to $4.04 per gallon. The Rocky Mountain price is $3.94 per gallon, down a nickel from last week. Decreasing four cents, the Midwest price is $3.98 per gallon, and both the East Coast and Gulf Coast prices dropped three cents, to $4.07 per gallon and $3.87 per gallon, respectively. Propane inventories decline U.S. propane stocks fell 1.3 million barrels to end at 71.2 million barrels last week, 12.0 million barrels (20 percent) higher than a year ago. Midwest regional inventories dropped by 0.9 million barrels, while Gulf Coast inventories declined by 0.4 million barrels. Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks dropped by 0.1 million barrels, and the East Coast region gained slightly. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.6 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating oil prices decrease while residential propane remains flat; wholesale prices see biggest decreases since start of season Residential heating oil prices declined during the period ending December 10, 2012. The average residential heating oil price fell 4 cents to $3.96 per gallon, nearly 10 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices decreased by 16 cents per gallon last week to $3.06 per gallon, 8 cents per gallon more than last year at this time. The average residential propane price was unchanged from last week's price of $2.41 per gallon, 44 cents per gallon lower than the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices decreased by 8 cents to $0.83 per gallon for the week ending December 10, 2012, 60 cents per gallon lower than the December 12, 2011 price. eia ------------------------------ Short-Term Energy Outlook December 11, 2012 Next Release Date: January 8, 2013 | Full Report | Text Only | All Tables | All Figures Highlights •EIA expects that the Brent crude oil spot price will average $110 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2012, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price will average $89 per barrel. The Brent and WTI crude oil spot prices are forecast to average $104 per barrel and $88 per barrel, respectively, in 2013. The projected WTI discount to Brent crude oil, which averaged $23 per barrel in November 2012, falls to an average of $11 per barrel by the fourth quarter of 2013. This forecast rests on the assumption that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) grows by 2.1 percent in 2012 and 1.8 percent in 2013, while world-oil-consumption-weighted real GDP grows by 2.7 percent and 2.4 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively. •U.S. monthly average regular gasoline retail prices fell from $3.85 per gallon in September to $3.45 per gallon in November, as crude oil prices fell and the gasoline market transitioned from summer-grade to lower-cost winter-grade gasoline specifications. Projected national average regular gasoline retail prices average $3.63 per gallon in 2012 and $3.43 per gallon in 2013, compared with $3.53 per gallon in 2011. Forecast diesel fuel retail prices average $4.02 per gallon during the fourth quarter of 2012 before falling to an average of $3.84 per gallon in 2013. •EIA's projections of average household fuel bills this winter have not changed significantly from last month's STEO. EIA expects household expenditures for space heating fuels will be higher this winter than last winter, primarily because of the return to roughly normal winter temperatures east of the Rocky Mountains compared with last winter's unusual warmth. Average expenditures for households that heat with heating oil are forecast to be higher than any previous winter on record. •EIA expects U.S. total crude oil production to average 6.4 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.8 million bbl/d from the previous year. Projected domestic crude oil production increases to 7.1 million bbl/d in 2013, 0.2 million bbl/d higher than projected in last month's STEO and the highest annual average rate of production since 1992. •Natural gas working inventories, which reached an all-time weekly record in early November, ended the month at an estimated 3.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), almost equal to the level at the same time last year. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011, will average $2.78 per MMBtu in 2012 and $3.68 per MMBtu in 2013. eia ---------------------------- Weekly Coal Production Data for week ended: December 08, 2012 Release Date: December 13, 2012 | Next Release: December 20, 2012 For the week ended December 08, 2012: •U.S. coal production totaled approximately 20.0 million short tons (mmst) •This production estimate is 1.4 percent lower than last week's estimate and 9.6 percent lower than the production estimate in the comparable week in 2011 •Coal production east of the Mississippi River totaled 8.5 mmst •Coal production west of the Mississippi River totaled 11.5 mmst •U.S. year-to-date coal production totaled 960.2 mmst, 6.6 percent lower than the comparable year-to-date coal production in 2011 •An evaluation of the Weekly Coal Production Report has been done to compare full year 2011 estimates with full year 2011 actual Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) production.

Production of the fuel made from crop waste, wood chips, household trash and other non-food organic sources will reach 9.6 million gallons (36 million liters) in 2013, up from less than 500,000 gallons this year, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration and obtained by Bloomberg News. That gain will leave the industry short of the government’s target for 1 billion gallons that gasoline and diesel producers are expected to blend into their products next year under a federal energy regulation. The industry may not meet those targets for another five years, and companies from Kior Inc. (KIOR) to Abengoa SA (ABG) are closing the gap. Kior opened the first commercial cellulosic biofuel plant in the U.S. in October and will break ground early next year on its second facility, which will be able to produce about 40 million gallons a year, Kate Perez, a spokeswoman, said in an e- mail yesterday. “We believe that there will be ample opportunity in this space for many years to come,” she said. At least four more companies expect to open refineries by the end of next year and two additional plants are scheduled to begin production the following year. They probably won’t make enough fuel to meet the 2014 targets, and the industry will “catch up in the next three to five years” to the requirements, said Adam Monroe, North America president for Novozymes A/S (NZYMB), the Danish company that supplies ethanol companies with enzymes. “We’ve moved beyond lab and pilot and we’re now into commercial phase,” Monroe said in an interview. “You’re seeing the commercialization and the first wave of plants coming on.” Fuel Law Under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, gasoline and diesel producers are required to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuel a year into their products by 2022, including 16 billion gallons of cellulosic fuel. The targets rise each year on a schedule set by a 2007 energy law, and the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to lower them annually to reflect the industry’s actual output. The EPA cut the 2011 cellulosic biofuel requirement to 6 million gallons from 250 million gallons and reduced the 2010 mandate to 6.5 million gallons from 100 million gallons. It cut this year’s target to 10.5 million gallons from 500 million gallons and hasn’t revised its goal for 2013. Kior’s Columbus, Mississippi, plant will eventually be able to make as much as 13 million gallons a year. Ineos Bio’s plant in Vero Beach, Florida, is due to go into operation this year with annual production capacity of 8 million gallons. Both will run at about 50 percent of capacity next year, according to an Oct. 18 letter from EIA. Additional Plants Abengoa is expected to open a plant next year in Kansas with capacity of 25 million gallons a year. Poet LLC is on track to open a facility in Iowa that will be able to produce 25 million gallons a year, and Fiberight LLC will open one in Iowa with about 4 million gallons of capacity. The EIA didn’t include these facilities’ expected output in the 2013 forecast in its letter. DuPont Co. is scheduled to open a facility in 2014 with annual capacity of 30 million gallons and Chemtex International, a unit of the Italian chemical company company Gruppo Mossi &amp; Ghisolfi will open one with 20 million gallons Unrealistic, Unfair The gap between the RFS requirements and the industry’s actual output prompted oil and gas trade groups to call for the policy to be repealed. The American Petroleum Institute filed a lawsuit in September calling the requirement unrealistic and unfair, and said Nov. 27 that the RFS is “unworkable” and should be repealed by Congress. The House of Representatives is considering a bill that would limit the EPA’s authority to set cellulosic biofuel targets. Policy certainty is necessary to ensure investments continue in cellulosic biofuels, said Novozymes’s Monroe. Novozymes provides enzymes to Poet, Fiberight and Chemtex. He compared the industry to standard, corn-based ethanol, which surged in production from 2005 to 2008. The RFS caps its requirement for corn ethanol at 15 billion gallons a year and the fuel has “almost completed in its mission,” he said. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-11/cellulosic-biofuel-to-surge-in-2013-as-first-plants-open.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355425360722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:02:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355426082521-18</Id><Title>Republican Preaches Heresy Backing a Carbon Tax</Title><Msg>Republican Preaches Heresy Backing a Carbon Tax By Mark Drajem Dec. 13, 2012 11:01 AM EST Former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis blames his efforts to combat global warming for the intra-Republican challenge that cost him his South Carolina congressional seat in 2010. That hasn’t deterred him. Since the loss, he has traveled the nation making the case to students and grassroots Republican activists that a carbon tax is both good policy and politics, Bloomberg News reports. “This really is a conservative position,” Inglis told a classroom of students at Florida State University last month. “An energy and climate answer might not just unite the Republican Party, but it also allows us to get some independents and progressives to support us as well.” Inglis advocates a carbon tax that would apply to the carbon-dioxide emissions from coal, oil or natural gas. He says the revenues should be used to offset cuts in other taxes. Such a tax would let the market come up with the best way to cut emissions, and replace “big government” regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency and billions of dollars in energy subsidies, he said. The proposition is still no easy sell to his fellow Republicans. “It’s not going anywhere,” Texas Republican Joe Barton, the former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, when asked about Inglis and the carbon tax. Because of Inglis’ self-described“heresies” on climate change, immigration and the bank bailout of 2008, he drew four challengers in a Republican primary in 2010.

At the time Tillerson bought XTO for a 25% premium, the consensus was that this seemed like a horrible deal ( the stock fell for months ) since it was clear NG would continue to fall ( poor world economy, huge and increasing supply glut) and Tillerson was paying a huge premium and diluting earnings for years. However many gave him the benefit of the doubt because "Exxon dosen't make mistakes" as one analyst said. The deal turned out even worse than the most pessimistic forecasts. The $41 billion was a total loss (XTO was virtually worthless at present and predicted NG prices for years into the future.). But even worse, Exxon is "losing its shirt on NG" in Tillerson's own words. And Exxon continues its terrible production performance on profitable liquids while it concentrates on unprofitable NG. So these are some questions concerning the deal 1. One of the reasons given for this deal was it would Increase Exxon's reserves which the company has done a terrible job of replacing. But NG reserves are worth much less than oil reserves. Did Tillerson think that he was fooling anyone by increasing reserves of worthless NG? 2. Another rationale for the deal was that Exxon was acquiring the expertise of top XTO management in NG exploration. However if Exxon hired away the top 50 executives of XTO with a $50 million bonus to each the cost would have been $2.5 billion instead of $41 billion plus the ongoing long term losses on the NG operation.So does this rationale make sense? 3. Giving management the benefit of the doubt that this was a legitimate deal and not collusion with XTO executives who were big shareholders and were bailed out with $billions of Exxon stock (at great cost to XOM shareholders) instead of seeing there XTO stock go to near zero (which the company was worth), what possible legitimate rationale could Tillerson have had to buy XTO at all let alone at a 25% premium? 4.Even assuming this deal was done in good faith with the best of intentions, it is clear that the deal was a (predictably) horrible disaster that destroyed untold shareholder wealth and will bleed shareholder value indefinitely if the company ever recovers. In light of this, how does Tillerson and top management keep their jobs? Is there an independent board of directors and are they even awake? 4. Finally for those of us who work for a living, if we made such a mistake would any of us keep our jobs?</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1355426859053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:27:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355428158096-20</Id><Title>Greens defeated in Germany on hydraulic fracturing...</Title><Msg>309 to 259.

No Kidding</Title><Msg>Unions: An Ohio contractor was wounded by gunfire Wednesday by a shadowy man vandalizing his SUV with union threats. Where's Washington's outrage at such lawlessness? Had King Electrical Services owner John King been shot by, say, a Tea Partyer, there'd be no end to the public pontificating from Washington's politicians and media commentators about their rhetoric or protests inciting violence. It's quite a different story for the Lambertville, Mich., contractor who woke up in the dead of night a week ago found a silhouetted figure on his driveway spraying "SCAB" on the side of his vehicle. The figure fired a gun at him before fleeing. King runs a small business employing 40 people at high wages with good benefits. His success at a time when unionized contractors are failing made him the target of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has unsuccessfully sought to unionize his workers. Now it's come down to guns, and Washington's chattering classes are strangely silent. The attack on King is emblematic of the sad fact that the leading perpetrators of political violence today are U.S. labor unions. They've grown more violent in their rhetoric as their political power grows and their appeal to workers diminishes. According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, a right-to-work think tank in Washington, there have been 4,400 incidents of union violence in the last 20 years. mp3Subscribe to the IBD Editorials Podcast The Teamsters are the leading perpetrators, with 454 incidents. But IBEW, which some suspect in the King incident, is in the top 10, having engaged in 125 incidents. All told, there have been 11,600 incidents of union violence against workers, management and the public since 1975. At the same time as the attack against King, IBEW has also engaged in a violent strike against Verizon in New York. Union strikers have been accused of cutting phone lines, firing BB guns at nonunion workers, and picketing customers. Internet videos show them using foul language and goon tactics. One of IBEW's thugs put his own daughter in the path of a truck as a means of getting more money from his employer. IBEW tactics have been so objectionable a federal judge ordered them this week to refrain from hurling and/or spreading feces in their strike, as if they should need to be told. What it's about is "the persuasion of power" as former Service Employees International Union chief Andy Stern put it.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1355429672211</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 15:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355429893313-23</Id><Topic><Title>Union Thugs?

Call it hypocrisy. Call it whatever you like—the fact remains that Obamacare's chickens are coming home to roost and some Democrats don't like it one bit. Before the election the American people got the sugar—the sweeteners that everyone thought were the popular parts of government-run healthcare like the end to the so-called problem of pre-existing condition and the ability for kids out of college to stay on their parent's health insurance plans. Now that the election is over and a new year is upon us, we're starting to get the ... salt. As the Republicans warned, time and again, Obamacare includes any number of hidden and not so hidden tax increases that are going to hit everyone where it hurts, right in the wallet. [See a collection of political cartoons on healthcare.] This is especially true for sick people, who are very soon going to have to pay a new medical device tax that is scheduled to go in to effect on January 1, 2013. It's a $20 billion tax, the Medical Device Manufacturers Association says, based on a 2.3 percent excise tax assessed on a manufacturer's yearly gross sales—regardless of whether they show a profit. And, like anything else, the cost of the new tax will be passed along to consumers and taxpayers in the form of higher prices. The medical device industry is one of the few flourishing in America these days. By taxing it, Obamacare creates an incentive to move operations overseas or, as the Democrats like to put it, "exporting jobs." Taxing sick people is bad politics. Exporting jobs is bad politics. Which is probably why, it should come as no surprise, that a large number of Democrats in the U.S. Senate who voted for Obamacare and its medical device tax in the first place now want Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to put the breaks on its implementation. In a letter to the Nevada Democrat, Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken of Minnesota, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Barbara Mikulsk of Maryland, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer of New York, Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Jeanne Sheheen of New Hampshire, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, #$%$ Durbin of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington, and Joe Lieberman and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut—all of whom voted to pass Obamacare—wrote requesting "a delay in the implementation of the medical device excise tax scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2013." They were joined in this effort by Sens.-elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who voted for Obamacare while a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. How Reid, who doesn't run the U.S. Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Health and Human Services is supposed to do that the senators who signed the letter don't say. This is political theatrics and rank hypocrisy at its worst. They voted for the tax and now they want to delay its implementation because the folks back home—the 400,000 people in their states who work in the medical device industry—may lose some of their jobs because of it. The tax shouldn't have been imposed in the first place but Obamacare is very, very expensive. More expensive than advertised in fact. To put it simply, Congress needed the money they expected the tax to generate to pay for the program. Which just goes to show there's no such thing as "free" healthcare.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1355430827750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 15:33:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355431137938-27</Id><Title>Obama's Tax-the-Scapegoat Strategy</Title><Msg>In an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly last year, President Obama claimed he "didn't raise taxes once." O'Reilly didn't challenge the claim, and other reporters repeated it as fact. But it was completely false. By the time he went on O'Reilly's show, Obama had signed more than 20 tax hikes into law with a combined 10-year price tag of more than $500 billion. However, since most of these taxes targeted relatively small and unpopular groups — smokers, tanning salons, insurance companies, the rich — few seemed to notice. Indeed, a review of the tax hikes Obama has enacted or proposed finds that most follow the same pattern: Pick out distinct groups that people generally don't like and hit them with special tax punishments. Politically, the strategy makes sense, since it lets Obama vastly expand government for what appears to be little or no cost. But in practical terms, it's a recipe for continued massive budget shortfalls. One of the first bills Obama signed into office was a 156% increase in the tobacco tax that will cost smokers more than $72 billion. But even though the tax hurts lower income families the most, the public at large barely noticed. Likewise, ObamaCare's new 10% excise tax on tanning salons — which is supposed to raise nearly $3 billion over 10 years — didn't raise any meaningful protests since it only affects those who get indoor tans. Finding Scapegoats The two biggest ObamaCare tax hikes also went largely unremarked, despite their $200 billion price tag, because they target only the top 2% of taxpayers. One is a new 3.8% surtax on investment income for families earning $250,000 or more, which kicks in next year and will raise $123 billion. The other is a higher Medicare payroll tax, which will raise another $86 billion from this same group, according to an analysis by Americans for Tax Reform. Obama promised more of the same approach to tax policy in his second term. Among his plans: He wants to raise taxes on the top 2% by another $1.6 trillion. He also wants to raise taxes on oil companies by $27 billion, which Obama would achieve by denying the industry tax deductions commonly available to other industries. And his "fiscal cliff" plan includes a new $61 billion "financial crisis responsibility fee"imposed on financial companies. Hidden Taxes When not trying to punish certain groups, Obama's tax strategy has been to hide tax hikes as much as possible. For example, ObamaCare raises $5 billion by banning the use of pretax flexible spending accounts to pay for over-the-counter drugs, which hits families who used this feature to cut their tax bills. And starting next year, the law raises the floor on deductible medical expenses to 10% of income, from the current 7.5%, costing taxpayers with big medical bills $15 billion over 10 years. It also caps the amount families can put aside in flexible spending accounts at $2,500, which amounts to a $13 billion tax hike. It raises another $60 billion by taxing so-called Cadillac health insurance plans, and adds a $63 per-person fee on health plans. The problem with this approach is that, whatever its short-term political benefits, there simply aren't enough scapegoats and hiding spots to finance Obama-sized government. All the tax hikes Obama stuffed into ObamaCare, for example, pay for less than half the cost of the new entitlement. The rest is supposed to come from proposed Medicare cuts that experts say are highly unrealistic. And Obama's new tax-the-rich plan would only make a dent in annual deficits, which are projected to total more than $8 trillion over the next decade. In addition, most of Obama's tax targets are proving unreliable. The tobacco tax hike, for example, was supposed to pay for a massive expansion of Medicaid's child health insurance program. But the tax has so far raised $2.2 billion less than expected, and revenues are forecast to fall year after year — as the smoking population declines — even as the cost of the Medicaid program skyrockets. Likewise, the tanning tax has brought in less than half what was forecast. Taxes on investments have also proved wildly unpredictable in the past, prone to market swings and investors' ability to time investments to minimize such taxes. Meantime, several Democrats now want to put off the $20 billion ObamaCare tax on medical device makers for fear that it will cost jobs — along with the income and payroll taxes that go with them. In recognition of all this, a few liberals are starting to push for a new, broad-based tax — such as a carbon tax or a value-added tax — to finance the permanently larger government Obama wants while keeping deficits under control. But for Obama to propose such a tax would require him to admit that scapegoats alone can't cover the cost of his massive growth in government.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1355431137938</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 15:38:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355432571676-28</Id><Title>We've got a bleeder</Title><Msg>It looks like somebody was pumping the stock market HARD yesterday, especially Exxon Mobil, and got slaughtered today.

It looks like they give it one last pump into close and that failed to lift it. Just fell right on its face... It will get nasty when the guinea hens in DC fail to agree to anything. There really is no way they can unless Boehner caves to Obama and that would cost Boehner his Speaker position and still almost certainly not get a bill out of the house...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355432571676</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:02:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355433211885-29</Id><Topic><Title>We've got a bleeder</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355432571676</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:02:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dog of a stock continues its daily underperformance.

XOM always traded about 20 points above its closest peer, Chevron. Since the Tillerson wrecking crew took over, the stock has traded 20 points below CVX. This management has destroyed $billions in shareholder wealth and has hurt retirees, pension plans, all other share owners. These guys are causing real damage to the financial futures of hundreds of thousands of families yet they keep their jobs.

Many Americans are living with little to no information that is truthfully presented. Many Americans vote with their hand out. Way too many Americans have lost tract of how we got here, why we live here and, the fact that we are not living well because we are "lucky". We are living well because of our system of freedom. If you forget that, you can forget your way of life. I'm not trying to promote our "standard of living", rather our ability to choose how we live. For those of you who choose to disavow your kick-off, please revisit your history books, and live well while you can do so.
