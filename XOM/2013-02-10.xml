"The fact is we've had plenty of spending cuts, $1.6 trillion in the Budget Control Act. What we need is growth," Pelosi said in an interview on "Fox News Sunday." Slashing spending indiscriminately, she said, would hurt growth prospects for the U.S. economy. "It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem," the California Democrat asserted. Pelosi didn't rule out additional spending cuts, but called for new revenue to reduce the projected $845 billion deficit this year. "What we do need is more revenue and more cuts," Pelosi said. "What I would like to see that is a big, balanced, bold [budget] proposal. Short of that, we must do something to avoid the sequester." "We have made the cut in terms of agriculture subsidies, there are tens of billions of cuts there. That should be balanced for eliminating subsidies for Big Oil," Pelosi added. "It isn't as much as spending problem as it is a priorities." Pelosi opposes cuts to education and health programs.

The nobility does not behave as others either, not at all. Wealth is routinely passed from father to son at a young age, the objective being to encourage fruitful marriages and many children to preserve the line. It is not uncommon for someone in their twenties or earlier thirties to come under the control hundreds of millions of even billions of pounds or euros.

It began as a Dutch trading colony of the WIC - financed by Dutch nobles and merchants, and then was conquered by the English Crown and ruled as a commercial colony of the English financier and merchant class. It voted for the US Constitution by a margin of only 2 votes. During the War of 1812 with England New York was very close to siding with England, and its financial community and merchants ignored Washington and the Southern warmonger coalition. They offered few financial supports to Washington and invested vast sums in English government debt instead. New York's rise as a banking center came over the objections of most Americans and especially Democratic Presidents. Is ties with London banking, and the control exerted by New York financiers over railroads and industry infuriated the American establishment - at least the ones who were barred from the nexus of power. New York financiers like Morgan were educated in Europe and were very British in outlook. The Gold Standard itself, which allowed New York and London to control most of the American economy, was entirely British. The American tradition was for silver or even paper... New York's culture today is totally alien to most of Americans. It has far more in common with London than it does most places in America.

A lessening of the number of wind projects combined with a decrease in prices on solar panels will help spur the change, Wolf said. Although the U.S. may install three to four GW of wind turbines this year, he said solar projects will exceed that after solar panel prices fell more than 60 percent in the past two year. Although a production tax credit was extended for a year on Jan. 1, uncertainty about whether the credit would be extended caused developers to finish many wind power projects by the end of 2012 without planning new ones. The credit extension, however, only requires that significant construction progress be made rather than the project be completed. According to Bloomberg, the U.S. installed around 3.2 GW of solar power last year and may reach 3.9 GW this year. power-engDOTcom/articles/2013/02/u-s--solar-power-will-eclipse-wind-power-in-2013--according-to-d.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360523099082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 14:04:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360524113299-17</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. solar power will eclipse wind power in 2013, according to Duke Energy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360523099082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 14:04:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seven or eight GW of potential combined wind and solar projects to be completed during 2013. 8 GW = 8000 MW / 400 MW for the average coal-fired utility plant = 20 potential shuttered utility plants. *How much will natural gas be squeezed?

The spread expanded 5.49 cents to 64.68 cents a gallon, the widest since Sept. 28. Gasoline jumped more than ethanol on speculation that blizzard conditions in the population-dense Northeast will affect supplies. A Feb. 6 U.S. Energy Information Administration report showed ethanol stockpiles at 20 million barrels, up 13 percent since early November. “Supply is still a concern,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “Stockpiles are still very high by historical standards. The situation is brightening, but it’s going to take a while to see substantial gains.” Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 0.4 cent to $2.412 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have advanced 10 percent this year and 8.5 percent from a year ago. Gasoline for March delivery gained 5.89 cents, or 2 percent, to $3.0588 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol. Kitt said that while ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel should spur more blending, total fuel consumption is limited during the winter season as fewer drivers take to the road and travel shorter distances. Gasoline demand fell 1 percent last week to a three-week low of 8.42 million barrels a day, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Gasoline Mix Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 91 percent a year earlier. Producers of the fuel have struggled to turn a profit because the lower consumption hasn’t been enough to circumvent higher corn prices caused by drought in the Midwest. Corn for March delivery decreased 1.75 cents to $7.09 a bushel in Chicago, the lowest price since Jan. 11. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 17 cents a gallon, up from minus 18 cents yesterday and 21 cents a week ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A U.S. Agriculture Department report today showed the corn inventories before the next harvest will be 5 percent larger than forecast a month ago. Inventories will total 632 million bushels on Aug. 31, up from 602 million forecast in January and less than the 989 million bushels a year earlier. Corn Demand Ethanol will consume about 42 percent of the 10.78 billion bushels of corn in this year’s harvest, the USDA said. At least 19 plants have been idled since June because of production costs and the supply glut, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group. Ethanol production last week averaged 774,000 barrels a day, up from 770,000 a week earlier and the lowest level since the EIA began tracking weekly data for the biofuel in June 2010. In spot market trading, ethanol in New York Harbor at $2.53 a gallon was 11.87 cents more expensive than in Chicago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol on the Chicago spot market has traded at about an 8.5-cent discount to New York in the past year. Ethanol on the West Coast fetched $2.60 a gallon. The price was $2.46 in the U.S. Gulf. The U.S. last week didn’t import the fuel for the first time since Sept. 28, EIA data show. Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo, where ethanol is made from sugarcane, cost $2.29 a gallon in the week ended today, up from $2.21 a gallon the previous week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-08/ethanol-weakens-against-gasoline-as-oversupply-constrains-gains.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360526538597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 15:02:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360527922043-20</Id><Title>Climate Change And The Blizzard: Nor'easters More Fierce With Global Warming, Scientists Say</Title><Msg>Climate Change And The Blizzard: Nor'easters More Fierce With Global Warming, Scientists Say Posted: 02/08/2013 8:41 pm EST | Updated: 02/09/2013 9:12 am EST Climate change may or may not have helped generate the nor'easter lashing the East Coast this weekend. Such storms happen with some regularity, after all. But the amount of snow the storm called "Nemo" ultimately dumps, and the extent of flood damage it leaves in its wake, may well have ties to global warming, climate scientists suggested. Michael Mann, a climatologist who directs the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, compared a major storm like Nemo -- or Hurricane Irene or Superstorm Sandy, for that matter -- to a basketball slam-dunk with a lower net. "If you take the basketball court and raise it a foot, you're going to see more slam-dunks," Mann said. "Not every dunk is due to raising the floor, but you'll start seeing them happen more often then they ought to." The two key ingredients in a big snow: just cold-enough temperatures and a lot of moisture. Combine the chilled air converging on the East with the massive moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico region and you've got the "perfect setup for a big storm," Kevin Trenberth, of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, told The Huffington Post in an email. As Trenberth explained, the ideal temperature for a blizzard is just below freezing -- just cold enough to crystalize water into snow. Below that, the atmosphere's ability to hold moisture to create those snowflakes drops by 4 percent for every one degree Fahrenheit fall in temperature. "In the past, temperatures at this time of year would have been a lot below freezing," Trenberth said. In other words, it's been too cold to snow heavily. But that may become less of an obstacle for snow in the Northeast. In addition to warming the air, climate change is adding moisture to it. Sea surface temperatures are about two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they were before 1980, raising the potential for a big snow by about 10 percent, according to Trenberth. And any individual storm, including this nor'easter, will pick up more moisture as it spins across a warmer ocean. What's more, as Mann explained, a warm ocean clashes with cold air masses from the Arctic. A bigger contrast in temperatures may mean a bigger storm, he said. Michael Oppenheimer, a climate change expert at Princeton University, said global warming is increasing extreme storms. "Storms like this tend to be heavier than they used to be," he told HuffPost. "That's a fact." As HuffPost reported on Friday, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show that the Northeast saw a 74 percent increase in precipitation during the heaviest rain and snow events from 1958 to 2011. Still, connecting any specific weather event to global warming remains inexact. A new area of study called "event attribution science" is mining data in an attempt to make more definitive links, or at least better gauge the odds of an extreme event in the context of climate change that results partly from human activities, including burning fossil fuels. But the field is young. And, truth is, nor'easters happen. In fact, Jeff Masters, a climatologist and founder of Weather Underground, noted that the number of intense nor'easters hasn't increased over the last three or four decades. A warmer climate, he explained, can decrease the length of the snowy season, and therefore the time window for nor'easters. Further, nor'easters are defined not only by heavy snowfall, but by high winds. There's less evidence for links between winter winds and climate change. Warm weather storms, such as Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy, are another story. "Since hurricanes are heat engines, they drive power from ocean waters," said Masters. Another climate-linked ingredient could propel this weekend's storm into the history books: rising sea levels. "A three-foot storm surge, on top of a higher sea level, will do more damage," Masters said, noting that sea levels in Boston, expected to bear the brunt of the nor'easter with an historic storm surge, have risen a foot in the last 90 years. Penn State's Mann also likes to use baseball metaphors when describing climate's influence on major storms -- "home runs," he calls them. "What we're seeing now with climate change is weather on steroids." CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Kevin Trenberth's job title.

Those figures were released February 8 in the United States Department of Agriculture’s World Agricultural Supply and Demands Estimates report. Higher acreages planted and stronger yields for the first-season crop and good early-season prospects for second-season corn are credited for the hike in Brazilian production.

The breakthrough comes at a key time for the industry, after the drought heightened criticism about the vast amount of corn used to brew up ethanol rather than be transformed into animal feed or other foods. The corn crop already was smaller than expected because of drought last year, and livestock groups were especially critical of how 40 percent of the crop being diverted toward ethanol caused corn prices to soar. The new cellulosic ethanol technology could quiet that criticism while also making use of material largely seen as worthless. Experts said it hasn't been easy. "You're fighting against millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of years of evolution and that's sort of the secular equivalent of going against the word of God," said C. Ford Runge, a University of Minnesota professor of applied economics and law. Making ethanol from corn is relatively simple, as kernels are cracked and fermented. But to produce ethanol from the woody and fibrous parts of plants, scientists had to figure out a way to break lignin – the tough fibers that plants have developed through evolution to make stems, trees and corn stalks stiff – from the cellulose. They must then extract the plant's sugars and convert them into ethanol. Efforts to make that leap have made for a punch line in the industry since the 1980s. Cellulosic ethanol, everyone would say, is just a few years away. But high oil prices eventually drove companies to spend more on research and development. The government jumped in too. The 2008 farm bill provided $1 billion in financial incentives to encourage cellulosic development. "You cannot underestimate the impact on the world of $80- or $90- or even $100-a-barrel oil," said Monte Shaw, executive director of trade group Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Oil futures first reached $100 a barrel in January 2008, marking a quadrupling of price in five years since 2003. Oil trades now at around $95 a barrel. The push for more ethanol production comes amid federal requirements that the petroleum industry mix 36 billion gallons of the additive into the nation's fuel supply by 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency has required that 16 billion gallons of that ethanol be cellulosic, providing another incentive for companies to pursue cellulosic research. Only about 25,000 gallons of cellulosic ethanol were produced last year, but 10 million gallons are expected in 2013. "Suddenly technological development started to occur," said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes North America, which makes enzymes used in cellulosic production. Scientists found enzymes that more efficiently break down the plant material and better yeast strains to convert sugars to alcohol, clearing the way for cellulosic production. About 70 cellulosic projects are under way, reflecting billions of dollars of private investment. In Iowa, the nation's leading corn producer, two cellulosic plants are under construction that will use corn plant leaves, stalks and cobs known as corn stover. Near Nevada, a small Iowa farming community about 40 miles north of Des Moines, DuPont is building a $200 million factory that when completed in 2014 will be the nation's largest cellulosic ethanol plant, capable of making 30 million gallons a year. Scientists said it's a major step forward. "We had lab experiments. That's all we had five years ago," said Jan Koninckx, a chemical engineer and DuPont's global business director for biofuels. The DuPont plant will work with 500 local farmers to collect more than 375,000 tons of corn stover annually. In northwest Iowa, two companies are teaming up to build another corn stover plant producing 25 million gallons of ethanol annually. Sioux Falls, S.D.-based ethanol-maker POET and Royal DSM, a biotechnology company based in the Netherlands, are building the $250 million plant in Emmetsburg. Other cellulosic plants are under construction in Kansas, Michigan and Mississippi. Plants in Georgia and Nevada will convert garbage into ethanol in commercial-size plants. One in Florida will convert yard waste and other plant material from a nearby landfill to the fuel additive. Other projects are testing the feasibility of making ethanol from fast-growing trees and various grasses. If cellulosic production can ease the demand for corn, the change will be welcomed by livestock producers who have been infuriated by rising feed costs. "The bottom line is it's all about the competition for corn," said J.D. Alexander, a cattle feeder and corn producer from Pilger, Neb., who is president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The ethanol industry said millions of gallons of cellulosic ethanol should begin flowing this year and rapidly increase over the next few years. Wade Robey, a board member at POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels, said the companies are confident the new plants will be profitable. "We feel very strongly this is a good business to be in and a good investment for our companies," he said. Some companies, including DuPont and Abengoa, acknowledged they are already looking at sites for more cellulosic plants. huffingtonpostDOTcom/huff-wires/20130131/us-food-and-farm-ethanol-from-scraps/?utm_hp_ref=chicago&amp;ir=chicago</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360556681973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 23:24:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
