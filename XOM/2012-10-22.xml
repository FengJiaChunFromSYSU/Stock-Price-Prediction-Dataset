The prospect of such talks was raised in an article published over the weekend by The New York Times that said Iran and the United States had agreed in principle to direct talks after the presidential election. On Saturday, the White House denied that a final agreement on direct talks had been reached, while saying that it remained open to such contacts. On Sunday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry dismissed the report. But if the report proved to be true, said a supporter of Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, Iran’s motives should be seriously questioned. “I hope we don’t take the bait,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think this is a ploy by the Iranians” to buy time for their nuclear program and divide the international coalition, he said. A supporter of Mr. Obama, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on the same program that the tough international sanctions the president helped marshal against Iran might be bearing fruit exactly as hoped, forcing Iran to blink. “This month of October, the currency in Iran has declined 40 percent in value,” Mr. Durbin, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said. “There is unrest in the streets of Tehran, and the leaders in Iran are feeling it. That’s exactly what we wanted the sanctions program to do.” The Times, citing unnamed senior Obama administration officials, reported over the weekend that after secret exchanges, American and Iranian officials had agreed in principle to hold one-on-one negotiations between the nations, which have not had official diplomatic relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Iran’s foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, denied on Sunday that any direct talks had been scheduled. “We do not have anything such as talks with the United States,” he told the semiofficial Fars news agency. Mr. Salehi predicted that there would be a new round of talks in November with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — including the United States — and Germany, but said that “there is no fixed date yet.” Several rounds of such talks have failed to produce a breakthrough. The United States and its partners say Iran’s nuclear program is aimed at producing a weapon, but Iran says the program is for peaceful purposes. Weighing in on the topic from Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that although he did not know whether the United States and Iran had discussed the possibility of direct negotiations, “very sharp sanctions and a credible military option” were the best means to halt Tehran’s nuclear program. He said Iran had used earlier multinational talks “to drag its feet and to gain time” to advance its weapons program. In the past, Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and members of his inner circle have floated the idea of re-establishing some diplomatic contacts with the United States. But while Mr. Ahmadinejad is the public face of the Iranian government, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is the only Iranian leader with the authority to approve direct negotiations with the United States. According to an Obama administration official, an understanding on direct talks was reached with senior Iranian officials who report to Ayatollah Khamenei. But Iranian analysts suggested that if there had there been any behind-the-scenes negotiations, the ayatollah would have publicly hinted of a change in his stance. “Instead, he has done nothing but strongly denounce all ideas of any compromise in the nuclear case,” said Abbas Abdi, a former politician critical of Mr. Ahmadinejad. That stance leaves little space for diplomatic maneuvering, Mr. Abdi said, adding that negotiations with the United States could only weaken the ayatollah’s position. “Direct talks with our archenemy would be a disgrace for those who support him, and create more leverage for his opponents to criticize him.” Mr. Abdi said. Amir Mohebbian, a foreign affairs analyst whose writings are published on Ayatollah Khamenei’s official Web site, denounced any idea of direct talks. “The Obama administration is clearly very eager to convince the U.S. voters that their sanctions are working,” Mr. Mohebbian said. “But as long as the U.S. makes threats and creates sanctions against us, no negotiations will be endorsed by our supreme leader.” Brian Knowlton reported from Washington, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran.

Nonetheless, no follow through was seen and the stock ended up generating a key reversal (higher highs, lower lows, and a close below the previous day's close) suggesting that the rally may have found a top. The stock failed to close above the 2 previous high closes at 92.30 and 92.55 seen over the past 6 weeks and did close on the lows of the day suggesting further downside will be seen on Monday. Intra-week support is found at 90.93, 90.51 and 90.09. The 50-day MA is currently at 90.15 giving that support level further strength. By the same token, any close below the 90.00 level, and probably below the bottom of the $90 demilitarized zone at 89.70, would likely push the stock down to test the 7-month breakout area between 87.00 and 87.50. Any rally above Friday's high at 93.67 would now be considered a strong positive.

How convenient. The report, timed just before tonight’s final debate on foreign policy smacked of an October Surprise gambit by the administration. But then the administration denied there was such a deal. In any event Iran promising to talk to the United States is nothing new. It has been playing rope-a-dope with President Obama and his team for almost four years. It agrees to talks or to have talks about talks, all the while moving closer to a nuclear weapons capability. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (and a Romney adviser and surrogate) John Bolton told me, “Iran has always been prepared to negotiate — when it suits them. That is the history of the last 10 years.” He also noted the impact of potentially dumping the P5 +1 negotiation format for the one-on-one negotiations the mullahs would dearly love to obtain. “If the Obama administration has in fact been pursuing bilateral talks with Iran from the outset, it has done two things: (1) enhance Iran’s view of the strength of its own negotiating position; and (2) completely undercut the administration’s incantation that ‘all options are on the table.’ Iranians sense administration desperation, so no wonder they’re not worried.” He cautioned against taking this all that seriously: “At most, Iran wants temporary relief from the sanctions. They will never negotiate away the nuclear weapons program. This is simply another effort to buy time and space.” Referring to Obama’s promise of “flexibility” after the election to Russia’s president last spring, Bolton cracked: “Maybe Medvedev clued them in.” Other observers were likewise underwhelmed by the report. Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies has been involved in sanctions policy. But he, too, warns, via e-mail: “It is not a surprise that Iran is floating the idea of new talks — especially because we’re less than three weeks before the election. People need to know how to distinguish a sincere offer from a fraud.” He also explained that the idea that sanctions could bring the mullahs to their knees has run up against the Iranians’ nuclear timeline. He explains: They are floating this offer because sanctions are clearly hurting the regime and this will be another Iranian attempt to trade minimal concessions for sanctions relief. American negotiators need to determine whether an economic cripple date — when Iran faces economic collapse — occurs before or after it becomes a nuclear threshold state. An economic cripple date must come at least six months before Iran reaches its nuclear threshold date since the prospect of imminent economic collapse will need time to crack the nuclear will of Iran’s supreme leader — if that’s even possible. [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu established his nuclear red line as late spring or early summer 2013, when the regime will have sufficient 20 percent enriched uranium to make one bomb. So the economic cripple date would have to occur within the next three months for the regime to be staring at imminent economic collapse before Israel’s red line in June or July. FDD’s recent analysis, though limited by the availability of reliable information on the Iranian economy, suggests that Tehran likely has sufficient reserves to last well beyond that date, perhaps for two years or more. Massively intensifying the sanctions in the ways currently under consideration by Congress could change that timeline. Before sitting down for direct negotiations with Iran, the administration needs to develop a reliable economic model for Iran’s economy, and an equally reliable nuclear red line, in order to better understand how long they have. And they should share that analysis with Congress, Israel and other important allies. The greatest risk is another round of protected negotiations allowing Iran to buy more time to develop its nuclear capacity while extracting sanctions concessions from a divided international community that blames America for the failure of diplomacy Obama’s sanctions came too late (after he wasted 18 months on “engagement”), were watered down too much and were unaccompanied by a credible threat of force. If anything, the latest “deal” highlights just how preposterous the entire Obama policy has been. At the debate tonight Romney should make clear that any negotiations should demand Iran give up its nuclear enrichment claims and should entail no weakening of sanctions. Instead of pooh-poohing military force the president and our allies should start planning for military action. It is only the credible threat of force that is likely to deter the regime at this late date.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350914254985</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:57:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350922511980-9</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Yahoo Finance charts - all on one screen - for free</Title><Username>douglasinthecity72</Username><Timestamp>1350916661385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:37:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ok so as far as I can see this is free. i just tried it and it works pretty well</Msg><Username>frozencustardking</Username><Timestamp>1350922511980</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350930772360-10</Id><Title>Oil dips below $90 with pipeline, Mideast in focus</Title><Msg>Oil dips below $90 with pipeline, Mideast in focus Contracts for petroleum products and natural gas also trade lower Oct. 22, 2012, 2:10 p.m. EDT By Myra P. Saefong and Sara Sjolin, MarketWatch SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Oil futures pushed lower Monday, retreating below $90 a barrel as traders eyed the expected restart of a key North American pipeline as well as developments in the Middle East ahead of the expiration of November crude contracts. Other energy futures also traded lower, with natural gas leading the percentage declines. “We expect to see pressure on the energy sector today as the day goes on,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC. The market’s “main focus is the Keystone pipeline being restarted today. Although a day late, [it] should put more pressure on crude and this could be fueled even further if the U.S. dollar catches a bid,” he said in an email. Crude for November delivery /quotes/zigman/2203159 CLX2 -1.60% was last down 54 cents, or 0.6%, to $89.51 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, having traded in a range between $90.80 and $89.25. December crude /quotes/zigman/2084380 CLZ2 -1.58% , which will become the front-month contract when the regular Nymex session ends Monday, fell 64 cents, or 0.7%, at $89.82 a barrel. The contract to watch is December, ”which has more volume to get indication of true movement in [West Texas Intermediate]” oil, said Zahir. Supply concerns arose following the temporary closure of a key pipeline in North America last week. The Keystone pipeline, which sends about 500,000 barrels per day from Canada to the Midwest, was shut last Thursday but was reportedly due to restart Monday, a day later than expected. A spokesman for TransCanada Corp. /quotes/zigman/27173 CA:TRP -0.77% /quotes/zigman/27155/quotes/nls/trp TRP -0.84% told MarketWatch in an email that he would provide an update once the company has a better sense on the restart. Tensions in the Middle East were also in focus. Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, Lebanon’s intelligence chief, was assassinated in a Friday car bombing in Beirut. Media reports said he was allied with the anti-Syria opposition, raising fears of a political crisis in Lebanon. “The uncertain situation in the Middle East ... remains a factor with the tendency to drive prices upward. Lebanon has now become a new seat of unrest, with violent disputes having taken place there yesterday,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note. “The biggest risk factor for the oil price is further deterioration of general market sentiment and accompanied growth in risk aversion,” they added. Iran, meanwhile, is likely to wait until the U.S. presidential election in November before deciding what course to take on its nuclear program, Dennis Ross, former Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama, said Sunday on Platts Energy Week, an all-energy news and talk show program. The dollar failed to offer support for dollar-denominated oil prices. The /quotes/zigman/1652083 DXY -0.01% dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, stood at 79.602, down modestly from 79.629 late Friday. Also Monday, heating oil for December delivery /quotes/zigman/2101426 HOZ2 -1.49% shed 3 cents, or 1% to $3.10 a gallon, while November gasoline /quotes/zigman/2315457 RBX2 -1.31% fell 2.5 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.67 a gallon. Natural gas for November delivery /quotes/zigman/2199366 NGX12 -4.04% declined by 14 cents, or 3.7%, to $3.48 per British thermal units. It ended last week up 0.2%. Natural gas recently revisited the technical resistance level of $3.65, and it “looks like profits were taken up at those levels,” said Tyche Capital’s Zahir. “Of course, supplies are not a concern in the natural-gas market.” marketwatch</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350930772360</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350930944422-11</Id><Title>Obama is anti energy and anti middle class</Title><Msg>He loves to redistribute.

Our primary area of focus is in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which includes our Evi area in the Peace River Arch and our Narraway/Ojay and Wild River fields in the Deep Basin. In addition, we own significant acreage in the Utica Shale in Quebec and the Liard Basin in the southwest portion of the Northwest Territories, which are shale gas prospects that we believe have significant future development potential. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2009 and through December 31, 2011, we have repositioned our asset base, divesting approximately $159 million in non-core or non-operated oil and gas properties, and investing approximately $138 million on new asset and undeveloped leasehold acreage acquisitions primarily in the Evi area and the Narraway/Ojay fields, both of which we believe have strong future growth potential. Evi Area As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 57,382 net acres in and near the Evi field, located in the Peace River Arch area of northern Alberta. This position offers us a significant development opportunity for premium-priced light oil. Through December 31, 2011, we have drilled a total of 72 horizontal wells in the Evi area since we entered the area in 2006. In 2011, we drilled 47 gross (47 net) horizontal wells in the Evi area, and we plan to drill up to 48 additional horizontal wells in the Evi area in 2012. Our working interest in all of the wells drilled in 2011 is 100%. For the 34 of the 2011 wells that have been brought on production, the average maximum recorded initial peak twenty-four hour production rate was approximately 329 Bbls per day. For the 30 of the 2011 wells that have been on production for at least 60 days, the 60-day average production rate was approximately 184 Bbls per day. For the 23 of the 2011 wells that have been on production for at least 90 days, the 90-day average production rate was approximately 179 Bbls per day. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had average daily net sales volumes of 3,605 Bbls per day from production in the Evi area. We believe we can ultimately enhance production rates and recoveries in the Evi area through further development drilling, including further downspacing of our acreage, completion optimization and secondary recovery techniques, such as waterflooding. In 2012, we plan to focus our capital budget on light oil by allocating approximately 80% of our total capital budget, or approximately $165 million, to the Evi area. Deep Basin Area As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 157,779 net acres in the Deep Basin, including approximately 121,088 net acres in the Narraway/Ojay fields, located in Alberta and British Columbia, and approximately 12,853 net acres in the Wild River field, located in the southeast portion of the Deep Basin. In 2011, we drilled and completed 6 gross (5.5 net) wells in the Narraway/Ojay fields, including 1 gross (1 net) horizontal well. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had average daily net sales volumes of 66 MMcfe per day from production in the Deep Basin. Our development of these assets is primarily focused on our Narraway/Ojay and Wild River fields. Geologically, these fields have a minimum of ten different stacked producing intervals, and we are able to produce from multiple intervals within an individual wellbore. We currently have no significant near term expiries or drilling obligations in the Deep Basin, which has allowed us to be flexible with our 2012 capital budget and defer significant natural gas investment until natural gas prices improve from their existing multi-year lows. In 2012, we are allocating approximately 7% of our total capital budget, or approximately $15 million, to the Deep Basin where we plan to focus primarily on recompletion opportunities. Shales As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 240,320 net acres in Quebec that are prospective for the Utica Shale. Natural gas produced from this area is in close proximity to major markets in Canada and the northeastern United States, which generally provides for premium product pricing compared to the NYMEX Henry Hub pricing. The Utica Shale is relatively shallow compared to other shale plays in North America, which we believe will provide for an economic advantage relative to the drilling costs associated with developing the resource. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 52,995 net acres in the Liard Basin, located in the Northwest Territories, that are prospective for the Muskwa Shale. This is a newly developing natural gas shale play adjacent to the producing Horn River Basin. We believe that our acreage in the Liard Basin is analogous to the Muskwa Shale in the Horn River Basin. Our acreage is located in close proximity to a pipeline in the Northwest Territories providing for the sale and distribution of any natural gas produced. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we re-entered and recompleted a well in the Liard Basin and intend to submit an application to the National Energy Board to potentially continue the lease for up to 21 more years.</Msg><Username>semiequipmentgodoftheyear</Username><Timestamp>1350931409267</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350931831252-14</Id><Title>Obama’s record: Environmental agenda pushes sweeping attack on air pollution</Title><Msg>Obama’s record: Environmental agenda pushes sweeping attack on air pollution Heather Zichal, deputy assistant to the president for energy and climate change, said the administration’s array of environmental rules go to the “sweet spot of energy security, economic opportunity and reducing pollution,” and fit into a favorite Obama theme during the 2008 campaign. But the business community argues that the regulations are heavy-handed and are hurting the nation’s economic security. “The utility sector, which we consider a part of the manufacturing sector, has been hit extremely hard,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources at the National Association of Manufacturers. Utilities, he said, are shuttering older plants and holding off expanding existing ones out of fear that the EPA will deny them permits. Dumping compromise? Last month, urged on by several business and energy groups, the GOP-controlled House passed the Stop the War on Coal Act, which would reverse several Obama regulations and proposals. It would bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, jettison the stricter fuel standards and give states primary authority over the storage and disposal of coal-combustion waste. But that bill has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Because the administration, faced by partisan polarization, has moved ahead on its own, opportunities for compromise have been lost, some say. Eisenberg notes that during former president Bill Clinton’s second term, the two parties negotiated passage of such significant environmental laws as the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. “The big difference is you had a Congress and an administration a little bit willing to work together on the issues,” he said. Obama has disappointed environmentalists in some cases. In September 2011, he decided to pull back an EPA proposal to limit ozone emissions linked to smog, on the grounds that it would hurt the economy and the government would revisit the issue in 2013 anyway. The business community praised the move, while environmentalists said it was irresponsible. The administration also has been criticized by some environmentalists for not moving to create new wilderness areas, in which development and energy extraction would be barred. Only Congress can designate wilderness but the president can bestow similar protections by creating national monuments through the 1906 Antiquities Act. “It’s not something they’re making a priority,” said Heidi McIntosh, associate director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. She said administration officials have been unwilling to overrule the objections of state and local officials on several key land-use issues. Barring a last-minute development, the current Congress will be the first since 1966 to fail to designate a single wilderness area. Obama has recently declared a few national monuments based on their historic or cultural significance, including Colorado’s Chimney Rock, and has forged private-public partnerships to preserve working landscapes in states such as Florida and Kansas. Obama has spent only a brief amount of time visiting national parks, and the National Park Service budget has declined 6 percent in the past two years. More goals if reelected Obama friends and foes agree on one thing: The president will probably pursue an even more aggressive environmental agenda if reelected. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) said in a statement he would expect Obama to push for more national monument designations in a second term. “From nearly day one,” he said, “the Obama Administration has attempted to impose policies that would block public access to public lands and cause significant economic harm and job loss.” When it comes to putting more public land off limits to development, he added, “Such decisions should not be made by unilateral orders from the president” using a 106-year old law. Environmental leaders expect Obama to try to take tougher action on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants if reelected. Obama hinted as much during a speech to a crowd of Colorado State University students in August. “We’re on track to emit fewer greenhouse gases this year than we have in nearly 20 years,” he said. “You can keep those trends going. That all happened because of you.” washingtonpost</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350931831252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350932133310-15</Id><Title>Group enters natural gas export debate to nudge administration</Title><Msg>Group enters natural gas export debate to nudge administration By Zack Colman - 10/22/12 01:39 PM ET An outside group is entering the debate on whether the Obama administration should allow natural gas exports with a call to restart the regulatory process. The Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG) launched a website and public awareness initiative Monday to provide policymakers and the public with aggregated data on natural gas. The group’s message is that exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) would bring billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs that would outweigh any price increases that might result, Bill Cooper, the group’s president, told The Hill. But that cannot happen until the Obama administration moves forward on several export permit applications, Cooper said. He said the administration should approve licenses to export with all countries, rather than just those that have trade deals with the United States. “We are talking with them and we are meeting with them. We don’t believe that the regulatory process is broken,” Cooper said. “I think the need is to get the regulatory process moving again. The applications have been stalled at the Department of Energy since last November, and there’s a strong desire to see that process restarted.” The administration has proven less willing to green-light permits to nations that aren't trade partners. Only one of the 15 applications from non-trade pact countries has been approved, while the administration has granted 14 of 19 permits for exports to countries with agreements in place. A loose coalition to which CLNG belongs has quietly pressured the administration on the topic in recent months. That informal collection of manufacturers and energy groups organized lawmakers to send letters urging the administration to expedite export approvals. The lawmakers, who were mostly Republican, have cited economic gains from exporting LNG while downplaying the effects it might have on price increases. The Energy Department has said it is waiting on the second and final part of its study on natural gas exports before it proceeds with permitting. The administration delayed releasing that report until after the election, citing complexities of analyzing fragmented global markets. That study is expected to be completed by the end of the year, an Energy official told The Hill in an email. The official said the study is one of many inputs considered in Energy's decision on LNG exports. "Prior to approving a proposal to export natural gas, the Natural Gas Act requires the Energy Department to determine that the proposed export is consistent with the public interest. That public interest determination includes, among other factors, both economic and environmental considerations," the DOE official said. The first part of the Energy Department's report said exports would likely raise natural gas prices in the United States, a comment that some Democrats who oppose exports seized upon. Cooper said that several other analyses show the price increases would be minimal, and that exports could reduce natural gas price volatility. “We are told that the Department of Energy wants to make sure that it gets the study right. It wants it to be right and accurate in all respects,” Cooper said. “And we want it to be accurate in all respects — but it’s taken a very long time.” A group of 20 Democratic lawmakers is using that time to ask the administration for a broader environmental assessment on exporting natural gas. Those lawmakers want Energy to request a more stringent environmental test for approving the permits. They are concerned that unconventional drilling methods that have been linked to land damage and contaminated drinking water would be used to meet a bulk of the new demand from exports. Cooper said current regulations do not require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to evaluate environmental effects with that broad of a scope. FERC must only rule on the environmental impact of the terminal itself, Cooper noted. FERC offered that explanation when it approved Cheniere Energy’s permit to non-free trade countries at its Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana. But Energy said earlier this month that it needs more time to consider a request from the Sierra Club to use the more stringent environmental test. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350932133310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350936720118-16</Id><Title>Who cares about the debate?

It was part of a scheme to steal an election in eastern Arkansas that included absentee ballot fraud and buying votes with money, food and even alcohol. "I guess I always knew all along it was wrong, but I really didn't think it was that big a deal," explained former Democratic state Rep. Hudson Hallum. "I always heard ... that's what everybody did." Hallum and three others have pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit election fraud during the special election that put him in the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2011. A total of nine people have been charged by federal and state authorities in connection with the plan. According to the indictment filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Little Rock, Hallum told co-defendant Phillip Wayne Cater, a West Memphis, Arkansas City Councilman, "We need to use that black limo and buy a couple of cases of some cheap vodka and whiskey to get people to vote." Prosecutors say Carter, along with Hallum's father, Kent Hallum, tried to get a discount from a liquor distributor in Memphis, Tenn., on 100 half-pints of vodka, for $200. In Little Rock, at least one brand of vodka retails for $2 per half-pint plastic bottle, so it does not appear they would have received any savings. "Folk gonna vote for whoever pay them," Carter was quoted as saying. The conspirators did not end up following through with the plan to trade vodka, but did allegedly trade money and food, determining that "$20 to $40 was too much to pay for one vote ... but was acceptable to pay for the votes of multiple members of a household." In addition to offering goods and money in exchange for votes, the indictment alleges that Hallum and his father even opened unsealed absentee ballots -- and the ones that were cast in favor of his opponent, Kim Felker, were "destroyed" so they wouldn't count. Hallum received a lopsided landslide in the absentee ballot count, garnering 394 votes to Felker's 67. "I was horrified," Felker told Fox News about the vodka-for-votes scheme, as she sat on her porch in Crawfordsville, Ark. "This is not a third-world country, this is east Arkansas, and this is something you hear of in another part of the world. ... The people in our district have been duped, really. And we are the ones who are suffering." Court documents detail Hallum's "absentee ballot strategy," which included submitting absentee ballot applications on behalf of voters, tracking when they were mailed, assisting voters in completing the ballots, and in some cases completing the absentee ballots without regard for the voter's choice. The fraud was exposed after Felker received a phone message from someone offering her absentee ballots for her race, which is against the law. She reported the call to authorities. Felker, a retired special education school teacher and farmer's wife, was making her first run for political office at the time. She lost by only eight votes out of 1,772 cast, and told Fox News she would have won the election had it not been stolen from her. "I think my votes were not turned in," Felker said. "I had always been suspicious of that, but I thought maybe it was only a case of several, but I was shocked." Felker said the experience has taught her that those who claim there is no voter fraud in the country should "come to my house and talk to me. There is voter fraud." "The most fundamental rights we enjoy as American citizens include the ability to vote," declared U.S. Attorney Jane Duke, who prosecuted the federal case."Voter fraud schemes ... have the devastating effect of eroding public confidence in elected officials and disenfranchising voters." "The system is broken," charges Arkansas Republican Rep. Bryan King, who is advocating new measures to ensure the integrity of the election process. King has waged a campaign for tougher election laws in Arkansas, including voter ID laws, in an effort to change what he says has been a long-standing culture of voter fraud corruption in his state. He is calling for better monitoring of election administrators, prosecutions of voter fraud allegations and mandatory sentences for those convicted of voter fraud crimes. He also wants the state to establish "a panel of independent judges and prosecutors, because a lot of these prosecutors don't want to prosecute voter fraud because of the political consequences." He said: "What we had in eastern Arkansas, and some other places in Arkansas, is voter fraud had never been prosecuted, no one was looking, no one was watching. ... If we can't put our faith in the election system, then how can we put our faith in the people that were sent up to represent us? People need to have faith in elections, and that they are being administered fairly." Tim Humphries, the Arkansas State Board of Elections legal counsel, said "the system was definitely corrupt over there." "If these people had not been caught, then that certainly impacts the integrity of the election process," he said. Humphries said the Board takes voter fraud allegations seriously and that cases like this "show that we're vigilant here in Arkansas about these sorts of things." After pleading guilty to the federal charges in September, Hallum resigned from office, and along with his three co-defendants is expected to be sentenced before the end of the year. He faces the possibility of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He did not respond to messages from Fox News and his attorney, Glenn Lovett, declined a request for an interview with Hallum. In an interview with Memphis Fox13, WHBQ last month, Hallum defended giving voters food, since the election coincided with a flood in his district, and he said people needed help. He did express regret for other actions, saying, "I took something from them, and that was their trust." "At the time, I absolutely didn't think me going to get somebody something to eat during a disaster, was wrong," he said. But he admitted that, "As we went along, I definitely started figuring out that we were doing some things that were absolutely wrong and, I didn't stop when I should have." Hallum also apologized to his fellow legislators at the Arkansas Capitol, writing them that he accepts responsibility and "took some bad advice that led to some bad decisions on my part ... It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with each of you and our state is a better place for what you have done." Despite his guilty plea and removal from office, Hallum is still on the ballot for November's election -- running against Green Party candidate Fred Smith. He resigned after the deadline to remove his name, but if he wins again, election officials say he will not take office and a special election will likely be held to fill the post. Felker said she has no plans to run again anytime soon. What especially stings, is that when she votes, she is reminded of her father, who served in World War II, and of her uncle, who was a prisoner of war. "When I cast my vote, that's who I think about and when I look at a ballot, that is what I think about, and that is what got me when I found out that my opponent and his father had torn up my votes," she laments. "I would not sell my vote for anything." She has a message for all Americans about voter fraud: "Don't just sit back and take it. If something is not right in our voting system, and it is messing with our democracy, you've got to step up and do something about it, because that's your most basic right, your vote. If that is compromised, then you are going to see democracy disappearing."</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350945789666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 18:43:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350948526288-20</Id><Topic><Title>Wonder if invest and infernal will disappear ?</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350525016176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your delusional behavior is amazing but sad.

MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. — A son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was acting on instinct when he kicked a maternity ward nurse as she tried to stop him from taking his newborn son out of the hospital, a defense lawyer said today. In opening statements at Douglas Kennedy’s harassment and child endangerment trial, attorney Celia Gordon said Kennedy "just wanted to take his baby out for some fresh air" on Jan. 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital. Nurses overreacted abrasively, she said, leading to a scuffle. But prosecutor Amy Puerto said Kennedy had to be stopped because he was violating hospital policy. She said he refused to obey the nurses, one of whom was injured when he "kicked her so hard in the abdomen that she fell to the floor." A second nurse was hurt when Kennedy twisted her arm, Puerto said. Witnesses testified about a flurry of alarms that were set off during the incident. One blared when Kennedy allegedly took a security band off the baby boy. Two hospital-wide alarms — "code purple" and "code pink" — were called in to declare a disorderly situation and a missing baby. Both sides agreed that Kennedy, with his son in his arms, approached the nurses’ station with a request to take the baby outside. Nurse Angela Adamo said she tried to dissuade him because his request "didn’t seem to make much sense to me." She also said the baby, in a hat and blanket, wasn’t appropriately dressed. Kennedy was not persuaded and moved to the elevator and stairwell, where two other nurses tried to block him. Gordon said that when one nurse reached for the baby, Kennedy kicked the nurse instinctively. "He was trying to keep her from taking his baby," she said. She also said the "code pink" was inappropriate because hospital policy indicates it’s for an abduction. Adamo said she never thought that Kennedy would not return with the baby. Puerto said Kennedy did not stop until he encountered a security guard on a stairwell. She alleged he said to the guard, "Do you know who I am?"</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350948633942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:30:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350949518625-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is anti energy and anti middle class</Title><Username>weightbayou</Username><Timestamp>1350930944422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:35:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maxwizard and Wahleee are great examples of the lazy "takers" and/or people who hate the US the way it was founded; hence they are Obama supporters.
