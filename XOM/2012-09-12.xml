Some 4% of the Gulf's oil production and 5% of the region's natural gas output remained offline, according to U.S. regulators, which noted that shut-in production has been somewhat slow to return because of damage to onshore processing facilities. But economists and analysts said that Isaac's impact on the economy is expected to be little more than a blip, especially compared with the havoc wrought by big hurricanes like Katrina and Rita in the last decade. Analysts say oil companies usually take several days to ramp up energy production after evacuations because they need to restaff far-off facilities and check the integrity of well bores, pipeline connections and the safety of the platforms to make sure the storm didn't cause any hidden damage. Kyle Cooper, managing partner at Houston's IAF Energy Advisors, said companies are being more cautious about their U.S. Gulf facilities in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. "I've been told the inspection process is much more rigorous and much longer," he said. The methodical process of bringing production back online hasn't had much impact on energy markets. At the height of the storm, Isaac pushed gasoline prices up between 10 and 15 cents, with the bulk of the impact felt in the U.S. Gulf region, said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. But the storm is likely no longer a factor in markets for refined products like gasoline and heating oil, he said. Gene McGillian, an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy, said refineries were slower to restart than some might have expected. But markets are more concerned now with whether the Federal Reserve will decide to pour more money into the economy through a fresh round of bond-buying, or quantitative easing, than with Isaac's lingering impact. Mr. Lafakis said Isaac didn't cause the same kind of infrastructure damage that cut into economic growth as storms such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, or Hurricane Gustav in 2008. "I think all those storms were more damaging from an economic perspective. Those storms also produced more lasting damage in terms of energy prices and energy production," he said. In all, IHS Global Insight estimates that Isaac is responsible for an estimated 13 million barrels of lost oil production and 28 billion cubic feet of lost gas production—together worth about $1.57 billion. "In terms of real GDP growth this production loss would knock at most 0.16 percentage point off annualized real GDP growth," said IHS economist Gregory Draco. "It's a relatively small impact," he said. Dozens of platforms and processing facilities were damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and remained evacuated for months after the storm. For example, in December of 2005, three months after Rita made landfall, 26.2% of oil production and 19.4% of natural gas production remained shut in. By comparison, all but two of the 596 production platforms operating in the U.S. Gulf and all but one of the 76 rigs there have been restaffed since evacuating before Isaac. While Katrina left an estimated $120 billion in infrastructure damage in its wake, Isaac is so far estimated to have caused about $1.5 to $3 billion in insured losses, with total losses likely about three or four times that amount, Mr. Draco said. One reason for that is that Isaac, which made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane and quickly weakened into a tropical storm, lacked the high wind speeds that caused damage in the past. "It was a fairly large storm in terms of expanse but didn't pack a ton of power like previous hurricanes," RBC Capital Markets analyst Leo Mariani said. The BSEE said shut-in production comes to about 57,439 barrels of oil a day and 213 million cubic feet a day of...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347428379069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 01:39:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347428851604-3</Id><Title>China to Hold Second Shale-Gas Auction Next Month, Ministry Says</Title><Msg>China to Hold Second Shale-Gas Auction Next Month, Ministry Says By Bloomberg News - Sep 10, 2012 1:35 AM MT China will hold its second auction of shale-gas sites next month as it tries to boost exploration and development of the cleaner-burning fuel. The tender on Oct. 25 will comprise 20 blocks in eight regions, the Ministry of Land and Resources said on its website today. Domestic companies and joint ventures controlled by the Chinese partner, who have registered capital of at least 300 million yuan ($47 million) and hold the relevant licenses, will be allowed to participate in the bidding, the ministry said. China, holder of the world’s biggest shale reserves, has yet to produce the unconventional fuel commercially, while output in the U.S. surged fourfold from 2007 to 2010. The Chinese government has pledged to prioritize land approvals, allow tax-free imports of equipment and offer subsidies to explorers to spur the industry’s development. The sites cover a total area of 20,002 square kilometers and are in Chongqing municipality and the provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui and Henan, according to today’s statement. Each participant is allowed to bid for a maximum of two blocks. China aims to produce 6.5 billion cubic meters of shale gas annually by 2015 and between 60 billion and 100 billion by the end of the decade, the National Development and Reform Commission said in March. The country holds 25.08 trillion cubic meters of exploitable reserves of the fuel, according to the land and resources ministry. The U.S. has an estimated 482 trillion cubic feet (13.6 trillion cubic meters) of technically recoverable shale gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration website. Technical Challenge China’s natural-gas consumption will increase fourfold by 2030 to 600 billion cubic meters a year, accounting for 30 percent of the global growth in gas demand, Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said June 6.

They said Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed Tuesday night when he and a group of embassy employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff as the building came under attack by a mob guns and rocket propelled grenades. The three Libyan officials who confirmed the deaths were deputy interior minister for eastern Libya Wanis al-Sharaf; Benghazi security chief Abdel-Basit Haroun; and Benghazi city council and security official Ahmed Bousinia. The State Department said Tuesday that one American was killed in the attack. It has not confirmed the other deaths. The attack on the Benghazi consulate took place as hundreds of protesters in neighboring Egypt scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and tore down and replaced the American flag with a black Islamic banner. The attacks in Benghazi and Cairo were the first such assaults on U.S. diplomatic facilities in either country, at a time when both Libya and Egypt are struggling to overcome the turmoil following the ouster of their longtime authoritarian leaders, Moammar Gadhafi and Hosni Mubarak, in uprisings last year. The protests in both countries were sparked by outrage over a film ridiculing Muhammad produced by an Israeli filmmaker living in California and being promoted by an extreme anti-Muslim Egyptian Christian campaigner in the United States. Excerpts from the film dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube. Stevens, 52, was a career diplomat who spoke Arabic and French and had already served two tours in Libya, including running the office in Benghazi during the revolt against Gadhafi. He was confirmed as ambassador to Libya by the Senate earlier this year. Before Tuesday, five U.S. ambassadors had been killed in the line of duty, the last being Adolph Dubs in Afghanistan in 1979, according to the State Department historian's office.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347451088069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:58:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347451333717-8</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Glorious Record</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347198946078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:55:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My father retired in September 2007, a month before the meltdown of the banking industry.

EIA expects Brent crude oil prices to fall from recent highs over the rest of 2012, averaging $111 per barrel over the last 4 months of 2012 and $103 per barrel in 2013. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot prices rose by a more modest $17 per barrel between June 25 and August 23, as the WTI discount to Brent crude oil widened from $10 per barrel to $22 per barrel. EIA expects WTI spot prices to average $93 per barrel in 2013, with the WTI discount to Brent narrowing to $9 per barrel by the end of the 2013. •Higher crude oil prices, refinery outages, a pipeline disruption, and concerns over Hurricane Isaac's impact on the Gulf Coast, the United States' major refining region, contributed to higher gasoline prices during August. EIA has increased the average regular-gasoline retail price forecast for the third quarter of 2012 to $3.66 per gallon from $3.49 per gallon in last month's Outlook. EIA expects retail gasoline prices to begin declining later this month as the gasoline market recovers and transitions from summer-grade to winter-grade gasoline specifications. Forecast regular gasoline retail prices average $3.58 per gallon over the fourth quarter of 2012 and $3.43 per gallon in 2013. •EIA expects U.S. total crude oil production to average 6.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.7 million bbl/d from last year. Projected U.S. domestic crude oil production increases to 6.8 million bbl/d in 2013, the highest level of production since 1993. •Because of the projected increase in natural gas prices relative to coal, EIA expects the recent trend of substituting coal-fired electricity generation with natural gas generation to slow and likely reverse over the next year. From April through August 2012, average monthly natural gas prices to electric generators increased by 34 percent, while coal prices fell slightly. EIA expects that coal-fired electricity generation will increase by 9 percent in 2013, while natural gas generation will fall by about 10 percent. •EIA expects carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, which fell by 2.3 percent in 2011, to further decline by 2.4 percent in 2012. However, projected emissions increase by 2.8 percent in 2013, as coal regains some of its electric-power-generation market share. •Natural gas working inventories ended August 2012 at an estimated 3.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), about 13 percent above the same time last year. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011, to average $2.65 per MMBtu in 2012 and $3.34 per MMBtu in 2013.

Prices fell to a seven-week low. Farmers will collect 10.727 billion bushels, the smallest crop in six years and down 13 percent from 12.358 billion in 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in its second survey-based estimate for the crop. Last month, the USDA forecast 10.779 billion. The average prediction of 35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 10.420 billion. Supplies of the grain on Aug. 31, 2013, will be greater than analyst estimates. Enlarge image Since mid-June, corn prices have surged 54 percent, reaching a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 on the Chicago Board of Trade. Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg Crop conditions as of Sept. 9 were the worst since 1988, with the harvest about 15 percent complete, the USDA said earlier this week. Since mid-June, corn prices have surged 54 percent, reaching a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 on the Chicago Board of Trade. After the USDA report, futures for December delivery fell 1.4 percent to $7.6675 as of 7:48 a.m., after touching $7.5925, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 24. The larger-than-expected estimate is “a psychological blow to the market,” Randy Mittelstaedt, the director of research for R.J. O’Brien &amp; Associates in Chicago, said before the report. “It’s still a small crop, and that means the market cannot afford to drop prices, or that will stimulate increased demand.” Tight Supplies Smaller supplies of corn may increase costs for ethanol refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) and Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) and meat producers Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) and Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD), which buy the grain for feed. Reduced production also may boost demand for fertilizer from CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF), Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and Agrium Inc. (AGU) Unsold supplies of U.S. corn on Aug. 31, 2013, before next year’s harvest, will total 733 million bushels, compared with 650 million forecast in August and 1.181 billion estimated this year, largely because of larger-than-expected supplies of last year’s crop, the USDA said. Traders surveyed by Bloomberg expected reserves to fall to 596 million bushels, on average. Feed use of last year’s crop will be 4.4 billion bushels, down 150 million from last month’s estimate, because of this year’s early harvest, which is making more grain available earlier and leaving more of the 2011 harvest in storages as the new marketing year begins, the USDA said. The department also lowered its forecast for exports in the current year by 50 million bushels to 1.25 billion. Drought Damage Combined Midwest temperatures and precipitation during June and July were the hottest and driest since 1936, according to Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. About 52 percent of the corn fields in the U.S. were in poor or very poor condition as of Sept. 9, the worst for the date since 1988 when production fell 31 percent from a year earlier, government data show. Yields will average 122.8 bushels per acre, down from 123.4 estimated in August and less than 147.2 bushels last year, the USDA said. That would be the lowest since 1995. About 87.361 million acres will be harvested, unchanged from August and 83.981 million a year earlier. The USDA said the average cash price for corn in the marketing year that began Sept. 1 will be $7.90 a bushel, compared with $8.20 estimated a month ago and $6.25 last year. bloomberg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347460294324</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:31:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347460711253-15</Id><Title>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending September 7, 2012</Title><Msg>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending September 7, 2012 U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 14.3 million barrels per day during the week ending September 7, 287 thousand barrels per day below the previous week’s average.

The state has shown an increase of FFVs by more than 20 percent from last year with greater than 143,000 registered in the state. FFVs can run on ethanol fuel blends up to E85 (85 percent ethanol, 15 percent gasoline). Many drivers are unaware they have an FFV. Most FFVs now have yellow gas caps and/or an FFV logo on the back of the vehicle. Still not sure? Check the U.S. Department of Energy’s website to identify all makes and models of flex fuel vehicles. There are several benefits for FFV drivers: saving money, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and supporting Nebraska’s economy. Several Nebraska fuel stations are selling E85 at 68 cents per gallon under regular unleaded prices. But economic studies have found that ethanol lowers gas prices for everyone – even non-FFV drivers – by extending our gas supply. “FFV drivers have an opportunity to make more fuel choices at the pump,” said Todd Sneller, Nebraska Ethanol Board administrator. “These choices have the additional advantage of lower prices than gasoline. More drivers are realizing the benefits of renewable fuels like ethanol by switching to FFVs.” Tomorrow, FFV drivers in Nebraska can save even more. Two gas stations in Grand Island are offering discounts on ethanol fuels on September 12 from 11-am to 1 pm.

Propel Fuels operates a network of low-carbon fueling stations throughout California and Washington. There are 28 stations so far and more than 200 stations are planned for new and existing markets over the next two years. Propel sells FlexFuel E85, which is made of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gas, while its biodiesel #$%$ blend contains 5 percent biodiesel and 95 percent regular diesel fuel. As part of an opening celebration running today through Friday in the Sacramento region, the Redwood City company is offering area drivers a free fuel promotion. Propel Fuels is offering motorists $10 worth of free E85 FlexFuel or biodiesel. Propel says added the fueling station at the existing stationin response to ongoing demand for renewable fuels by drivers and fleets operators in the Sacramento region. The region, according to the company, has the highest number of renewable fuel pumps in California. “Fleets and families in greater Sacramento have shown us that access to renewable fuels is important to them, so we’re continuing to grow our network of stations here,” Propel CEO Matt Horton said in a news release. “This is an ideal location, conveniently situated near both the freeway network and downtown, where new fueling stations aren’t common.” Horton said the company was excited to work with Mak’s to bring more fuel choices to downtown Sacramento drivers. In the region, Propel also operates co-located fueling locations on Folsom Boulevard and Florin Road and in Citrus Heights, and in Elk Grove, Rocklin, Roseville and Placerville.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347461513707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:51:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347462198627-18</Id><Title>obama should resign as president ! he has weaken america !!!</Title><Msg>................</Msg><Username>savingamerica681</Username><Timestamp>1347462198627</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:03:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347464449841-19</Id><Topic><Title>obama should resign as president ! he has weaken america !!!</Title><Username>savingamerica681</Username><Timestamp>1347462198627</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:03:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He should be jailed for treason.</Msg><Username>raul_10_spain</Username><Timestamp>1347464449841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:40:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347467772305-20</Id><Title>The Religion of Peace</Title><Msg>Proves for the millionth+ time, that is anything but that. "(CBS/AP) LOS ANGELES - A California-based filmmaker went into hiding after a YouTube trailer of his movie attacking Islam's prophet Muhammad sparked angry assaults by ultra-conservative Muslims on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya. The U.S. ambassador to Libya and three American members of his staff were killed. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports from the Pentagon that U.S. officials do not believe Tuesday's killings were the work of the mob. Instead, the officials believe that within that mob were heavily armed militants who were using the demonstration as a cover to get into the U.S. Consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi and then take as much revenge as they could on Americans. Whether the militants were seeking revenge for the film or they were simply trying to kill Americans on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks is still unclear, Martin reports. Speaking by phone Tuesday from an undisclosed location, writer and director Sam Bacile remained defiant, saying Islam is a cancer and that the 56-year-old intended his film to be a provocative political statement condemning the religion. Libyan officials said Wednesday that Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed Tuesday night when he and a group of embassy employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff as the building came under attack by a mob firing machine guns and rocket propelled grenades."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347467772305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347468121721-21</Id><Topic><Title>Libyan officials: U.S. ambassador killed in attack</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347451088069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:58:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Canada closed their Embassy in Canada and in Iran.

Greenpeace Canada says a mass sit-in planned for the front lawn of the B.C. legislature in Victoria on Oct.22 is backed by more than 80 leaders from the business, First Nations, environmental, labour and academic communities across Canada. The group says those supporters include environmentalist David Suzuki, former Canadian UN ambassador Stephen Lewis, Council of Canadians chair Maude Barlow, lawyer Clayton Ruby, author Naomi Klein and economist Mark Jaccard. Barlow says the protest will show that you can’t gut Canada’s environmental laws and try to put a price tag on the B.C. coast without a public response. Environmentalist Tzeporah (Zep-or-ah) Berman says the risk of oil spills from pipelines and tankers is too great and it's time to take a stand to defend the B.C. coast.

Sources have told Reuters the United States is considering an emergency stocks release in a move to help suppress high oil prices, and other members of the International Energy Agency, such as France and Great Britain, could join the move. Some members of the IEA have opposed the release although its head has recently said high oil prices were a cause for concern. The IEA, which represents developed energy consuming countries, made only one mention of "market rumors of an imminent release of U.S. strategic stocks" in its monthly report while painting a supply-demand picture implying such a release would not be necessary. The IEA said it made no significant changes to its global oil demand outlook and forecast it would grow at a steady rate of around 0.8 million barrels per day (bpd) or 0.9 percent in both 2012 and 2013. "This modest growth rate reflects the combined effects of sluggish global economic activity, historically elevated oil prices and global improvements in energy efficiency," it said. It said that August OPEC liquids production growth, led by Nigeria, Angola and Iraq, failed to offset fully unplanned production outages in non‐OPEC countries such as U.S. output hit by a hurricane and North Sea output disruptions due to a strike in Norway and planned maintenances. However, compared to a year ago, global oil production stands 2.0 million bpd higher due to increases from OPEC, which is pumping way above the levels required by the market and therefore contributing to a large stocks build across the world. The IEA said the call on OPEC crude and stock change was projected to rise by 1.3 million bpd in the third quarter of 2012 to 31.1 million bpd due to a seasonal quarter-on‐quarter uptick in demand of 1.4 million bpd. However, a projected recovery in non‐OPEC supplies in the fourth quarter of 2012 is forecast to cut back the ‘call' on OPEC by a substantial 0.5 million bpd to just 30.6 million bpd versus its current output of 31.55 million bpd. TIGHTENING THE SANCTIONS Oil prices have rallied to $117 a barrel in August due to expectations of a new round of monetary easing in the United States and amid tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran's nuclear program. The IEA said Iranian oil exports are estimated to have inched up in August to 1.1 million bpd from below 1 million bpd in July. "China, South Korea, India and others are poised to increase liftings in September. In addition, a cargo was reportedly sold through the private sector after Tehran, in a bid to maintain exports, allowed for the first time sales outside of the state oil company," the IEA said. Increased exports, however, may be temporary, it added as both U.S. and European officials have proposed to tighten sanctions further due to lack of progress in negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program. On the stocks front, OECD industry crude stocks contracted by 16.5 million barrels in July and a preliminary 23.7 million barrels in August on strong refining crude runs. Total industry oil builds of 10.6 million barrels for July were below normal and preliminary data hint at counter‐seasonal draws in August, the IEA added. "Recent demand strength notwithstanding, low expectations of future demand are such that the OECD stock cushion actually looks more comfortable today when measured in days of forward demand than before the latest draws," the IEA added. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347474891280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:34:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347477194341-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Glorious Record</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347198946078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:55:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congratulations to your Father.

CPS teachers work the shortest school day of any city in country, in a district with a 16-to-1 student-teacher ratio and per pupil spending of more than $13,000 a year. These arrangements have yielded a 60% graduation rate, in a district where more than 97% of teachers are rated effective. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's former chief of staff, is pushing to extend the system's school day and put in place meaningful teacher evaluations that, among other things, link ratings to improvements in student achievement. He's offered the Chicago Teachers Union a 16% pay bump over the next four years, at a time of tight budgets and 8% unemployment, if they'll sign on. The CTU has instead opted to strike. In doing so, it has larded its list of grievances with a slew of petty concerns (including complaints about air conditioning and an insistence that teachers from shuttered schools be hired back without regard to job performance). The stakes in all this couldn't be higher: for teacher unions, for Democratic education reformers and for President Obama. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten has been careful to not embrace her Chicago chapter too closely, and to sound statesmanlike in public remarks. The difference couldn't be starker from the incendiary language she used in attacking Gov. Scott Walker during the 2011 battle royale over collective bargaining legislation in Wisconsin. What's different is that this is a bad fight for the teacher unions - most of the public, seeing the facts, will not be on their side - it comes at an awful time, and an ugly defeat could be a crushing blow.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483561890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 16:59:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347483762291-32</Id><Title>Widespread distrust of US extends beyond Middle East</Title><Msg>Obama resetting US foreign policy has really worked Suspicion of America outweighed faith in its good intentions by large margins in the Arab world and Pakistan, and even its heavyweight European ally Germany was more sceptical than trusting, a YouGov survey found. British and French opinion was more positive but still deeply divided. Negative Arab and Pakistani perceptions of America as overweening and untrustworthy clearly pose a daunting foreign policy challenge for the Obama administration. The fact that 78% of Pakistanis questioned by YouGov said they did not trust America to act responsibly underlines Washington's serious lack of soft power in the region as it attempts to extricate itself from Afghanistan. Attitudes towards the US in the Arab world were nearly as negative. Those respondents in the Middle East and north Africa who said they trusted America were outnumbered by more than two to one by those who said they did not, and 39% said they did not trust America at all. The results suggest that Arab antipathy arising from the Iraq invasion and US support for Israel has not been softened by Obama's military withdrawal from Iraq, US support for the Arab spring and the relatively low-profile US role in the Libyan and Syrian conflicts. Perhaps just as worrying for Washington is the lukewarm support among western European allies. More Germans questioned in the YouGov survey voiced misgivings than trust in the US. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of past wariness, French opinion was somewhat warmer: just over half of the French poll respondents trusted America, against 40% who did not. The so-called special relationship between the US and Britain emerged from the survey as distinctly lopsided. There was widespread American affection for its close ally, but the sentiment was only partly requited, reflecting deep British ambivalence about America's powerful role in world affairs. Two-thirds of Americans questioned by YouGov said they trusted Britain to act responsibly, with 15% dissenting. The leading traits Americans attributed to the UK were a respect for human rights and "a sensible voice in the world". More Americans than Britons thought the UK was "a force for good" on the world stage.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483762291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:02:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347483827144-33</Id><Topic><Title>Widespread distrust of US extends beyond Middle East</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483762291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:02:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>British perceptions seem to reflect the resentment of a junior partner in the relationship. Far more Britons than Americans saw the UK as a nation in decline, arguably showing a persistent deficit in national confidence even after the Olympics. When asked to select a word they associated with America, a striking 40% of the British respondents chose "bullying", a greater proportion than in any other country or region covered by the survey. Only 12% thought the US was defined by its respect for human rights. Half of British respondents said they trusted America, and 41% said they did not. There was a plurality in all the countries surveyed that foreign military intervention in Syria would make the situation there worse or have no impact. Opposition to such a move was most pronounced in Pakistan, and it was also prevalent in the Middle East and north Africa, where 40% of respondents said intervention would make matters worse, compared with 33% who said it would make things better. Six per cent said it would make no difference. Among western countries, opposition to armed intervention was most entrenched in Britain, where the balance was 37% in favour and 21% against, with 12% saying it would have no impact. In the US, those for and against were more or less even (20% and 22%), but outnumbered by the 47% who said they simply did not know. Sex, work and morality French attitudes towards women who prioritise their careers over starting a family are a touch kinder than those in the Middle East, but a touch harsher than those in Pakistan, according to the polling. Britons defended it as "a morally acceptable choice" by a 72%-6% margin, and Germans and Americans were also emphatic, but France was far more evenly divided: 30% deemed it acceptable to postpone parenthood in these circumstances, as against 27% who thought the reverse. In Pakistan, by contrast, the support was by a more decisive 42%-27% margin. Only in the Middle East and north Africa did the suggestion run into more opposition than in France, with respondents rejecting it by a margin of 49% to 22%.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483827144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347483903885-34</Id><Topic><Title>Widespread distrust of US extends beyond Middle East</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483762291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:02:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Elsewhere in the survey on questions of gender and sexual morality, opinion breaks down in more predictable ways, with liberalism prevailing in irreligious Europe, conservatism exerting more of a grip in the Muslim world, and the partially devout US occupying an intermediate position. On contraception, pornography and gay marriage the same pattern is found, as indeed it is on abortion, where France was by far the most pro-choice. In one other respect, France was an outlier. A minority of the French said it was always wrong for a married man (49%) or indeed woman (44%) to have an affair, whereas the majority everywhere else that YouGov surveyed said it was always immoral. Democracy v economy The case for democracy is coming perilously close to being lost around the world, the poll reveals. In Pakistan and to a lesser extent across the Middle East and north Africa, respondents told YouGov that they thought a strong economy was more important than a system of government based on democracy. In Pakistan, the prioritising of growth over democracy was emphatic, by 71% to 22%. In a cross-border Middle Eastern sample of the online population – including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya – economic strength trumped democratic governance by 44% to 41%. Perhaps more surprising is the nonchalant attitude towards democracy shown in some of the states that have enjoyed it for longest. Both France and the US were split down the middle on whether the economy or democracy should come first, with a 41%-41% divide in both nations. Britain's enthusiasm for its democracy was a little more emphatic: it was seen as the priority by 46%, against 38% who would put the economy first. Only Germany was resolute in prioritising the political system. By 52% to 35%, German voters told YouGov that democracy had to come first. nydailynews.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483903885</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:05:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347484047517-35</Id><Topic><Title>Widespread distrust of US extends beyond Middle East</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347483762291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:02:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Libyans and Egyptians also obviously impressed with Obama's apologies and denigration of the US.

The list of speakers included management representing three ethanol production companies as well as a representative from an agricultural equipment manufacturer. Jeff Lautt, president and CEO of Poet LLC spoke about the company’s progress in constructing the 20 MMgy cellulosic ethanol plant known as Project Liberty. Though the facility is not yet completed, Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels LLC has already had a positive economic impact in Emmetsburg, Iowa, with a new equipment dealership opening up and custom harvesting businesses sprouting up. It has also already provided revenue to area farmers for biomass harvests, he said. That positive economic impact will spread across the U.S. after the biorefinery is proven out at commercial scale in Emmetsburg, he said. The company plans to expand it to others of its 27 ethanol plants as well as license the technology to other ethanol producers. The RFS is what has helped Poet get where it is today in the cellulosic ethanol world. “In short, the RFS is working. It was intended to spur investment, speed the development of new sources of fuel and it is doing just that,” he said. “It intended to make American farmers the new leaders in energy production, rather than the Middle East. It is doing that.” If the RFS was waived or altered it would send out a negative signal to farmers considering biomass harvest as well as companies and investors looking to get into the renewable energy field. Before breaking ground on its first cellulosic plant Poet and DSM had each invested millions into cellulosic ethanol—and other companies are spending money on their own projects. “We’ve done that trusting that America’s vision of renewable fuel, domestic fuel production would not falter,” he said. “Our nation must remain faithful to the plan for a better energy future. We must maintain the integrity of the renewable fuel standard.” Mark Cooper, director of growth initiatives for New Holland also talked about the importance of maintaining the course on the RFS. The company manufactures agricultural harvesting equipment, including balers to harvest, package and transport next-generation feedstocks for biofuel production. “As you might guess, the industry over the past few years has experienced double digit growth, and a big part of that is the development of a more stable farm economy, attributed to the growth in biofuels and ethanol production,” he said.” So it is very important to New Holland that we maintain the renewable fuel standard as it is, to provide that economic stability for our farm customers.” Other speakers included Rick Schwark, president and CEO of Absolute Energy LLC, Dan Sanders Jr., company manager of Front Range Energy LLC and Tom Buis, CEO of Growth Energy. In addition, while in Washington, D.C., for the event, more than 100 Growth Energy members hit Capitol Hill, speaking to lawmakers about the importance of the RFS. The annual conference also included a keynote address from USDA Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilasck on Sept. 11. Vilsack, a strong advocate of ethanol, remains supportive of the RFS in the midst of the waiver request. ethanolproducer</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347492437452</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:27:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347493852914-39</Id><Title>Frustration high at farm bill rally</Title><Msg>Frustration high at farm bill rally By DAVID ROGERS | 9/12/12 2:49 PM EDT Updated: 9/12/12 4:46 PM EDT Bright sun, Johnny Cash tapes, the proverbial hay bales, and a High Plains stem-winder delivered by Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, exhorting his former House Republican colleagues that it’s 3 a.m. with a storm coming: get off the sidelines, hook up the tractor “and let’s go harvest a farm bill.” And then there were the signs. “Do You Eat? You Need a Farm Bill Now” or “Old MacBoehner Had a Farm Bill, Ei-Ei-O.” It was no match for “tractor-cade” under Jimmy Carter or “Rally for Rural America” in the last years of Bill Clinton. But hundreds of farmers and their lobbyists rallied in front of the Capitol Wednesday in a last, bittersweet attempt to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to take up a farm bill before the November elections. Moran stole the show but was also a reminder that his fellow Kansan, Sen. Pat Roberts, the ranking Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, didn’t come. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) also stayed away, underscoring the increased partisan tensions as the farm stalemate continues. Indeed, since talks at the Republicans’ national convention in Tampa, the fix has seemed in from the House GOP: no action before the election and a push later to postpone debate into the next Congress. “There is no good reason why we didn’t bring this farm bill to the floor,” Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson told the crowd. But as the ranking Democrat on the Ag panel and a veteran of many farm bill fights, Peterson also stung many by gruffly warning that the agriculture movement must exert more grassroots pressure if it is to have real success in Washington. “The groundswell is not out there. It is not happening at the grassroots level,” Peterson said. “This rally is a good starting point but …to change this we need 100 or 200 calls from people in their districts to these members (of Congress).” “I’m here to tell you if you don’t do that we’re not going to get a farm bill,” Peterson said. “It’s that simple. We went through August and we really didn’t see the groundswell of support out there. We’ve got to make this happen. You’ve got to make this happen. It’s got to come from the grassroots.” Pam Johnson, the incoming president of the National Corn Growers Association and a sixth generation Iowa farmer with her husband and sons, was miffed. “That angers me a lot,” she told POLITICO. “It angers me a lot that now the blame is on farmers. Farmers are home harvesting right now. And they’re doing their business. They assume their representatives are here doing their business. “If we ran our business the way they run their business, we’d be out of business.” Nonetheless, for all his rough edges, Peterson, a former House Agriculture Committee chairman, has been one of the most aggressive players in the House or Senate in trying to get a bill through Congress. And the good farm economy — even with this summer’s drought — has taken some pressure off the House GOP to move a bill. What price will be paid politically in November is not yet clear. GOP Reps. Kristi Noem and Rick Berg—both Boehner allies and both under attack in the Dakotas—appeared at the rally: “Washington makes too many excuses. I’m not taking it anymore,” Noem told the crowd. “He’s not providing any leadership at all,” Darin Van Ruden, a 44-year-old third-generation Wisconsin dairy farmer, said of the speaker. From Wyoming County in upstate New York, Pat McCormack described himself as “typically Republican but this year I don’t know which way I am voting at all.” “It frustrates me a lot right now,” the 40-year-old dairy farmer said of the impasse. McCormack is worried about health care reform and the potential costs for him as a small businessman with 10 employees. But Boehner’s handling of the farm bill could drive McCormack back toward Rep. Kathleen Hochul (D-N.Y), who won the seat in an upset last year. “I have a hard time getting over the healthcare. But yes, it would help me with her.” Asked later to explain his absence from the rally, Lucas told POLITICO: “It didn’t seem like the place I should be at this given moment. “Right now I am trying to be an honest catalyst trying to work with all my friends to get us to a consensus point to get something done. My big problem is we’re shifting — if we have not already shifted — from a policy process to a political process and it’s the crazy season with only two-and-a-half more days of legislative time charted in the House before Election Day.” To date Lucas has played the good soldier, trying to work inside his party with leadership. But there are signs that his patience is wearing thin, and the conflict could come to a head soon. At a Monday night GOP whip team meeting, the chairman joined with other farm state Republicans to press for action. And he finds himself having to battle both Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and the No. 2 Republican on the agriculture panel, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, also of Virginia. Both are promoting the strategy of delaying the farm bill until the next Congress. “Bob believes that the key now is to do an extension,” Lucas said of the exchanges in the whip meeting. “I think that he believes the Congress that will be the 113th will be a dramatically different body.” But Lucas is doubtful that reform would be any easier next year. He checked off the list of savings in the farm bill: about $15 billion from commodity subsidies, $6 billion from conservation, $16.5 billion from food stamps. “There is a high probability that it won’t be possible to achieve that kind of a combination in the next session of Congress,” Lucas said. “Because if anyone believes that one side of the other is going to win the United States Senate by a big enough margin to compel more dramatic reforms than that, then I don’t think they are looking at the scorecard.” ...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347493852914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347497509232-40</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>Only oil stock down today.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the spread, which reflects differences in transportation costs, crude oil quality, and production or distribution system operating constraints is expected to drop to about $9 per barrel by the end of 2013. It should narrow further in 2014 as pipeline capacity to deliver WTI crude oil to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) expands. Historically, the Brent-WTI spread ranged from about ± $5 per barrel. However, in early 2011, the startup of the TransCanada Cushing Extension (Keystone Phase 2) pipeline, which allowed greater volumes of Canadian crude oil to be moved into Cushing, caused the price of WTI to decline versus Brent, increasing the spread from around $4 per barrel in early 2011 to almost $30 per barrel by September 2011 (Figures 1 and 2). Because its quality is similar to that of WTI, Brent crude can be substituted for WTI to meet delivery obligations against New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contracts. Prior to 2011, Brent could be economically brought into the United States by tanker and moved by pipeline from the USGC to Cushing, Oklahoma. On average, Brent crude oil traditionally sold at a small discount to WTI, reflecting marine and pipeline transportation costs. With increased crude oil production from U.S. tight oil plays, particularly from the Williston Basin in North Dakota, and the February 2011 start-up of the Keystone Phase 2 pipeline from Steele City, Nebraska to Cushing, crude oil inventories in Cushing began to rise because there were no pipelines to move this new volume of crude, which exceeded the demand from Midwest refiners, from Cushing to Gulf Coast refineries. A few months before the TransCanada pipeline was completed, the Brent-WTI differential started to rise, from an average $2 per barrel in December 2010 to an average $15 per barrel in February 2011. The WTI discount reached a high of about $29 per barrel in September 2011. The reversal of the 150,000-barrel-per-day (bbl/d) Seaway pipeline between Cushing and the Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter of 2011 contributed to a decline in the Brent-WTI differential to an average of $9 per barrel in December 2011. However, by March 2012, as it became clear that the Seaway reversal would be insufficient to clear the bottleneck between Cushing and the USGC, the WTI discount rose back to an average $19 per barrel. Over the last five months the monthly average Brent-WTI differential has ranged from $13 per barrel to $19 per barrel. EIA expects the Brent-WTI crude price differential to contract as new Cushing-to-USGC pipelines are built and existing pipelines expanded. The planned capacity additions should reduce the differential as the increased capacity helps balance crude supply and demand in Cushing, while supplying the Gulf Coast with additional crude. The Enbridge/Enterprise Seaway pipeline is expected to expand its capacity from 150,000 bbl/d to 400,000 bbl/d by early 2013 and then to 850,000 bbl/d by mid-2014. TransCanada's Gulf Coast Pipeline project is expected to add between 700,000 and 830,000 bbl/d of capacity from Cushing to the Gulf Coast in late 2013. The relationship between WTI and Brent appears to have undergone a fundamental change. New pipeline capacity from Cushing to the Gulf Coast will make it unlikely that light sweet crudes will move from the Gulf Coast to Cushing for delivery against WTI futures contracts as in the past. This suggests that the historical WTI premium to Brent in the futures market is unlikely to return. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices increase again The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased less than a penny to $3.85 per gallon, 19 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The largest increase came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the average price is up six cents to $3.70 per gallon. The West Coast price increased a penny to $4.08 per gallon. East of the Rockies, the Gulf Coast and Midwest prices fell to $3.64 per gallon and $3.86 per gallon, respectively, while the East Coast price is $3.83 per gallon, up two cents from last week. The national average diesel fuel price increased half a cent to remain at $4.13 per gallon, 27 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The largest increase came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price increased two and a half cents to $4.24 per gallon. The Midwest and East Coast prices were both up a penny, to $4.08 per gallon and $4.11 per gallon, respectively. On the Gulf Coast, the average price fell half a cent to $4.02 per gallon, while the price on the West Coast is down a tenth of a cent to remain at $4.42 per gallon. Propane stocks show a slight build U.S. propane inventories showed signs of leveling off last week, as total stocks grew by 0.2 million barrels to end at 72.7 million barrels, roughly 33 per cent higher than the same week last year. The Midwest region added the most inventory, growing by 0.3 million barrels, while Gulf Coast stocks fell 0.3 million barrels. The East Coast and Rocky Mountain/West Coast regional inventories were both up 0.1 million barrels. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 6.6 percent of total propane inventories.

The image was projected behind retired Adm. John Nathman and more than a dozen Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans on Sept. 6. The entire image was projected at the beginning and end of the tribute; a portion of the image (the right-most ship) could be seen at some points during the more than five-minute tribute. The Navy Times first reported the mistake Tuesday: “The ships are definitely Russian,” said noted naval author Norman Polmar after reviewing hi-resolution photos from the event. “There’s no question of that in my mind.” Naval experts concluded the background was a photo composite of Russian ships that were overflown by what appear to be U.S. trainer jets. It remains unclear how or why the Democratic Party used what’s believed to be images of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at their convention. A spokesman for the Democratic National Convention Committee was not able to immediately comment Tuesday, saying he had to track down personnel to find out what had happened. Not only are ships clearly outfitted with Russian radar equipment, but they are even flying a Russian naval flag, according to the Times.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347508376826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:52:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
