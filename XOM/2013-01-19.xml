The transition to renewable energy sources is still in its infancy, however, and the state’s solar energy industry participants are looking to add to the momentum. The Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association (COSEIA) on Jan. 16 announced that it will present the outline of its plan to pave “The Path to a Million Solar Roofs” at the Solar Power Colorado conference and trade show at The Westin in Westminister, outside Denver, Feb. 5-6. Photo credit: Namaste Solar US Solar Energy: A Growth Curve Inflection Point? Coloradans are reaping the benefits of collaborative pro solar, wind, clean tech policies, plans and actions that span government, commerce and industry, academia, and civil society. Solar and wind energy installations almost doubled between 2007 and 2011, and Colorado’s become a renewable energy and clean tech hub for manufacturers and participants all along the value chain. That’s driven green job creation, and boosted tax revenues, not to mention near and long-term health and environmental benefits from reducing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions and impacts of energy resource development. “The Metro Denver region alone had about 1,500 companies and 18,000 workers in the cleantech sector in 2011, and achieved a 35% increase in direct employment growth since 2006,” according to one of three initial Clean Energy Economic Development Series reports on the success and benefits of renewable energy development in US states produced by the Environmental Defense Fund and Collaborative Economics. Shooting for a Ten-Fold Increase COSEIA is looking to keep the renewable energy locomotive going with its Million Solar Roofs campaign and 2013 Solar Power Colorado conference. “Solar energy is now a $100 billion global industry. As Colorado pioneers its path to a Million Solar Roofs, we’re excited to bring solar executives and utility leaders together to build partnerships for future growth,” executive director Neal Lurie was quoted in a COSEIA press release. “We are excited to outline our Million Solar Roofs campaign at the conference and to enlist industry leaders to help us flesh out the details to refine the plan for reaching this ambitious goal.” The goal of the campaign, COSEIA elaborates, is to “provide about 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy in Colorado by 2030 through a combination of photovoltaic (PV) electric systems and solar thermal heating and cooling systems.” To do so, COSEIA members and partners aim to “boost public outreach, utility partnerships and public-private collaborations to encourage the growth of solar energy from small arrays on homes to large utility-scale projects, and from community solar gardens to industrial rooftop projects. To reach this goal, solar would supply nearly a fifth of our state’s energy needs.” For more on COSEIA’s Milllion Solar Roofs campaign and its plans to get there, check out this blog post by The Denver Post’s Cathy Proctor. sDOTtt/1yFkz</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358576941018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 01:29:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358577458251-2</Id><Title>FERC Regulatory Change Could Boost Distributed Solar In The US</Title><Msg>FERC Regulatory Change Could Boost Distributed Solar In The US January 18, 2013 Silvio Marcacci Connecting distributed generation solar projects to the electrical grid may have just gotten much faster and cheaper, potentially boosting both the US solar industry and overall grid reliability. Distributed solar installation image via Shutterstock The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) yesterday published a set of regulatory reforms intended to streamline the grid interconnection process for mid-sized solar projects that meet certain technical standards. If approved, the reforms could double the amount of solar qualifying for “fast track” interconnection in the US. FERC’s regulatory reform would update Order Number 2006, issued in 2005. The order established the first set of interconnection procedures for wholesale electricity generation projects under 20 megawatts (MW) in size. The procedures were adopted by many states, but with the solar market’s rapid growth, many aspects of Order 2006 have created red tape to bringing new projects online. Why Do Grid Interconnections Matter? You might be wondering just what an interconnection is, and why it’s so important to solar, so here’s a quick primer. Interconnection standards are the requirements any electricity generator — either customer or utility — must meet in order for the grid operator to approve their connection to plug into transmission lines and sell power onto the system. Plug-in solar panels image via Shutterstock The federal government has jurisdiction over the interconnection process for distributed solar projects where electricity is being sold to a utility on the wholesale market, and the growing volume of proposed solar installations has created a logjam in many areas, threatening many projects. What’s At Stake? To get a sense of what’s at stake for this growing market, consider that PJM Interconnection (America’s largest grid operator) recently stated two-thirds of active projects are under 20MW, and California (America’s largest solar market) has a regulatory mechanism in place to procure 1,000 MW of distributed renewable generation from projects under 20MW. FERC’s proposed reforms would streamline the interconnection process in four ways; •Allow projects requesting interconnections to be given a pre-application report from transmission operators evaluating the proposed installation before a formal request is made. •Increase the threshold for participation in the “fast track” process from 2MW to 5MW, and base eligibility on individual systems and resources. •Revise the supplemental review process for projects that fail to meet fast track requirements. •Provide interconnection requestors the ability to submit written comments on transmission upgrades necessary for their interconnection. Massive Potential For America’s Solar Market Wholesale distributed solar generation projects are an important element to meeting America’s solar potential, because they fall between small rooftop projects and large utility-scale projects. Distributed solar generation can also be located close to demand, have smaller environmental impacts, and can be quickly constructed. “We applaud FERC for recognizing the challenges facing wholesale distributed generation development, which is one of the fastest-growing segments of the solar energy industry,” said Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This important proposed rule has the potential to roughly double the amount of solar generation capacity eligible to be fast-tracked in the US.” sDOTtt/1yFe3</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358577458251</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 01:37:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358597939004-3</Id><Title>Wind Energy Was Top Source Of New U.S. Generating Capacity In 2012</Title><Msg>Wind Energy Was Top Source Of New U.S. Generating Capacity In 2012 by NAW Staff on Thursday 17 January 2013 Renewable energy sources - including wind, solar, geothermal, water and biomass - accounted for 49.1% of all new U.S. electrical generating capacity installed in 2012, for a total of 12.956 GW, according to the latest Energy Infrastructure Update released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. More than a quarter of that new capacity - 3.276 GW - entered operation in December, as wind developers, in particular, scrambled to get their projects online before the would-be production tax credit deadline. Wind energy led the way, with 164 new units totaling 10.689 GW in new generating capacity, followed by solar, with 240 units totaling 1.476 GW; and biomass, with 100 new units totaling 543 MW. Geothermal and water each had 13 new units with installed capacities of 149 MW and 99 MW, respectively. By comparison, new natural-gas generation entering operation totaled 8.746 GW (33.15%), followed by coal, with 4.51 GW (17.09%); nuclear, with 125 MW (0.47%); and oil, with 49 MW (0.19%). New capacity from renewable energy sources in 2012 increased by 51.16% compared to 2011, when those sources added 8.571 GW. In 2011, renewables accounted for 39.33% of all new in-service generation capacity. Renewable energy sources now account for 15.4% of total installed U.S. generating capacity in operation, with wind energy representing 4.97%. “If there were still any lingering doubts about the ability of renewable energy technologies to come online quickly and in amounts sufficient to displace fossil fuels and nuclear power, the 2012 numbers have put those doubts to rest,” says Ken Bossong, executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable energy technologies. “Not only has renewable energy become a major player in the U.S. electrical generation market, but it has also emerged in 2012 as the reigning champion.” nawindpowerDOTcom/e107_plugins/content/contentDOTphp?contentDOT10983#DOTUPqNFoe9KK0</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358597939004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 07:18:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358601166239-4</Id><Title>Wind and solar power get preferential grid access on the basis of their zero fuel and marginal costs</Title><Msg>Wind and solar power get preferential grid access on the basis of their zero fuel and marginal costs power-engDOTcom/news/2012/12/23/german-wind-power-irks-neighboring-grids.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358601166239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 08:12:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358612654323-5</Id><Topic><Title>End of the road for the dollar...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358546428808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:00:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Central banks have two ways of paying for the debt they buy: borrowing from their member banks or printing money. The amount they can borrow from their member banks is limited by how many reserves - short term cash equivalent assets - the banks own. When the banks run out of money to lend to the central bank the central bank has to start printing money to continue buying bonds. When it does that the money supply rises and the value of the money plummets, causing investors to sell bonds forcing interest rates up. The stock market is quite simply insane and its valuation is being driven by the belief that the trade-off of a low interest rate and a purchase of a stock at any value justifies the purchase of a stock at any value. As long as the low interest rate can be maintained it will probably keep rising under that insane logic. However when the dollar begins to fall, people in other countries will sell their stocks to escape losses in the dollar. When that selling hits not only will the stock market decline, but the $ interest rate will also increase, breaking down the low interest rate reason for buying stocks. As of the latest Federal Reserve report $19.39 trillion of US stocks, bonds, and other financial assets were owned by people outside the United States. The way you fit $19.39 trillion in $ asset through a door that can maybe allow $2-$3 trillion backed by value is to change the exchange rate of $/£, $/€, $/¥.... Americans will end up owning their own assets, having exchanged $2-$3 trillion to buy what once was valued at $19.39 trillion. If you multiply 2/19 buy the stock market value you would get some idea of what Wall Street would look like at that point... At some point the US government will figure out how to tax its people enough to pay its bills, and it would be easier with the assets in American hands, and ponzi scheme and fantasy logic it brings being dully destroyed... I think London will be the financial center of the world in such a future... That arrangement does not trouble me in the least.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358612654323</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:24:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358614856209-6</Id><Title>Head Start Towards 2020: California Reduces CO2 Emissions for Third Year in a Row</Title><Msg>Head Start Towards 2020: California Reduces CO2 Emissions for Third Year in a Row By Thomas Schueneman on Jan 16th, 2013. California’s CO2 emissions fell in 2011 for the third straight year, putting the state in a good position for meeting its target of reducing carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, according to the California Air Resources Board (CARP) and as mandated by California AB32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006). Since businesses began reporting data in 2008, emissions have steadily declined from 133,4 million tons to 111million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, shedding a full 22 percent in 2011. Electricity production, once the leading sector for CO2 emissions in the state, made the biggest inroad towards reduction targets by cutting emissions 17.5 million ton between since 2008. Emissions from electricity generation was 34.9 million tons in 2011. Renewables, conservation, carbon market contribute to reduction Analysis from the CARB attributes the reduction in emissions from power generation to conservation and increased renewable energy production. California has one of the most ambitious renewable energy production targets in the US with a goal of 33 percent by 2020 through the California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) Last summer the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) announced that the state was the first in the nation to install 1,000 megawatts of customer-generated solar power. California’s Independent System Operator (ISO) and the CPUC reported that on two occasions during August of last year a record-breaking 1,000 megawatts of solar energy was brought on line at one time, writes Noah Long in the Natural Resource Defense Fund’s Switchboard. That’s enough electricity to power the city of San Francisco or roughly as much power as is generated from two large gas plants. The state’s three largest electricity generators, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, met intermediate RPS targets of 20 percent renewables for the period of 2011-2013 last summer as well. With renewable energy production surging in the state, especially solar, and its carbon trading scheme now fully underway, California has an excellent head start for meeting its emissions reduction and clean energy production goals. Hopefully other states will follow. sDOTtt/1yxRH</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358614856209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 12:00:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358621931572-7</Id><Topic><Title>End of the road for the dollar...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358546428808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:00:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At some point the US government will figure out how to tax its people enough to pay its bills When the money stops flowing to the man in the street......the Blood will start flowing in the streets.

(ENB)’s North Dakota pipeline system has been underused for the past three months as railroads move more oil out of the Bakken shale play, a refining company told U.S. regulators. Enbridge’s plans to expand its pipeline network out of the Bakken won’t stop railroads from taking business, Flint Hills Resources LLC, a unit of Koch Industries Inc., said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “This trend is not temporary,” Flint Hills said. “Rail transportation is becoming more competitive and will continue to take barrels away from the Enbridge North Dakota system.” Railways have emerged as a competitor to pipelines as production from shale fields has grown faster than pipeline space. While rail is typically more expensive than pipelines, railcars can reach markets that pipelines don’t, yielding higher prices for producers. Flint Hills, which operates the 330,000-barrel-a-day Pine Bend refinery in Minnesota, filed the document with FERC as part of its opposition to a surcharge on the North Dakota system proposed by Enbridge. “We are seeing reduced volumes on our North Dakota system as some producers seek alternate transportation options to take advantage of favorable oil pricing in other markets,” Graham White, an Enbridge spokesman in Calgary, said in an e-mail. Volumes will increase as new regional market access projects are finished later this year, he said. North Dakota produced 747,000 barrels a day in October, up 50 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. An estimated 52 percent of the crude moved by rail, versus 38 percent by pipeline, according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Top Shipper The largest oil rail-car shipper in the Bakken is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) The company plans to boost its crude-oil shipments by 40 percent to 700,000 barrels a day by the end of this year, Chief Executive Matt Rose told Bloomberg in a phone interview this month. Enbridge’s North Dakota system can transport 210,000 barrels a day from Minot to Clearbrook, Minnesota, according to the company’s website. The company plans to expand its Bakken pipelines and to connect them with other parts of the Enbridge network, including construction of a new 225,000 barrel-a-day pipeline called “Sandpiper” that will link with Enbridge’s Mainline system in Superior, Wisconsin. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-16/enbridge-losing-bakken-oil-business-to-railroads-refiner-says.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358623687125</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:28:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358624201583-9</Id><Title>Italy and Spain set new records for solar generation</Title><Msg>Italy and Spain set new records for solar generation By Giles Parkinson on 16 January 2013 Italy and Spain have set new records for solar generation in the past year, according to provisional data from their respective grid operators, with Italy trumping Germany as the most solar-powered industrialized nation in the world. According to provisional data from the Italian transmission grid operator TERNA, and reported by Cleantechnica, solar energy provided 5.6 per cent of Italy’s electricity demand in 2012. That makes it the most most solar-powered industrialized nation in the world, surpassing even Germany’s 4.8 per cent share of solar in the electricity supply. According to the data quoted by Cleantechnia, Italian solar (almost entirely solar PV, produced a total of 18.3 TWh of energy last year, an increase of an 72 per cent compared to 2011. Preliminary data suggests that the solar capacity in Italy rose to 17GW over roughly 470,000 systems in 2012, suggesting its share of production could rise to as much as 7 per cent in 2013. And while incentives such as feed in tariffs have been slashed, and in some cases ended for new installation, the emergence of “grid parity” continues to drive the market, particularly in the commercial sector, where Australia’s CBD Energy, for instance, has a pipeline of 25MW of projects and recently sold a 5MW installation to a UK institution. Though official numbers are not yet available, preliminary numbers suggest that the installed solar capacity in Italy rose to approximately 17 GW spread over roughly 470,000 systems in 2012. In Spain, the share of solar also rose to 4 per cent, according to preliminary data from its grid operator Red Electrica de Espana, and quoted by Recharge News. While this is lower than either Italy or Germany, the significant statistic from Spain is that one per cent of its production was met by large scale solar thermal power station, including those with storage and 24-hour delivery such as Gemasolar. Around 3 per cent of its energy production came from solar PV. Spain’s total contribution from renewable energy sources was 32 per cent in 2012, down from 33 per cent in 2011 and 35 per cent in 2010 because of low reservoir levels at hydroelectric dams, Recharge reported. Renewables contributed 23 per cent of total production in Germany and 11.7 per cent in the UK, according to Recharge. Spain has also been hit by changes to tariffs, including a retroactive cut to PV feed-in tariffs, and a new levy on electricity generation from wind energy, which contributed 18 per cent of Spain’s electricity generation. Because of the decline in hydro power, coal power rose from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, causing overall power emissions to rise 11 per cent. reneweconomyDOTcomDOTau/2013/italy-and-spain-set-new-records-for-solar-generation-54684</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358624201583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:36:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358626175551-10</Id><Topic><Title>End of the road for the dollar...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358546428808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:00:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Our corrupt and lying leaders know this, that's why the middle class will be taxed to death in the near future." You can rest assured, too, that if the U.S. government tried to increase taxes on the Wall Street crowd, or their equivalents in Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, they would board a jet to Heathrow, toss their passport in the trash at the US Embassy in London, and continue their business as before, but as British residents and then as British citizens... The same would apply for many corporate executives of multinational corporations. So the tax burden will necessarily have to fall on those who lack skills or means to relocate.

"It would be in Texas' best economic interest to actually interconnect very strongly with other interconnects -- either the Western or Eastern Interconnect," Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in a press briefing following an open FERC meeting. "This is something that, over time, through recognition on the part of both the interconnects on this side and Texas on their side, that we'll see mutual benefits be so high that it will be compelling for Texas to strongly interconnect with the rest of the United States," Wellinghoff said. Inside FERC is the authoritative guide to gas pipeline regulation and the agency's role in reshaping the electric utility industry and has covered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for more than 25 years. He noted that Texas has a high amount of wind, geothermal and other renewable generation resources that will produce more than the state can use at certain times, Wellinghoff said in restating an opinion he first voiced in 2009 at an American Wind Energy Association conference in Chicago. Noting that Texas is considering whether to establish an energy capacity market, Wellinghoff said that consideration reflects the fact that "they need new capacity internally. If they had access to capacity externally, that might provide them some help as well," Wellinghoff said. When asked if there would be a way for Texas to increase its transmission interconnections to the rest of the US without becoming subject to FERC transmission rate jurisdiction, Wellinghoff said this is possible if Congress specifically passed a law to do so. "The economic benefits are so compelling that someday someone is going to start moving toward that solution," he said. plattsDOTcom/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6040054</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358645208399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:26:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358645649915-14</Id><Topic><Title>US FERC chairman urges Texas to increase grid connections to rest of US</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358645208399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:26:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ERCOT frets over growing demand By Emily Pickrell Updated 8:14 pm, Thursday, January 10, 2013 Texas will add $8.9 billion in electric transmission projects by the end of 2017, but the new capacity won't be enough to meet growing demand, the state's main grid operator reported Thursday. Besides demand, other factors contributing to congestion will include maintenance that takes lines out of service and outages during line construction, according to the report by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “When you get busy transmission lines, it's the same thing as roads clogged with traffic,” said Robbie Searcy, a spokeswoman for the council. “It's going to limit how much power you can carry through the existing transmission facilities.” Increased traffic also may raise electricity costs as demand brings less-efficient resources online. The agency said in the report that one of its statewide priorities will be to address growing power demands tied to booming oil and gas production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Eagle Ford Shale in the south. The expected completion this year of increased transmission capacity to Dallas-Fort Worth from West Texas, where wind generation has mushroomed in recent years, should help ease some congestion. But these lines may not be enough to handle the more than 20,000 megawatts of new wind power under review for construction, the report warns. “As we see the gap between available generation and peak electric demand become tighter over time, it becomes increasingly important to deliver new power resources to the grid as quickly, reliably and cost-effectively as possible,” council CEO Trip Doggett said in a written statement. Separately from its report warning of future strains on the system, the Electric Reliability Council reported that demand decreased slightly last year compared to 2011, which had the hottest Texas summer on record. Electricity use dropped 2.7 percent year-over-year, from 334,000 to 324,859 gigawatt-hours. But 2012 demand was 3 percent higher than in 2010, the council said. A gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts. One megawatt can power 500 to 700 average homes under normal conditions in Texas, or about 200 on the hottest days, the state's main grid operator estimates. mysanantonioDOTcom/business/article/ERCOT-frets-over-growing-demand-4184252DOTphp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358645649915</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:34:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646591936-15</Id><Topic><Title>US FERC chairman urges Texas to increase grid connections to rest of US</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358645208399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:26:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DOE To Prepare Environmental Impact Statement For Clean Energy Transmission Line by SI Staff on Friday 21 December 2012 comments: 0 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed Plains &amp; Eastern Clean Line Transmission Project, which would help integrate more renewable energy onto the electric grid. The project would include an approximately 700-mile, overhead, high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission line and associated facilities, and would have the capacity to deliver approximately 3.5 GW of power - primarily from renewable energy generation facilities in the Oklahoma Panhandle region - to load-serving entities in the mid-South and the Southeast via an interconnection with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The proposed project would traverse Oklahoma and Arkansas and deliver power to western Tennessee. Prior to making a determination of whether to participate in the proposed project, the DOE must fully evaluate it, in consultation with the Southwestern Power Administration, including reviewing the potential environmental impacts pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Clean Line first identified several potential route corridors within a broad study area and subsequently refined the corridors using input from federal and state agencies, municipalities, nongovernmental organizations and thousands of stakeholders. Clean Line recently held 20 open-house meetings in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee to seek additional input on potential routes. Using this information, Clean Line identified and submitted to the DOE several potential routes. The DOE will analyze the potential routes, along with a range of reasonable alternatives proposed in scoping comments, and may expand or refine the range of alternatives based on those comments. Maps identifying the potential routes currently proposed for analysis are available here. solarindustrymagDOTcom/e107_plugins/content/contentDOTphp?contentDOT11787</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358646591936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:49:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
