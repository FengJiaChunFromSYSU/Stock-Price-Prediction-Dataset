Climate activists including 350# org founder Bill McKibben and Sierra Club head Michael Brune announced the White House demonstration Tuesday shortly after Obama was projected the victor over Mitt Romney.  “In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, as the warmest year in American history draws to a close, as the disastrous drought lingers on in the Midwest, everyone is looking for ways to make a real difference in the fight to slow climate change,” an open letter announcing the event states. “We’d like to ask you to come once more to Washington, to resume the battle to stop the Keystone XL Pipeline, mid-afternoon on Nov. 18th,” states the letter from activists including author Naomi Klein, Nebraska anti-Keystone advocate Jane Kleeb, outspoken NASA climate scientist James Hansen and others. The White House in late 2011 delayed a decision on whether to permit TransCanada Corp.’s project to bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. The decision followed demonstrations — including a large number of civil disobedience arrests in August 2011 — by environmentalists who bitterly oppose the project. The administration plans to make a decision as soon as next year on Keystone. Republicans, business groups and a number of unions support the project. Romney and other Republicans, on the stump, had sought to transform Obama’s indecision on Keystone into a political liability by touting jobs the project would create and energy supplies from a friendly neighbor. But environmentalists say the project will worsen global warming. The open letter says it would negate the climate benefits of tougher auto mileage standards that the Obama administration has put in place. “Keystone XL is still a crazy idea, a giant straw into the second biggest pool of carbon. Even if it doesn’t spill, it would add 900,000 barrels of oil worth of carbon each day to the earth’s atmosphere, or as much as the new auto efficiency regulations would save,” it states. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352269417675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 01:23:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352270703597-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama blamed video</Title><Username>carrieanneamerica</Username><Timestamp>1352239811198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 17:10:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When all the facts are not known, you speak in generalities, as did the Pres.

Progress reports on the status of electricity and liquid fuels supply are available in the U.S. Department of Energy's Hurricane Sandy Situation Reports. •EIA projects that the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price will average $89 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2012, about $4 per barrel lower than in last month's Outlook, while the Brent crude oil price is expected to average about $1 per barrel less than in last month's forecast at about $110 per barrel over the same period. The projected WTI discount to Brent crude oil, which averaged $22 per barrel in October 2012, falls to an average of $11 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2013. WTI crude oil is forecasted to average $88 per barrel in 2013, while the Brent crude oil forecast remains unchanged at $103 per barrel. •U.S. regular gasoline retail prices began October 2012 at $3.80 per gallon and fell to $3.49 per gallon on November 5, 2012. Projected U.S. regular gasoline retail prices average $3.56 per gallon during the fourth quarter of 2012. Hurricane Sandy, however, has contributed to higher wholesale gasoline prices on the East Coast, and the recovery schedule for affected refineries, pipelines, and distribution terminals contributes to uncertainty over the near-term price outlook. EIA expects regular gasoline retail prices, which averaged $3.53 per gallon in 2011, to average $3.64 per gallon in 2012 and $3.44 per gallon in 2013. •EIA expects U.S. total crude oil production to average 6.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.7 million bbl/d from last year. Projected U.S. domestic crude oil production increases to 6.8 million bbl/d in 2013, the highest level of production since 1993. •Working natural gas inventories are at a record high level. As of October 26, 2012, working inventories totaled 3,908 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is 56 Bcf greater than the previous record high of 3,852 Bcf on November 18, 2011. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011, to average $2.77 per MMBtu in 2012 and $3.49 per MMBtu in 2013. eia ------------------------- Weekly U.S. Fuel Ethanol/Livestock Feed Production ethanolrfa ------------------------- e85prices ------------------------- gasbuddy ------------------------- biodiesel retail locations biodiesel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352306861404</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:47:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352306862121-43</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulations Liberals</Title><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1352303979206</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:59:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are too ignorant to understand obama's devious intentions.

The decrease in retail gasoline prices has been a result of easing crude oil prices, narrowing gasoline crack spreads (the difference between wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices), and the switch in production from higher-cost summer-grade gasoline to lower-cost winter-grade gasoline. In its November Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a continuing decline in retail gasoline prices through the end of this year (Figure 1). However, the effects of Hurricane Sandy on petroleum supply chains in the Northeast have added to the uncertainty of the forecast. One driver behind the recent decrease in gasoline prices has been a decrease in the price of crude oil. After reaching a third-quarter high of more than $117 per barrel on September 14, the spot price of Brent crude oil fell to average $112 per barrel for the month of October. EIA expects global oil markets to continue to loosen as projected global liquid fuels production outpaces consumption by 0.1 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, leading to global inventory builds. Much of the effect of this easing is already reflected in prices. EIA expects Brent spot prices to remain relatively flat through the end of the fourth quarter, averaging about $109 per barrel in both November and December. In addition to lower crude oil prices, gasoline crack spreads have contracted significantly over the past month, helping to lower prices at the pump. In September, the differential between the refiners' wholesale price for motor gasoline and Brent hit a multiyear monthly average high of 54 cents per gallon, partially driven by the tight gasoline market on the West Coast (PADD 5) and refinery problems in Mexico and Venezuela. However, the switch in production from summer-grade gasoline to lower-cost winter-grade gasoline and an easing demand for refined products as consumption came off its third-quarter peak contributed to falling gasoline crack spreads. The crack spread fell 17 cents per gallon from September to an average of 37 cents per gallon in October. With crude oil prices expected to be relatively flat through the end of this year, a further decline in the crack spread is expected to be the main driver of lower retail gasoline prices. EIA expects the gasoline crack spread to average 18 cents per gallon in November and 15 cents per gallon in December. Because a significant portion of easing in the gasoline market is due to falling crack spreads on the West Coast, that region is expected to see the largest decrease in retail prices from their October levels, with prices projected to fall 56 cents per gallon to $3.68 per gallon in December. The pace at which petroleum markets in the Northeast normalize in the wake of Hurricane Sandy injects additional uncertainty into this month's forecast. Price effects from the storm have been thus far fairly muted. Several regulatory waivers have been issued to ease supply constraints in the Northeast, helping mitigate some price pressures. However, the situation continues to develop and gasoline inventories in the Northeast are currently at relatively low levels; if supply disruptions linger longer than current expectations, it could push prices in the region higher. Currently, EIA is projecting prices on the East Coast (PADD 1) to average $3.43 per gallon in December, a decrease of 30 cents per gallon from October, which is slightly less than the 33-cent-per-gallon decline projected for the U.S. average price. The Market Prices and Uncertainty Report that accompanies the November STEO provides a quantitative analysis of gasoline price uncertainty based on the price structure of futures and options traded for New York Harbor Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB). Gasoline and diesel fuel prices continue to drop The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline decreased eight cents last week to $3.49 per gallon, seven cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The average U.S. retail price has decreased 36 cents per gallon over the last four weeks. Prices again fell in all regions of the nation, with the largest decrease on the West Coast, where the average price is down 15 cents to $3.90 per gallon. The last time the West Coast price was below $4 per gallon was the week of August 13, 2012. The Midwest and Gulf Coast prices were both down seven cents, to $3.32 per gallon and $3.27 per gallon, respectively. The East Coast price is now $3.53 per gallon, a decrease of six cents from last week, and the Rocky Mountain price decreased four cents to $3.61 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price decreased two cents to $4.01 per gallon, 12 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The diesel price fell in all regions of the Nation for the third consecutive week, with the largest decrease coming in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price fell four cents to $4.16 per gallon. The West Coast price is down three cents to $4.15 per gallon. East of the Rockies, the Midwest and Gulf Coast are now $3.96 per gallon and $3.92 per gallon, respectively, a decrease of 2.5 cents from last week in both regions. On the East Coast, the price fell a fraction of a penny to $4.03 per gallon. Propane inventories dip further Total U.S. inventories of propane fell 0.3 million barrels last week to end at 73.6 million barrels, 13.4 million barrels (22 percent) higher than a year ago. The majority of the decline occurred in the East Coast region, which fell by 0.3 million barrels. Elsewhere, Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks were down 0.1 million barrels, Gulf Coast stocks dipped slightly and Midwest regional inventories showed a slight build. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.7 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating oil prices decrease, propane prices increase Residential heating oil prices decreased during the period ending November 5, 2012. The average residential heating oil price fell by a penny last week to $3.98 per gallon, 11 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices decreased by nearly 12 cents per gallon last week to land at $3.11 per gallon, nine cents per gallon less than last year at this time. The average residential propane price rose two cents last week to $2.40 per gallon, 41 cents per gallon lower than the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices decreased by nearly two cents to $1.00 per gallon for the week ending November 5, 2012, 47 cents per gallon lower than the November 7, 2011 price. eia</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352314905379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:01:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352315484201-54</Id><Title>Enjoy the next 4 yrs with Obama THEN the next 8 yrs. with HILLARY !!!!</Title><Msg>GOP WILL NOT CHANGE PERIOD !!!!</Msg><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1352315484201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:11:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352316077948-55</Id><Topic><Title>Enjoy the next 4 yrs with Obama THEN the next 8 yrs. with HILLARY !!!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1352315484201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:11:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rove and limbo have the gop hostage--keep doing the same thing the same way and hope for a different result--utter nonsense but fox news crowd lines up and believes--moth to a flame hannity--oreilly--palin--kraphammer--coulter--just as big of collection of idiots as you can find</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352316077948</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:21:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352316213610-56</Id><Title>DOWN GOES TEA BAGGIES ALLEN WEST JOE WALSH etc. !!

The president likely will take far longer to decide whether the United States should export its newfound shale oil and gas bounty. Opponents warn that exports would spike fuel costs for consumers and undermine a domestic manufacturing recovery. Obama slowed regulation of fossil fuels during his campaign against Republican challenger Mitt Romney, who ran on expanding drilling and letting states dominate oil and gas regulation. Obama streamlined regulation on drilling for natural gas from shale and delayed finalizing rules on mercury emissions from power plants. The light touch may have helped the president gain support from voters anxious about jobs in gas-rich Pennsylvania and Ohio. Now that the election is over, regulations proposed and studies undertaken by Obama's agencies will return to the forefront. And environmental groups are increasingly lobbying centrist Democrats like Obama to tighten regulations on hydraulic fracturing - known as fracking - as efforts on pushing Congress to fight climate change wither. "It's going to be a rougher second term for oil and gas given the way the environmental debate is going and the diminished incentive Obama has to protect oil and gas after his last election is behind him," said Robert McNally, a former White House energy adviser during the George W. Bush administration who now heads the Rapidan Group, a consulting firm. EXPORT DELAYS The Obama administration this year also delayed decisions on exporting vast new natural gas finds to countries besides those with which it has free-trade agreements. Skeptics on exports including Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat in line to head the chamber's energy committee, have raised concerns about diverting fuel that could be used to support domestic manufacturing and raising prices in the process. The Energy Department this year delayed a study on the economic effects of gas exports. But even if the study eventually projects limited effects, allowing the shipments would be a difficult decision for any president. "Are we about supporting domestic industries, about the energy industry or about just low energy prices for American citizens?" said Sarah Emerson, the head of Energy Security Analysis Inc, in Boston, describing the difficulties of the decision. "I'm not convinced either Obama or Romney would do anything on any of this." The lack of clarity means the United States faces huge questions about what fuels it will use to power its future as it inches toward greater energy independence. During Obama's first four years, the United States unseated Russia as the world's top natural gas producer, and oil output last month hit a 17-year high. The gains were because of advances in fracking and horizontal drilling - not policy decisions. Until decisions on exports are made, it could make investors hesitant to sink money into renewable energy or even know which fossil fuel to favor. "We have regulations for safety and clean air, but we've never really had a concerted, careful and coherent energy policy, and I don't really see us developing one," Emerson said. SLIM CHANCE FOR CLIMATE TAX With many scientists blaming climate change for fueling stronger weather events like the deadly Superstorm Sandy, calls have risen for Congress to pass a carbon tax. But such efforts face an uphill battle. Many Republicans would reject supporting anything resembling a tax. It could put an unfair burden on the poor and raise fuel prices for consumers weary of two years of high gasoline costs. "Sounds great, but there are many issues with a carbon tax," said Whitney Stanco, an energy policy analyst at the Washington Research Group, in a note to clients. Washington Research advises institutional investors. Until the U.S. economy significantly recovers, major climate legislation is unlikely to pass, especially after Republicans retained control of the House of Representatives. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency will likely move forward on regulating greenhouse gases, Stanco said. CLUES TO FUTURE GAS RULES The EPA is expected to release soon two fracking reports that could provide clues to how the Obama administration will treat natural gas drilling over the next four years. The agency is expected to finalize a report issued late last year that said fracking polluted water supplies in Wyoming. The agency has insisted Wyoming's unique geological formations make it difficult, if not impossible, to assume that the sort of pollution that happened there could occur in other regions of the country. But if the final report confirms the initial results, gas investors may watch headlines closer than the details, Rapidan's McNally said. In addition, the EPA is set to release initial results of a study on fracking's effects on groundwater supplies. And the Department of the Interior is expected to finalize draft rules later this year on fracking on public lands. The administration hopes these could be used as a template for rules on state lands. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352317593180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:46:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352318174482-63</Id><Title>Energy winners and losers: A snapshot</Title><Msg>Energy winners and losers: A snapshot By Ben Geman - 11/07/12 02:37 AM ET The energy policy fallout from Tuesday’s elections will take time to shake out. But here’s a quick snapshot of a few winners and losers now that President Obama has been reelected, Democrats retained the Senate and Republicans kept the House. WINNERS: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) He’s likely to take the chairmanship of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with the Democrats keeping control of the Senate. Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the current chairman, is retiring. Wind energy tax credits At the very least, the tax credits are looking better than they would have if Mitt Romney had won the White House. Romney opposed an extension of incentives slated to expire at year’s end, while Obama wants Congress to extend them — and Romney’s loss could free up some Republicans to back an extension without bucking an incoming president from their own party. Climate change The topic, in the background for much of the 2012 White House race, is at least back on the political radar screen. Superstorm Sandy prompted attention to links between climate change and extreme weather. Obama, in his victory speech Tuesday night, spoke of the need to ensure children live in a country that “isn’t threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.” Romney’s loss and the Democrats’ retention of the Senate likely mean that the Obama administration’s greenhouse gas regulations won’t get scuttled. But the future of climate policy remains highly uncertain. A big global warming bill remains dead on Capitol Hill, and Obama’s second-term administrative agenda has not yet been fleshed out. LOSERS: The Keystone XL oil pipeline The proposed pipeline to bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries was sure to be approved under Romney, who had pledged a green light on “day one.” Obama hasn’t made a final decision on Keystone. But he’s now free of election-season attacks over the project from pro-pipeline Republicans and industry groups. Green groups are putting renewed pressure on Obama to nix it. The project is far from dead, but a Romney win would have meant near-certain approval. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) Murkowski was in line for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee gavel if Republicans had taken the Senate. Inhofe would have become chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, had Republicans seized the majority in the upper chamber. Instead, Inhofe must depart as ranking member of the panel due to term limits. Oil companies They’re doing fine as U.S. production booms. But Obama now has four more years to continue efforts to repeal tax incentives that he has long targeted. The industry also opposes upcoming regulations on the drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," as well as several other administration policies. In addition, industry groups want more access to public lands and waters, such as areas off the East Coast that Romney had pledged to make available. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352318174482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:56:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352319252510-64</Id><Title>JUST WONDERING</Title><Msg>With Obama's victory, will he blame this on Bush too!</Msg><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1352319252510</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:14:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352319905106-65</Id><Topic><Title>Today's Obituaries:</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352318750824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:05:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yea some of the cockroaches from this board have run sure enough 4 years of nonsense about energy--healthcare--taxes--gun control--ETC run lil cockroach--the truth is like a bright light--run back into your trailer</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352319905106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:25:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352320214795-66</Id><Topic><Title>JUST WONDERING</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1352319252510</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:14:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he should--couldn't have done it without the "w" and his credit card phony wars--free prescription drugcare--taxcuts for the wealthy--aig--the list is endless sure woulda been easier if Rmoney had the w out on the trail bragging about his 8 years of glory Obama gets Clinton out on the trail--next time get the W out there--he should be the posterboy for all things gop</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352320214795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:30:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352320250543-67</Id><Topic><Title>Crazy XOM Rumors!</Title><Username>gracenixon234</Username><Timestamp>1350909421264</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 08:37:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'll keep track of the target prices and inform you of the winner after the new year.</Msg><Username>ellenmccall960</Username><Timestamp>1352320250543</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:30:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352329551401-68</Id><Topic><Title>Goodbye Keystone Pipeline</Title><Username>jksouth</Username><Timestamp>1352265959782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 00:25:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good thing the Pipe Line isn't going through the North West, they wont have to clean up all the leaks this neerdowell company cause.</Msg><Username>besttoyou1</Username><Timestamp>1352329551401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 18:05:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352329723586-69</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Mandate - Repeal Reaganomics</Title><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352302392379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:33:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually your # 2 is what Reagen did, the largest peace time tax increase in American history !</Msg><Username>besttoyou1</Username><Timestamp>1352329723586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 18:08:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352334268467-70</Id><Topic><Title>Today's Obituaries:</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352318750824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:05:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow - congratulations!
