On Monday night, the smaller, lower-key Environmental and Clean Energy Inaugural Ball unfolded at Georgetown’s Sequoia restaurant. But what it lacked in Will.i.am, the smaller of the two environmental balls made up for in yes-we-can. President Obama’s green energy team all said, in essence, that Obama really, really meant it when he vowed to make climate a major focus in Monday’s inaugural speech. “We need to make sure that we tackle climate change in these next four years and this president is going to do it,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, wearing his traditional ten-gallon hat and bolo tie, told the crowd Monday night. “We are going to lift our game in the interlocking challenges of climate change and energy,” said John Holdren, who is Obama’s top science adviser. “Energy and climate policy are going to be a top priority,” said Heather Zichal, the top White House energy and climate aide. The event was hosted and sponsored by an array of renewable energy industry organizations, companies and advocates. It was probably on the wonkier side of the inaugural ball spectrum. A sample of the applause lines: “On public lands alone, we have already permitted 10,400 megawatts of renewable energy power in the United States,” said Salazar, who is stepping down in March. “We are going to achieve the President’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020,” Zichal told the crowd. Other speakers included Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, and Energy Secretary Steven Chu. Obama administration officials have touted several first-term policies like substantially toughening auto mileage standards, but the administration also faced setbacks on climate change and energy, including the collapse of emissions-capping legislation in Congress. The president has yet to fill in the details of his second-term climate agenda. Climate advocates are pushing for several executive actions. Among them: Environmental Protection Agency's establishment of carbon emissions standards for existing power plants. “I think it is quite likely that we will see that,” Holdren, the science adviser, told The Hill. Zichal, asked after her remarks when Obama would provide specifics on his second-term climate plans, declined to tip the White House’s hand. “I am not going to get in front of my boss on this one,” Zichal told The Hill Monday night. “I think you will, in due time, see a really aggressive agenda on the energy and climate initiative in line with what the president talked about today. “I think you will hear more detail about what [Obama] wants to do in the State of the Union [speech],” Salazar told reporters. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/278429-obamas-green-team-he-really-meant-it</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358836505945</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 01:35:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358849602640-2</Id><Topic><Title>"I think the Republican party is in difficulty." -- Colin Powell</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1358818241921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 20:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>powell is a #$%$ POS.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1358849602640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 05:13:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358849650706-3</Id><Topic><Title>HELLO OLD AMERICA THE NEW AMERICA IS HERE GET USE TO IT !!!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1358787828927</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 12:03:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pra pra wahlee is a #$%$ POS loser.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1358849650706</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 05:14:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358861020415-4</Id><Topic><Title>Fantastic Advancement for Exxon Mobil Corporation . **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>golub.gregory</Username><Timestamp>1358855693110</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:54:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>moving</Msg><Username>andrewhancock39</Username><Timestamp>1358861020415</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 08:23:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358863844064-5</Id><Title>German income taxes now lower than American taxes...</Title><Msg>The marginal rate is 50.5% in Germany.

The US budget must be balanced and the only way to balance it is to increase US taxes much higher. Capital gains, dividends, income taxes, and US corporate income taxes are going to have to increase. It won't happen for a couple of years but it will happen. When they are increased the after-tax return and corporate profits will decline and the stock market will plummet. At one time in the past the US had much higher tax rates, but it also had much lower stock values and higher pre-tax dividend rate. The stock market is a forecasting mechanism and looks ahead. The alternative of running trillion dollar deficits forever to sustain the ponzi scheme stock values with more and more borrowed money is not going to work. At some point international investors will tire of buying US debt, forcing the dollar interest rates up, and the US government to balance its budget.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358866241158</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:50:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358867851838-8</Id><Topic><Title>60 degrees in New Jersey today (January).</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1358111833183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 16:17:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hottest Year in Human History!

US Federal income taxes are 39.6%. Already you are over 50% without even counting the Obamacare taxes. A place like New York City has Federal, State, and city taxes, and now Obamacare taxes. Between them you are near 55% depending on your investments. And no the VAT does not generate more revenue for Germany than income taxes. The ratio is about 4:3 income taxes to VAT taxes. You do not pay VAT either unless you buy something. America has sales taxes although not at 19%. You will pay higher property taxes just about everywhere in America as well relative to Germany. German citizens get free university, something that Americans could easily spend $200,000-$300,000 on. US schools are poor and to replicate the German Gymansium would require private school which is probably another $150,000 or so per child. Health care expenses are much higher in America. Those inferior American government services, and the cost to compensate for them, should be deducted from American after-tax income to compare to a place like Germany. Germans pay high fuel taxes but Germans do not use or require as much fuel, as the German government has made intelligent investments in transportation, something America has not done... And most importantly: The US budget is not balanced so you are living on borrowed time. American taxes will be going up and you will get nothing for it...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358871044519</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 11:10:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358872689383-13</Id><Title>Sixty Dayz Til Announcement!!!!</Title><Msg>The Div may reach 75 per Q.

Photograph: Damir Sagolj/AFP/Getty Images The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon says his top hopes for 2013 are to reach a new agreement on climate change and to urgently end the increasingly deadly and divisive war in Syria. The UN chief told the Associated Press that he's also hoping for progress in getting the global economy humming again, restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, promoting political solutions in Mali, Congo and the Central African Republic, and providing energy, food and water to all people.' Ban laid out this ambitious wishlist in an interview before heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, saying he plans to take "the uncommon opportunity" of being with 2,500 government, business and civil society leaders in the Swiss ski resort to exchange frank views on these issues. "The world is now experiencing unprecedented challenges," Ban said. "Climate change is fast happening – much, much faster than one would have expected," he said. "Climate and ecosystems are under growing strain." Ban spoke before President Barack Obama, in his inaugural address Monday, put a similar emphasis on tackling climate change in his second term. Two-decade-old UN climate talks have so-far failed in their goal of reducing the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that a vast majority of scientists says are warming the planet. In December, a UN climate conference in Doha, Qatar, agreed to extend the Kyoto protocol, a treaty that limits the greenhouse gas output of some rich countries, and affirmed a previous decision to adopt a new global climate pact by 2015. "I will do my best to mobilise the political will and resources so that the member states can agree to a new legally binding global agreement on climate change," Ban said. Ban urged progress in getting nations and people to use the world's limited resources without waste and in ways to ensure their replacement, so that all people will have enough to eat and drink and there will be electricity for their homes – and have energy to spare to promote economic growth. "We have to have sustainable development," he said. "That's our number one priority together with climate change." Momentum for fighting climate change has stalled amid recessions, financial meltdown and government debt crises of the past five years. "At the same time, we need to see some economic dynamism," Ban said. "The world is still suffering, struggling to overcome its economic crisis." The forum at Davos, opening Wednesday, focuses this year on how to ensure a more sturdy economic recovery that can withstand the kind of shocks the past few years have wrought – and includes closed-door panels on many of the things worrying Ban. Among the world leaders he may rub elbows with at Davos are Bill Gates, Christine Lagarde, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Jacob Zuma. guardianDOTcoDOTuk/environment/2013/jan/22/ban-ki-moon-climate-agreement</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358879226432</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:27:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358879677717-19</Id><Title>Supreme Court won't hear challenge to EPA rulemaking on sulfur dioxide</Title><Msg>Supreme Court won't hear challenge to EPA rulemaking on sulfur dioxide The Associated Press January 22, 2013 WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court won't hear a challenge to a tough new clean air requirement limiting sulfur dioxide emissions.

(AP) — Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman approved a new route for the Keystone XL oil pipeline on Tuesday that avoids the state's environmentally sensitive Sandhills region. Heineman sent a letter to President Barack Obama confirming that he would allow the controversial, Canada-to-Texas pipeline to proceed through his state. The project has faced some of its strongest resistance in Nebraska from a coalition of landowners and environmental groups who say it would contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, a massive groundwater supply. Canadian pipeline developer TransCanada and some workers' unions say the project is safe and will create thousands of jobs. The original route would have run the pipeline through a region of erodible, grass-covered sand dunes. The new route skirts that area, although the pipeline's most vocal critics remain firmly opposed to it as well. "Governor Heineman just performed one of the biggest flip-flops that we've in Nebraska political history," said Jane Kleeb, executive director of the group Bold Nebraska. Heineman said previously that he would oppose any pipeline route through the Sandhills region.

Netherlands-based grid operator Tennet said Wednesday that Mitsubishi will take a 49 percent stake in the (EURO)2.9 billion high-voltage cables linking four offshore farms to the German grid. The four plants have a total production capacity of 2.8 gigawatts, more than two average nuclear reactors. Linking the wind farms, some of which are more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) offshore, to electrical grids is costly. Tennet needs to invest a total of (EURO)5.8 billion to connect ten offshore wind farms, and has been struggling to finance the grid expansion. Germany is phasing out nuclear power by 2022 in favor of renewable energies instead, and offshore wind is expected to become one of the main energy sources. huffingtonpostDOTcom/huff-wires/20130116/eu-germany-energy/?utm_hp_ref=homepage&amp;ir=homepage</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358882811192</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:26:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358884058552-29</Id><Topic><Title>Black on brown crime record shattered</Title><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1358879926324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:38:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Just think John McCain" IF john mcsame could "think" he never would have even associated with sarah palin he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory now he is old/bitter at everything except himself way past any usefulness in any capacity -- just used for the gop block the USA from advance strategy --all politics/no principles sad just sad</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1358884058552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:47:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358884075786-30</Id><Topic><Title>German income taxes now lower than American taxes...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358863844064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:10:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Forced savings and personal spending mandates applicable to wages and salaries up to : Rentenversicherung - Pension insurance up to a maximum of 11,300 euros yearly and lesser mounts for the following: Arbeitslosenversicherung - Unemployment insurance, Krankenversicherung - Health insurance Pflegeversicherung - Nursing care insurance What those are is spending mandates imposed by government.

The bill, H.R. 267, would require that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigate capping the licensing timeline at two years for certain hydropower projects. Democratic and Republican committee leaders praised the bill during a Wednesday markup. “The first five bills before us today show that we can work together on a shared priority,” Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said of the package of bills the committee considered, which included the hydropower measure. Ranking member Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) added that the bill “produces a balanced, bipartisan approach.” The bill, co-sponsored by Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), is based on a version that passed the full House unanimously in July. The Senate did not move its iteration out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the committee’s ranking member, said the bill fell by the wayside during the final weeks of the 112th Congress. But the item could get more attention with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) at the helm of the committee, as he represents a state awash in potential hydropower. Supporters of the House bill say the licensing changes are necessary. They contend the process is open-ended, with projects waiting in the pipeline for several years. The permitting timetable in the House bill would apply to projects at non-powered dams. Construction of a hydropower-based energy storage technology known as closed-loop pumped storage also would benefit from the cap. The National Hydropower Association (NHA) said that expediting licensing at the nation’s nearly 80,000 non-powered dams could add about 60,000 megawatts of hydropower by 2025. “The National Hydropower Association is very pleased with the speed at which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act. It’s a common sense, bipartisan piece of legislation that will allow hydropower to contribute more to our nation’s energy needs and economic growth,” NHA Executive Director Linda Church Ciocci said in a Tuesday statement. Renewable-energy advocates are getting behind the bill because it could facilitate more closed-loop pump storage. That technology would store energy from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar, that utilities could dispense throughout the day. The bill also would exempt “conduit” projects not specifically designed to produce power — such as canals, aqueducts and tunnels — from federal licensing procedures. It also would raise the licensing exclusion threshold for small hydropower projects to 10,000 kilowatts, up from 5,000 kilowatts. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/278529-house-energy-committee-passes-hydropower-bill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358885816474</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 15:16:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358885851460-37</Id><Topic><Title>Fantastic Advancement for Exxon Mobil Corporation . **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>golub.gregory</Username><Timestamp>1358855693110</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:54:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SCAM VIRUS REPORTED TO YAHOO !</Msg><Username>alphonite</Username><Timestamp>1358885851460</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 15:17:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358885982146-38</Id><Topic><Title>Fantastic Advancement for Exxon Mobil Corporation . **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>golub.gregory</Username><Timestamp>1358855693110</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:54:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SCAM VIRUS REPORTED TO YAHOO !</Msg><Username>alphonite</Username><Timestamp>1358885982146</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 15:19:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358890917991-39</Id><Title>The flawed Roman way...</Title><Msg>The Romans were an arrogant people with commitments far in excess of their own society's resources or political institutions. The looked on the entire world outside their land as "barbarian," and their "historians" and literary and political class wrote reams of nonsense about foreign peoples about which they knew almost nothing. Take for instance the Germans who they believed they could conquer, and, when that failed, whom they arrogantly believed they could ignore. They deluded themselves into believing that a society concentrated on agriculture, mining, and other craft and industrial pursuits was no threat to them. The extremely traditional and single minded culture to their North - and indeed a quite democratic culture when it came to deciding on war and peace - they looked upon as inferior to their own land of artists, poets, and lawyers, libertines, and politicians. The Romans celebrated homosexuality, bath pursuits, games, and made a national sport of cultural decadence while their neighbors to the north carried on with their more "rude" "uncivilized" activities... The Romans eventually were forced to exchange gold and a ever debased currency for the products of the lands to their North as well as to their East... The Romans eventually were annihilated, both on the battlefield and more importantly from within their decaying urban centers; their culture was smashed to pieces and fell. It simply became impossible for them them to tax enough for them to sustain their and Imperial military. Eventually it become sensible for areas that were Roman to renounce their Roman allegiance and assume the culture of others - that is assume the superior culture to their North. Only the Wall of Constantinople, built to protect a dying civilization from collapse, prevented their culture from being expunged altogether. It still survives in part, inspiring many of the failed governmental structures of Catholic Europe and Southern Europe today. What survives of its records and legal traditions and nostalgia about its "Senate" and "Assemblies" and Imperial decadence was preserved there, as well as items of curiosity recorded by Monks. In the land that gave birth to Luther, Hegel, and Protestant rationalism - Germany - the yoke of Rome was driven out in a titanic religious struggle. What remained of the failed Roman institutions, institutions which were incorporated into the Catholic Church, was annihilated as completely as the times would allow. England, the Netherlands, and other countries of the North followed the German lead... Other countries were inspired by a rather dubious 18th century fad to look up things Roman as admirable and worthy of copy... Idiotic geometric and very Roman institutions and names were lifted out of the past and set to battle against ancient Germanic ideas of governance, ideas that had long since found a home in England. Through the incorporation of foreign peoples of decidedly Roman cultures today- mostly Mexican but not exclusively- the threat to good sustainable governance is magnified many times over for such wayward lands... The rot and cancer is quite advanced now. Hopefully it can be stopped, but prospects are not hopeful for such an end.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358890917991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 16:41:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358899395433-40</Id><Title>New highs for oil by summer., WIT soon over $100/barrel.</Title><Msg>Nice climb upwards.</Msg><Username>yainvestor2</Username><Timestamp>1358899395433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 19:03:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358906750404-41</Id><Topic><Title>New highs for oil by summer., WIT soon over $100/barrel.</Title><Username>yainvestor2</Username><Timestamp>1358899395433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 19:03:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure as heck beat the yell out of Board Bashers</Msg><Username>dai_gul_dai</Username><Timestamp>1358906750404</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:05:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358908420007-42</Id><Topic><Title>The flawed Roman way...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358890917991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 16:41:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing garbage.

The fact that they were conquered, and from a point of immense advantage, proves the vast extend of their inherent inferiority. Fact: Roman failure as an agriculture and industrial society is easily verifiable. The contrast to the industrial urban culture of Germanic civilization, where cities were manufacturing centers rather than parasitic administrative centers, is recorded in the Industrial History of England (and Europe), Usher, 1923 – a professor of history and economics at Cornell University. The idea that the “middle ages” was a backward period is quite simply rubbish. What was backward was the parasitic culture that was destroyed. Technological Histories such as the History of Technology, McNeil, prove the statement too… Fact: Constantinople was built to buttress the Roman civilization after Rome itself become untenable, and Rome’s legal and cultural past was preserved by Emperor Justinian. He also tried to re-conquer the old Roman Empire from the Germans, and to this day Southern Italy, which he succeeding in retaking, has been backward. Northern Italy, which was conquered and held by the Germans, is the industrial and economic core of Italy to this day. The culture division of Northern and Southern Italians goes back that far and has powerful consequences. The dichotomy is well explained by Pollard. It is similar to the dichotomy between the Paris Basin and Belgium which were conquered by the Germans too. France is not called Frankreich – “Empire of the Franks” for nothing. The Franks are Germanic of course. Their Catholicism is not very Roman, and indeed the French Catholics set up competing anti-Roman, Avignon Papacy for many years. Fact: The Protestant Reformation is an historical fact, and the wars of religion in the 16-17th century are a fact. The dichotomy between Protestant rationalism and Roman Catholic superstition and institutions is well covered by Max Weber, a preeminent world renowned social historian. Hegel’s work on rational thinking does much to lay the ground work for Weber too… Fact: The 18th century interest in Roman ideas of governance by some Paris salon types, in turn copied by some American intellectuals, is a fact too. Rome's People’s Assembly of the Plebs? –US House of Representatives -- at odds with an elected Senate of Patricians… That arrangement is not Germanic and it is not English. It did not work in Rome and its failure led to the rise of the Emperors –Imperial “President Presidency” would be a good translation. Eventually they just got tired of the Senate and ignored it…What about slavery institutionalized in a founding document by slave holding “patricians.” It's hard to tell whose idea that might be, Cato or some French read American. The only thing they left out was righting America’s founding documents in Latin. Roman Eagle? That is not English. What about the fasces… It’s in the US Congress and Oval Office. The Nazi Eagle is of course Roman too. Austria was Roman Catholic, and Hitler was an Austrian by birth and temperament. Mussolini fancied himself a Roman Emperor...Fasces is the root of fascism…There’s Southern Europe again, reflecting its Romanism. Fact: The 19th century religious revival in the Northern United States, running concurrent with the Kulturkampf in Germany, and which culminated in the Progressive movement on both sides of the Atlantic, was strongly anti-Catholic, and anti-Roman to the core. The objective of the American Progressives was to expunge Romanism from American immigrants using the power of the state as Germany was doing. They passed immigrant laws after World War I designed specifically to stop the Catholic immigration from Southern Europe. Shall we find the name of the law? Progressive also was named that for a reason – as in Progress away from an inferior model... Fact: Mexicans are Roman Catholic. They are not Protestant and have no tradition of Germanic WASP governance at all. Progressives would have been abhorred. Now they have helped elect a President. Obama puts on a good show, and does much lying and promising, but in the end the $1 trillion dollar deficit and utter failure to even govern as a real Progressive will have consequences… You are quite simply a fool and a joke. I have noted this observation before, and it is worth repeating again…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358913525168</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 22:58:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
