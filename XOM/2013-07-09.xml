Also facing the budget knife would be certain Department of Interior and Corps of Engineers projects. The $30 billion bill was passed by committee last week on a party-line vote and is likely to reach the House floor on Tuesday. It contains billion of dollars less than 2013's enacted levels, as well as the Senate's version for 2014 and recommendations from President Barack Obama's budget. "The bill would leave U.S. competitiveness at risk in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass," the White House said in a statement. "If the President were presented with H.R. 2609, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill." Feeling the brunt of cuts would be the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The bill calls for a $2 billion, or a 73 percent cut, in funding from the White House's proposal, to $746 million. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds advanced energy projects, would be cut by 87 percent from the president's budget request. The administration had threatened to veto all of the House Appropriations bills because they are written to levels that assume the sequester stays in place and would impose big cuts on most domestic agencies, taking aim at Democratic spending priorities. reuters</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373348446056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 01:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373374059670-3</Id><Topic><Title>Yankeedom USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369925701757</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 10:55:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sold United Kingdom 5 Year Government Bonds at 1.39% ytm, gain in price +0.24% War on Fossil Fuels Allocations (%): German Real Estate {urban upper/middle class, large city}: 78.5% United Kingdom t-bills: 12.5% German t-bills: 9.0%</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373374059670</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 08:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373375500571-4</Id><Title>Obama picks renewables advocate as Navy energy chief</Title><Msg>Obama picks renewables advocate as Navy energy chief Zack Colman - 07/09/13 08:52 AM ET President Obama tapped a renewable energy advocate as the Navy's new energy chief. Obama on Tuesday nominated Vice Adm. Dennis V. McGinn (Ret.) as the Navy's assistant secretary for energy, installations, and environment. McGinn comes over from the American Council on Renewable Energy, where he was president and chief executive. The selection signals a continued commitment to green energy within the armed forces, an effort that's irked some Republicans who argue such initiatives are too pricey. The Navy plans to get half its energy fron non-traditional sources by 2020. The White House has promoted the Navy's transition to biofuels to power its fleet, and the Navy is also working toward getting 1 gigawatt of power from renewable sources, among other goals. Some of those goals, however, have triggered GOP criticism. They say that renewable energy programs are too expensive in an age of budget sequestration that threatens to chop $500 billion from the Pentagon in the next decade. The Navy and Defense Department have said transitioning to renewable energy enhances security, keeps spending disassociated from volatile oil prices and reduces the effects of climate change, which the Pentagon has called a national security issue. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373375500571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:11:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373376479994-5</Id><Title>Oil industry kicks off Keystone XL campaign</Title><Msg>Oil industry kicks off Keystone XL campaign July 9, 2013 at 7:10 am by Jennifer A. Dlouhy The oil industry’s top lobbying group is launching an ad campaign aimed at convincing the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. With TV commercials as well as print and online advertisements, the American Petroleum Institute is touting bipartisan support for the controversial pipeline that would ferry oil sands crude from Alberta to Gulf Coast refineries. One TV spot, for example, highlights politicians’ and business leaders’ previous comments endorsing the pipeline. “Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL. Warren Buffett too,” the ad says. “So do 82 percent of Americans, and The Wall Street, the Washington Post, USA Today.” The ad comes as the State Department vets whether the border-crossing pipeline is in the “national interest.” It currently is reviewing about 1.2 million public comments in response to its March conclusion that the project was unlikely to dramatically boost demand for Canada’s oil sands. Environmentalists dispute that conclusion and say the pipeline would help ensure a market for bitumen harvested from Alberta’s oil sands through energy-intensive techniques that give it a higher carbon price tag than conventional crudes. Some landowners in the pipeline’s path also say they worry that spills of diluted bitumen carried by Keystone XL could taint drinking water supplies. But the API and other pipeline backers say the diluted bitumen that Keystone XL would transport is no more carbon-intensive than the oil it would displace. Keystone XL is a chance for the U.S. to strengthen ties with a North American ally and import less Venezuelan crude. The explosive derailment of a train carrying crude to a refinery on Canada’s east coast on Saturday has reignited a debate over the best way to move oil across North America and underscored the risks of all forms of transport.

In a new note, AllianceBernstein’s Bob Brackett argues US oil production is now at an inflection point: halfway through the year, growth has ground to a halt: With EIA weekly production data through July 3rd, we are halfway through the year and production is up 282,000 KBOPD (thousand barrels of oil per day), or 564 KBOPD annualized. This number is below previous 800 KBOPD of growth (2012 v 2011) (Exhibit 9) and 1,000 KBOPD of growth (Dec-2012 v Dec-2011).

Dlouhy Houston Chronicle A deadly crude oil train disaster in Canada has brought renewed scrutiny to the growing use of rail to carry oil – including hundreds of thousands of barrels in Texas – and prompted worries that the higher volume will mean more accidents. Though rail proponents say moving crude by train is safe, federal regulators and others say that pipelines are safer, a stance that has played a role in the debate over the planned Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Texas coast. And regardless of the relative safety of the two transportation modes, the mere fact that more crude trains are on the rails increases the possibility of accidents like the one Saturday in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. At least 13 people died and dozens were injured as a portion of the town was flattened by exploding carloads of oil when a train derailed there. Disaster: Death toll grows in Canada oil train accident The train was moving oil east from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota to a refinery in Canada, the Associated Press reported. Parties to the political debate over transport were muted in their response to Saturday’s tragedy. The oil industry lobbying group American Petroleum Institute declined to comment and a representative from the Natural Resources Defense Council did not respond to phone calls. Rail car loads soar The Sierra Club environmental group expressed wishes for the safety of residents and responders in Lac-Mégantic, and said the accident “strengthens our resolve to move beyond fossil fuels so communities in Canada, the U.S. and around the world are no longer threatened by industrial disaster, toxic pollution and climate disruption.” Energy companies are moving more oil by rail because trains can serve markets that don’t have pipelines, said Jackie Forrest, senior director of North American oil market research for IHS.
