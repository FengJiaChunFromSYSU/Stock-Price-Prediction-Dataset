A new analysis of government data compiled by Green Energy Markets finds Australia on track to not only hit 22% renewables by 2020, but reach an unprecedented 51% of all electricity by 2050. Two major factors are empowering this paradigm shift: rapid growth of solar energy and the gradual phase-out of oil and brown coal – the two most carbon-intense energy resources. Where’d All This Green Power Come From? Since past is prologue, let’s examine how this green transformation began. Australia’s 20% Renewable Energy Target (RET), roughly 60,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of power, or equal to reducing every resident’s carbon footprint by one-third, was established in the Australian Labor Party’s 2007 election platform. 45,000GWh of new capacity was required to meet this target, considering the country’s projected 2020 electricity generation requirement of 300,000GWh and existing renewables capacity of 15,000GWh as of 1997. Australian electricity generation by type image via Green Energy Market Electricity retailers and other large-scale emitters are required to produce certificates demonstrating progress against a set liability level of renewable generation. In January 2011, the RET was divided into two parts: an uncapped scheme for small-scale renewable projects like rooftop solar, and a utility-scale target of 41,000GWh. Slow Start, Fast Finish So far, progress toward the RET has been modest, despite billions of pending clean energy investments. Government figures show that in 2012-2013, 13% (34,000GWh) of the country’s total electricity came from renewable generation, with 60% coming from coal, 24% coming from natural gas, and 2% from oil. But renewables are poised to quickly expand, cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/05/30/australia-approaches-22-renewables-by-2020-51-by-2050/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369977272709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 01:14:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369978689377-2</Id><Topic><Title>XOM to Buy IOC for 8 Billion</Title><Username>janinesor</Username><Timestamp>1369954350343</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 18:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If accurate just maybe you should change your sentiment to strong buy.

I recently said, "Our idiotic Fed has not been borrowing from banks to pump up the bond market. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other private institutions, thus increasing the monetary base. This is distinguished from the more usual policy of buying or selling government bonds in order to keep market interest rates at a specified target value. Expansionary monetary policy typically involves the central bank buying short-term government bonds in order to lower short-term market interest rates." And you said, "WRONG Federal Reserve Flow of funds release z.1 7 March 2013 P. 76, lines {32-45} liabilities of the Federal Reserve monetary authority; line 32 depository institution reserves: Q4 2012 $1.49 trillion up from $20.8 billion in 2007. That items is liability of the Federal Reserve, and asset of the banks they borrowed the money from. By definition it is a loan. What they did with the money is listed under assets: pump US government and mortgage prices buy buying with the $1.5 trillion they borrowed. Lose all your money I don't care. I will enjoy watching your countries tribulations too. You are quite simply a joke.… " Why did you bother to reply if you don't care about my opinions?

This deterioration is worsening despite record bond purchases by Bernanke's Fed, purchases that are meant to lower long term $ interest rates. The reason the rate is rising despite Bernanke's efforts is simple: people lack faith in the US government's ability to manage its finances. It is remarkable that any faith exists at this point, considering the total inability of the US government to balance its budget at any time since it went off the Gold Standard. Indeed it went off the Gold Standard precisely because it could not balance its budget (for political reasons), and could not back its debt in gold any longer - in fact it defaulted on its debt when it stopped paying it in gold. The UK faces a budget challenge but nothing compared to the US. The UK has a socialized medicine which keeps costs down and rates to healthcare providers can easily be controlled by Parliament. Plus the UK has no Constitution to impede it. It could use wealth taxes to balance its budget if it needed to, and suspend many liberties the UK people now enjoy to maintain order. Germany's budget is now balanced, and Germany faces no challenge from health costs due to a well managed health system. Germany has the ability to levy wealth taxes too, allowing it to leverage the assets of the entire nation against its liabilities at will. Productivity is rising on an endless arc due to a superior educational system and now the power of super-computers pushing forward Quantum theoretical technologies. Funding pensions with rising productivity is easy. .... The US had better reform itself quickly. Its position as military Master of the world rests on its credit rating.

The 12-nation oil cartel’s decision on keeping the status quo on production of 30 million barrels a day was expected. The price for internationally traded benchmark oil is over $100 barrels a day, level most OPEC countries are happy with. That’s not the case for OPEC’s customers. With Europe fighting a stubborn economic downturn and recovery weak in many other parts of the globe, most governments consider oil pricey, as do consumers at the gas pump. But OPEC Secretary General Abdullah Al-Badry said much of the end price was due to add-ons beyond producers’ control. ‘“You fill your tank with cost of oil plus taxes,” he told reporters. ‘‘If governments want to…. do something to the price, they should reduce their taxes.” In a post-meeting statement, the ministers suggested they could hold an emergency meeting on reducing output should market prices fall substantially. Analysts, however, said such a sharp drop in the markets was unlikely in the short run, despite generally tepid global economic growth. ‘‘Geopolitical tensions are holding the price of oil high,” said John Hall of Alfa Energy, alluding to turmoil in Syria and tensions over the nuclear program of OPEC member Iran. ‘‘OPEC doesn’t have to act; the market is acting for it.” Beyond prices and output, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries faces more complex issues. The rise in shale oil production in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, has an impact on OPEC as the country remains a main market for OPEC. Shale oil, which is extracted from rocks using heat, helped lift the U.S.’s total output to a daily 7.4 million fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/31/opec-keeps-oil-target-same-puts-off-tougher-actions/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370025130647</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:32:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370025593399-24</Id><Title>Sessions: EPA nominee Gina McCarthy is 'stonewalling'</Title><Msg>Ramsey Cox - 05/31/13 10:36 AM ET Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said he still couldn’t support President Obama’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because she is “stonewalling.” “The job of EPA administrator has the potential to impact the life of every American in both positive and negative ways — and so I believe she has to be as forthcoming as possible in answering questions,” Sessions said Thursday. “To date, she has not provided responsive answers to many of the requests submitted by our ranking member, Sen. [David] Vitter (R-La.), or many of my questions.” Sessions serves on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee where Republicans walked out of Gina McCarthy's nomination hearing in order to delay her confirmation vote. Her nomination was advanced last Thursday on a 10-8 party-line vote. “I believe she is a good person and her assurance that EPA would become more responsive under her management has been encouraging,” Sessions said. “However, neither Ms. McCarthy nor the agency she would like to lead has been responsive to many of the reasonable requests of Senators tasked with advising and consenting to this nomination.” Democrats accused Republicans of using another stall tactic to delay Obama’s nominee by submitting more than 1,000 questions for McCarthy to answer before the confirmation hearing. Sessions said he submitted questions on wasted funds and climate change assertions but McCarthy did not adequately answer them. “She has persisted in EPA’s stonewalling of my request for information about taxpayer funds wasted on an unnecessary reconsideration of the ozone standard — a request I have waited almost two years to be answered,” Sessions said. “In addition, she did not answer my questions about EPA’s sue and settle tactics, and she has refused to provide EPA’s analysis concerning the president’s faulty thehillDOTcom/blogs/floor-action/senate/302711-sessions-epa-nominee-gina-mccarthy-is-stonewalling</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370025593399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:39:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370026555929-25</Id><Title>First grant recipients named under DOD advanced biofuels program</Title><Msg>Anna Simet | May 28, 2013 The U.S. Department of Defense has issued three contracts totaling $16 million for biofuel plants intended to help power fighter jets and destroyers by 2016, as part of the Defense Production Act’s Advanced Drop-In Biofuels Production Project. The DPA Project is focused on creating public-private partnerships that will provide incentives for private-sector investment in cost competitive, advanced biofuels production capability, while establishing one or more complete domestic value chains capable of producing drop-in replacement biofuels. This includes feedstock production and logistics, product blending and transportation, as well as the design, retrofit/construction, operation, validation, and qualification of domestic, commercial-scale, integrated biorefineries. The selected projects will involve the design, construction and/or retrofit, and operation of a domestic commercial-scale integrated biofuels production enterprise (IBPE) that meets a nominal target of at least 10 MMgy per year of biofuel production capacity, according to the DOD. IBPEs will be capable of producing drop-in liquid transportation fuels targeted for military operational use, and must be approved and certified MILSPEC JP-5, JP-8 and/or F-76 equivalents by the time the facility becomes operational. Award winners are Golf, Ill.-based Emerald Biofuels LLC, Natures BioReserve LLC in South Sioux City, Neb., and Fulcrum Brighton Biofuels LLC in Pleasanton, Calif. Grant recipients under the Advanced Drop-In Biofuels Production Project are required responsible for matching private investments.

Lake said the province has carefully reviewed the evidence presented to the panel. "The panel must determine if it is appropriate to grant a certificate for the project as currently proposed on the basis of a promise to do more study and planning after the certificate is granted,” Lake said. “Our government does not believe that a certificate should be granted before these important questions are answered." Enbridge to address concerns The president of Enbridge, John Carruthers, called the B.C. announcement "part of the process." "British Columbia needed to submit their evidence. We need to address it. We need to meet with the people of B.C.," said Carruthers. B.C#$%$ conditions Environmental review needs to be passed. World-leading marine oil spill prevention, response.

"Even if there's a positive decision from the Joint Review Panel in December, we still need to meet with the public, meet with the province of B.C. and continue to dialogue with them, engage with them through the further development process, through construction and through operations." In a news release, Enbridge executive vice president Janet Holder also said the province's five conditions can't be fully met until the end of the review panel process, saying the company is working hard to meet the conditions and earn the confidence of the government and the people of B.C.

In releasing its annual hurricane season outlook last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an “active or extremely active” season, with 13 to 20 named storms — 7 to 11 of which could become hurricanes, including 3 to 6 major hurricanes. These ranges are well above the seasonal average of 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. In addition, climate change is fueling more intense and destructive storms. As Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explains, “Climate change is causing a greater number of intense storms. The total number of storms has remained constant, but the proportion of high-intensity events has gone steadily upward in most parts of the world. Scientific models and real-world observations both suggest that the frequency of intense storms is going up.” As climate change warms the oceans, water evaporates faster — driving stronger winds, more rain, and more powerful hurricanes. And as sea levels rise, the storm surges from hurricanes will be more destructive, posing a serious threat to coastal communities. These impacts were brought to bear last fall when Superstorm Sandy struck New York and New Jersey. Unusually warm warm water temperatures fueled the late-season storm and sea-level rise enabled the most devastating aspect of the storm — unprecedented storm surges. Sandy’s tremendous size and catastrophic surges left 147 people dead and caused an estimated $72 billion in damages.
