One person died and another was critically injured after shots were fired at Montreal's Metropolis, where Marois was in the middle of her victory speech. A third victim was treated for shock in hospital. Quebec's premier-designate had just told a cheering crowd that Quebec needs to become an independent country when her bodyguards swooped in and whisked her off stage. Marois took the podium just before midnight as a gleeful crowd of supporters burst into a round of Gens du Pays, a nationalist anthem, Marois told all Quebecers she was hopeful they could put aside their differences for a united Quebec. "Voters have made a choice and we will respect it, and we will govern with all other parties at the national assembly," she told the packed room at the Metropolis concert hall. The PQ won 54 of the province's 125 seats with 31.9 per cent of the vote, while the Liberals won 50 seats with 31.2 per cent of the vote. Marois, 63, will become the province's first female premier. During her speech, Marois thanked all of the candidates in the election and said the PQ will govern with all parties represented at the national assembly. Harper congratulates Marois In English, Marois directly addressed anglophone Quebecers, saying their rights would be respected. "We share the same history, and I want us to shape together our common future," she said. She also addressed her "friends and neighbours in Canada" saying that Quebec needs to become sovereign. "We want a country and we will have it," Marois said to loud cheers. The PQ has never governed in the past with a minority, however, and its ability to table a referendum question or any other confidence measure would be tested by Liberal opposition.

After years of controversy focused on the project’s risks to the environment, its impacts on First Nations and its uneven distribution of the benefits, Enbridge appealed to the greater good in hearings in Edmonton Tuesday. It was the company’s first opportunity to defend before regulators the $6-billion “national project” from Alberta to the British Columbia coast, and it likened it to the Canadian Pacific Railway, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the TransCanada Pipeline. “All attracted great attention and debate, but when constructed, laid the foundation for significant benefits for Canadians,” John Carruthers, president of Northern Gateway, said to regulators. “Our project is no different.” In an interview ahead of the hearing, Mr. Carruthers said the project is important for the company, but even more important for Canada. “It’s critical for Canada to be part of a growing world economy and get full value for our natural resources,” he said, referring to the deep discount affecting Canadian oils because there is insufficient pipeline space to move it to the United States, its sole export market. “That is the objective of the project. “Today, oil is Canada’s most important export, and the oil sands are a tremendous driver of the Canadian economy and right now we are tied to one market only … And that is in a market that has served us well over time and but is maturing, and most people would see as declining, particularly as domestic production grows. Clearly, it’s in Canada’s interest to access new, large and growing markets, and those are the markets in the Pacific Rim.” Enbridge also cast the project as a potential model for Canadians generally, for British Columbians and neighbouring Albertans, and for Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals to work together to resolve important differences. It’s a defence few projects can use and that has its appeal. You can gain support for many unpopular things by extolling the greater good. It’s also bigger than energy companies’ usual defence — that if it’s good for the economy, it’s good for everyone.

You can’t make the numbers work,” said Jackson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and former state environmental commissioner. Jackson also said it’s important to to take “sensible steps” to address global warming, then made a self-mocking comment about how shocking it must be to have someone say “the climate word.” “Our children and grandchildren are one day going to look at us and say, ‘What did you do?’ ” Jackson said. She also told delegates not to forget the “enormous amoung to propaganda” that will be filling the airwaves against President Obama this fall, and asked the crowd to tell their friends and neighbors “don’t believe it.” So, is the country better off environmentally after four years of President Obama? “Absolutely,” Jackson said in an interview.

Over Labor Day weekend millions of Americans hit the open road, but with gas prices spiking toward $4 per gallon, many elected to stay home. The oil companies blame Hurricane Isaac for causing the sudden inflation, but the increases continue even as reports come in that damage to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico suffered little, if any damage. “The oil market is so volatile and ethanol has served as a stabilizing factor that can help control costs by providing a level of certainty,” stated Tom Buis, CEO of Growth Energy. “Ethanol currently makes up 10% of our nation’s fuel supply and it has helped prevent extreme spikes in gas prices. Independent studies have shown that the inclusion of ethanol has saved consumers from 17 cents to $1.09 a gallon.” AAA estimated 33 million drivers would hit the roads over Labor Day weekend, and with gas prices hovering near $4 a gallon, more and more consumers are turning to higher ethanol blends to save at the pump. Furthermore, consumers who drive Flex Fuel vehicles can see substantial savings by filling up with E85. “Without ethanol blended in gasoline, prices would be higher,” Buis continued. “It is the least expensive motor fuel on the market and consumers can trust in a fuel that supports the American economy, powers NASCAR and reduces our dependence on foreign oil.

The groups are defending EPA's ability to set cellulosic and advance biofuels targets that are based on market data and seek to spur development, as consistent with the RFS as passed by Congress. In the next 18 months industry officials report there is an anticipated "wave of commercial biofuels coming online" with larger projects at POET, DSM, Mascoma helping supply a projected 140 million gallons per year to the Renewable Fuels Standard. The RFS had originally called for 1 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2013, but production will fall well short of that. EPA has adjusted requirements for advanced biofuels lower in recent years with the slowed commercialization of next generation biofuels. In the brief, the groups argued that "[f]or the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirement, EPA reasonably based its analysis on EIA's projection, but then took into account more specific information it had from individual facilities. Precedent makes clear that EPA can adopt standards calculated to spur development, consistent with Congress's express statutory objectives."

In the first debate with Republican Rep. Rick Berg, Heitkamp insisted she would be an independent voice and took pains to separate herself from top leaders in her party. That tact couldn’t have been clearer when she wholeheartedly embraced Palin’s approach to energy production in her oil rich state. “I think ‘Drill, Baby Drill’ is the way we need to do it,” Heitkamp said in response to a moderator’s question during a 50-minute North Dakota Broadcasters debate in Bismarck Wednesday morning. “This is an area where I have vehemently disagreed with the administration. They’ve walked away from coal. They’re hostile to oil.” Heitkamp has good reason to articulate as many Republican-sounding positions as possible. North Dakota’s open Senate seat is critical for control of the upper chamber, and Republicans are trying to link her to Obama as much as possible in a state that almost certainly will overwhelmingly vote for Mitt Romney in November. Heitkamp entered the debate ready for the line of attack and countered by portraying Berg, a freshman lawmaker, as an ineffective, uncompromising legislator unable to break Washington’s gridlock. Berg had only mentioned Obama once and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid twice when Heitkamp dove into a well-prepared defense. “Congressman Berg will repeatedly talk about Harry Reid and Barack Obama, and I find it interesting, because this morning, when I woke up and brushed my teeth, I looked in the mirror and I did not see a tall, African-American, skinny man,” she said. “So let’s make it clear that my priorities are North Dakota priorities. That you cannot run this campaign … by simply talking about a political party. You have to talk about ideas.” But Berg returned to his big picture argument about changing power in the Senate, drilling home the point during an exchange on energy. “The reality and the problem is, if we’re going to get these things done, we’ve got to change Washington. And we can’t do that without changing the Senate,” he said. Heitkamp — a former attorney general and tax commissioner — made an effort to underline areas where she’s broken with party orthodoxy. She called the Senate’s inability to craft a budget “deplorable,” and she came out in favor of a balanced budget amendment — a position many Democrats have derided as “extreme.” After reciting a laundry list of provisions in the health care law she supports, Heitkamp acknowledged “there’s bad” parts that need to be fixed. She dismissed environmentalist concerns about fracking — the hydraulic technology used to expand natural gas production — as “junk science. “People who say they’re against fracking don’t even know what it is,” she said.

After playing defense on energy just six months ago, Democrats express confidence Obama has parried attacks of “Drill, baby, drill” from the Republican Party. The Democratic confidence is bolstered by polls showing that on energy policy, voters prefer Obama to Romney: A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Aug. 27 shows that registered voters favor Obama over Romney 49-41 when asked which candidate they trust to do a better job handling energy policy. “We have nothing to be afraid of when we’re getting attacked simply by rhetoric and statements that take us back to the ‘Drill, baby, drill’-only program of Sarah Palin and her people,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told The Hill on Tuesday. “We feel good about where we are.” Democrats believe Obama has made inroads by touting his support for expanded oil-and-gas drilling as part of a wider energy strategy heavy on green energy and efficiency. They think they have blunted GOP attacks on energy — which Republicans traditionally have seen as a strength of their party — in part by more tightly embracing fossil fuels. Their 2012 platform embraces a wide array of energy options — four years after the party made multiple references to the “tyranny” of oil. Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said Republicans and Romney had helped Democrats by shifting to the right on climate issues. But Markey added that Obama had also passed a basic competency test on energy policy that had tripped up other incumbents — including two Republicans. “I don’t think for a...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346870186366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:36:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346871537352-23</Id><Topic><Title>Lyin Ryan!</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346812015175</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:26:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one can hide from "The Wahleee" he sees them for what they are, G-D Bless you Wahleee!</Msg><Username>carl_cessman</Username><Timestamp>1346871537352</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:58:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346874296144-24</Id><Topic><Title>Lyin Ryan!</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346812015175</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:26:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the one lyin' is you wallboard.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1346874296144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346875682189-25</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News Kohn on Ryans Speech of Lies</Title><Username>bankhouseone</Username><Timestamp>1346727809000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:03:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I said, there are some good and some bad reasons for voting to raise the debt limt.

That claim is illogical and then used to try to claim Ryan lied. Fact is deficit spending, gorwing faster than GDP leading to an non-sustainable debt growth rate is what lead to the down grade. Don't believe me, go ask the rating agency itself. So the claim is just another Dem lie and one you wallboard support because it aligns with your agenda. As to the increases during GWB tenure. Yes, there were to many. Yes GWB and the Congress (both Dem and Rep) spent more than should have. So the debt when GWB left (which BTW, was over $10B) was much too high. But because GWB increased the debt by $4.9T in 8 years doesn't make it better than Obama has increased it $5.4T in less than 4 years. At his current pace, Obama will increase the debt $6T in one term and over $12T in two.

Biodiesel is now available via truckload from Renewable Energy Group’s new biodiesel location in Rancho Dominguez outside of Long Beach, Calif. The first truckload of biodiesel was picked up by Whole Energy, a regional distributor and retailer with locations in Washington, Oregon and California. “Whole Energy is committed to biodiesel, helping Californians meet their carbon reduction goals, and offering supply for Oregon and Washington blending requirements,” said Gary Haer, vice president of sales and marketing at REG. “REG’s terminal agreement with Maxum Petroleum expands the opportunity for West Coast distributors like Whole Energy to blend biodiesel for public and private diesel fleets.” “We are excited about the opportunity to offer biodiesel from the nation’s largest biodiesel producer and marketer in California,” said Atul Deshmane, Whole Energy’s president and CEO. “Whole Energy is committed to a multi-region approach for offering biodiesel blends for fleets and consumers who are looking to go green, enhance performance and protect the earth with a sustainable fuel. REG biodiesel has demonstrated both great performance and carbon intensities.” REG recently registered its REG Seneca (Ill.) plant with CARB in accordance with LCFS and REG-9000 biodiesel from that location has a carbon intensity as low as 4.0 gCO2e/MJ, according to CARB...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346885633625</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 18:53:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346886442158-31</Id><Title>New Keystone route proposed, but green groups unswayed</Title><Msg>New Keystone route proposed, but green groups unswayed By Zack Colman - 09/05/12 04:19 PM ET The company behind the Keystone XL oil pipeline has proposed re-routing the U.S. portion to gain support from environmental groups that have pressured President Obama to block the project. Canadian firm TransCanada Corp. said in a statement Wednesday that it proposed an alternative route to the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). It cited Nebraskan fears that the pipeline, which would bring Alberta oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, originally passed through the highly erodible Sandhills region and could contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer, a valuable source of drinking water. "TransCanada shares the goal of protecting key water and natural resources with Nebraskans,” TransCanada CEO and President Russ Girling said Wednesday in a statement. “The identified route, along with our commitment to implement additional safety requirements above and beyond those required for any other pipeline, ensures the protection of Nebraska's resources." The state hopes to send a finalized report to Gov. Dave Heineman (R) by the end of this year, the Nebraska DEQ said. He will have 30 days after that to rule on the new route. Obama delayed making a final decision on the U.S. leg of the pipeline until after the election, claiming that he did not have enough time to review the plan. Republicans argue that was a concession to environmentalists, who were key supporters of Obama’s 2008 campaign and had expressed concerns the president neglected their causes early in his term. TransCanada has begun constructing the Canadian part of the pipeline in hopes that Obama’s hesitation to approve the U.S. share is a product of election-year jitters. The administration has final say over the project because it crosses national boundaries. But the changes offered Wednesday did little to ...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346886442158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346887889156-32</Id><Title>Dem button "Once you Vote Black you never go Back"</Title><Msg>This button was seen at the dem convention.</Msg><Username>sirola1</Username><Timestamp>1346887889156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346889434380-33</Id><Topic><Title>Flip Flopney and Lyin Ryan</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346816377161</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 23:39:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And you think Obama has been a 'friend' to our military???

The amount of shut oil output was down 2.18 percentage points and closed natural gas production fell 3.29 points from a day earlier. The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said 680,749 barrels per day (bpd) of oil production was still shut, down from 710,866 bpd on Tuesday, and 1.157 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day in natural gas output was closed, down from 1.309 bcf per day on Tuesday. Those figures are expected to fall in the coming days. Isaac came ashore as a hurricane on August 28 and its slow movement last week across Louisiana delayed the restart of production.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346895004679</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:30:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346895680251-42</Id><Title>Shell OKs oilsands' 1st carbon-capture project</Title><Msg>Shell OKs oilsands' 1st carbon-capture project The Canadian Press Posted: Sep 5, 2012 12:06 PM ET Last Updated: Sep 5, 2012 12:22 PM ET Read 91 comments Royal Dutch Shell is going ahead with the first carbon capture and storage project for an oilsands operation in Canada, the international energy giant announced Wednesday. The "flagship" Quest project will be built on behalf of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project's joint venture owners, which include Shell, Chevron and Marathon Oil. It also has the support of the Canadian and Alberta governments. "CCS is critical to meeting the huge projected increase in global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions," Shell CEO Peter Voser said in remarks accompanying the announcement. "If you want to achieve climate change goals, CCS has to be part of the solution. We are helping to advance CCS technology on a number of fronts around the world, but Quest will be our flagship project." Voser described the Alberta oilsands as a secure and reliable source of energy and an economic engine which drives employment, training and business development across Canada and beyond. "We will need all sources of energy to meet world demand in the coming decades," Voser noted. "Lower CO2 energy sources will grow, but even by 2050 at least 65 per cent of our energy will still come from fossil fuels. So CCS will be important to manage climate impacts." The Athabasca Oil Sands project produces bitumen, which is piped to Shell's Scotford upgrader near Edmonton. From late 2015, Quest will capture and store deep underground more than one million tonnes a year of CO2 produced in bitumen processing. Quest will reduce direct emissions from the Scotford upgrader by up to 35 per cent — the equivalent of taking 175,000 North American cars off the road annually, Shell said. Government investment John Abbott, Shell executive vice-president, heavy oil, said the knowledge Quest provides will help enable "much wider and more cost-effective application of CCS through the energy industry and other sectors in years to come." The Alberta government plans to invest $745 million in Quest from a $2-billion fund to support CCS, while Ottawa will provide $120 million through its Clean Energy Fund. Quest is the world's first commercial-scale CCS project to tackle carbon emissions in the oilsands, and ...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346895680251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:41:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346903157309-43</Id><Title>DEMs = Societies MISFITS......BUMs. go get a JOB or a better one....WORK !!!</Title><Msg>what a BUNCH of "weirdos"...........</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1346903157309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 23:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
