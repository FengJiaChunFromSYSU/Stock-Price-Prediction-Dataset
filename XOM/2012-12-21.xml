If you read German and English history there is no doubt that the role of government is helpful to a nation and its economy. The growth of government, led by the right in Europe, lifted civilization out of the dark ages to modernity. It allowed England to conquer most of the world - you are speaking English after all. The US did much better too when the power of its libertarian extremists was broken after the American Civil War. They obstructed infrastructure, schools, universities, and even sales of land to immigrants because they feared the power that was growing in the North - a power influenced by European big government ideology. Progressive is the name for it. Obama is doing what the Republican Party is unable to - get rid of the libertarian influence in America once and for all. It has grown to dangerous levels after the end of the Cold War. He's not very left wing anyway, and even if he ends up being so it matters little. Germany and England suffered a few bursts of left-wing enthusiasm on their path to big government. You mentioned a few of England's former colonies as examples. How do you suppose English law ended up there? What about Japan - German law and some American influence after World War II. Japan has its problems but compare the power of the Tokugawa government and their successors with a place with a weak government and you will see the difference across time. Greece and Spain are weak pathetic states and new to the game of big government. In time they will learn.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356111662567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 12:41:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356113169496-36</Id><Topic><Title>Bush killed the US economy....</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1356108537769</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 11:48:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jr was a shameful disgrace to the office he held.

Known as boiler MACT rules, the standards impose the first-ever limits on emissions for mercury, acid gases and fine particulate matter, or soot, for boilers and incinerators. The agency said the rules would affect about 1 percent of the nation's boilers. It added the rules would yield public health benefits, preventing 8,100 premature deaths and 5,100 heart attacks per year beginning in 2015. Republicans and industry had fought the rules, saying they represented regulatory overreach and would impose burdensome economic costs. That pressure led to several revisions to bake in more flexibility for industry. The final rules also included some of that flexibility by holding off on implementation until 2016 at the earliest, giving industry more time to comply. John Walke, director of green group Natural Resources Defense Council's clean air program, said the rules were an improvement but added that they are "mixed bag." "The agency, however, eased standards in their final rules for cement manufacturers, which is troubling and deserves further explanation," Walke said in a Friday statement. Industry groups were not pleased either. Jay Timmons, chief executive with the National Association of Manufacturers, said the rules "remain far from being realistic." "Manufacturers are understandably growing more pessimistic about the direction of the economy. The end-of-year regulatory assault on businesses, combined with the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff, makes for one of the worst business environments in living memory," Timmons said in a Friday statement. The Capitol Hill reception was a bit warmer. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who will head the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources next Congress, said the rules strike "a good balance." Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Energy and Power, said that while he is still concerned about costs, the final rules "include changes that will help facilities achieve compliance." ”We welcome EPA’s revisions to make these rules more workable and achievable. EPA itself acknowledged that its original rules were flawed and rightfully commenced a reconsideration process," Whitfield added in a Friday statement. Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, praised the rules. He painted them as a victory for Democrats, noting Republicans had tried to derail the rules. “Cutting mercury pollution from these industrial facilities will protect our children and cutting carbon pollution from these boilers will help heal the climate. From cars and trucks to power plants and now industrial boilers, the Obama administration is showing it is committed to cutting pollution," Markey said in a Friday statement. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/274247-epa-finalizes-boiler-emissions-rules</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356117301295</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:15:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356117472090-38</Id><Topic><Title>XOM report.</Title><Username>robertklotz24</Username><Timestamp>1355765875748</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 12:37:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow!</Msg><Username>phillipslela442</Username><Timestamp>1356117472090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:17:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356117972806-39</Id><Title>mellanox stock long strong bullish</Title><Msg>now =)</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

The review could have major implications for the U.S. natural gas boom spurred by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which has transformed the U.S. energy market and could revamp global energy flows. The Environmental Protection Agency offered a “progress report” on its broad, multifaceted report, which includes data gathered from hundreds of natural gas and oil wells across the U.S. The study is the federal government’s most ambitious look at fracking, which uses water, sand and chemical mixtures to crack underground rock and release previously inaccessible reserves of natural gas and other fuels. The tracking boom has transformed local economies in Pennsylvania, North Dakota and elsewhere, while also putting the nation on track to become energy-independent. But critics of the practice continue to claim fracking is unsafe and endangers local water supplies, and environmental groups have put increasing pressure on President Obama and governors such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo to crack down on fracking and instead embrace renewable fuels. The EPA study could become the key cornerstone of future federal efforts to limit fracking, and many congressional Republicans and oil and gas industry leaders remain leery of the science behind it. In its progress report, the EPA explains how it is examining five major areas of the fracking “water cycle.” They are: The impact of large water withdrawals, necessary to perform fracking; the possible impacts of fracking fluid surface spills and how they would affect drinking water resources; the implications of “injection and fracturing process” on drinking water resources; how “flowback” — wastewater generated by fracking — could affect water supplies; and the possible effects of inadequate treatment of fracking wastewater. The EPA is conducting case studies at well sites in Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas. So far, the agency has collected samples from 70 domestic water wells, 15 monitoring wells and 13 surface water sources. It is also looking at “information on chemicals and practices” from a number of oil and gas companies, and is evaluating “well construction and fracturing records” provided by operators for 333 oil and gas wells across the U.S. The study, the agency said, will undergo rigorous and independent peer review before being completed. washingtontimesDOTcom/news/2012/dec/21/epa-offers-details-its-controversial-fracking-stud/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356119299014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:48:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356119801380-41</Id><Topic><Title>EPA offers details of its controversial fracking study</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356119299014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:48:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EPA outlines fracking pollution study Long-term effort to determine whether technique used to gather natural gas ruins drinking water. By Timothy Gardner, Reuters 1:50 p.m. EST, December 21, 2012 WASHINGTON — The Obama administration issued the framework on Friday of a long-term study on whether fracking for natural gas pollutes drinking water, but will not make conclusions until 2014 about the controversial technique that is helping to fuel a domestic drilling boom. Critics of the Environmental Protection Agency study, called for by Congress in 2010, complain it does not closely examine the impact of drillers' injecting waste water deep underground, a practice that has been linked to small earthquakes. The progress report outlined case studies at drilling sites in states including North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas that will inform the final study. For a link to the study click here rDOTreutersDOTcom/jec84t It also explained the scientific methods the EPA is using to understand how drinking water supplies are affected by the lifecycle of water used fracking. That cycle ranges from withdrawing the water from ground and surface supplies to treating it in wastewater plants. Although conclusions are more than a year away, power utilities, chemical companies and other big consumers of natural gas fear the study could lead to more regulations and raise costs as a result. Power generators, including American Electric Power and Southern Co, have been enjoying rock bottom prices for natural gas in recent years. Fracking involves forcing large volumes of water laced with chemicals and sand deep underground to crack rock and free oil and natural gas. Critics of fracking, including many environmentalists, worry drilling operations near schools and homes can pollute water and air. The drilling industry and some Republicans in Congress have said the EPA study is overkill because fracking is safe. The EPA's long-term study will examine the large volumes of water sucked up by fracking operations, surface spills of fracking fluids on well pads, and the drilling itself. The study will also look at spills of so-called "flowback" water that rushes up from wells when they start producing gas, and how well wastewater treatment plants operate. But the study does not closely look at the effects of injecting waste water deep underground, a practice environmentalists worry could become a dormant threat to water supplies. Drillers say they are recycling more and more water used and produced in fracking. But some of the waste is still injected underground. Ben Grumbles, a former assistant administrator for water at the EPA, said injection of the waste is "legitimate and important concern." Ohio recently linked the disposal method to a series of small earthquakes and placed a moratorium on the injections but lifted it in November. Grumbles, who is now president of the U.S. Water Alliance, said the omission of examining the practice was "not a fatal flaw" of the study because he believes a different arm of the EPA is doing research on waste water injection. "They really do need to look at the issue," he said. "I would hope the offices were coordinating and efforts to review potential risks of large volumes of waste water being injected ... will be looked at, " he said. mcallDOTcom/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-epa-fracking-pollution-study-20121221,0,5262210DOTstory</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356119801380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:56:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356119903804-42</Id><Topic><Title>EPA offers details of its controversial fracking study</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356119299014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:48:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Request for Information To Inform Hydraulic Fracturing Research Related to Drinking Water Resources A Notice by the Environmental Protection Agency on 11/09/2012 federalregisterDOTgov/articles/2012/11/09/2012-27452/request-for-information-to-inform-hydraulic-fracturing-research-related-to-drinking-water-resources</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356119903804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:58:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356125290221-43</Id><Topic><Title>It Took Sleazy Republicans 4 Days To Promote More Gun Sales</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1355927636634</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:33:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're the equivalent of human waste.

They do not understand that at one time there was no such thing as national cultures - their models did not exist except in the vision of the elite.

Propel Fuels says it has closed on the initial phase of its Series D round of funding with $11 million in equity capital from existing investors Nth Power, Craton Equity Partners, and @Ventures as well as a new investor, Gentry Venture Partners. In addition, the company has secured $10 million in debt financing. Propel currently operates stations throughout California and Washington State with more than 200 stations planned for new and existing markets over the next two years. Propel says the new funding will allow the company to accelerate the build-out of its network of stations that aims to offer drivers the cleanest, most sustainable, domestically produced fuels on the market today. Propel currently operates a growing network of stations that provide renewable fuels (Flex Fuel E85, biodiesel blends) alongside the conventional gasoline that most drivers use today. Offering a better station experience that reaches beyond fuel is a major goal of the company. Propel also enables drivers to offset carbon from their fuel purchases, improve their vehicle’s fuel economy, find rideshare opportunities, tune bicycles, and recycle on the go. Propel is the only fueling company in the country known to bring drivers the opportunity to offset their emissions at the pump through the company’s CarbonOffset program. This year, Propel was named to Inc. Magazine’s list of the Fastest Growing Private Companies (the 17th fastest growing energy company); the 8th Fastest Growing Private Company in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal; and the 14th Fastest Growing Private Company in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times. “The continuing support of our existing investors, the new investment from Gentry, and the access to additional debt capital is a strong endorsement for our vision, our accomplishments, and team,” said Matt Horton, CEO of Propel. “This new funding, combined with grant funding from the State of California, will enable us to accelerate the build out of our alternative fuel stations across state, offering consumers true choice and a better experience at the pump.” Propel says that as part of the investment by Gentry, Thomas B. Raterman, a Partner, has joined Propel’s Board of Directors. Raterman has more than 30 years of corporate finance, investment banking, and executive management with rapidly growing entrepreneurial companies. “We’re witnessing a revolution in transportation, whether it’s innovative new enzymes to create clean fuels, or whole new drivetrains and power systems in the vehicles themselves,” said Raterman. “Propel is creating a position as a trusted source of the most advanced fuels on the market today – no matter what type of vehicle you drive. We’re excited to help them succeed.” hybridcarsDOTcom/200-new-propel-stations-planned-two-years-67406</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356138991327</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 20:16:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356139163458-53</Id><Title>XTO</Title><Msg>Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson assured us over and over what a good acquisition XTO was when most analysts felt he badly overpaid.

The massive taxing power of the U.S. government has not even been unleashed yet and already you are predicting the end...Now, of course, this borrowing of money will simply have to stop... They have not crossed the line of printing yet. The Reichsbank crossed it in 1914 and the Confederacy in 1862, because they did not have sufficient bank deposits to borrow. The Fed knows better. There's plenty to tax too. We could start with pensions and all other deferred compensation. I think 90% above $100,000/year would be a fair number...Workers who are actually producing should have a lower rate... Government investment is very effective anyway, and will be even more so considering the tremendous backlog of projects that have been held up by the Republicans. There's lots of low hanging fruit.
