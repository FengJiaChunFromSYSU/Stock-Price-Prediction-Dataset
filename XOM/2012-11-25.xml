The Democrat Party's agenda was ascendant. Marginal tax rates were 70% of more and technological and economic growth was the fastest in American history. Stocks beat Treasury Bonds by wide margins in investment return. From 1981 to 1992 America's debt load was rising as a percent of the economy. The Republican Party's agenda, really a retread of the old failed Hoover-Coolidge approach on taxes, was ascendant. Marginal tax rates fell. America's economy slowed compared to its peers in Japan and Europe. Treasury Bonds tied with Stocks in investment return. From 1993 to 2000 America's debt load was stable as a percent of the economy. A mix of Democrat and Republican policies were implemented which reduced public sector debt whilst encouraging an orgy of speculation in banking and stocks. The economy did well at least as long as the stock bubble was inflating. The budget was balanced thanks to the stock bubble boosting capital gains taxes paid. Stocks and Treasury Bonds both did well. From 2001-2012 America's debt load was rising as a percent of the economy. The Republican Party's agenda of low tax rates was again tried. The low tax policy could not be reversed due to the Tea Party radicals. Treasury Bonds decisively beat Stocks in investment return. America's economy logged one of its worth growth records in a century.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353862628246</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:57:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353863625900-4</Id><Topic><Title>Facts about America's Debt</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353862628246</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:57:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*America's economy logged one of its worst growth records in a century. - W's policies</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353863625900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 12:13:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353864903202-5</Id><Title>The Annihilation of the Speculators</Title><Msg>Watch Europe over the next few years.

In the game of tax incidence, the burden of the tax falls on the Speculators who own before the tax is imposed or made known to the market. So if you were a Republican in 1929 your best move was to sell before the Democrats raised your taxes to 90% unless you wanted to wait around a couple of decades for your investments to be made whole. lol The Free Traders have made this outcome inevitable.

Greedful is correct that neither the Republican or Democrat Party has been good about cutting spending. I certainly agree that GW Bush and the Republican Party were in essence the Democrat Party in how they spent during the early 2000's until the Demoncraps took control of both the House &amp; Senate in 2007. From 2007 through 2010, the Pelosi-led House and Reid-led Senate redefined out of control spending and took it to a level never seen before - in fact what they did put the next to final nail in the USA coffin - these last elections were the final nail. In 2010, the election of a few Tea Party favorites to the House, which enabled the Republicans to gain control of the house, caused only a ripple in the ongoing spending machine (big government Demoncraps, RINOs, and the US Press) of Washington DC and the machine ended up squelching them in the most recent election. The Republican-led House passed numerous spending control bills but they were squelched by the Demoncrap-led Senate and/or President Hussein. Anyway, Greedful is correct now that the Demoncraps totally rule, there is no hope of spending cuts and the only way to attempt to somehow balance the budget is to raise taxes - and this is exactly what the Demoncraps have wanted all along. The Demoncraps have won and the USA has lost because sooner than later everyone's taxes will go up to feed the Greedful Washington DC machine. Stick a fork in the USA, it's done.</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1353880904585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 17:01:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353881116759-24</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Makes Some Interesting Points</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1353877891053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:11:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The charitable deduction should be abolished entirely.

THE GOP. Land values and wages can always fall and as America's economy rots they will no matter how hard government tries to prop them up. At some point the mix of labor and land costs will be the same as foreign locations, and then industry will come back. High taxes just help them on their way to the lower equilibrium level, and hence are desirable. Taxes pay for such useful things as education and public services which can keep wages perpetually higher than areas without those services, so their is a double benefit from the taxes. Capital costs pretty much the same, and will probably always be cheap in America with so much fixed income wealth hiding from the rot... It's helpful to separate the speculator from the producer - they are not the same. The speculator thrives on high asset prices and America's non-competitiveness flowing from them... The speculator is worthless and its days are coming to an end with the defeat of the GOP - hopefully forever.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353883355286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 17:42:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353883499265-31</Id><Topic><Title>Greedful Makes Some Interesting Points</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1353877891053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:11:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with both of you that manufacturing of useful goods should be brought back to the USA.

New factories need to be immediately built in the US, and although they should pollute as low as reasonably possible, the EPA and the "civil rights" courts should not impede their construction and operation. Our court system is totally controlled by special interests and most of them are controlled by the Demoncraps. Labor unions should be significantly throttled to enable reasonable wages for low end jobs - $50 to $100 per hour for a high school drop out to install a bolt in a car is not reasonable. Due to many reasons, most but certainly not all of them Demoncrap instilled, the USA is currently 180 degrees off-center and I personnally think we are past the point of no return.

That by definition is a pro-speculator policy. Increasing stock prices, and real estate prices does not nothing useful for the economy. Higher real estate prices simply require more mortgage debt to finance which diverts capital away from business uses to useless speculative activities. Higher real estate prices also encourages more house construction, and more depreciation of the structures, and more dead weight for the economy to support. Higher or lower stock prices are irrelevant to the economy, unless you are a member of the top 1% who owns most stocks, however the loss of dividend taxes to achieve the high prices is, by definition pro-speculator, and retards the state of public finances, investment in useful activities, and economic growth. Which party has the most speculators in it is irrelevant: the party that supports their interest is the one responsible for the economic fallout caused by the poor policy.

What’s less known is it will make trips to the grocery store more expensive and drive up the cost of pizza. All this is happening because nanny state zealots slipped a zinger into the measure just before it came up for a vote. A provision requiring restaurant menus to display calorie counts might seem like a minor addition to legislation representing the takeover of one-sixth of the economy, but the seemingly simple addition will cost billions. President Obama’s own Office of Management and Budget listed the menu display imposition as the third most burdensome statutory requirement enacted that year, forcing retail outlets to expend 14,536,183 work hours every year just to keep Uncle Sam happy. Instead of applying the menu rule just to restaurants, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided on its own initiative to sweep certain convenience stores and pizza delivery storefronts under the calorie-count requirements. FDA bureaucrats are even micromanaging compliance, down to determining the sizes of fonts that can be used on menu signs. Small-business franchisees will bear the majority of the burden. “If they want to put in new products or change pricing or add new toppings, they have to buy new menu boards,” said Jenny Fouracre-Petko, director of legislative affairs for Domino's Pizza. “That’s where it gets expensive.” It will also become confusing, as the boards must convey the calorie counts for the 34 million possible topping combination that the chain offers. Never mind that most customers order pizza over the telephone or through the Internet. Never mind that Domino's already has an online calculator for weight-conscious customers to figure out calorie counts. Mr. Obama’s minions demand things be done their way. The signage overload is also headed for grocery stores that feature items like fresh bakery goods and food bars. Store owners must either slap up the signs everywhere or label each individual product. The problem is that suppliers, ingredients and recipes constantly change. If a store wants to offer something different, it will have to cough up around $500 to ship the product to a lab for testing and certification. This ultimately affects the products stores will be able to offer consumers. “It forces you into a central kitchen,” said Jennifer Hatcher, a senior vice president for the Food Marketing Institute, which represents 26,000 retail food stores. “It eliminates creativity and regional variation.” Administration zealots insist having calorie counts plastered onto every wall in every store in the country will make people healthier. It’s far more likely the person picking up a birthday cake at the supermarket or a double-cheese pizza with pepperoni isn’t concerned with calories. For those watching their waistline, various online calculators and smartphone apps provide the needed information. Regulators seem more interested in bullying business than achieving a tangible result. Fortunately, Rep. John Carter, Texas Republican, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, Texas Democrat, have introduced legislation that would undo the FDA’s overreach. Since a full repeal of Obamacare is unlikely, Congress ought to repeal this provision before it’s too late.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353900476644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 22:27:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353900669120-46</Id><Title>KAHLILI: Iran thrilled over Obama re-election</Title><Msg>In his first news conference after re-election, President Obama said there was still time for a diplomatic solution on Iran’s nuclear program and that Iran could enjoy “peaceful nuclear power” if it meets international obligations. Diplomacy has failed and international sanctions, though having some effect, have not persuaded the radicals ruling Iran to stop their illicit nuclear program. The economic screws must be tightened. Iranian leaders did not hide their satisfaction in Mr. Obama’s re-election and the prospect of more negotiations, which, in their view, will buy them more time to develop nuclear weapons. Professor Pirooz Mojtahedzade, who teaches political geography at Tehran University, said in a recent interview, “Perhaps one reason for Obama’s success in his re-election campaign was his opposition to the warmongering Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] of Israel, which officially eliminated the effect of the Zionist lobby in presidential elections, and the result of this is that the Israel lobby will not have much effect on U.S. politics in the next four years. “I have no doubt that the U.S. desires negotiations. We must remember the promises by Obama in his first four years to change U.S. politics internally and externally to address international matters peacefully, including Iran’s nuclear energy program through negotiations and peaceful means,” Mr. Mojtahedzade said. His thoughts were echoed in several other analyses in Iranian media. One said America is in no way looking for a confrontation with Iran and, in fact, has such a confrontation as its red line. Therefore, it’s only natural that the Islamic republic is aware of this limited U.S. strategy and will benefit from it, the analysis argued. Proof of that claim, the analysis said, is the recent incident in which Revolutionary Guards fighter jets shot at a U.S. drone. America reacted to the incident cautiously, not militarily, diplomatically or even publicly. It is with this belief that the regime has successfully dragged out international talks about its illicit nuclear program over the past four years while making significant progress toward nuclear weapons. When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, the Islamic regime had barely enough enriched uranium for one nuclear bomb. Today, it has enough for six, if further enriched. In 2009, Iran was enriching uranium at one facility in Natanz. Today, enrichment goes on with thousands more centrifuges spinning at another facility in Fordo. The latter is deep underground and immune to airstrikes. In 2009, the regime was limited to 3.5 percent enrichment. Now, it is enriching to 20 percent, a significant step toward weaponization. Most alarming is that the regime is within days of ramping up production of 20 percent-level uranium, doubling its output. This would cut in half the time needed to acquire enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb. A Nov. 16 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it has received further information that “Iran has carried out activities that are relevant to the development of a nuclear device.” This is while Iran has stonewalled an IAEA request for months to inspect the military site at Parchin, where it is believed the regime tested an explosive device that could help with the development of a nuclear weapon. I revealed recently that one secret site at which Iran is conducting nuclear work is in the outskirts of Najafabad, in the province of Isfahan. A team of Iranian scientists headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, the father of Iran’s nuclear program, has been secretly testing a neutron detonator and implosion system, designing and building a nuclear warhead to arm Iran’s Shahab-3 ballistic missile and working on separating plutonium for a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb. Despite the 2007 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate saying Iran had halted work on nuclear weapons as early as 2003, the Iranians never did — something that the Nov. 16 IAEA report also verified. With the current crises in the Middle East and Iran arming Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and other terrorist groups, one thing is certain: If the regime becomes nuclear-armed, proliferation will become a nightmare, world stability and the global economy will become its hostage, and uncertainty and instability will rule.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353900669120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 22:31:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
