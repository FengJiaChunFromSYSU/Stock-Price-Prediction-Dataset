"I'll tell you what my green dream is: that we finally face up to climate change," Biden said during a surprise appearance at the "Green Ball," an inaugural weekend event for environmental groups. The vice president stressed that the environment would not be a second-tier issue and thanked the environmental community for its support for the president. "I came to say thank you," Biden said to thunderous applause. While the green groups credit President Barack Obama with making significant progress on environmental issues, including with new regulations on power plant emissions and a dramatic jump in vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, many complain that he has done too little to address what scientists call an increasing threat of catastrophic climate change. The major strategy for dealing with that problem, through cap and trade, died in the Senate during Obama's first term. Greens are looking for any sign that Obama will offer a new strategy for addressing climate. They're also calling on the president to use his rhetorical powers to drum up public support for the cause and politicoDOTcom/story/2013/01/biden-to-climate-activists-keep-the-faith-86483.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358770483808</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 07:14:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358777457601-6</Id><Topic><Title>Currency Purchase...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358277364611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 14:16:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sold for euro...1.1917 €/£. 100% German 5-Year Bunds @0.64% yield to maturity.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358777457601</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358778264081-7</Id><Topic><Title>Truck Stops Are Gearing Up For Natural Gas Fueling</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1358705427375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 13:10:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That will be strongly deflationary.

In a letter to the president, also copied to both Iowa Senators and all four Iowa Congressmen, the Iowa RFS Coalition thanked President Obama for his unwavering support of the federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) and urged his continued strong support for agriculture and renewable fuels throughout his second term. In part, the letter to President Obama read, “Throughout your first term, you and key members of your Administration—including Secretary of Agriculture and former Iowa Governor, Tom Vilsack—have shown tremendous leadership in supporting policies, such as the RFS, which help crack open the door for renewable fuels to compete against the highly entrenched petroleum industry. “The Iowa RFS Coalition will stand with your Administration and the Iowa Congressional delegation to defend the RFS from false attacks. With your support, this vital policy will continue to thrive for the next decade unlocking cleaner, cheaper domestic fuel choices for American consumers.” Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Policy Director Grant Menke said, “With efforts to eliminate the RFS at peak intensity, the Iowa RFS Coalition looks forward to working with the President and the Iowa delegation to protect the RFS in 2013. Together, we will move forward for fuel choice.” Current members of the Iowa RFS Coalition are DuPont, Iowa Biodiesel Board, Iowa Biotechnology Association, Iowa Corn Growers Association, Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Iowa-Nebraska Equipment Dealers Association, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Monsanto and Syngenta. The Iowa RFS Coalition will continue to welcome new members throughout 2013. The Iowa RFS Coalition is a group of Iowa businesses and organizations committed to protecting and preserving the federal RFS through cooperative efforts of advocacy, outreach and education. The Iowa RFS Coalition opposes re-opening the federal RFS; recognizes that maintaining the federal RFS is critical to the Iowa and U.S. economies, our nation’s energy security and our planet’s air quality; and agrees that ethanol and biodiesel production are essential components of an all-of-the-above American energy solution. ethanolproducerDOTcom/articles/9485/iowa-groups-announce-formation-of-iowa-rfs-coalition</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358826205869</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 22:43:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358828209700-39</Id><Title>Alberta's royalty regime to take steep hit as oil prices sputter, energy minister warns</Title><Msg>Alberta's royalty regime to take steep hit as oil prices sputter, energy minister warns Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald : Monday, January 21, 2013 08:15 AM Alberta bitumen faces a huge discount compared to the price for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude;with the differential near $37 a barrel on Friday. Photo Credit: Jimmy Jeong , Bloomberg CALGARY — The steep price discount facing Alberta crude is jeopardizing the Redford government’s projection of collecting $10 billion in bitumen revenue by 2014-15, as fewer oilsands projects are expected to graduate into paying higher royalties in the short term, says Energy Minister Ken Hughes. In last spring’s budget, the Tory government predicted it would collect a gusher from the province’s 108 oilsands projects, with bitumen royalties hitting $5.7 billion this year and climbing by an average of 32 per cent in each of the following two years — driven by rising production and expectations of higher commodity prices. Rising prices would mean more oilsands projects would move from paying an initial lower levy to the government — known as a pre-payout royalty rate — to a higher tier of payments, as producers recoup their total development costs for such large-scale projects. Today, however, Alberta bitumen faces a huge discount compared to the price for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, with the differential near $37 a barrel on Friday. In an interview, Hughes said the number of oilsands operations now expected to reach payout quickly — bumping them into the higher royalty tier — is smaller. “In my estimate, we’d probably see maybe half as many projects reach payout in the next four years, compared to what we might’ve thought would happen even a year ago,” he said. “The impact of the price pressure on bitumen means payout will not come as quickly for as many projects. So that also has an impact on the revenues of the province of Alberta over time. “They will still reach payout, but they won’t reach payout as quickly.” As for the government’s target last spring of garnering almost $10 billion in bitumen royalties in 2014-15 — propelling the province into an overall $5.2-billion surplus — Hughes urged caution. “I cannot foresee anything like that happening, and our job as the government of Alberta is to be prudent, cautious and conservative in our assumptions about revenues to the provincial coffers, so we can continue to have choices that we do today about how we manage our way through these issues.” According to provincial statistics, 49 oilsands projects in northern Alberta are currently in the pre-payout phase as of Dec. 31, 2012, paying royalty rates that top out at nine per cent of gross revenues. Another 59 are in the higher category, paying royalties of up to 40 per cent of net revenues, depending on oil prices. When the budget was released last February, the Energy Department expected 13 oilsands projects would graduate to the higher post-payout levels by 2014-15. (An updated number won’t be released until the new budget is released in March.) Greg Stringham, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, notes some U.S. refineries are converting to handle heavier grades of crude, which should increase markets for Alberta bitumen. As well, another pricing issue — the gap between North American and global oil prices — is expected to narrow. Project payout is largely determined by the total cost of a development and commodity prices, he said. “Lower prices means in most cases longer payouts, higher prices means faster payout — because payout is just how much revenue goes against the cost,” Stringham said. “But a lot of the major projects that have been started up for several years now are already past their payout point. So it’s not like you swing all of the projects, it would (affect) only the newer production that comes on.” At the heart of the government’s problem is the difficulty forecasting volatile prices for Alberta’s most important energy commodity. Oil prices are sharply lower than projected in the budget. West Texas Intermediate has averaged $91.40 a barrel during this fiscal year — compared with last spring’s budget estimate of $99.25 — and every $1-a-barrel drop over the course of the year costs the treasury $233 million. The price for a Western Canadian Select, which reflects a blend of conventional heavy oil and bitumen produced in Alberta, has averaged only $70 a barrel since April — closing at $58.71 a barrel on Friday — sharply off the budget forecast of $83. And every $1 difference in Western Canadian Select over an entire year will cut bitumen royalties to the province by $239 million, according to Alberta Energy. Energy economist Joseph Doucet, a professor at the University of Alberta, noted the province remains a relatively high-cost environment in which to build large energy projects. Meanwhile petroleum producers and the province are currently collecting less money for a heavily discounted product. Ultimately, this means less cash for government coffers. “It’s a very serious problem and it’s something that wasn’t anticipated — or fully anticipated — until fairly recently,” Doucet said of the price discount. But Wildrose MLA Rob Anderson said the government’s prediction of bitumen royalties jumping by a third in each of the next two years was “total insanity.” Oilsands projects will move into a higher payout rate, but not at the aggressive pace the Redford government was banking on, he added. “Any rational human being thinking there would be a 32 per cent increase in bitumen royalties in two years needs their head examined. I don’t want to use the word impossible, but that’s essentially what it is,” Anderson said. Part of the broader issue facing Alberta stems from rising oil production in the United States — where volumes hit a 14-year high last fall — and limited pipeline capacity. Hughes noted the industry is still strong, and employment levels are growing because of the huge opportunities in the oilsands. While last year’s budget projected some pressure on bitumen prices, “what nobody anticipated was how quickly and how deeply the impact would come upon the Alberta economy — and upon the industry,” he added. “All this speaks to is the fact, within the oil industry, there will not be as much revenue, which means there may be slowing down of a few projects. But we’re still amongst the luckiest people in the world.” globaltvedmontonDOTcom/albertas+royalty+regime+to+take+steep+hit+as+oil+prices+sputter+energy+minister+warns/6442792604/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358828209700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:16:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358829027638-40</Id><Title>Canadian LNG project finds buyer for its gas</Title><Msg>Canadian LNG project finds buyer for its gas Tuesday, 22 January 2013 05:06 Posted by Abdul Ahad CALGARY: Golar LNG Ltd, which bills itself as one of the world's largest independent operators of liquefied natural-gas carriers, said on Monday it and LNG Partners LLC have agreed to buy all the output of the Douglas Channel LNG project, the first such contract for Canada's nascent LNG industry. Golar said in a release that it and privately held LNG Partners will buy the 700,000 tonnes of LNG per year, beginning by mid-2015, to be produced by the project backed by the Haisla First Nation aboriginal group and Douglas Channel Gas Services Ltd. No price was disclosed. The project was the second to be awarded an LNG export license by Canadian regulators in 2011, behind one granted to the Kitimat LNG project proposed by Apache Corp and Chevron Corp. A handful of other LNG projects have also been proposed for British Columbia's northern coast to supply Asian markets with gas from the province's massive shale-gas fields. Backers of the rival projects include Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Malaysia's Petronas, BG Group Plc and others, making British Columbia a rival to the US Gulf coast, where nine projects have been announced and one, Cheniere Energy Inc's, Sabine Pass project, is already under construction. Golar said the deal is subject to reaching a financing agreement with the project's partners and that the project receive all needed permits for construction to begin. brecorderDOTcom/markets/energy/america/102448-canadian-lng-project-finds-buyer-for-its-gas.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358829027638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:30:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358829329810-41</Id><Topic><Title>The greatest day in American history</Title><Username>zachattack1041</Username><Timestamp>1358803236398</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:20:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And, you are the error on this page.................................</Msg><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1358829329810</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:35:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
