It seems just a tad early to be thinking about the 2016 election—unless, apparently, you’re Hillary Clinton. According to Maureen Dowd in The New York Times, she sent handwritten notes to losing congressional candidates and invited big Irish-American donors on a trip to Dublin this week. “She has enormous strength in the Irish-American community because of the Clintons’ massive role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland,” explained the publisher of an Irish-American newspaper. Rumor is that Clinton’s State Department is about to recommend approval of the Keystone Pipeline. (Kevin Lamarque / AFP-Getty Images) Which, to tell you the truth, wouldn’t worry me very much if I was one of Clinton’s possible contenders. True, she’s sewing up the all-important Danny Boy vote—but it’s possible she’s about to dump hot water on another sector of the electorate. That would be the ones who worry about climate change. Young people, they’re called. Also people who have their houses flooded or their farms baked. They’re more of them all the time, somehow—in fact, pollsters find 68 percent of Americans “very worried” about global warming, up from 46 percent in 2009. That’s what happens when the warmest year in American history ends with the widest storm (Sandy) ever measured. But the rumor is that Clinton’s State Department is nonetheless about to recommend approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which the top climate scientists in the nation have unanimously called a terrible idea. As far as I know, though, Clinton’s subordinates haven’t reached out to ask them why. For more than a year now, it’s been one of Washington’s worst-kept secrets that Clinton wants the pipeline approved. And why not? Its builder, TransCanada, hired her old deputy campaign manager as its chief lobbyist and gave lobbying contracts to several of her big bundlers. Leaked emails show embassy officials rooting on the project; it’s classic D.C. insiderism. (And, weirdly, her rumored successor is just as involved—Susan Rice has millions in stock in TransCanada and other Canadian energy companies.) And in one sense it doesn’t make much difference. Everyone in the capital’s also known that the Keystone decision, in the end, will come down to President Obama, who will weigh State’s findings and then rule whether the pipeline is in the national interest. When that happens, we’ll find out if he’s a more modern politician than Hillary, or if he’s still fighting yesterday’s wars too. The first term of his presidency was, in essence, devoted to dealing with the remaining problems of the 20th century. He crossed one off the list—America finally joined the rest of the industrialized world in offering most all its citizens some kind of health care. And he tackled another, with his endless pursuit of that will-o’-the-wisp “energy independence.” “Under my administration,” he boasted last March, “America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years. That’s important to know. Over the last three years, I’ve directed my administration to open up millions of acres for gas and oil exploration across 23 different states. We’re opening up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources offshore. We’ve quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We’ve added enough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the earth and then some.” And he’s right—he’s shown no interest in leaving any carbon anywhere in the ground. Hey, he watched the Arctic melt at a record pace and then he let Shell head up to the open water and drill. One guesses that 50 years from now the only item on Obama’s legacy list anyone will still care about is what he did on global warming. So Keystone will test whether the second term will be more of the same. In his case, of course, he never has to worry about voters, or donors, again. But one guesses that 50 years from now the only item on his legacy list anyone will still care about is what he did on global warming. Will he nibble around the edges, or will he actually take on the oil companies? Keystone will tell the tale. As for Clinton, she doubtless figures four years is a long time, and—even though it’s the one environmental issue in decades that’s brought big crowds of environmentalists into the streets—that voters will forget her stance on the pipeline. Maybe she’s right. But she didn’t get anything else accomplished on climate either—the Copenhagen conference was the biggest bust on her watch. And given that the planet just keeps getting warmer and weirder, it’s possible greens have a memory almost as long as Irishmen.

Sam Brownback said. As the top sorghum-producing state in the nation, Brownback said in a news release, Kansas will benefit by the EPA determination that ethanol produced from sorghum qualifies under the Renewable Fuels Standard Program. “The RFS requires the United States to produce 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022, with an increasing requirement for renewable fuels from noncorn sources,” Brownback said. “This pathway will open the door for Kansas sorghum farmers and Kansas ethanol plants to help meet both the conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel mandates under the RFS.” Some 60 percent of Kansas-produced ethanol comes from sorghum, Brownback noted. In a determination signed on Nov. 30 by EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, the federal agency ruled that grain sorghum ethanol produced at dry-mill facilities that utilize natural gas for processing energy meets the 20 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction threshold necessary to qualify as a renewable fuel under RFS guidelines, the Kansas Department of Agriculture said in a statement. Brownback, the Kansas agency noted, recently sent Jackson a letter urging approval of the sorghum pathway. He also invited Jackson and the EPA staff to visit Kansas ethanol plants that use sorghum grown by Kansas farmers. The new EPA finding also determined that sorghum ethanol produced at plants that use specified forms of biogas as processing energy meets the 50 percent greenhouse gas reduction threshold necessary to qualify as an advanced biofuel, the agriculture department said. The ruling could benefit Western Plains Energy, an Oakley company that is ready to use waste from beef feedlots, swine operations and landfills to generate the methane gas used in its sorghum-produced ethanol plant. A Garden City company, Conestoga Energy, is using carbon dioxide trapped in oil wells as part of its sorghum-ethanol production. “The ingenuity found in Kansas is second to none,” Dale Rodman, Kansas secretary of agriculture, said in a statement. “These ethanol plants, and likely many more, have made significant financial investments necessary to produce ethanol from sorghum and meet advanced biofuel standards.” “Kansas sorghum farmers and ethanol producers are ready and willing to help meet RFS requirements, but have been unable to without the sorghum pathway,” Rodman continued. “Approving the sorghum pathway is a critical step forward in our nation’s quest to become energy independent. Not only will we be able to meet advanced biofuel requirements with domestically produced ethanol instead of importing it from foreign nations, but it will also encourage growth on Main Street.” cjonlineDOTcom/news/2012-12-07/brownback-lauds-epa-ruling-sorghum-ethanol</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355150128853</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:35:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355150747484-5</Id><Title>STOCK A123 THAT MADE HEADLINE IN CONGRESS AT 2 CENTS LOLLLL AONEQ</Title><Msg>WAXIANG TAKE OVER</Msg><Username>aenadeona</Username><Timestamp>1355150747484</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:45:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355153787355-6</Id><Topic><Title>Gold Crash Coming</Title><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1354895223990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:47:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The German authoritarian model refers to government by scientific experts. The idea traces its roots back to the 18th century. The Prussian state set up academies of science and learning to cultivate the administrators and professionals to run the government and society along rational, efficient lines. The American Progressives copied major parts of the German system, especially the education system. The American government (Republican Party) built hundreds of universities, exactly as the German government did, something which the British state of the time refused to do, just as it refused to develop a good secondary education system. American &amp; German science and business methods far surpassed the English in consequence. It was only with American help that the English managed to "win" the world wars at all... The difficulty of a place like Venezuela and Cuba is the utter lack of government for centuries. The Spanish state was always weak and incompetent because it lacked the technical ability to be much else. The Spanish had a very poor education system, and what they did have revolved around the Church and its interests. America will be relatively easy to get in order once it raises taxes and starts systematically using the tools of government to shape and better the society. It may well take the iron fist of government to soften up the opposition in the ghettos and stamp out that worthless culture. There should be no difficulty there... The crash of the various tulip manias mentioned will make it easier for stamp out the culture of individuality and waste which has cropped up in recent decades...</Msg><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1355153787355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 10:36:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355155744133-7</Id><Title>Corporate Split</Title><Msg>In following examples set by MPO and COP, XOM is likely to split exploration and production.
