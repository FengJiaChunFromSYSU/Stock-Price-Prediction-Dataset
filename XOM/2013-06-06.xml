Output was 32,000 barrels a day higher than imports in the seven days ended May 31, according to weekly data from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Production had been lower than international purchases since January 1997. Market shift: OPEC to study U.S. shale boom A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in states including North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas. The surge in oil and gas production helped the U.S. meet 88 percent of its own energy needs in February, the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show. Crude inventories climbed to the highest level in 82 years in the week ended May 24. “The U.S. market is much more comfortably supplied than a few years ago,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “We have a reduced need for imports.” The U.S. pumped 7.3 million barrels a day of oil last week, up 8,000 barrels from the prior week, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. Imports fell 549,000 barrels a day last week to 7.27 million. Up North: Canadian refineries importing US oil at a soaring rate Stockpiles slid 1.6 percent to 391.3 million barrels last week as imports dropped and refineries used more crude to produce fuels. Supplies reached 397.6 million barrels in the week ended May 24, the highest level since 1931. Trend Extension Production climbed 42 percent over the past five years and reached a 21-year high of 7.37 million barrels a day in the week ended May 3. Imports have tumbled 26 percent since May 2008. “This is an extension of trends that have fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/06/05/u-s-crude-output-exceeds-imports-for-first-time-in-16-years/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370492899417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 00:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370493453064-2</Id><Title>Interior Department Approves Up To 4GW Of New Renewable Energy Projects</Title><Msg>Interior Department Approves Up To 4GW Of New Renewable Energy Projects</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370493453064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 00:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370494607297-3</Id><Title>IRFA, E15 retailers fight for blendstock needed for E15 in summer</Title><Msg>Holly Jessen | June 05, 2013 Linn Co-op Oil Co. and Iowa’s other E15 retailers were recently forced to stop selling E15 because oil refiners won’t supply the gasoline blendstock required for the summer months. “Consumers who want a higher grade ethanol blend, in this case E15, are being denied that choice,” said U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa. Braley was part of a June 3 conference call hosted by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association that was held to discuss the petroleum distribution monopoly, one of the tools Big Oil is using to block the sale of higher ethanol blends, said Monte Shaw, executive director of IRFA. In the summer months the U.S. EPA allows E10 to exceed the 9.0 pounds per-square-inch Reid Vapor Pressure requirement by 1 pound from June 1 to Sept. 15 but did not give E15 the same waiver. In order to offer E15 to vehicles model year 2001 and newer, the renewable fuel must be blended with low-volatility gasoline, which is used in markets that require reformulated gasoline. The catch is, although that fuel travels through Iowa via pipeline, E15 retailers are being denied access and therefore must only sell E15 to flex-fuel vehicle drivers or shut down their E15 pumps, as Linn Co-op did. “One of the key things about this is, we’re not asking for something that doesn’t exist,” Shaw said. “The gasoline blendstock we need to make E15 in the summer is available, it flows through the very pipeline system that services Iowa, but they will not let us take it out of the pipeline here.” Earlier this year, a group of Iowa’s E15 retailers sent a letter, asking oil refiners supplying Iowa to provide the summer gas blendstock required for E15, IRFA said. However, as of June 1, no oil refiner has done so. In the meantime, the necessary blendstock travels through Iowa, on its way to Kansas City and Chicago, where reformulated gas is required due to ethanolproducerDOTcom/articles/9915/irfa-e15-retailers-fight-for-blendstock-needed-for-e15-in-summer</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370494607297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 00:56:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370501227274-4</Id><Topic><Title>IRFA, E15 retailers fight for blendstock needed for E15 in summer</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370494607297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 00:56:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great news...

The IG says in memo dated Monday that they will review data and interview EPA staff, environmental groups, industry associations, and scientists. There’s no estimate of when the investigation will be complete. In April the EPA lowered its estimates of natural-gas leaks but some scientists questioned the figures. The issue is important because natural gas emits far less pollution than coal when burned, but those benefits can be offset by leaks of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. A previous IG report found that unreliable estimates on air pollution from natural gas production hinder EPA efforts to police the recent boom in drilling. vindyDOTcom/news/2013/jun/05/epa-investigate-efforts-reduce-methane-gas-leaks/?</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370525791649</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:36:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370525903669-11</Id><Topic><Title>Do your DD on IOGA, Looks ready to bust out</Title><Username>matthewsbrody230</Username><Timestamp>1370522616609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 08:43:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice Info</Msg><Username>fgrayson405</Username><Timestamp>1370525903669</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370526619453-12</Id><Title>With more solar on the way, does Xcel need more gas peakers?</Title><Msg>06/06/2013 by Dan Haugen As the population grows, the economy improves and the climate warms in its service territory, Xcel Energy projects rising demand for electricity on hot summer days before the end of the decade. On April 15, the Minnesota utility proposed meeting that new peak demand by building three 215-megawatt natural gas power plants — one in the Twin Cities and another two in North Dakota. Six weeks later, though, Xcel and other investor-owned utilities in Minnesota were presented with a new legislative mandate to generate 1.5 percent of their electricity from solar by 2020. The state’s new solar standard is expected to spur development of an estimated 450 megawatts of solar power over the next six and a half years, which raises the question: does Xcel still need all three of those gas peaking plants? The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which has already agreed to the need for more generation, will meet today to consider whether some of that need could be met with solar power instead of fossil fuels. The commission is charged with choosing the best plan for ratepayers from five possible proposals, including Xcel Energy’s natural gas plants and a renewable developer’s plan to install more than 30 solar arrays strategically spread across Xcel’s territory. The renewable company, Geronimo Energy, says its 100-megawatt distributed solar project could economically supply about a seventh of the additional generation capacity Xcel Energy expects to require by 2019. Other options include proposals by Invenergy and Calpine Corp. to expand existing natural gas plants in Cannon Falls and Mankato, respectively, and a bid by Great River Energy to sell its surplus electricity to Xcel customers.

I think this for several reasons: they look like very much like us; by process of elimination you can eliminate the places they could not be from and what is left is Germanic; red hair is a highly distinctive genetic marker and common to what the Romans called Celtic and Germanic peoples. I deduce the “Homeric” Greeks were Germanic because their culture was Germanic which one can prove by written records which record an economy based around kingship domains, barter, and land warfare, exactly like what culture of what we know to be German areas, and a culture alien to the Mediterranean peoples. I think most of the Italians are actually Germanic too. Northern Italy certainly is. One need only look at the people, especially the women, and the history to tell. Exactly who the Trojan people were, the ones the Romans claimed to be descended from, is a mystery. There is good evidence to suggest they were in fact Germans from the Carpathians and surrounding lands... In any event they survived for quite some time among highly predatory Germanic peoples which indicates they were probably accepted a racial basis. I’m not going to go through all the world’s peoples. Suffice it to say that most have always been poor and will probably always be poor. The British tried to uplift some of them and failed. Most of the peoples they tried to uplift were as poor when the British Empire fell apart as when the areas were first conquered. Bet on the third world if you like, and allow as many to settle in the USA as you wish. No doubt the left like that strategy. I will bet on Germany, and like minded countries. I don’t claim others could not be like us if they applied themselves and don’t fear them. Nuclear weapons and the power of modern technology makes warfare obsolete between countries at the level of Germany…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370536410657</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:33:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370536909079-25</Id><Topic><Title>I think IOGA is about to go to $1+</Title><Username>palmerthomas471</Username><Timestamp>1370535293884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:14:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will check it out.</Msg><Username>clucas149</Username><Timestamp>1370536909079</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:41:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370537242921-26</Id><Topic><Title>IOGA looks prime for a huge breakout</Title><Username>greenblake246</Username><Timestamp>1370533332565</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:42:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Getting good benefit?</Msg><Username>clucas149</Username><Timestamp>1370537242921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370537773233-27</Id><Topic><Title>I think IOGA is about to go to $1+</Title><Username>palmerthomas471</Username><Timestamp>1370535293884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:14:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am buying this now</Msg><Username>jonathanavila624</Username><Timestamp>1370537773233</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:56:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538999551-28</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon Closing Deal in PNH for the largest GAS FIND in their history</Title><Username>iocrules</Username><Timestamp>1370524789249</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:19:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, another lucrative venture for XOM.

Dlouhy U.S. regulators are giving the oil industry and other stakeholders more time to weigh in on a controversial proposal to stiffen standards for wells drilled on federal lands, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell pledged Thursday. At issue is a proposed rule from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management that aims to boost the integrity of oil and gas wells to prevent contamination, would force companies to disclose the chemicals they pump underground and would make drillers adopt plans for managing water at the sites. Both environmentalists and oil industry leaders had pleaded for extra time to examine the 171-page proposal unveiled last month. Jewell said she would allow an extra 60 days for stakeholders to vet the proposed rule, giving a full three months for review. “That will give ample time for people to express their views on it,” Jewell said, “but we do need to get on with (updating) this regulation that has been over 30 years in place (as) technology has moved forward.” During a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, Jewell said the extension was designed “to provide an opportunity for people to comment on those rules, to determine whether it is problematic for them.” An extra two months should be plenty, Jewell said. “I think that will be plenty of time for them to get comments in,” Jewell told reporters after the hearing. “Many of them have already formulated their comments. It just gives them a little breathing space.” The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management proposed a similar regulation last year but then withdrew it after a flood of critical responses. Stakeholders had 120 days to weigh in on last year’s proposal. The new measure has drawn widespread opposition from the oil industry even though it includes a number of concessions geared toward that sector.

That's fine. It doesn't bother me at all,” Reid said during a Thursday media call without providing a timeline for action. In March, the Senate endorsed the Canada-to-Texas pipeline in a nonbinding amendment to the Senate Democratic budget. That measure garnered 62 supporters, 17 of which were Democrats — though some downplayed their votes. The controversial oil sands project is under federal review at the State Department. Its builder, TransCanada Corp., needs a cross-border permit from the White House to complete Keystone’s northern leg. Reid hinted a vote would happen because Republicans have been insistent on it. "I would assume they would offer amendments any time they want," Reid said. He said the GOP's push for a Keystone vote has held up other efforts, referencing comprehensive energy efficiency legislation sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). The bill's path to the floor has faced obstacles because of disagreements on amendments. That's similar to last year, when Democrats and Republicans alike derailed it because they wanted to tack messaging bills to the legislation. “I have tried to get it on the floor. I tried to do it before immigration,” Reid said. “The Tea Party-driven House — and, frankly, Senate — makes it very difficult.” The bill, which has support from industry, labor and green groups, would encourage the adoption of energy savings technologies and techniques at residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Still, Reid said the bill could end up being a vehicle for a Keystone vote. That could represent a turn from last year, in which several Senate aides have said attempts to add a attach Keystone... thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/303993-reid-keystone-xl-vote-coming</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370557801004</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:30:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370558077055-33</Id><Title>Interior chief says no new drilling in Atlantic as GOP forges ahead</Title><Msg>Zack Colman - 06/06/13 02:03 PM ET Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said Thursday that the White House won’t allow drilling in the Atlantic Ocean while House Republicans are putting the finishing touches on legislation to do so. “We’ve done a five-year plan — it doesn’t include the Atlantic. I don’t expect to go back on that,” Jewell told reporters Thursday after a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. President Obama’s five-year drilling plan, which runs through 2017, doesn't offer any lease sales in Atlantic or Pacific coastal waters. A 2010 draft of his plan included Atlantic waters, but Obama pulled back on it following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill later that year. That’s irked Republicans, who want oil and gas firms to have more access to offshore waters. Earlier Thursday, a subpanel of the House Natural Resources Committee discussed a bill that would open the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling. Jewell’s remark hints strongly that Obama would veto the bill should it ever get to his desk — but Republicans plan to forge ahead regardless. The legislation (H.R. 2231) from committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) is similar to a bill he sponsored last year that cleared the GOP-controlled House. That bill picked up no traction in the Senate. It's unlikely to see the light of day this session, though some Senate Democrats have warmed to the idea. Hastings's bill would require Obama to submit another five-year plan — this one ending in 2020 — that includes zones off the coasts of California, South Carolina and Virginia. The bill “clearly states that the president's plan is unacceptable and it requires him to put a new offshore leasing plan in place by 2015,” Hastings said Thursday in his opening remarks. “In contrast to the president's no-new energy plan, this is a drill-smart plan that focuses energy production in thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/303963-interior-chief-says-no-new-drilling-in-atlantic-as-gop-forges-ahead</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370558077055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370562829808-34</Id><Title>Molycorp Inc.
