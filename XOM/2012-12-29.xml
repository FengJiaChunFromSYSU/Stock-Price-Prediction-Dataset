Cuomo announced today that $250 million is available for a broad range of renewable energy generation projects. This funding is a critical component of Governor Cuomo’s Energy Highway Blueprint that will upgrade and modernize New York’s aging energy infrastructure. Funding for these renewable projects is administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) through the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), and is targeted to electric generation projects that use wind, hydroelectric, solar, biomass or other clean-energy resources. The projects will not only help expand the State’s renewable energy portfolio but will assist the State in reducing its carbon footprint. “As New York State looks to upgrade and improve its energy infrastructure, renewable energy will play an even greater role in providing power that is more reliable, efficient and environmentally sustainable,” said Governor Cuomo. “Through the RPS, the state is investing in its future. These projects will not only help diversify New York’s renewable energy portfolio, but also provide economic development opportunities across the state.” The RPS funding will be awarded competitively, with recipients expected to be announced by summer 2013. “The RPS program has allowed New York State to expand its clean-energy economy by attracting private investment in these medium and large renewable energy projects, which are creating jobs and providing environmental benefits for local communities,” said Francis J. Murray Jr., President and CEO, NYSERDA. “Governor Cuomo’s commitment to diversifying the state’s renewable energy portfolio has positioned New York as a national leader focused on energy security, environmental responsibility and sound energy policy development.” “The generation of electricity from renewable sources increases energy diversity and promotes a better environment for us all,” said Public Service Commission Chairman Garry Brown. “Developing renewable resources, along with our energy efficiency efforts, provides our best hope toward ending dependency on fossil fuels, improving regional economies, reducing harmful emissions, and enabling all of us to gain greater control of our energy future. The Renewable Portfolio Standard ensures that the success of the state’s renewable energy program continues unabated.” New York’s RPS program has been highly successful at attracting investments in clean energy and diversifying the in-state resource mix. The program is expected to yield significant economic benefits to the state. Over the next 20 years, the direct benefits from the projects currently within the RPS program are expected to approach $2.4 billion, and the effects on the broader economy are estimated at more than $4.9 billion. Under the RPS program, NYSERDA has current Main Tier contracts with 54 large-scale renewable electricity generators. The power generated from these projects is expected to provide enough clean power for more than 650,000 homes per year. These projects include two biomass facilities, 10 landfill biogas operations, 25 hydroelectric facilities, and 17 wind farms. poststarnewsDOTcom/topstories/x65620145/GOVERNOR-CUOMO-ANNOUNCES-250-MILLION-FOR-RENEWABLE-ENERGY-PROJECTS-TO-ADD-RELIABLE-CLEAN-POWER-TO-NEW-YORK-S-ENERGY-HIGHWAY</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356764842759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 02:07:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356765275557-5</Id><Topic><Title>GOVERNOR CUOMO ANNOUNCES $250 MILLION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS TO ADD RELIABLE CLEAN POWER TO NEW YORK?S ENERGY HIGHWAY</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356764842759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 02:07:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vt. utility calls for moratorium on renewable energy mandates VIDEO Posted: Dec 28, 2012 3:28 PM MST Updated: Dec 28, 2012 4:59 PM MST By Alexei Rubenstein JOHNSON, Vt. - Vermont Electric Cooperative is asking the Legislature to approve a moratorium on creating renewable power mandates. VEC CEO Dave Hallquist says the utility is concerned about finding balance between rising electric rates and the adoption of a greener power portfolio. "I don't think we've really thought this out entirely. We're kind of looking at this through different perspectives. Our perspective as the boots on the ground utility that has to carry it out says we don't know how it can work even from a physics standpoint," Hallquist said. Hallquist questions the electric grid's technological ability to accommodate renewable generation projects in excess of 20 percent because of the intermittent nature of power like wind and solar. He also says cost-effective energy storage remains a concern. "Carbon is only 4 percent of the electricity carbon footprint of the state, so we've got all this emotional energy. We've got our communities being split and yet were focusing on really the crumbs of carbon. The real issue of carbon is in transportation and heating and cooling and it seems like if we're going to put our energy in and we really want to reduce carbon we would put it on where the biggest contributors are," Hallquist said. The VEC vote comes as some lawmakers have vowed to resurrect a wind moratorium proposal that failed last session. But that will run into sharp opposition from both Gov. Peter Shumlin and House leadership. "I think it's about the most anti-business statement the Legislature could make," said Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier. "I don't think we can move fast enough to move to renewables and I am bound and determined to continue to make the progress we are making in building renewables in Vermont," said Shumlin, D-Vermont. New Department of Public Service Commissioner Chris Recchia says while he understands VEC's concerns, renewables like hydro and biomass are proven base load resources and that ISO, the New England transmission organization, has said there is more room for reliable renewable capacity. Shumlin this fall created an energy sighting commission to analyze how electricity generating projects are permitted, but they aren't slated to finish their work until the end of the legislative session. VEC says the issue is even larger than siting when it comes to relying on the technology behind an ever increasing renewable portfolio. VEC says until there are ways to overcome the hurdles surrounding renewables, natural gas is a good source of low carbon, base load power. wcaxDOTcom/story/20445873/vt-utility-calls-for-moratorium-on-renewable-energy-mandates</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356765275557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 02:14:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356766237673-6</Id><Topic><Title>GOVERNOR CUOMO ANNOUNCES $250 MILLION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS TO ADD RELIABLE CLEAN POWER TO NEW YORK?S ENERGY HIGHWAY</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356764842759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 02:07:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wind energy parks to open 12/28/2012 MCCLATCHY TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE Michigan's two largest utilities opened sprawling wind energy parks in the last month that will play a crucial role in helping the companies meet the state's renewable energy requirements. Detroit-based DTE Energy opened a 110-megawatt wind park in Michigan's Thumb on Friday, while Jackson-based Consumers Energy opened a 100-megawatt wind park south of Ludington on Thanksgiving Day. The companies are racing to meet Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard, a 2008 law that requires all utilities to generate at least 10% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2015. Michigan voters in November rejected a ballot proposal that would have required utilities to get 25% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. With those turbines spinning, DTE and CMS now generate about 7% of their electricity from renewable sources, officials said. DTE and CMS said they are confident they'll meet the 2015 targets. DTE started operating its newest clean energy generator, the Thumb Wind Park in Huron and Sanilac counties, on Friday. The park's 69 turbines are spread out among 15, 000 leased acres of farmland in Bloomfield, McKinley, Sigel, Minden and Delaware townships. It's the first wind park the utility has constructed itself. The company said it also plans to open the Echo Wind Park on 16, 000 acres in Oliver and Chandler townships in late 2013. Collectively, DTE is spending about $500 million to construct the two wind parks, spokesman Scott Simons said. "This project certainly puts us on our way to meeting the state's renewable energy goals," Simons said. "Not only does renewable energy give us the diversity in our generation portfolio, but it's also very good for the environment." CMS completed its 56-turbine Lake Winds Energy Park on 16, 000 acres of leased parcels in Riverton and Summit townships in Mason County. The $235-million park, which finished construction in September and is owned by CMS, opened Nov. 22. The company is also requesting state permits to begin constructing a 150-megawatt wind park in Tuscola County in Michigan's Thumb. "It's still the early days there, but the project's on schedule to start serving customers in 2015," CMS spokesman Jeff Holyfield said. "We've got an aggressive plan in place to meet the 10% standard in 2015." Wind turbines, which spin a generator to create electricity and feed it back into the grid, will provide most of DTE's renewable energy. The company said it would use wind energy to get about 800 to 900 of its 1, 000 megawatts of renewable energy. Biomass, solar and landfill gas will help provide the rest. Drivers navigating the rural public roads that twist through wind parks are often surprised by the fact that the turbines are not clumped together. "One of the reasons for that is to provide as little disruption to the landowners and their neighbors as possible," Simons said. power-engDOTcom/news/2012/12/28/wind-energy-parks-to-open.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356766237673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 02:30:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356778083954-7</Id><Topic><Title>The Emperor Has Spoken!!!</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356736127881</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 18:08:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least it's cold enough that the damn fool has finally rolled down his sleeves.

There were no consequences for them because the British Empire was locked in mortal combat with the enemies of civilization and had very high defence costs, and could not undercut them on taxes - it was a big job conquering the world. The British Empire made good its defence costs by taxing the poor and workers who could not move easily, and, in any event, were in plentiful supply. Other places were under the boot heel of dictators, or still wallowing in barbarity, and presented no competition to their "city on the hill." Very poor global communications made it much harder for owners of capital to move it away from grasping governments. During the Cold War the contest with the Soviets imposed still more barriers, as whichever civilized country one looked to was in the fight. Such barriers do not exist today. If a country provides services with its taxes that is one thing, as the services are counted against the tax burden by objective people and businesses, but if all it is doing is borrowing, taxing, and spending on welfare and the military --bread &amp; circuses-- it will be in serious trouble. People do not have to put up with such policies and won't.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356795571011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 10:39:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356796700164-10</Id><Title>Significant rise in UK’s green power capacity</Title><Msg>Significant rise in UK’s green power capacity 29 December 2012 9.00am. The UK energy minister yesterday revealed a 40% rise in Britain’s green  power capacity — taking total renewable generation to more than 10% of the  country’s energy mix for the first time. Energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey heralded the statistics and said he was “determined” the country would lead a global race for alternative energy as  he unveiled an updated roadmap for the future of the industry. Overall generation across the country climbed by 27% during the 12 months to July 2012, he said, with offshore wind capacity rising 60% and a five-fold increase in the potential wattage from solar panels. Mr Davey’s department said the figures showed that the UK was “on track” to meet interim targets, ahead of a Europe-wide ambition for 15% of all energy to be generated from renewable sources by 2020. “Renewable energy is increasingly  powering the UK’s grid, and the economy too,” he said. “It’s a fantastic achievement that  more than 10% of our power now comes from renewables, given the point from which we started. “Right now, getting new infrastructure investment into the economy is crucial to driving growth and supporting jobs across the country. “I am determined that we get ahead in the global race on renewables and build on the big-money investments we’ve seen this year.” The update identifies 72 strategic actions which have been completed since the latest instalment in July last year, listing a further 38 still recorded as “in progress”. An additional 91 “activities to deliver deployment”, including facilitating access to the grid, overcoming radar interference from windfarms and de-risking and  facilitating investment, are also outlined. Offshore wind developments — seen as crucial to the future economies of  Tayside and Fife thanks to three major  projects within striking distance of  Scotland’s east coast — will be singled out for specific attention, in an effort to reduce costs by around a third by 2020. Reducing developer and operator expenditure to around £100 per MWh is seen by the industry as the key to unlocking significant resources in wind energy. An industry-led Offshore Wind Cost Reduction Task Force has already been established to help manage the process, aiming to help improve capacity in the supply chain and bring forward investment. It is expected offshore wind capacity will extend to 18GW by 2020 if that milestone can be reached. Onshore wind capacity is expected to grow to 13GW throughout the UK in the same period, with much of the increase expected to take place in Scotland. The roadmap also identifies a “healthy” pipeline of biomass projects towards a total 2020 contribution of 6GW, while the Government adds that solar power has “the potential to form a significant part of our renewable energy generation mix”, and could deliver between 7GW and 20GW by the end of this decade. Last week, statistics also showed that Scotland generated enough green power  to cover more than 36% of the country’s gross electricity consumption requirements during 2011. Almost 40% of the UK’s green energy came from Scotland during the period, with more than 26% of the power  generated north of the border being “exported” to other parts of the UK. In the first nine months of 2012 renewable power generation was up 15%. The Scottish Government says it is on course to hit its target for the equivalent of 100% of Scotland’s electricity needs to be met from renewables by 2020. thecourier url at talkstock</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356796700164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 10:58:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356808084993-11</Id><Title>1000 bases in 148 countries but cops in US are afraid to get out of their cars in most major cities</Title><Msg>The American public is mind raped by the Manhattan media as both parties enslave their constituents with unpayable debt.

Over the next four, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency will have to decide whether to take on an even larger industry: Big Oil. Following Lisa Jackson's resignation on Wednesday, her successor will inherit the tricky task of regulating a drilling boom that has revolutionized the energy industry but raised fears over the possible contamination of water supplies. The controversial technique at the center of the boom, hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting millions of gallons of water laced with chemicals deep into shale rocks to extract oil and gas. It has become a flashpoint issue, putting the EPA -- charged with safeguarding the nation's water -- in the middle of a fight between environmentalists and the energy industry. Both sides now eagerly await a major EPA research project into fracking's effects on water supplies due in 2014, as well as final rules on issues including the disposal of wastewater and the use of 'diesel' chemicals in the process. It is unclear who will take the role, but the incoming chief may have a "huge impact" on the oil and gas industry, says Robert McNally, a White House energy adviser during the George W. Bush administration who now heads the Rapidan Group, a consulting firm. On the one hand, energy industry and big manufacturers are warning the EPA not to impede a drilling boom that offers the promise of decades' worth of cheap energy. Meanwhile, environmentalists are pressing President Barack Obama to ensure the drilling bonanza is not endangering water resources. "This administration clearly needs contributors to economic growth for its economic legacy as much as it needs to add to its environmental legacy," said Bruce Bullock of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. "This appointment could be key in seeing which of those two legacies is more important." There are many contenders for the role, but no clear front-runner as yet. Obama may seek an insider to avoid a difficult confirmation process, with possible candidates including Bob Perciasepe, the EPA deputy administrator and interim chief, and Gina McCarthy, who runs the air quality division. Obama is unlikely to win Congressional approval for a heavy-handed regulator, and there is no suggestion of a stringent crackdown. Even Jackson, who suffered withering criticism from big industry and Republicans for her efforts to curb pollution and limit greenhouse gas emissions, has cautiously condoned the practice as safe, while acknowledging the need for greater study and, in some cases, oversight. "(Fracking technology) is perfectly capable of being clean," Jackson said in February. "It requires smart regulation, smart rules of the road." Jackson's successor may now be charged with refining those rules, and both energy companies and fracking critics are anxious about the outcome. Industry body Independent Petroleum Association of America said the EPA has "hindered development" of oil and gas for four years, and looks forward to a new chief who will promote energy drilling "hand in hand" with environmental regulation. Executive director of the Sierra Club environmental group Michael Brune says the EPA has "unfinished business" in addressing things such as the release of methane emissions during fracking. APPETITE TO REGULATE Some analysts say Obama will not risk the economic stimulus of cheaper, domestic energy by pushing for tougher regulations. The oil sector is one of the few bright spots in the U.S. economy; natural gas prices are near their lowest in a decade, a boon for manufacturers, and U.S. oil output is the highest in 18 years. "Even before (Jackson's resignation) there didn't seem to be much of an appetite in the White House to regulate shale drilling on a federal level in the next couple of years," says Nitzan Goldberger, U.S. energy policy analyst with Eurasia Group. But big drillers such as ExxonMobil and Chesapeake who have plowed billions of dollars into shale fields are watching carefully for any sign of new rules or oversight. Mark P. Fitzsimmons, a former lawyer in the Department of Justice's environmental division, and now a partner at Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP in Wash DC, says there is "a risk of overregulation." Some drilling activity has already slowed sharply this year due to the slump in natural gas prices. "Regulatory overlays that add to the cost of production will further slow down development" but won't stop it, he said. While fracking technology has been around for decades, it has only gained widespread use across dozens of states in recent years. The EPA, like many groups, has struggled to keep up with the expansion, according to Government Accountability Office reports released earlier this year. After years in which states were mostly responsible for regulating onshore drilling, the new EPA administrator will be pressed to take a more central role. A year ago, in the first U.S. government report of its kind, the EPA drew a potential link between water contamination in rural Pavillion, Wyoming and fracking, based on samples of ground water from the area. That study has been contested, and subsequent research has been inconclusive. A firmer word on the impact may not emerge until 2014, when the EPA is expected to release the first exhaustive in-depth government study on the long-term effects of fracking on drinking water, commissioned by Congress over two years. While climate change issues and air pollution may remain larger agency priorities, fracking is moving up the agenda. "I don't think they would be capable of ignoring something that Matt Damon makes a movie about," said Fitzsimmons. Damon and John Krasinski star in "Promised Land," a new film that opened on Friday exploring the social impact of fracking. It received mixed reviews from critics, but is being closely watched by an energy industry that fears it could further antagonize public opinion over domestic drilling. A Gallup poll this year showed drinking water contamination is the leading environmental concern among Americans. DIESEL, WASTEWATER AND FLARING The debate rages over a diverse range of issues. While fracking was exempted from the Federal Clean Water Act in 2005, operations that used diesel fuel, which contains a number of toxic chemical compounds, were not exempted. However, what exactly constitutes "diesel" has been a bone of contention among oil firms and environmental groups. "The question is how to define "diesel" - broadly or narrowly," says consultant McNally. "It's a big issue especially for Bakken producers," he said, referring to the region of North Dakota where crude oil output has more than tripled in two years. The EPA published a draft definition in May, which met with criticism from the industry and some legislators, but it will fall to the new administrator to set a final definition. Under Jackson, the EPA also said it would begin to regulate the millions of gallons a day of wastewater that is withdrawn from wells after the fracking process, probably in 2014. This is usually trucked offsite and sometimes re-injected elsewhere, although increasingly it is being reprocessed for further use. And eventually, the EPA could face pressure to backtrack on previous initiatives. In April, the agency relented to pressure from the industry, giving drillers until January 2015 to end the practice of "flaring" excess natural gas from wells that were not connected to pipelines. It had initially proposed that firms cease almost immediately. For Jackson's successor, a central question is whether the EPA takes a broader role in the industry, or, as Jackson hinted a year ago, allows state officials to call most the shots when it comes to drilling: "It's not to say that there isn't a federal role, but you can't start to talk about a federal role without acknowledging the very strong state role." reutersDOTcom/article/2012/12/28/us-epa-fracking-idUSBRE8BR02X20121228</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356811624484</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 15:07:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356811964141-17</Id><Title>Vast majority of gun crime is black on black and 50% of black men are addicted to tobacco</Title><Msg>Yet both parties in DC are aggressivley attempting to confiscate tax paying Americans guns.

It would be a good idea to build some more universities too to train up some more scientists. As the technological frontier is forced outward by the bright light of science (paid for by the ignorant and lazy) the economy will grow much more swiftly. With luck genetic engineering will come on stream quickly, and that promises to be a quantum leap forward in productivity.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1356825754436</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 19:02:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356832500204-23</Id><Topic><Title>Hitler and the 'fiscal cliff'</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1356808129652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 14:08:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>with no solution, there could be revolution.
