The economy promptly crashed. During the summer of 1982 the US Congress debated a tax increase: "Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982." The bill was introduced because bankers and other influential people ordering their Republican contacts that Reagan's irresponsible policies were going to have to stop. Reagan signed the tax increase into law 3 September 1982.--- that was just about the exact bottom of the 1982 recession. Further tax increases followed in 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987. Between them the tax increases fully reversed the 1981 tax cut - except who paid the taxes was different.

People outside the US have two uses for dollars: buying dollar assets or buying US exports. If one buys a dollar of US assets they cannot buy a dollar of US exports with the same dollar. In other words, the US fiscal deficit causes a reduction in US exports, and the reduction of US exports shows up as a decline in US industry and jobs, and the US trade deficit. Tax cuts like Reagan and Bush passed, and which Obama extended his first 4 years simply increase the budget deficit and destroy US industrial and manufacturing jobs as US exports decline. Foreign purchases of US assets also create major assets bubbles as the foreign buyers have no other use for the dollars and will buy irrespective of price. If US price levels rise because of Federal Reserve pumping of stocks and bonds, the US trade deficit just widens, destroying even more US jobs as foreign production displaces American production. The policy of higher prices and low tax cuts and deficit finance is not a sustainable one. The reason you cannot foresee a sustainable solution with such policies is because there is none. The economy will self-correct by forcing prices to come down as the American economy rots out from the fiscal and trade deficits. If the US government refuses to change its policies the forcing action will come by a crash in the stock, bond and bond market where most of the foreign buying is concentrated. When prices have come down, and US healthcare and other prices of government services fall, then the entitlement programs are much more affordable...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358446390958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:13:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358446641635-19</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon Mobil Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>roomvlabobbie</Username><Timestamp>1358442296694</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:04:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just joined.</Msg><Username>lichensteinchristina</Username><Timestamp>1358446641635</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:17:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358448681190-20</Id><Title>Printing $40B+ each and every month.</Title><Msg>Ben is XOM's Best.

The facility has a pretty substantial solar carport of about 375 kilowatts to help boost it over the four megawatt mark, but the real meat of the solar power system is a 4.1 megawatt, ground-mounted, low-concentration photovoltaic power plant. Overall, the two systems will generate about 10 million kWh of electricity and save the Army about $930,000 each year. PHOTO Yep, World’s Largest Low-Concentration Solar Power System At 4.1 megawatts, the new White Sands array easily beats out the previous record holder for low-concentration solar power, which is (was) a 2 megawatt installation that went online in Puglia, Italy just last spring. Though low-concentration systems are not as efficient as high-concentration systems, they make economic sense for utility-scale operations where real estate is cheap and plentiful. For U.S. Army Solar Power, Such Thing as a Free Lunch The $16.8 million White Sands system, which covers about 42 acres of the 3,200 square mile missile range (plenty of room for more!), cost the Army nothing up front. The project was developed as a power purchase agreement, which is familiar ground in the solar industry. Basically, a power purchase agreement makes real estate available to the solar installer, whether it’s an individual rooftop or a utility-scale power plant. The property owner doesn’t pay anything up front for the solar equipment, but commits to purchasing the power it generates at an agreed-upon rate for a certain period of time (in this case, 25 years). Siemens, Inc. built the system at White Sands, and the company will operate it and be responsible for its maintenance. The actual ownership belongs to Bostonia Bank, which financed the installation in partnership with the Army Corps of Engineers. The Army has been pursuing this type of power purchase agreement hand over fist for the past couple of years. Back in 2011 it established a special Energy Initiatives Task Force to streamline the pipeline for utility-scale installations at Army facilities, relieving individual base commanders from having to reinvent the wheel with each project. The White Sands Solar Power Plant The bulk of the installation consists of more than 15,000 solar panels mounted on proprietary STS-Azimuth trackers developed by Solaria Corporation, which also provided the solar modules for the previous record-holder in Italy. The trackers enable each module to continuously adjust to the most advantageous angle, and squeeze more energy out of the sun throughout the day. The Azimuth tracker consists of a single vertical axis which supports 20 solar modules. Unlike horizontal-mounted trackers, the Azimuth tracker permits the panels to rotate rather than simply tilt. Solaria estimates that the Azimuth tracker enables it to yield about 30 percent more energy than horizontal trackers. The single axis configuration also helps reduce cost by cutting down on the need for site preparation, which in turn enables it to be installed fairly quickly compared to other types of energy systems. The White Sands project broke ground in April 2012 and it was ready for action in December 2012. Solar Power is Only Half the Battle Impressive as it is, the new solar power plant will only supply about 10 percent of the energy needed by the White Sands facility, and that underscores another critical aspect of the Army’s emerging energy policy. Rather than focusing narrowly on new sources of energy, the Army has also embarked on an ambitious energy “culture change” initiative called “The Power is in Your Hands.” The goal of the new initiative is to merge new technology with new behaviors, resulting in an “energy-informed culture” in which energy users are keenly aware of their responsibility for reducing the real life-and-death risks involved in providing energy to military facilities overseas. Given the risks and impacts of energy production here at home, that’s a lesson the civilian sector can take to heart, too.

Altering the course of US energy policy after decades of supporting the fossil fuel industry, the Obama administration has managed to put in place the policies and institutional framework and is capitalizing on it. Winds off the US Atlantic coast could produce enough clean, renewable electricity to power at least one-third of the entire US or the entire East Coast from Maine to Florida, at least theoretically, according to a study performed by a Stanford University research team. Key to realizing all this potential is building the high-voltage transmission lines that would carry and deliver the electricity generated via offshore winds to urban centers and other areas. With sponsors including Google, Marubeni, private equity firm Bregal Energy and Belgium transmission system operator Elia, the Atlantic Wind Connection announced January 14 that it had selected New Jersey as the the for the first phase of a project that entails laying a high-voltage, direct current (DC) electricity transmission backbone under the US Atlantic seabed that would stretch from New York City to Virginia. AWC Phases IMAGE Blow, Wind Blow Independent transmission company Trans-Elect and Atlantic Grid Development are AWC’s project developers. With a planned capacity of 3,000 megawatts (MW), the so-called New Jersey (NJ) Energy Link is to extend the length of the Mid-Atlantic state, linking offshore wind energy resources and consumers in northern, central and southern Jersey, according to Atlantic Wind Connection’s (AWC) press release. Winds in the Mid-Atlantic region’s shallow Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) hold more than 60,000 MW of offshore wind energy potential, according to assessments performed under the aegis of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The Dept. of Interior and BOEM last May paved the way forward for an environmental review of AWC’s build-out, issuing a finding of “no competitive interest” and granting Atlantic Grid Holdings LLC right-of-way. Building a backbone for the transmission of electricity produced from these offshore winds is the most efficient and effective means of enabling offshore wind power project developers to build out offshore wind turbine arrays and deliver clean, renewable electricity where it’s needed, AWC and offshore wind power proponents assert. An offshore Atlantic power transmission backbone would also lay the groundwork for building a new marine clean energy industry, one that would provide jobs, income, investment returns and tax revenue while avoiding the carbon and greenhouse gas emissions that result from burning coal and fossil fuels to generate electricity for generations to come, they add. Clean, Renewable Electricity for Nearly 2 Million Households When completed, the AWC will be able to carry as much as 7,000 MW of offshore wind energy to consumers along the US East Coast, enough for some 1.9 million households, according to AWC. With a project plan that envisages construction extending from 2016-2026, Atlantic Grid Energy intends to build out the offshore transmission backbone in five phases at an expected cost of $6.311 billion. Completing the project would enable transmission of clean, renewable offshore wind power to consumers in NY, Pennsylvania, NJ, Delaware, Maryland, Washington D.C. and Virginia. According to a project analysis performed by IHS Global Insight, the AWC transmission backbone would be able to deliver 3,417 MW of electrical power to consumers in NJ (44% of AWC’s total capacity); 1,015 MW to those in Delaware (13%); 1,013 MW to those in Maryland; and 2.297 MW to consumers in Virginia (30%). IHS projects that the NJ Energy Link will create more than 20,000 jobs in the state, injecting $9 billion into NJ’s economy and adding some $2.2 billion to the state treasury. These figures are based on construction of offshore wind turbines in NJ OCS waters with a total capacity of 3,400 MW. Contrary to opponents’ contention that building out the AWC and offshore wind farms will increase electricity rates to consumers, AWC contends that the NJ Energy Link will reduce them by improving the flow of electricity to minimize energy peaks that cause high prices; moving the cheapest and cleanest energy to where it is needed, when it is needed; and minimizing costly upgrades to the grid. “The NJ Energy Link can make the grid more reliable and lower the cost of energy in New Jersey by delivering both offshore wind and conventional electricity to where it is needed and when it is needed along the coast, whether that be southern, central or northern New Jersey,” AWC CEO Robert Mitchell asserted in the company’s press release. Addressing critics who point to the intermittent nature of wind power generation, AWC says the offshore transmission backbone will be able to supply electricity to consumers 100% of the time, “not just when the wind is blowing.” More Cleantech Content You Might Like: US Atlantic Offshore Wind Energy Bidding Proposal Announced By Obama Administration 300,000 Jobs and $200 Billion Economic Potential from U.S. Offshore Wind South Carolina Offshore Wind Farm Could Produce Thousands of Jobs, Billions in Wages and Governme ...

Obviously this is a theoretical exercise, and 100 percent of the planet’s electricity needs are not actually going to be filled through solar. But several credible scenarios suggest that solar could provide about 30 percent of global total electricity in 2050, up from the 0.1 percent it provides now. By going through the numbers, the Solar PV Atlas demonstrates both the practical feasibility of renewable energy, and the possibility of harmonizing solar energy with conservation goals: The atlas considers electricity demands in seven diverse regions and calculates the area (land or roof) that would be needed for PV to meet these demands. In each of these cases, less than one per cent of the region’s total land cover would be required to host solar PV panels in order to meet one hundred per cent of the region’s projected electricity needs in 2050, taking into account solar resources and predicted electricity consumption and demographic changes. […] With its selection of diverse areas, the atlas illustrates that PV technology, when well-planned, does not conflict with conservation goals. On a macro level, no country or region must choose between solar PV and space for humans and nature. Quite the opposite. As climate change threatens humans and the environment, it is more important than ever to work for the efficient and wide-scale adoption of well sited, responsibly and effectively operated renewable energy generation facilities. Environmental protection and renewable energy can and must develop in parallel. In the map of Madagascar above, the small read and blue squares represent the land area needed for solar to meet 100 percent of the country’s projected electricity needs in 2010 and 2050, respectively. They’re drawn to scale relative to the map, in order to provide a straightforward visual comparison. The Atlas also goes through Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa, Turkey, and the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh as examples. “The regions represent diverse geographies, demographics, natural environments, economies and political structures,” the Atlas points out. “They receive different average levels of sunshine, and all show vast potential for widespread development of solar PV.” The Atlas builds on the earlier Energy Report from the WWF, which anticipates a total drop in global energy production by 2050. That’s due to increased efficiency outpacing population growth, thus allowing the same energy needs to be met with less energy. At the same time, it anticipates renewable-based electricity ramping up massively, finally displacing all other forms of electricity by 2050. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/01/17/1460431/solar-world-land/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358453361373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:09:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358453686731-30</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Solar Could Meet All The World’s Electricity Needs In 2050 Using Under One Percent Of World’s Land</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358453361373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:09:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In pursuit of the LNG market it's likely less expensive to develope renewable energy.

Obama also is promising to address climate change, an issue he has acknowledged was sometimes overlooked during his first term. "The president has been clear that tackling climate change and enhancing energy security will be among his top priorities in his second term," said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. While the administration has made progress in developing renewable energy and improving fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles, "we know there is more work to do," Stevens said. He'll have to do that work with new heads of the agencies responsible for the environment. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Environmental Protection chief Lisa Jackson and Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have announced they are leaving. Energy Secretary Steven Chu is expected to follow his colleagues out the door in coming weeks. The White House says no decisions have been made on replacements for any of the environment and energy jobs but says Obama's priorities will remain unchanged. One of the first challenges Obama will face is an old problem: whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas. Obama blocked the pipeline last year, citing uncertainty over the conduit's route through environmentally sensitive land in Nebraska. Gov. Dave Heineman is considering a new route; he is expected to make a decision next month. The State Department has federal jurisdiction because the $7 billion pipeline begins in Canada. The pipeline has become a flashpoint in a bitter partisan dispute. Republicans and many business groups say the project would help achieve energy independence for North America and create thousands of jobs. But environmental groups have urged Obama to block the pipeline, which they say would transport "dirty oil" from tar sands in western Canada and produce heat-trapping gases that contribute to global warming. They also worry about a possible spill. If the pipeline is approved, "the administration would be actively supporting and encouraging the growth of an industry which has demonstrably serious effects on climate," 18 top climate scientists wrote in a letter to Obama this week. Obama also faces a choice over whether to promote a boom in oil and natural gas production that has hampered growth of nontraditional energy sources such as wind and solar. The emergence of cheap, plentiful natural gas in particular poses a dilemma for Obama, who supports gas development as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels that trigger global warming. Many environmental groups who support the president are wary of natural gas and are critical of drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing that allow drillers to gain access to reserves that formerly were out of reach. Hydraulic fracturing, also known as "fracking," involves injection of water, sand and chemicals underground to break up dense rock that holds oil and gas. The Obama administration has said it will for the first time require companies drilling for oil and natural gas on public and Indian lands to publicly disclose chemicals used in fracking operations. The proposed rules also would set standards for proper construction of wells and wastewater disposal. Environmental groups are pushing the administration to do more to crack down on fracking, while industry groups and Republican lawmakers say federal rules are unnecessary, since states already regulate the drilling practice. The natural gas boom "puts the administration in an interesting position. They can be aggressive and look at natural gas for the possibilities it brings, or they can bow to the environmental community, which is not interested in more natural gas drilling," said Frank Maisano, a Washington spokesman for a range of energy producers from coal to wind. The Environmental Protection Agency also is expected to forge ahead with the first limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. The administration has imposed rules on new plants but is expected to move forward on rules for existing plants, despite protests from industry and Republicans that new rules will raise electricity prices and kill off coal, the dominant U.S. energy source. Older coal-fired power plants have been shutting down across the country, thanks to low natural gas prices and weaker demand for electricity. Environmental groups also hope Obama will use his executive authority to protect more wild places, through creation of national monuments and other steps. The last Congress was the first since the 1960s not to designate a new wilderness area. "We're hoping he can leave a legacy for conservation of public lands and have a real vision for it," said Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Obama's second term will be pivotal in the fight against climate change, which he called the "singular issue of our time for anyone who cares about clean air, clean water and a safe future for our families." Brune urged Obama to take "swift, decisive action to prevent more erratic weather, superstorms and wildfires." Top contenders to replace Salazar include former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes and John Berry, head of the Office of Personnel Management and a former director of the National Zoo. A host of green groups are backing Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva. Gregoire also is under consideration for the EPA slot, along with Jackson's deputy, Bob Perciasepe, and the head of the agency's air and radiation office, Gina McCarthy. University of Maryland Prof. Donald Boesch, who served on Obama's 2010 oil spill commission, is a leading candidate to replace Lubchenco at NOAA. huffingtonpostDOTcom/2013/01/17/obama-second-term-energy_n_2498833.html?ref=topbar</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358471762186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:16:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358472062370-33</Id><Title>Saskatchewan leader urges Obama to approve Keystone XL pipeline</Title><Msg>Saskatchewan leader urges Obama to approve Keystone XL pipeline Thu Jan 17, 2013 6:35pm EST By Jeffrey Jones CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The premier of Saskatchewan led 10 U.S. state governors on Thursday in urging President Barack Obama to approve TransCanada Corp's contentious and long-delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline, citing energy-security benefits in both countries. Saskatchewan does not have the massive oil sands resources that neighboring Alberta does and which would move in large volumes to the southern United States in the proposed $5.3 billion conduit. But it does have some of the Bakken light oil reserves that would also be shipped. "The energy relationship between the United States and Canada is vital to the future of both our countries. It is an interest we share, transcending political lines and geographic boundaries," Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said in a letter to Obama. Wall pointed out that U.S. oil imports from Canada could reach 4 million barrels a day in seven years, twice the amount now imported from the Gulf region of the Middle East. "The Keystone XL Pipeline could also provide the critical infrastructure required to transport growing U.S. domestic production from the Bakken shale region to market," Wall wrote. The governors of Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming, all Republicans, were also signatories to the letter to Obama supporting the project, which would move more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day to southern Nebraska from Canada. A decision by the State Department on whether to approve the pipeline is expected by the end of the first quarter, though some analysts expect that timing to slip. TransCanada faces staunch opposition from environmentalists, who warn of the increased risk of oil spills. On Thursday, The Natural Resources Defense Council, Pembina Institute and others pressed their case in Washington by saying the project would foster increased oil sands development in Alberta and surging carbon emissions. Obama rejected TransCanada's application last year, saying it must stake out a new route around the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska. TransCanada resubmitted its application last spring. The $2.3 billion southern section of the project, between Oklahoma and Texas, is already under construction as it did not require a presidential permit. Absent from the list of governors was Dave Heineman, the Republican leader of Nebraska. His state's environmental regulator recently issued an assessment on the new path that said Keystone would have little impact on a major aquifer and that any spill cleanup would be paid for by TransCanada. Heineman is expected to decide soon whether to approve the new route. Among environmental groups pressing for rejection, Oil Change International said emissions from a byproduct of refining oil sands, known as petroleum coke, have so far been unaccounted for. Petcoke can be burned like coal by utilities. Most previous assessments of emissions linked to oil sands have not examined emissions from burning the substance, the group said. The Oil Change report said the fuel emits 5 percent to 10 percent more carbon dioxide than does coal. Concern about climate change has increased after a series of extreme weather events last year, including Hurricane Sandy, widespread drought and the warmest year on record in the United States. Representative Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Keystone should be stopped. "We know that climate change is happening now, we have to fight it now, and we must say no to this pollution pipeline now," Waxman said in a release Alberta Premier Alison Redford, whose provincial coffers are highly dependent on oil exports, said Obama's administration was already fully aware of her position supporting Keystone XL. caDOTreutersDOTcom/article/businessNews/idCABRE90G1F320130117?sp=true</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358472062370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:21:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358472598239-34</Id><Title>OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Departing EPA chief says ‘Be Green’</Title><Msg>OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Departing EPA chief says ‘Be Green’ By Ben Geman and Zack Colman - 01/17/13 06:32 PM ET thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/277877-overnight-energy-departing-epa-chief-says-be-green</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358472598239</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:29:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358472714325-35</Id><Title>NRA Filth and Glenn Beckistan...</Title><Msg>How does the NRA Celebrate the slaughter of 20 6 year olds?

The goal of the Atlantic Wind Connection is to act as a transmission "backbone" for a new U.S. offshore wind industry, connecting offshore wind farms to the on-shore electrical grid. The completed project will stretch from New Jersey to Virginia, but the company announced earlier this week it would build the New Jersey span first. Construction on the "New Jersey Energy Link" is set to begin in 2016 and be in service by 2019. Today the company said Bechtel would serve as its engineering, procurement and construction contractor and Alstom will be its high-voltage direct current technical adviser for the New Jersey phase. "Bechtel and Alstom are global leaders in the design and execution of complex power projects and both have successfully completed projects across the globe," said Robert Mitchell, CEO of the Atlantic Wind Connection. Of course, neither company has built wind farms off the U.S. east coast, that's because the U.S. isn't yet in the offshore wind game. New Jersey in 2010 passed a widely praised law setting up an Offshore Renewable Energy Certificate incentive program, but the program has yet to be implemented. The most advanced plan for a wind farm off the New Jersey coast is Fishermen's Energy's plan for a demonstration wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City. The company is currently waiting to find out if it will be accepted in the OREC program. The Atlantic Wind Connection is a partnership between Trans-Elect and Atlantic Grid Development. Google, Begal Energy, Marubeni Corp. and Eurogrid International are also sponsoring the project. njbizDOTcom/article/20130117/STATEST/130119862/Contractors-named-for-wind-energy-transmission-project?template=state-street</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358473654255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:47:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358474008598-37</Id><Title>25 Poet plants extract enough corn oil for 68 MMgy of biodiesel</Title><Msg>25 Poet plants extract enough corn oil for 68 MMgy of biodiesel By Poet | January 18, 2013 Twenty-five of Poet’s network of 27 biorefineries have now installed its patent-pending corn oil technology, bringing its total capacity to approximately 250,000 tons per year, enough feedstock to produce 68 million gallons of biodiesel annually.

San Diego-based Person received a $1.35-million grant to add pumps that distribute fuel with an 85-percent ethanol mix – i.e. E85 – at 19 new gas stations throughout the Golden State. Pearson, which estimates that the number of California's flex-fuel vehicles runs into the "hundreds of thousands," estimates that the pumps will displace more than 2.7 million gallons of traditional gas a year and will cut greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 25,000 tons annually. The company, which received its grant from the California Energy Commission (CEC), already distributes E85 at about a dozen stations throughout the state, including locations in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose. Selling gas with a higher ethanol content has been a hot-button issue of sorts, with proponents saying it cuts foreign-oil dependency and helps US farms while opponents claim that it's bad for the environment, creates food shortages and can damage engines. The US Environmental Protection Agency last June legalized public sales of a 15-percent ethanol blend (E15), which has 50 percent more ethanol that current standard fuel. Some states such as Maine have gone as far as saying they may ban sales of E15. Despite having the most registered vehicles in the US, California trails states such as Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa when it comes to E85 stations. Of the country's approximately 2,500 E85 stations, 88 are in California, according to the US Energy Department. Pearson Fuels' press release is available below. Show full PR text Pearson Fuels Awarded $1.35 Million to Build an Additional 19 E85 Stations in California State's Largest E85 Marketer to Double Flex Fuel Stations Retail Network SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pearson Fuels of San Diego, Calif. has announced that it has been granted $1.35 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to assist in its expansion of its retail flex fueling network. The funds will be used to install E85, a high blend of ethanol and gasoline, into 19 traditional retail gasoline stations across California. It is expected that the project will displace approximately 2,754,218 gallons of gasoline per year as well as reduce greenhouse emissions by approximately 25,082 tons per year. The funding was made available through CEC's Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. "There are hundreds of thousands of flexible fuel vehicle owners in California who have been burning imported oil in their vehicles for years while a domestically produced, renewable and cleaner burning fuel is available" In the United States, the high blend of ethanol used in E85 continues to be produced primarily from corn. However, there have been major technological improvements that have contributed to more advanced production plants and a more advanced fuel made from agricultural waste products and other non-food sources. The California Imperial Valley has several such plants in the development process. "There are hundreds of thousands of flexible fuel vehicle owners in California who have been burning imported oil in their vehicles for years while a domestically produced, renewable and cleaner burning fuel is available," said Mike Lewis, Pearson Fuels General Manager. "The problem continues to be a significant shortage of retail stations where the public can buy the fuel, with less than 45 retail E85 Flex Fuel Stations in the entire state. The CEC's funding, matched with our own and that of the retail fuel station owners will go a long way towards addressing that shortage." Lewis said stations will be strategically located in areas where significant numbers of flex fuel vehicles are currently underserved by flex fuel stations. Stations are planned for 19 different communities from San Diego to South Lake Tahoe. Pearson Fuels opened in 2003 as the world's first alternative Fuel Depot. From inception the Pearson Fuel Depot offered a number of firsts in what most people thought was the mature retail fueling industry. Specializing in bringing alternative fuels to the public, the Fuel Depot brought the first E85 station to the west coast of the US, the first Biodiesel station to San Diego and the county's first dual pressure CNG station. Using lessons learned from the Fuel Depot, Pearson grew to become California's largest wholesale E85 distributor and has a large biodiesel blending project nearing completion in McClellan, CA. Several retail hydrogen projects and compressed natural gas stations are also in development.

The spread ballooned 5.1 cents a day after the Energy Information Administration said ethanol stockpiles last week climbed 2.6 percent to 20.4 million barrels, the highest level in four weeks, while production sank to 784,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since the Energy Department’s statistical arm began reporting data in June 2010. “Stocks have been building,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena, Illinois. “The production report was really negative. Not a good sign there.” The grain-based additive was 42.94 cents cheaper than gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities, the biggest one-day widening since Dec. 26. The spread was 37.84 cents yesterday. Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 0.4 cent to $2.339 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have advanced 9.2 percent in the past year. February-delivery gasoline rose 4.7 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.7684 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange as U.S. economic data boosted optimism that fuel demand will increase. In cash market trading, ethanol in New York gained 0.5 cent to $2.415 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive was unchanged at $2.385, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Ethanol in Chicago increased 0.5 cent to $2.315 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive jumped 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.46. Corn Declines Corn for March delivery slipped 6.75 cent, or 0.9 percent, to $7.245 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from 30 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock. Aemetis Inc. (AMTX), a U.S. ethanol producer, idled production at its plant in Keyes, California, citing “unprofitable market conditions for corn ethanol,” and will upgrade the operation to also make fuel from sorghum, it said today. Abengoa SA (ABG), a Spanish engineering and renewable energy company, said yesterday it idled output at ethanol mills in York and Ravenna, Nebraska, until market conditions improve. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-17/ethanol-s-discount-to-gasoline-expands-second-day-on-supply-glut.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358475179775</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:12:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358476886591-40</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Filth and Glenn Beckistan...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1358472714325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:31:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing is as sickening as you wahleee boy.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1358476886591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:41:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358476969675-41</Id><Title>OPEC cuts oil output to 14-month low amid economic uncertainty</Title><Msg>OPEC cuts oil output to 14-month low amid economic uncertainty Posted on January 16, 2013 at 7:00 am by Bloomberg Comments(0) OPEC reduced its production to the lowest level in 14 months as budget wrangles in the U.S., uncertain impact of stimulus measures in Japan and Europe’s struggle to boost growth cloud outlook for fuel demand. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut output by 465,000 barrels a day in December to 30.4 million, the lowest since October 2011, led by a reduction in Saudi Arabia, the group said today in its monthly report, citing secondary sources. That’s 800,000 a day more than the average 29.6 million the group estimates it will need to provide this year. OPEC kept is 2013 global demand forecast unchanged. “Fiscal uncertainties persist,” OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said in the report. “The U.S. is not the only country faced with fiscal challenges” as the impact of stimulus in Japan is unclear and “there remains some uncertainty about the near-term future development” in Europe. Brent crude futures, trading at about $110 a barrel in London today, advanced 3.5 percent last year as threats to supply in the Middle East were balanced by risks to demand from Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. budget dispute. The drop in OPEC production last month is the steepest since March 2011, when Libya’s exports were halted during the uprising against deposed leader Muammar Qaddafi. Group output remains 400,000 barrels a day more than the collective target of 30 million reaffirmed at the organization’s most recent meeting in December. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, cut output by 420,800 barrels a day in December to 9.2 million, OPEC said. The second-largest decline last month was in Iraq, where supplies fell 196,300 barrels a day to 3 million. Production also dropped in Iran, by 20,400 barrels a day to 2.7 million. In addition to supply data compiled from secondary sources, OPEC also provides production numbers submitted directly by member countries. Saudi Arabia pumped 9.023 million barrels a day in December, according to its submission. The number is the same as that given by a person with knowledge of the Kingdom’s oil policy on Jan. 10. “Saudi Arabia cut its oil output significantly in December,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. OPEC boosted estimates for supplies from outside the group by about the same amount as it lowered projections for demand for its own crude. Non-OPEC producers such as the U.S., Canada and Brazil will bolster output by 900,000 barrels a day to 53.9 million this year, according to the report. That’s about 85,000 a day more than OPEC estimated last month. Global oil demand will increase by 760,000 barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, this year to 89.6 million barrels, OPEC said. OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to meet in May. The International Energy Agency, an adviser to consuming nations based in Paris, will publish its next monthly forecasts of supply and demand on Jan. 18. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/01/16/opec-cuts-oil-output-to-14-month-low-amid-economic-uncertainty/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358476969675</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:42:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358484820850-42</Id><Title>Belgium plans artificial island to store wind power</Title><Msg>Belgium plans artificial island to store wind power Thu Jan 17, 2013 12:06pm GMT * Island planned for North Sea, 3 km off Belgian coast * Would be doughnut-shaped with a reservoir in the middle * Will take five years or more to build BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Belgium is planning to build a doughnut-shaped island in the North Sea that will store wind energy by pumping water out of a hollow in the middle, as it looks for ways to lessen its reliance on nuclear power. One of the biggest problems with electricity is that it is difficult to store and the issue is exaggerated in the case of renewable energy from wind or sun because it is intermittent depending on the weather. "We have a lot of energy from the wind mills and sometimes it just gets lost because there isn't enough demand for the electricity," said a spokeswoman for Belgium's North Sea minister Johan Vande Lanotte. "This is a great solution," she said, adding she thought it could be the first of its kind. Excess energy would be used to pump water out of the centre of the island, and then the water would be let back in through turbines when demand outpaces supply. Vande Lanotte revealed the plans during a presentation at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge late on Wednesday. Belgium plans a complete exit from nuclear power as soon as enough energy from alternative sources becomes available, but last year it postponed the closure of its oldest reactor for a decade over energy supply worries. In 2011, around 57 percent of Belgium's energy came from nuclear power. Belgium hopes eventually to generate 2,300 MW from its network of North Sea wind farms, which could replace a significant part of either of its two nuclear sites, Doel and Tihange, which each generate about 3,000 MW. The island is still in the planning stages, but will be built out of sand 3 km off the Belgian coast near the town of Wenduine if it gets the final go-ahead. The island, which would also work as an offshore substation to transform the voltage of the electricity generated by wind turbines, could take five or more years to plan and build. It won't be until Elia, Belgium's power grid operator, strengthens the power lines leading out to the coast. "One of the driving elements is the reinforcement of the grid onshore towards the coast," a spokeswoman for Elia said. Belgium's nuclear power operator Electrabel, a division of France's GDF Suez, shut down two of its reactors last year while it investigates cracks found in the reactor casing.
