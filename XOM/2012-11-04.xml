The storm’s blow to New York City — the world's media capital — at the apex of the White House race is drawing widespread attention to climate change and extreme weather. It also underpinned New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's endorsement Thursday of President Obama, which he explained by saying Sandy brought the election stakes into “sharp relief.” Media attention to climate has grown as well, most memorably on a Bloomberg BusinessWeek cover that plastered the words “It’s Global Warming, Stupid,” over a picture of a flooded New York City street. Climate change, in short, is having its moment after being shut out of all three presidential debates last month. “This hurricane can, in fact, potentially move the needle in terms of opinion about climate change. Whether that translates into policy actions, that’s a much bigger question,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. Environmentalists don’t want to let the moment slip away and are using the storm to renew their push for curbs on carbon emissions. “I do think there has been a political realignment of the climate issue as a result of Sandy,” said Joe Mendelson, director of global warming policy for the National Wildlife Federation. “I think whoever is in office coming out of the election will have to recognize that climate has to be dealt with.” The last several years have been a mixed bag for climate advocates in Washington. They lost big when a sweeping emissions-capping bill fell apart on Capitol Hill, but scored long-sought victories on climate regulations and mileage standards for automobiles. Tuesday’s election is a crossroads for the movement: Mitt Romney has vowed to scuttle rules from the Environmental Protection Agency that he says will harm the economy, while advocates hope that Obama would press ahead in a second term with policies such as carbon standards for existing power plants. It’s unclear how Sandy will affect it all. But there’s plenty of evidence that a single event can leave a lasting mark on the nation’s energy and environmental policies. The 2010 BP oil spill lead to tougher safety rules, while a huge winter storm that year probably helped bury climate legislation in the Senate (even though scientists say extreme snowfall does not disprove global warming). Further back in time, the nuclear accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island in 1979 helped stop new reactor construction in the United States for 30 years. But after years of gridlock on climate and energy issues, it’s far from certain that Sandy will shake things up in Washington, D.C. Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of communications at Boston University, said he doesn’t expect a sea change in climate politics comparable to Three Mile Island. “Thirty years ago media was so much more centralized, there was much more of a cohesive theme in coverage of something like that,” he said. “In another two months, most people are going to go back to the key issue that they have seen as important over the last several years, and that is the economy and what effect is it having on their family,” he said. House Republicans, who are expected to retain their majority on Election Day, say that their drive to scuttle EPA climate change rules will continue unabated in the next Congress. “Our legislation protects America jobs and middle class families — the reckless cap-and-tax agenda promoted by President Obama’s EPA will destroy American jobs and hurt middle class families,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Undaunted, environmentalists have quickly worked Sandy into their political messaging in the closing days of the 2012 elections. “In the aftermath of a year marked by devastating droughts, floods, and wildfires, topped off by the havoc wrought by the Superstorm Sandy, the decisions we make on these energy issues will determine whether we power our nation with dirty fuels that will make our climate crisis even worse, or clean energy that creates new jobs while protecting our planet and our families,” states a Sierra Club memo circulated Friday afternoon on the stakes in 2012. Hurricane Sandy arrived after a year that already saw record-setting heat waves, drought and massive western wildfires. Scientists say that warmer ocean waters and greater atmospheric moisture from climate change are fueling the power and precipitation from storms. But scientists are far more cautious about attributing the existence of a storm to climate change, and say it’s hard to determine whether global warming played a role in weather patterns that pushed Sandy west into New York and New Jersey. The storm hit amid a shift in polls that has found growing public agreement with the overwhelming view among scientists that climate change is underway. A Pew Research Center poll released in mid-October found 67 percent of Americans say there is solid evidence of global warming. That’s four points higher than 2011 and 10 points higher than 2009, although it remains well below the 77 percent who held that view five years ago. A Yale University-George Mason University poll released in October showed that 74 percent of Americans believe that global warming is affecting weather in the United States. “Sandy arrives amidst all of that other extreme weather experience and our data shows that many people are starting to connect the dots,” said Yale’s Leiserowitz. Mendelson predicted that opponents of actions to curb emissions would increasingly find themselves in political jeopardy. “There is no question that efforts to stop taking action on climate change will face some headwinds coming out of Sandy,” he said. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352002689216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 00:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352004158718-2</Id><Title>INVEST IS RIGHT AS USUAL</Title><Msg>IT WAS SEPT 11th -- and still, Obama insisted it was not a terrorist attack and blamed a video. For days he blamed the video. He failed to immediately send fighter jets into the sky to disperse the terrorists, even though he could have and should have. Obama covered up his own failure and threw the man who made the video in jail (what about the 1st Ammendment???). If Obama didn't know it was a terrorist attack then he is too dumb to be president, and if he knew it and lied, then he should be impeached. Fighter jets should have been sent into the sky over the consulate and CIA house immediately. EVEN THE DOPES WORKING FOR OBAMA KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK. NOBODY WITH ANY SENSE EVER THOUGHT THE VIDEO HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. This coverup is way worse than Watergate. Nobody died in Watergate. AS USUAL, INVEST IS RIGHT. Any way you look at it, Obama FAILED. His foreign policy is a FAILURE and he is complicit in the deaths of 4 Americans through at the very least, incompetence. There will always be attacks and deaths and mistakes, but the lies and the cover-up and the MASSIVE INCOMPETENCE by Obama is almost beyond belief. He should be immediately impeached.</Msg><Username>carrieanneamerica</Username><Timestamp>1352004158718</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 00:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352028557523-3</Id><Title>Bill maher says blacks coming after who vote rommey</Title><Msg>I keep contact with the black community and there not any plans here where I am for a riot.And I think i'll cover my front windows just in case for tuesday.

Scotland beat its 31% target for 2011 by about 4%. “When I became first minister in 2007, I inherited a target for 50 percent of Scotland’s electricity to be produced by renewable sources by 2020,” said Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. “We now know that we can achieve much more than that, more quickly, having already exceeded our 2011 target.” As the first minister said, the renewables industry is really a “massive economic opportunity,” not something that would be a negative for the country. The new target could add up to the 11,000+ green energy jobs in Scotland, especially after this last year, a ‘bumper year’ for investment, with an estimated £2.3 billion investment in renewables projects. Scotland plans to meet these ambitious goals by further development of offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects. The country is also aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2020.

Hence the efforts to exclude millions. Example? There was no sympathy from the state for Floridians who have reportedly waited as long as eight hours to vote early, prompting Florida Democrats to file an emergency lawsuit Sunday morning. The suit, filed in Miami federal court, seeks extended voting hours because of "inadequate polling facilities." "The extraordinarily long lines deterred or prevented voters from waiting to vote," the filing claims, according to the Miami Herald. "Some voters left the polling sites upon learning of the expected wait, and others refused to line up altogether. These long lines and extreme delays unduly and unjustifiably burdened the right to vote." Despite previous calls from prominent Democrats and Monroe County's Republican Supervisor of Elections Harry Sawyer, Republican Governor Rick Scott has steadfastly refused to keep polls open beyond an 8-day early voting period that ended Saturday at 7 p.m. -- or make that 1 a.m., when the last waiting voter in Miami-Dade was finally able to cast a ballot. "We think that the hours we have right now are the best hours we've ever had," Chris Cate, a spokesman for Florida's elections division, told the Herald during the week. Lines were especially long in Miami-Dade County, where by 7:25 a.m. Saturday two of the county's 20 early voting stations were already suffering 5-hour wait times. Six of the locations listed wait times of six or more hours on Saturday afternoon, hampered perhaps in part by a hefty ballot that was 10 pages for most voters. Florida's GOP-led legislature cut the number of early voting days down from 14 to 8 last year, eliminating the Sunday before Election Day but keeping the number of maximum hours the same. The move was signed into law by Scott and approved by federal courts. But previous governors, including then-Republican Charlie Crist and party stalwart Jeb Bush, both extended early voting hours by executive order when demand was high.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1352045716159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352045817439-12</Id><Topic><Title>Today's Right Wing Mainstream Republican Doesn't Want US Citizens To Vote</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1352045716159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:15:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brain death on display.

The hopes of those days went unfulfilled.” The endorsement also ticks off a list of reasons for why the daily tabloid is backing Romney in 2012 – including smaller paychecks, fewer jobs and higher subway fares and gasoline prices. “America’s heart, soul, brains and muscle -- the middle- and working-class people who make this nation great -- have been beset for too long by sapping economic decline,” the editorial continues. “So, too, (have) New York breadwinners and families.” Beyond the rhetoric, the paper backs up its decision with a salvo of numbers after the 2008 financial crisis – including a 7.9 percent national jobless rate and nine million fewer jobs. The paper also points out the hometown crowd, with some of the most well-educated and well-paid residents in the country not spared. The median household income for a New York family dropped by $54 a week over that period, the paper also points out. The Daily News joins nearly a dozen other major U.S. newspapers in switching endorsements from Obama to Romney, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project. Only one newspaper, The San Antonio Express-News, which endorsed the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain, has switched to endorsing Obama, according the survey. The 11 papers, according the study, that also switched to Romney are: The New York Daily News Long Island Newsday Houston Chronicle Fort Worth Star-Telegram Orlando Sentinel Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel Nashville Tennessean Des Moines Register Illinois Daily Herald Los Angeles Daily News Los Angeles Press-Telegram</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352077583673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:06:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352077765589-43</Id><Title>I guess this is fine with libs</Title><Msg>since Apple is a democrat supporting company. Apple paid less than 2 percent in taxes for profits generated outside of the U.S. in the last fiscal year. The company paid $713 million in taxes on $36.87 billion in foreign profits, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Sunday Times was the first to spot the figure. In comparison, Apple paid $12.26 billion in federal taxes for profits generated in the U.S., and $1.06 billion in state taxes. Apple, like many other global companies, generate much of its profits overseas where tax rates are more favorable. But the profits are often stuck overseas, because they would be taxed at the higher 35 percent U.S. corporate rate if they were brought home, a process known as repatriation. Many companies, such as Cisco Systems, have argued for tax relief for the repatriation of foreign profits. As defenders note, what Apple is paying overseas isn't illegal, and the company isn't even using any tax loopholes in avoiding paying higher taxes. Forbes pointed out that in the U.K., corporations that don't have a branch in the country don't pay taxes on profits they generate in that country, since they are supposed to paid back in the home country. But there have been increasing calls for large technology companies that do have a presence overseas to pay a higher share of taxes. ZDNet's Zack Whittaker's writes that companies such as Apple and Amazon don't pull enough of their weight when it comes to paying corporate taxes. While he notes that no companies are breaking any rules, there needs to be a reform of the regulations. These technology giants are playing by the rules, but the problem is the rules are broken. Who sets the rules? The government. And yet the government all but takes it out on the individual taxpayer by making them drag the country out of economic downturn kicking and screaming. For Apple, foreign profits are an increasingly important stream as the U.S. market begins to mature. While demand for Apple products remains high here, there are few willing consumers who don't already own an Apple product, dampening its growth prospects down the line. As a result, emerging markets such as China and India are seen as the drivers of Apple's future profits. It doesn't hurt that the tax rates are lower over there either.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352077765589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:09:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352078351051-44</Id><Topic><Title>Today's Right Wing Mainstream Republican Doesn't Want US Citizens To Vote</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1352045716159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:15:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like you will soon be joining wahleeee boy in the asylum.

There is hope without Obama. We're Americans and we will fight to get America back to what it was before the Obama disaster. Americans DO NOT WANT OBAMA TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE FOR REDISTRIBUTION. HE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND CHANGE AMERICA into something we would not recognize. Despots around the globe have announced their support for Obama.
