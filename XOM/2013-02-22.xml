Ernest Moniz, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and familiar presence in Washington, has emerged as the front-runner to replace Steven Chu as Obama’s energy chief. That’s not sitting well with green advocates, who say Moniz’s support for natural gas is at odds with the risks of “fracking,” the controversial drilling process, and the need for tough steps to address climate change. “Moniz is a status quo pick at a time when we can’t afford the status quo,” said Tyson Slocum, who heads the energy program at Public Citizen. Sources tracking the selection process say Obama is leaning strongly toward picking Moniz, who served as undersecretary of Energy in the Clinton administration and currently directs the MIT Energy Initiative. The Cabinet decision arrives at time when environmentalists are putting intense pressure on the president to confront global warming. They held a major rally last weekend in Washington, D.C., urging Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and take steps to reduce carbon emissions. Moniz has argued that natural gas can play a major role in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and serve as a “bridge” to a low-carbon future, riling activists who believe that fracking creates risks to water supplies and other harms. A major 2011 study the MIT energy program released said that environmental risks of developing gas from shale formations, which is achieved through fracking, are “challenging but manageable.” Bill Snape, the senior counsel with the Center for Biological Diversity, said he’s concerned that Moniz’s support for natural gas could bring a shift in focus away from the development of renewable electricity and smart-grid technologies. “The concern I have with him is, he has the veneer of this MIT PhD scientist, that somehow he is going to be objective, and in reality he could very well be a political hack for the natural gas industry,” Snape said. The group Food &amp; Water Watch has launched a petition urging Obama not to nominate Moniz. “Moniz is a proponent of using natural gas as a ‘bridge fuel’ to renewable energy. But in reality, fracking for natural gas only prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels, while contributing to global climate change and polluting our scarce fresh water resources,” the group said. The tensions over Moniz’s possible nomination reflect a broader conflict over natural gas and its impact on climate change. Natural gas emits much less carbon than coal when burned for electricity, but some critics — including Al Gore — fear that the methane from production sites will negate that advantage, since it is a potent greenhouse gas. A 2011 report by outside advisers to the Energy Department (DOE) said that negative view of gas is “not widely accepted,” but noted that more data collection and analysis is needed on the fuel's climate footprint. Moniz is also pro-nuclear, writing in 2011 that it would be a “mistake” to allow Japan’s nuclear disaster to “cause governments to abandon nuclear power and its benefits.” “As greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, finding ways to generate power cleanly, affordably, and reliably is becoming an even more pressing imperative. Nuclear power is not a silver bullet, but it is a partial solution that has proved workable on a large scale,” he wrote. The U.S. branch of Greenpeace took shots at Moniz over Twitter when his name became prominent in reports about potential replacements for Chu. On Feb. 8, the group urged Obama to fill his Cabinet with “real leaders” and not “fracking cheerleaders,” and, citing Moniz’s views on nuclear energy, asked Obama “what are you thinking?” But the criticism of Moniz is hardly bubbling up from across the environmental movement. A number of the largest, most politically connected groups, such as the National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, have not expressed concerns about his selection. And environmentalists can also find things to like in Moniz’s background. The 2011 MIT gas study says that for greenhouse gas reductions greater than 50 percent, which advocates say will eventually be needed to avoid the most dangerous climate change, displacing coal with natural gas won’t always cut it. “For more stringent CO2 emissions reductions, further de-carbonization of the energy sector will be required,” he told a Senate committee in 2011, citing the need to move to renewables and other non-emitting sources of energy. His research also supported putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions, which is the goal of many major climate proposals. And on fracking, the MIT group’s study backs mandatory disclosure of chemicals used in the process and minimizing environmental impacts through regulation. But some environmentalists' views on fracking go well beyond calls for disclosure and oversight. The Sierra Club, one the nation’s biggest groups, offered a warning to the potential DOE nominee. “Were Mr. Moniz to be appointed Secretary of Energy, we would stress to him that an ‘all of the above’ energy policy only means ‘more of the same,’ and we urge him to leave dangerous nuclear energy and toxic fracking behind while focusing on safe, clean energy sources like wind and solar,” said Melinda Pierce, the Sierra Club’s legislative director. It’s unclear how much sway Moniz would exert over Obama’s second-term climate and energy agenda. While he may have Obama’s ear, DOE lacks formal jurisdiction over a number of major energy and climate topics that will confront the president in his second term. It’s the Interior Department that decides what federal lands and waters to make available for drilling and imposes some of the regulations, while the Environmental Protection Agency handles potential carbon rules for the nation’s coal-fired power plants. While Chu brought high-profile focus to green energy, a huge portion of the Energy Department’s budget is devoted to securing and managing the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile and cleaning up contamination at sites that produced nuclear materials. But DOE also has a major role in supporting green technology development. And the department is weighing a series of controversial industry applications that together would greatly expand U.S. natural gas exports. Greenpeace, in a statement Thursday, declined to again criticize Moniz directly, but fired several shots across the bow on energy exports and other topics. "The Department of Energy will play a key role in determining if industry is allowed to undercut President Obama's climate commitments by exporting fossil fuels abroad,” said Kyle Ash, Greenpeace’s senior legislative representative. “Whoever leads DOE should ensure that investments in safe solutions like renewable energy and improved efficiency become central to DOE's mission.” Moniz’s MIT Energy Initiative has attracted attention for its support from major energy companies such as BP, Shell, Chevron and others. A spokeswoman for the MIT group said that as of late 2011, 74 percent of the Initiative's outside-funded research projects were about renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon management and storage technologies, “innovation and investment,” and other areas such nanotechnology, basic energy sciences and biotech. Moniz would replace another physicist, the Nobel Prize-winning Chu, but if confirmed he would arrive with much more Washington, D.C., experience than his predecessor. In addition to his work in the Clinton administration, Moniz remains a familiar face in Washington, testifying at a number of Capitol Hill hearings through the years. Moniz is currently a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and served on the “blue ribbon” commission on nuclear waste policy that Obama created in 2010 and issued a final report a year ago. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/284331-rumored-energy-pick-stirs-fears-on-left</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361538684418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:11:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361540776959-5</Id><Title>Best way to invest in Advanced Energy...</Title><Msg>Real estate in München, Stuttgart, Ludwigshafen.

The proposed limits for any given year would be no more than five percent or one million gallons, whichever is greater, of total volume of cellulosic biofuels commercially available for the most recent calendar year. In response, Bob Dinneen, RFA President and CEO said this is worse than irony. “Now that truly meaningful investment is being made in cellulosic ethanol companies that can be witnessed by the steel in the ground and actual production and introduction of millions of gallons of advanced ethanol into the marketplace, the Congressman wants this nation to turn its back on progress — turn back the clock to days of petroleum domination,” said Dinneen. “Americans want fuel choice, they want cost savings, and they want American energy independence. America is noted worldwide for its ingenuity and creativity. Ethanol, especially the next generation that is now coming to fruition before our eyes, is the epitome of the American spirit. Rather than encouraging that uniquely American entrepreneurial spirit, Congressman Sensenbrenner would limit the growth in advanced biofuels to no more than five percent per year. Clearly, far faster growth will occur if the RFS is left to work as designed. But in any case, I wonder if Congressman Sensenbrenner would agree to a five percent cap on the growth of non-conventional petroleum from fracking in the same spirit he is trying to cap advances in biofuels to five percent. Why limit the speed of progress toward energy independence from any domestic resource?” concluded Dinneen. domesticfuelDOTcom/2013/02/18/sensenbrenner-introduces-bill-to-cap-cellulosic-fuels/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361542700101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:18:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361543146733-7</Id><Topic><Title>Sensenbrenner Introduces Bill to Cap Cellulosic Fuels</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361542700101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:18:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ACE Says Desperation Motivating ‘Big Oily Food’ Appeal To Supreme Court Posted on 21 February 2013 by Gary Truitt Executive Vice President of the American Coalition for Ethanol, Brian Jennings today was critical of the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) and the Grocery Manufacturers Association’s (GMA) effort to appeal rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals that they groups did not have standing to sue over E15. “Big Oily Foods’ cozy and self-serving relationship to do whatever it takes to stop consumers from access to safe and affordable E15 fuel is dripping with highly-saturated desperation. First these groups convince a couple Members of Congress to introduce legislation which would overturn EPA’s science-based decision to approve E15 for 2001 and newer model year cars. Now, after their lawsuits against EPA have been rejected by lower courts, they are appealing to the Supreme Court to help protect their profitable status-quo.” “With gasoline prices on the rise for 35 days in a row, American-made E15 will help drivers save money at the pump. The gap between ethanol and gasoline prices has widened, making E15 a much more affordable and attractive option for retailers and consumers. As we have said before regarding the so-called study by CRC cited by API as a reason to stop E15: the definitions of “pass” and “fail” and the cars selected for testing were carefully chosen to produce the results the study’s funders wanted. The Department of Energy has pointed out that the CRC tests included engines with known durability issues, and that one of the engines even failed while running on straight gasoline with no ethanol.

The rules are being considered by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission even though the state does not yet have any of the shale oil or gas production that have proven controversial elsewhere in the nation. Fracturing technology has been used for decades in Alaska, but without the complications associated with the shale boom farther south, said commission member Cathy Foerster. Alaska's oil and gas is produced entirely from conventional rock formations, which are porous and permeable. And with the North Slope's permafrost, remoteness from residential areas and other characteristics, most Alaskan operators are able to avoid the conflicts that have arisen in the lower 48 states, she said. But shale production could be in Alaska's future, she added, as could concerns over the large amount of fracturing that is required to draw hydrocarbons out of non-permeable, non-porous shale rock. One company, Anchorage-based Great Bear Petroleum LLC, holds leases to about 500,000 North Slope acres and is planning several exploration wells to test shale-oil prospects south of the nation's two largest oil fields. The company is targeting shale rock that was the geological source of oil in the porous rock that holds the giant Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk reservoirs, Foerster said. "If there's any correlation between the conventional rocks and the source rocks, then we ought to have something fabulous. But who knows?" Foerster said. According to a U.S. Geological Survey report issued a year ago, the North Slope could hold up to 2 billion barrels of shale oil and 80 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. It was the first-ever USGS estimate for North Slope shale resources. The AOGCC aims to have clear fracturing regulations in place before anything happens, Foerster said. Apart from the proposed well-water testing before and after any fracturing procedures, landowners and well operators within a quarter mile of the sites must be notified and the fracturing chemicals must be disclosed. The AOGCC wants more comprehensive disclosure than what the companies already voluntarily disclose to a national database, Foerster said. "We want to be able to monitor things a little more closely so we can have a good feel for what's going on." The commission has scheduled an April 4 hearing on the proposed rules. Foerster said she hopes they will be in place by the end of the year, after the required public and legal review. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/02/22/alaska-fracking-idUSL1N0BM08620130222</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361545981417</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:13:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361546757261-9</Id><Title>New management plan allows petroleum development on nearly half of sprawling Alaska reserve</Title><Msg>New management plan allows petroleum development on nearly half of sprawling Alaska reserve New management plan for Alaska petroleum reserve By DAN JOLING | ASSOCIATED PRESS | Feb 21, 2013 3:48 PM CST in US A new management plan for the vast National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska splits the Indiana-size area roughly in half between conservation areas and land available for petroleum development, and allows pipelines carrying oil or gas to be constructed through the federal reserve. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Thursday he had signed a record of decision for the reserve west of Prudhoe Bay and south of Barrow on Alaska's North Slope. He said the balanced approach under the plan was the result of extensive local testimony. "This comprehensive plan will allow us to continue to expand our leasing in the NPR-A, as has happened over the last three years, while protecting the outstanding and unique resources that are critically important to the culture and subsistence lifestyle of Alaska Natives and our nation's conservation heritage," Salazar said. Perhaps as important to the petroleum industry was the commitment to access through the reserve for a pipeline that can connect oil drilled offshore in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to the trans-Alaska pipeline. The management plan provides "explicit confirmation" that potential pipelines carrying oil or gas can be constructed through the reserve, Salazar said in his announcement. The Bureau of Land Management manages the reserve and estimates that lands made available for development contain nearly three-fourths of estimated economically recoverable oil and over half of the estimated economically recoverable gas. The reserve covers 23 million acres, and access to petroleum will be allowed on 11.8 million acres that are estimated to hold 549 million barrels of recoverable oil and 8.7 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. Salazar in August released details of a preferred alternative, and his signing of the management plan was expected. The department received more than 400,000 public comments. Salazar characterized the reserve an "iconic place on our Earth." The reserve is home to the 325,000 animals in the western Arctic caribou herd and the 55,000 animals in the Teshekpuk caribou herd. Hunters from 40 northern and western Alaska Native villages rely on the caribou as a subsistence resource. The plan through an expansion of a Teshekpuk Lake Special Area continues restrictions on development near renowned habitat for migratory waterfowl, including black brant, Canada geese and greater white-fronted geese. It also creates the Peard Bay Special Area and enlarges the Utukok River Uplands Special Areas, boosting special areas in the reserve from 8.3 million acres to 13.35 million acres. Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska regional director for The Wilderness Society, said Peard Bay is important for its wetlands and waterfowl habitat. The entire coast is habitat for threated polar bears plus seals and walrus looking for places to rest as more summer sea ice melts, she said. Utukok River Uplands, she said, is primary calving grounds for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd and provides elevation and breezes where the animals can get relief from insects. Wilderness Society President Jamie Williams in a statement called the plan a fair and thoughtful decision that balances conservation, Alaska Natives' needs for subsistence resources, and the nation's demand for energy. Joshua Reichert of Pew Charitable Trusts called the decision the Obama administration's crowning land conservation accomplishment to date. But Brendan Cummings, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said by email that additional areas should have been protected. "Like most things Obama, this plan is better than the Bush-era plan it replaces but far short of what we need in terms of both energy policy and protection of our most sensitive wildlands," he said. "In an era of dangerous climate change, we simply should not be opening up any of our public lands to fossil fuel development." Alaska elected officials contend the management plan is too restrictive. Republican Rep. Don Young called the plan "another game of smoke and mirrors." The department ballyhooed pipeline routes through the reserve but potential routes do not appear realistic, Young said. "The Department of Interior has once again caved to environmental special interest groups, and unfortunately today's finalized plan will do nothing but further restrict potential oil and gas development in a petroleum reserve established to ensure America's energy security." U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, said the department ignored a request from the village of Nuiqsut, located within the reserve, for more area south of Teshekpuk Lake to be made available for leasing. "No one disputes the importance of Teshekpuk Lake to waterfowl and caribou, but I think we should listen most closely to those who live there and depend on both these critical subsistence resources as well as the economic opportunity resource development can bring," he said in a statement. Previous management plans covered the northeast and northwest areas of the reserve. The new plan is the first that covers the entire reserve. newserDOTcom/article/da4j9c600/new-management-plan-allows-petroleum-development-on-nearly-half-of-sprawling-alaska-reserve.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361546757261</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:25:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361548136692-10</Id><Title>new supercomputers for energy and other uses...</Title><Msg>SuperMUC in München/Garching, finished in 2012 and in operation now... speed: 2.9 X 10^15 floating operations per/sec...the fastest computer in Europe; a more than 1,000,000 fold increase in speed in less than 20 years...

The EPA has already begun an inter-agency study of methane, air toxins and other pollutants released when oil and gas are tapped using the process, called fracking, Gina McCarthy, the head of the agency’s air office, said in a letter to the Inspector General’s office that was released yesterday. “We have identified emissions information for oil and natural gas production as a critical need,” McCarthy said in her letter, which was dated Nov. 16. McCarthy is the leading candidate to be nominated by President Barack Obama to head the EPA, according to people briefed on the plans. Gas released by fracking, in which water, chemicals and sand are shot underground to break apart underground shale and free trapped gas or oil, has contributed to a boom in production that has lowered prices for the fuel. Methane, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming, is the main component of natural gas. As fracking starts to free gas from the rock, some methane is released. The amount emitted into the atmosphere can offset the benefits of burning natural gas over coal to generate power, Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth said in a 2011 study. Other scientists and industry groups have said both the EPA and Howarth overstate the amount of emissions, and say drillers have an economic interest in capturing and selling the gas escaping from their wells. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-21/fracking-emissions-get-review-after-epa-watchdog-report.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361555534179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:52:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361556921918-16</Id><Title>Progress In The Big Apple — NYC Mayor Bloomberg Targets 1/3 Electric Taxi Fleet By 2020; Largest Bike Share In Country</Title><Msg>Progress In The Big Apple — NYC Mayor Bloomberg Targets 1/3 Electric Taxi Fleet By 2020; Largest Bike Share In Country February 22, 2013Cynthia Shahan Mayor Bloomberg addressed urban issues in his recent “State of the City” address, sharing with the crowd news of more structural implementation of clean air: “[T]he biggest change to our transportation network in ages is coming this summer: the largest bike share program in the country. I know Marty can’t wait. Bike share has been successful and popular in every city it’s been tried — and here, it will offer New Yorkers more options to get around town faster.” Electric Taxi Fleet In addition to the bike-sharing program, Bloomberg is aiming to have one-third of the NYC taxi fleet be electric vehicles by 2020, the most ambitious such effort I’ve seen. To help that along, he has also announced 10,000 new EV charging spots in the Big Apple. All of these transportation initiatives will help us achieve one of PlaNYC’s top goals: giving New York the cleanest air of any big city in the country. Remember: Clean air means you live longer. Even if you don’t care about climate change, cleaning our air is good for your health. Speaking of climate change, we’ve reduced our carbon footprint by 16 percent in just five years. Now, we’ll challenge the city’s leading corporations to join City government in cutting their carbon footprints by 30 percent in ten years. —Mayor Bloomberg So, with the many urban efforts to abandon what does not work, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is working to implement what does work. Together with City Council, Bloomberg plans to amend the city’s building code so that up to 20% of all new public parking spaces in private developments will be wired and ready for electric vehicles, creating up to 10,000 parking spots for electric vehicles over the next seven years.

Energy Secretary Steven Chu will take questions and talk about the industry’s growth during a Google+ Hangout about the solar industry at 2pm ET/1pm CT. We’ll be showing it live here. Solar industry experts will join him to talk about “how this domestic renewable energy source is creating jobs, strengthening our nation’s manufacturing capabilities and providing Americans with affordable, clean energy.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/22/live-energy-sec-chu-addresses-us-solar-power/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361559524104</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:58:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361559755595-20</Id><Title>U.S. quadruples pipeline tax break cost to $7 billion</Title><Msg>U.S. quadruples pipeline tax break cost to $7 billion Posted on February 22, 2013 at 6:59 am by Bloomberg in Pipelines A tax break used by oil and gas pipeline companies such as Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) will cost the U.S. government $7 billion through 2016, about four times more than previously estimated, Congress’s tax scorekeepers said this month. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation quadrupled its cost estimate for exempting the fast-growing “master limited partnerships” from corporate income tax in the year ended in September to $1.2 billion from $300 million. The annual cost will rise to $1.6 billion by fiscal 2016, the committee said. The revision reflects the growth of tax-free publicly traded partnerships. They have taken over the U.S. pipeline business and are expanding into the rest of the oil and gas industry, partly by gobbling up dozens of tax-paying companies. With President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans calling for a tax overhaul, the higher cost estimate may make it harder for industry to protect the MLP subsidy, said John Buckley, a tax professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “A bigger number always means it’s a bigger target,” said Buckley, who as a Democratic congressional aide helped draft the 1987 law that included the partnership exemption. Canada ended a similar break in 2011, saving an estimated $500 million a year. Wind, Solar Lawmakers led by Senator Chris #$%$, a Delaware Democrat, are pursuing a proposal to extend the MLP break to renewable energy companies such as wind and solar-power producers. Proponents in both chambers of Congress introduced bills last year that failed to win passage. #$%$ plans to reintroduce the bill in March, said Ian Koski, a spokesman for the senator. The estimate increased primarily because the latest data show MLP’s are generating more income than before, said Thomas Barthold, the chief of staff of the committee, in an e-mail. The market value of the MLP industry has grown to about $370 billion, more than double its size as recently as 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pretax income for about 90 MLP’s rose to a record $16.9 billion in 2011, Bloomberg News reported last month. Last year, the committee estimated the cost of the MLP exemption at $1.4 billion for the four years ended in 2015. The new estimate pegs the cost during those same four years at about $5.4 billion. Linn Acquisition Today, Linn Energy LLC (LINE), a Houston-based publicly traded partnership that produces oil and gas, said it agreed to buy Berry Petroleum Co. (BRY) for $2.42 billion. It’s the first time a publicly traded partnership has bought a listed oil and gas producer that’s a tax-paying corporation, or “C-Corp,” Linn said in a statement. The transaction will “demonstrate how much value can be created by tax-efficiently converting a C-Corp with the right assets into an MLP,” said Kolja Rockov, Linn’s chief financial officer, on a conference call. Berry, based in Denver, set aside $81.3 million for corporate income taxes in the first three quarters of 2012, after recording a $142.2 million tax benefit in 2011 because of a net loss. MLP’s don’t pay corporate income taxes because they’re structured as partnerships, and they don’t distribute taxable dividends. Individual members pay personal income tax on any profits, offsetting to some extent the government’s loss of revenue. Energy Exception In 1987, six years after large businesses started forming publicly traded partnerships, Congress passed a law requiring them to pay the same taxes as corporations, a rate that is currently 35 percent. The law included an exception for industries involving oil and gas and other natural resources. Since then, the pipeline industry has mostly shifted to the partnership structure. Two of the biggest are Houston-based Kinder Morgan, run by billionaire Richard Kinder, and Enterprise Products Partners LP. The law spurs investment in energy infrastructure that outweighs the cost of the lost tax revenue, said Mary Lyman, the executive director of the National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships. She said MLP’s that transport and store oil and gas spent $113 billion on capital investment from 2007 to 2012. Good Ratio “You compare that to even the higher estimate. That seems like a good benefit to cost ratio,” Lyman said. Corporate tax overhauls outlined by both Obama and Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would lower the corporate tax rate while eliminating some breaks. Any reduction in the corporate rate would lower the cost of the subsidy for MLP’s, even if their special tax status is left in place, Buckley said. Investor demand for MLP equity securities, known as partnership units, has led a variety of companies from outside of the pipeline business to convert to the form. New MLPs that went public in the past two years include CVR Partners LP (UAN), which uses refinery byproducts to make fertilizer, and Hi-Crush Partners LP (HCLP), which digs up the sand used in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. Congress expanded the break in 2008 to include companies that transport and store biofuels such as ethanol. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/22/u-s-quadruples-pipeline-tax-break-cost-to-7-billion/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361559755595</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361564205815-21</Id><Title>Fed Bullard says printing will be essentially endless</Title><Msg>Ben is XOM's Best.
