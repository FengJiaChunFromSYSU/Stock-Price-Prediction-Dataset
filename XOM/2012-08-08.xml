Three projects are expected to complete their federal permitting process as early as December. The single largest project in the suite is a 3,000-megawatt wind farm in Wyoming called the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Farm Project by the Power Company of Wyoming. The Interior Department said it expects to complete the federal permitting process for the largest proposed wind farm in North America by October 2014, according to a White House statement. The remaining six projects include Mohave Wind Energy by BP Wind, Quartzsite Solar Energy by Solar Reserve, Desert Harvest Solar Energy by enXco, McCoy Solar Energy by NextEra, Moapa Solar Energy Center by RES Americas, and Silver State South by First Solar. RES Americas’s center in Nevada is being jointly developed on public lands as well as the Moapa River Indian Reservation. The White House said streamlining the review process is part of a wider administration effort to make the permitting for infrastructure projects more efficient while also protecting the environment. Additional expedited infrastructure projects will be announced in “the coming weeks,” according to the White House. http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/obama-administration-moving-on-seven-renewable-energy-131324.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344401413000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 00:50:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344401439000-3</Id><Title>Twenty Five U.S. Senators Ask EPA to Adjust Ethanol Mandate</Title><Msg>Twenty Five U.S. Senators Ask EPA to Adjust Ethanol Mandate By Mario Parker - Aug 7, 2012 4:57 PM MT 0 Comments Twenty-five U.S. senators including Dianne Feinstein asked the Environmental Protection Agency to adjust the country’s ethanol mandate, adding to calls for the Obama Administration to take action. In a letter today, the bipartisan group of senators urged EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to use her waiver authority because of the record corn prices caused by the most severe U.S. drought in 56 years. Ethanol will be produced from 38 percent of this upcoming year’s crop, down from 41 percent last year, according to government estimates. Today’s letter follows an Aug. 1 petition from a coalition of 156 representatives in the House of Representatives that asked Jackson to lower or suspend the U.S. requirement, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard or RFS, to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline this year and 13.8 billion in 2013 because of the effect the drought will have on corn yields and food prices. “We ask you to adjust the corn grain ethanol mandate of the RFS to reflect this natural disaster and those new market conditions,” the senators wrote in today’s letter. “Doing so will help to ease supply concerns and provide relief from high corn prices.” Corn for December delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $8.005 a bushel in Chicago. Futures rose to a record $8.205 on July 31. Ethanol Falls Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.6 cent to $2.572 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 17 percent this year. A telephone message left for Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based ethanol trade group, after normal business hours wasn’t immediately returned. “Calls to waive any or all of the RFS from the livestock lobby, oil industry or their allies in Congress are not only premature, but void of justification,” Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen said in an Aug. 2 statement in response to last week’s letter. Ethanol producers have responded to the record corn prices by slashing output 16 percent to 809,000 barrels a day in the week ended July 27 from a record 963,000 on Dec. 30, according to Energy Department data. In 2008, Texas Governor Rick Perry submitted a waiver request to the EPA on the mandate that was rejected. That year Arizona Senator John McCain, then the Republican candidate for president, and other lawmakers asked the agency to adjust the requirement because of higher corn prices. Poet LLC, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is the largest U.S. ethanol producer, followed by Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) in Decatur, Illinois. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/twenty-five-u-s-senators-ask-epa-to-adjust-ethanol-mandate-1-.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344401439000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 00:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344401550000-4</Id><Title>White House to seek $7B in green energy contracts for military</Title><Msg>White House to seek $7B in green energy contracts for military Posted on August 7, 2012 by Cowboy Byte The White House announced Tuesday it is inviting contract proposals from green energy firms to boost the Army’s use of renewable energy. The administration is making $7 billion available for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to spend on locally-generated biomass, geothermal, solar or wind energy for up to 30 years. The move is part of a broader White House-led push to green the armed forces, over GOP opposition, which claims the efforts are a waste of taxpayer dollars. The Defense Department has set ambitious targets, aiming for renewable sources to account for 25 percent of its energy by 2025, with the Army working toward getting 1 gigawatt of power from green sources by that year. http://cowboybyte.com/10971/white-house-to-seek-7b-in-green-energy-contracts-for-military/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344401550000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 00:52:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344404448000-5</Id><Title>Biodiesel demand estimates now provided in petroleum supply &amp; demand balances</Title><Msg>Biodiesel demand estimates now provided in petroleum supply and demand balances 07/08/2012 06:59 (16:38 minutes ago) The FINANCIAL -- Biodiesel production data were reported for the first time in U.S. and regional petroleum supply and disposition balances as published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in the Petroleum Supply Monthly (PSM) in May 2012. The biodiesel production data in the PSM will allow EIA to more completely account for biodiesel when calculating demand for distillate fuel oil. Biodiesel production and other biodiesel data are now included in the item "Renewable Fuels Except Fuel Ethanol" in PSM supply and disposition tables. As EIA reported, in addition, previously published PSM data for January-April 2012 were revised to include biodiesel production. Similar revisions will be reported for 2011 when the Petroleum Supply Annual is released at the end of August 2012. Product supplied is a widely followed measure of demand for petroleum products. For finished petroleum products (including distillate fuel oil), product supplied is calculated as the sum of production, imports, net receipts (only for regional data), and adjustments minus the sum of stock change, refinery and blender input, and exports. While not a measure of actual consumption, product supplied has proven to be a useful approximation of demand for petroleum products. In the case of biodiesel, EIA assumes that any biodiesel that is produced is blended with diesel fuel, adding to the diesel fuel pool. This biodiesel production amount adds to the distillate fuel product supplied level, as shown on the graph. Including biodiesel production in the distillate fuel production volume added between 50 to 70 thousand barrels per day over the first five months of 2012. http://finchannel.com/news_flash/Oil_%26_Auto/113925_Biodiesel_demand_estimates_now_provided_in_petroleum_supply_and_demand_balances/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344404448000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 01:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344424787000-6</Id><Title>More Green Energy Scam News</Title><Msg>Good old Harry Reid, the No. 2 lying Democrat behind President Hussein, wasting taxpayer dollars like a good Democrat should.

The forecast Brent crude oil spot price falls to an average of $100 per barrel in 2013. The projected West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price discount to Brent crude oil narrows from about $14 in the third quarter of 2012 to $9 by late 2013. These price forecasts assume that world oil-consumption-weighted real gross domestic product (GDP), which increased by 3.0 percent in 2011, grows by 2.8 percent in 2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013. •With higher crude oil prices, EIA has increased the average regular gasoline retail price forecast for the third quarter of 2012 to $3.49 per gallon from $3.39 per gallon in last month's Outlook. EIA expects regular gasoline retail prices, which averaged $3.53 per gallon in 2011, to average $3.53 per gallon in 2012 and $3.33 per gallon in 2013. •EIA expects U.S. total crude oil production to average 6.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.6 million bbl/d from last year, and the highest level of production since 1997. Projected U.S. domestic crude oil production increases to 6.7 million bbl/d in 2013. •As a result of drought conditions affecting corn harvests and prices throughout the Midwest, ethanol production fell from 920 thousand bbl/d for the week ending June 8, 2012 to 809 thousand bbl/d for the week ending July 27, 2012. EIA has reduced its 2012 ethanol production forecast from 900 thousand bbl/d (13.8 billion gallons) in last month's Outlook to 870 thousand bbl/d (13.3 billion gallons). EIA expects ethanol production to recover in the second half of 2013, averaging about 880 thousand bbl/d for the year. •Natural gas working inventories ended July 2012 at an estimated 3.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), about 17 percent above the same time last year. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011, to average $2.67 per MMBtu in 2012 and $3.34 per MMBtu in 2013. http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344448838000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:00:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344448879000-33</Id><Title>Next generation of biofuels enters commercial production</Title><Msg>Next generation of biofuels enters commercial production Aug. 7, 2012 12:47pm The next generation of biofuels is entering commercial production which offers farmers and others new income opportunities while reducing the U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Advanced biofuels are high-energy liquid transportation fuels derived from low-nutrient input, high-yield crops including switchgrass, miscanthus, and others; agricultural and forestry waste; and other sustainable biomass feedstocks including algae. These renewable biomass sources are converted through various processes which break down the cellulose in plant cells to produce cellulosic ethanol and other products. Advanced biofuel joins corn-based ethanol and bio-diesel from soybean oil - the first generation of biofuel - in the ongoing U.S battle to reduce foreign energy imports. Corn ethanol refineries today produce about 14 billion gallons of conventional ethanol annually which curbs U.S. oil imports by about 300,000 barrels per day. The U.S. imports about half of its petroleum needs. Americans send about $2 billion a day overseas to purchase imported oil to convert to fuel. A handful of advanced biofuel refineries in the U.S. are either in production or in the construction phase. Company leaders shared the latest details on their cutting-edge ventures during the 2012 Biomass Conference held in Washington, D.C. in July. About 700 advanced biofuel industry members, scientists, academia, and others attended the event, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). More than 80 speakers shared the latest in advanced biofuel developments. Christopher Standlee, Abengoa Bioenergy’s executive vice-president, said the company will complete construction of its first U.S. cellulosic ethanol commercial refinery in Hogoton, Kan., next year. The refinery will shift into commercial production in 2014. The advanced biofuel refinery will produce about 25 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol annually from biomass, plus generate 20 megawatts of electricity. The Abengoa plant will produce the ethanol from corn stover primarily, plus wheat straw, milo stubble, switchgrass, and prairie grasses. The company will purchase about 390,000 tons of dry biomass annually from farmers located within 50 miles of the refinery. Abengoa will pay farmers about $17 million annually for the biomass. Standlee says the “key driver” for Abengoa’s entrance into advanced biofuels is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. The law calls for the production of 36 billion gallons of renewable transportation fuels annually by 2022. About half of the mandate is for cellulosic ethanol. “This is the legislation that says if we build bio-refineries there will be a market,” Standlee said. “If we make the fuel, there will be a market for the fuel.” Standlee also credited DOE loan guarantees to companies for bringing the advanced biofuels market to fruition. Abengoa invested $200 million of its own money before the DOE put up its first dollar. Abengoa will repay its DOE note in full, plus interest, the company leader said. Abengoa has 15 grain ethanol refineries in the world including six in the U.S. The refineries produce nearly one billion gallons of conventional biofuel annually. http://westernfarmpress.com/miscellaneous/next-generation-biofuels-enters-commercial-production</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344448879000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:01:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344448890000-34</Id><Topic><Title>Next generation of biofuels enters commercial production</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344448879000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:01:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Across the U.S., about 25 advanced biofuel refineries are under development. David Danielson, DOE Assistant Secretary for energy and efficiency and renewable energy, expressed excitement over the industry’s developments. “Construction is underway, steel is in the ground, jobs are created, and new technologies are being validated,” Danielson told the crowd. “We are making strong progress toward our national biofuel goal. By replacing imported fossil fuels with renewable, home-grown biofuels, we’re working to ensure our economic security, our national security, and the safety of our air and water.” Many of the first wave of advanced biofuel refineries will be located in the Midwest. The DOE says refineries will eventually be built coast to coast. This will require biomass production nationwide which will offer crop diversity and profit potential for farmers. The USDA Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) voluntary biomass crop assistance program (BCAP) offers farmers financial assistance to produce biomass crops. FSA funds offset many production-related costs. Most BCAP programs give farmers six months to enroll. BCAP is available in 11 areas of the country, funded by the 2007 farm law. A BCAP program offered in the West in 2011 fell short of its acreage sign-up goal. Producers in California, Montana, Oregon, and Washington were asked to grow 51,000 acres of the weed camelina, camelina sativa, for conversion to cellulosic ethanol for jet fuel. The FSA project sought 30,000 acres in California alone. Under the western BCAP program, camelina would be grown as a rotational crop with cereal grains on marginally productive land with limited available water under a multi-year FSA contract. At the Biomass Conference, FSA biomass crop assistance manager Kelly Novak addressed the federal government’s efforts to enroll biofuel acreage. She said about 3,000 acres were enrolled in the four-state camelina program including 2,000 acres in California. Novak says the lower-than-expected farmer participation was based on a shorter sign-up period (less than two months), reduced overall federal funds, insufficient production information about camelina, and a difficulty to answer farmers’ questions during the brief sign-up period. Congress will decide in the next farm bill whether BCAP biomass programs will be available in the future. Algae are one of the most talked about potential feedstock sources for advanced biofuels. Scientists are developing various algae strains which could be grown in different regions of the country. A potential hotbed for algae production could run from San Diego, Calif., to West Texas due to the region’s abundant sunshine and hot summer temperatures. “The cost of algae production has come down dramatically to make it cost competitive,” said Valerie Reed, the DOE’s acting biomass program director. “We are probably looking at a 10-year time frame for the commercial production of algae.” The road to commercial advanced biofuel production has been a slow ride. One reason is the difficulty to gain investors to financially support new energy development. In addition, financial challenges caused by the Great Recession slowed industry progress. “Its success depends on the work of a diverse stakeholder group – farmers, agronomists, lab scientists, engineers, investors, entrepreneurs, industry groups, environmental organizations, academics, lawmakers, and government officials,” Reed said. In retrospect, the grain ethanol industry took 40 years to mature to its current high production efficiencies. The stars appear lined up for advanced biofuels. The next generation of renewable energy has arrived.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344448890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:01:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344448903000-35</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SHOW US YOUR GRADES AND THESIS</Title><Username>americafirst761</Username><Timestamp>1344424944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 07:22:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The audacity of the GOP to run McCain and Palin against the smooth talking African is reprehensible.

The government obviously wants to see British Columbia’s export trade continue to grow and diversify, that’s important. But projects have to be evaluated on their own merits.” Observers say the prime minister’s comments are a subtle shift in his government’s previously unequivocal language on export pipelines, including the proposed Northern Gateway project, which is facing increasing political opposition in B.C. Last September, Harper described the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast into as a “complete no-brainer” – a comment that came just two months before the U.S. State Department delayed a decision on the project, throwing the viability of the line into question. While the prime minister’s desire to get western oil to Asian markets was still on display Tuesday, analysts believe Harper is taking a more cautious approach when it comes to talking about specific pipeline projects – saying that proposals have to be approved through an independent process. Harper told reporters he has spoken privately to B.C. Premier Christy Clark, but has no intention of getting caught in the clash between her and Alberta Premier Alison Redford over whether British Columbia should get a higher share of the wealth that will be created by opening Asian markets to bitumen. “I’m not going to get into an argument or a discussion about how we divide hypothetical revenues,” he said after announcing new financial benefits for parents caring for critically ill children. The prime minister’s comments come at a time when the Redford government is increasingly emphasizing there are multiple possible routes to get Alberta’s landlocked oilsands to the West Coast for transport to foreign markets. In December, Redford warned B.C. it could turn off investors if it pushed back against Enbridge Inc.’s Northern Gateway project to move oil from the Edmonton area to Kitimat, B.C., for loading onto tankers bound for Asia. http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/UPDATED+Alberta+pipeline+dispute+Stephen+Harper+says+science+politics+will+determine+route/7053114/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344449379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:09:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344449390000-37</Id><Topic><Title>B.C.-Alberta pipeline dispute: Stephen Harper says science, not politics, will determine route</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344449379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:09:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last month, Clark demanded five conditions be met in order for bitumen to be transported across her province, including B.C. getting its “fair share” of financial benefits derived by the line. Following the prime minister’s remarks on Tuesday, Alberta deputy premier Thomas Lukaszuk said “we believe that this project, as any other transmission project, are nation-building projects.” “We are not backing (away) from any particular project,” Lukaszuk said. “But occurrences within one project will not dissuade us from pursuing others.” Harper’s insistence Tuesday that independent panels will decide the fate of the project follows the declaration last week by his senior B.C. minister, James Moore, that Ottawa has no plans to “ram through” Enbridge’s $6-billion Northern Gateway line in order to sell more oil to China. “We may be witnessing the beginnings of the Harper government backing away from the project,” said University of B.C. political scientist George Hoberg, a specialist on environmental and resource management policy. But Harper didn’t back down from his long-stated position that it’s in Canada’s “national interest” for the oilsands industry to find customers beyond the U.S., where buyers are getting crude at a discount to global prices. “We think it’s obviously in the vital interests of Canada and in the vital interests of British Columbia, as Canada’s Asia-Pacific Gateway … to diversify our exports through this province,” he added. The Enbridge project is unpopular among British Columbians, according to polls, and more controversial than another major project on the drawing board, Kinder Morgan’s $4.1- billion plan to twin its existing oil pipeline from Edmonton to Burnaby. Mount Royal University political analyst David Taras said given the public battle between Clark and Redford, as well as opposition to Gateway in B.C. based on environmental concerns, many politicians will back away from hard positions on the issue. “Nobody has an interest in the car crash that damages the whole country. I’m sure there’s talks going every which way,” Taras said. Enbridge’s proposal is now before a joint National Energy Board-Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency panel. Many critics of Northern Gateway point to a recent U.S. regulator’s report that said the Calgary-based company acted like the “Keystone Kops” in response to a massive 2010 spill in Michigan. An Angus Reid poll released last week indicated 59 per cent of British Columbians opposed the project, compared to 34 per cent who favoured it. Josh Paterson, staff counsel with West Coast Environmental Law, said while it was positive Harper stated Northern Gateway would be a science-based decision, he does not have a lot of faith that will happen. Enbridge spokesman Todd Nogier said the company looks forward to making its case based on the project’s merits. “To the extent that (the prime minister) has expressed that the regulatory process is to be based on science and fact, we’re quite comfortable.” On Tuesday, Enbridge published a full-page, open letter to Canadians in a national newspaper trumpeting what it says is a 99.99 per cent safety record over the past decade and hundreds of millions of dollars it’s spending annually to prevent spills, as well as noting that pipelines remain the safest way to transport petroleum. “Our goal at Enbridge is — and will continue to be — the prevention of all spills,” said the letter.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344449390000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:09:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344449567000-38</Id><Topic><Title>B.C.-Alberta pipeline dispute: Stephen Harper says science, not politics, will determine route</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344449379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:09:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Enbridge OK with Harper stance on pipeline Published: Aug. 8, 2012 at 6:49 AM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 8 (UPI) -- A spokesman for Canadian pipeline company Enbridge said he was "comfortable" with decisions on a proposed pipeline from Alberta oil sands projects. Enbridge aims to construct the Northern Gateway oil pipeline to deliver so-called tar sands oil to ports in British Columbia for export to Asian markets. Critics of tar sands point to a series of oil spills, including a 20,000-barrel spill by Enbridge in Michigan in 2010, as reason for caution. British Columbia Premier Christy Clark laid out criteria that need to be met before the provincial government gets behind the project. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, during a speech in Vancouver, that science would drive decisions on national oil pipelines. "The only way governments can handle controversial projects of this manner is to ensure that things are evaluated on an independent basis scientifically, and not simply on political criteria," he was quoted by the Calgary Herald as saying. Enbridge spokesman Todd Nogier said he was pleased with Harper's declaration.

Bush in 2007, it set goals to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil, and encourage the production of cleaner, home grown alternative fuels by 2022. The RFS is working! First generation ethanol is exceeding its goals and is now 10 percent of our nation's gasoline consumption. Next generation fuels such as advanced and cellulosic are progressing, and given time will meet the goals outlined in the most significant energy policy ever enacted by the federal government. Pulling the plug on the RFS would be the wrong move at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. The gall of API to suggest biofuels do not improve our air quality and environment is laughable. Biofuels are cleaner than oil under all circumstances. API makes further ridiculous assumptions when grasping to tie biofuel production to alleged increased food prices. Countless academic, economic and government studies reiterate that higher food prices are much more affected by energy costs, such as oil and gasoline, than the cost of farm commodities. This report is nothing new, and only continues to keep our nation addicted to foreign oil. Ethanol reduces our dependence on foreign oil, creates jobs right here in America, improves our environment, revitalizes rural communities and saves consumers at the pump."

Corporate managers are not motivated by the tax rate they pay on their earnings. They will work just as hard at a 50% tax rate as at a 35% tax rate. The tax rate will matter to a business owner as it impacts their incremental profit. They can respond to it by laying off employees to compensate for a tax, or shutting down entirely if the tax makes being in business not remunerative enough for their time. Small business matters to economic output at a given moment but most technology and innovation is generated by big corporations and their managers where tax rates on salaries are not very important...

Reid told Greenwire Tuesday that he hopes the Senate will return to legislation that puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions. A Senate floor battle on major climate legislation in the next Congress would mark the first such showdown since senators voted down a big cap-and-trade bill in 2008. “We certainly can't stay where we are; we have to do something,” he told Greenwire at a green energy summit he co-hosts each year in Las Vegas. But even if Democrats hold onto their slim Senate majority, legislation to price carbon — whatever its shape — would face long odds winning the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a near-certain filibuster. Cap-and-trade has become toxic among Republicans and faces resistance from some conservative Democrats too. Proposals to impose a carbon tax — an idea receiving fresh attention of late (see here, here and here) — would also face very big hurdles if it ever came up. Reid’s comment to Greenwire followed a speech on climate change in which he tallied the impact of U.S. drought and other extreme weather worldwide, and ripped global warming “deniers.” “This year alone, the United States has seen unparalleled extreme weather events — events scientists say are exactly what is expected as the earth's climate changes,” Reid said in Tuesday's speech. “The seriousness of this problem is not lost on your average American. A large majority of people finally believe climate change is real, and that it is the cause of extreme weather. Yet despite having overwhelming evidence and public opinion on our side, deniers still exist, fueled and funded by dirty energy profits. These people aren't just on the other side of this debate. They're on the other side of reality,” he said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. The House narrowly passed a sweeping Democratic cap-and-trade and energy bill in 2009, but Senate efforts to advance a climate bill in 2010 sputtered. A scaled-back plan crafted by Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) never came up for a vote. On the flip side, measures to curtail Environmental Protection Agency greenhouse gas regulations have also failed to advance in the Senate. http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/242791-report-reid-eyes-climate-bill-if-dems-hold-senate-</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344467402000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 19:10:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344468501000-59</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Reid hopeful for climate bill if Dems hold Senate</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344467402000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 19:10:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If such a bill is such a good idea, why wait.

As the Tax Foundation explains in a recent report based on CBO data: "The top 20 percent of households pay 94 percent of federal income taxes. The bottom 40 percent have a negative income tax rate, and the middle quintile pays close to zero." This reality is treated as a state secret in Washington because it refutes Mr. Obama's campaign theme that the rich are undertaxed. The same crowd that has been howling that the rich don't pay their fair share of taxes now touts a study concluding that cutting taxes will only benefit the rich. Well, which is it? *** Another reality is that more than one-third of Americans pay no income tax. Many in this group contribute payroll taxes, but for most their only connection to the income tax is to receive refundable tax credits (in the form of a check) that are effectively government payments. This is the basis for the Tax Policy Center's wild claim that the Romney plan raises taxes on those who earn less than $30,000—a group that now has a negative tax liability.</Msg><Username>infernal.equinox</Username><Timestamp>1344475667000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344475966000-72</Id><Topic><Title>July 2012 HOTTEST MONTH EVER!!!!</Title><Username>walhieee12</Username><Timestamp>1344449158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:05:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a geometric rise in C02 emissions beginning from the reign of King Henry VIII. By the 1650s England was emitting more C02 than would have been possible if the entire yearly growth of wood in England was burned several times over. Global temperatures did, indeed, start to turn up after the 1650s, haltingly at first, and then rather quickly in the latter half of the 19th century when coal consumption achieved quite large levels. Petroleum was not really very important during the 1930s. Nearly 90% of global energy and C02 emissions came from coal as late as 1930. If there was any forcing of climate it would have come from coal. Since then oil has come on in a big way... Even now coal is still more important as a source of global energy and C02 output. The correlation is there. Correlation does not mean causation, but it is suspicious.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1344475966000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344476403000-73</Id><Title>China Drills Into Shale Gas</Title><Msg>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/</Msg><Username>infernal.equinox</Username><Timestamp>1344476403000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:40:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344476528000-74</Id><Topic><Title>July 2012 HOTTEST MONTH EVER!!!!</Title><Username>walhieee12</Username><Timestamp>1344449158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 14:05:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correlation does not mean causation - correct.
