Running up trillions in debt that will be paid by the lower classes, pursing wars that enrich the upper class, and pumping the stock market through the Federal Reserve are all prime examples. Considering his lifestyle and history of living high pandering to poor people, he may well be a true elitist at heart anyway. “Our eco turned around faster and much better than did the more conservative approach.” Your economy never would have crashed to begin with if the left had not been allowing the lower classes to borrow money they could not repay through its banking and housing policies. Your economy has not recovered either, as it has a $1 trillion deficit/year. Germany’s economy and government has a budget surplus, trade surplus, and is near full employment. German conservatives do not need instruction in how to run a country correctly. The UK was dragged down by irresponsible American banking policies. Southern Europe has many of the same problems, plus it is overrun with communists and socialists. “You do drastic cuts you will XOM back down in the 60's and huge stock market losses for ALL.” -I do not care what happens to Exxon stock or the stock market, as I own neither. “The poor are used to being poor are you?” LOL!!!!

The new Texas wind power project was authorized by the state’s Public Utility Commission (PUC) in 2008. When completed some time this year it will include 3,500 miles of new line carrying up to 18,456 megawatts, and according to a trade news report, PUC is already looking to order more wind power transmission lines, apparently with connections to out of state markets. The question is, does this really mean that nuclear and coal power are on the way out? Texas Wind Power Up, Nukes Down Well yes, eventually, according to Christopher Crane, the CEO of energy giant Exelon. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune last week, Crane predicted that the influx of low cost wind power would lead the company to start shuttering its nuclear plants. That’s no idle conjecture (or threat, as the case may be). Direct costs and risk management issues are already casting a shadow over the nuclear industry in Texas. In 2011, rival utility giant NRG was set to build two new power plants in Texas but backed off as a wind power surplus combined with a stiffer regulatory environment for nuclear power, consequent on the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The U.S. market isn’t the only place where nuclear energy is getting a chilly reception due to cost and safety concerns. The U.K.’s ambitious plan to build 10 new nuclear power plants just lost the backing of British utility Centrica, which is apparently going to concentrate its resources on renewable energy as well as natural gas. Texas Wind Power Up, Coal Down Coal is on even more shaky ground, partly because new wind farms and other clean energy facilities are beginning to offer more competitive alternatives, and also because existing coal power plants are being converted to other fuels, namely biomass and natural gas. As with nuclear power, the regulatory framework is also becoming more hostile to coal. Just yesterday the Washington Post editorial board urged President Obama to lay out a forceful climate change action plan in his upcoming State-of-the-Union address, noting that the Environmental Protection Agency is already poised to issue new rules that don’t require Congress to consent: “The EPA has already established or is in the process of establishing a range of new air pollution rules. These rules will ensure than no new conventional coal plants are built in the United States, and they will force the closure of some particularly awful, ancient coal-fired facilities.” The Global Energy Whack-a-Mole Though the U.S. utility landscape is transitioning to safer, renewable forms of energy, that’s not going to have much of an effect on global greenhouse gas emissions. The domestic market for coal is drying up, but U.S. coal companies have simply begun exporting more coal abroad. For that matter, pressure is mounting on Congress to allow more natural gas exports due to the domestic gas boom, and the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would make the U.S. an export enabler of notoriously “dirty” tar sands oil from Canada. As for nuclear energy, the nation’s stock of aging nuclear facilities is creating one giant headache for local emergency planners to say nothing of ratepayers and taxpayers. It’s also creating a conundrum for diversified energy companies like Exelon, which operates the nation’s largest fleet of nuclear facilities but is also rapidly embracing wind and other renewables in its portfolio. sDOTtt/1zC1z</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360595277776</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 10:07:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360596092814-9</Id><Topic><Title>Best investment strategies for your money.</Title><Username>shawnnapyro802</Username><Timestamp>1301582274000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-03-31 10:37:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a great day!</Msg><Username>ameliajoshep</Username><Timestamp>1360596092814</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 10:21:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360596997143-10</Id><Title>India faltering and China's solid long run prospects...</Title><Msg>India has one of the worst education systems in the world, and that will make it impossible for its economy to grow beyond low wage industries and third world subsistence levels.

It’s actually based on Q3 2012 state data and Q4 2011 country data, so it gives Florida a 9-month bonus. It’s a “fun stat” and there are many more like it that I could have chosen, but I’m simply using the stat to get to the matter of importance: why is solar power growth in “The Sunshine State” and much of the US so much weaker than solar power growth in the super grey Czech Republic, super grey Germany (Germany has over 57 times more solar power per capita than Florida.), super grey Belgium, etc? Click on this link to see larger chart. The reason is that Florida (like much of the US) hasn’t implemented policies to: price the pollution that comes from coal and natural gas power plants (in a perfect market, this would be adequately priced); or to pay solar power producers for the full value and benefits they provide to society. The huge majority of Americans support solar power. But we aren’t demanding it. The rich have more influence over our politicians than we do. In the energy industry, this includes the heads of fossil fuel companies and utility companies. Without strong citizen efforts to change the story, Florida remains far behind the likes of those two countries above and many, many more. If Floridians (or other Americans) truly want solar power to be on equal footing when it comes to subsidies or pricing of electricity, then they need to organize and demand it. Otherwise, coal, natural gas, and nuclear are going to remain unfairly propped up by externalities and other subsidies. sDOTtt/1zDwK</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360597169009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 10:39:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360602013742-12</Id><Title>Much more austerity coming...</Title><Msg>The UK will be next.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, started to think about what she would do if she became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. No need to worry about that. But Murkowski went ahead anyway and drew up a blueprint about how Congress might address energy issues. She unveiled the plan last week: "Energy 20/20: A Vision for America's Energy Future." The cover shows the nighttime satellite view of the United States, brightly lit almost everywhere except Alaska. To prevent the booklet, which weighs in at 121 pages, from heading straight for the proverbial shelf, Murkowski has been talking to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,, the new committee chairman. They aren't cooking up a comprehensive energy bill, but they are looking for more modest, doable things. "Singles and doubles," is how one committee staffer put it. For now, it's hard to say what those might be. Murkowski's plan includes support for nuclear energy, the Keystone XL pipeline and exports of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). She would put government money into energy storage research. She would make "clean energy" a relative term, defining it as "less intensive in global lifecycle impacts on human health and the environment than its likeliest alternative." She would open up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas exploration. She would open up more federal offshore areas for oil and wind development, divert some of the royalties to the states and commit the rest to an Advanced Energy Trust Fund for clean-energy research and to pay down the national debt. We spoke recently about her views on energy. Q: I like the cover. A: When you look at the world at night you can identify energy sources. Those (well-lit areas) are the prosperous nations around the world. And then you see blackout zones. It's a reminder that energy is good. It's not this necessary evil that we sometimes tend to focus on. It's what makes the world go round. Q: I've been told that you and Wyden are looking for "singles and doubles." A: If we can advance things that are smaller but still make a difference, I'm okay with that. You haven't seen many initiatives move through this committee, get through the floor and get signed by the president. I'm okay with moving some things forward that will help address some of our environmental issues and jobs and move us to a better place as a nation, and I think we can do that with energy. Q: Yet you and Wyden don't see eye to eye on many things. He has been leery of permitting LNG exports, for example. A: I've said he is being cautious. There is a big difference between being cautious and saying I oppose exports. This is an area where we can have a good, legitimate discussion about what is currently in place. I think that the ability to export our abundant resources of LNG is good for us and quite honestly helps with the balance-of-trade issue. Japan would love to see LNG coming from its friend and closest ally, the United States. It was interesting taking Sen. Wyden to Alaska and see the LNG export facility there. Alaska has had the longest contract in the country going from Cook Inlet to Japan. He saw pretty quickly that Alaska is a different market from the Lower 48. We had an interesting field trip. They were doing a demonstration and had this boiling beaker with LNG bubbling up. And it looks really scary. You put your finger in. I said, "Yeah, it's cold." It's like putting your finger in baby powder. They're trying to demystify this. The really great thing was when someone dipped a graham cracker into the LNG and passed it around for the rest of us to eat. Senator Wyden waited for me to take the first bite to make sure I didn't die. It was like a Thin Mint from the freezer. So I think we demystified some of the concerns about LNG. Q: What about the House? A: So what about the House? Sen. Wyden and I have already reached out to our counterparts. We got a good reaction from them. The four of us -- (including House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (Mich.) and Rep. Ed Whitfield, chairman of the subcommittee on energy and power) -- have agreed that we'd like to have occasional breakfasts and talk. That's new territory, which is a good thing. I'm a firm believer that if you put together a good product that is just good policy, that is embraced by both sides so that it is seen as politically advantageous to the Republicans or Democrats, that even in this very polarized partisan world that you can advance legislation. I have to believe that or I wouldn't want to get up every morning. In some cases we get stuck on things like Yucca, (the proposed site for nuclear waste for which the Obama administration cut funding). But let's agree that the partisan back-and-forth is not going to hold us back. We'll put together a good product. And my hope is that the House will embrace it accordingly. Signed, Pollyanna. Q: You talk about energy abundance in your report, but you're also concerned about "clean energy." Don't climate concerns introduce a constraint no matter how much oil and gas might be in the ground? A: Think about what the oil and gas world looked like in the 1980s. The drilling technologies we used for oil in Prudhoe Bay left a pretty considerable footprint. Look to the '90s, and the footprint in (new) fields is greatly reduced. It has allowed us to put wells 10 feet from one another and do directional drilling and go out eight miles around us so that the impact to the land is almost negligible. In the last five, seven years, the boom is not because all of sudden there is more natural gas beneath the North American continent but that our technologies have allowed us to access this resource in a way that results in less emissions. So when you think about energy in terms of abundant versus scarce, it is important to keep in mind that our opportunities are only limited by the limits of our technology. What we've managed to do in a few short decades has allowed us to access resources in a way that reduces our environmental impacts and with fewer emissions. It's something absolute but more of a continuum that's going to allow us to have a cleaner environment, cleaner water, cleaner air and access to resources that will give us what we need to heat and cool and be comfortable. At same time, there is an awareness and a responsibility to our environment. I guess it's a more holistic approach. Q: You've said that we need to stimulate clean energy, but you don't want to raise the price of dirty fuels and you don't want subsidies. How do we do that? A: You've got to move us to these technologies that allow us to get to the clean-energy source. If we can't work to reduce the cost, you're not going to see them implemented unless there is a path of unlimited subsidies, and that's not doable, either. We can kick-start the research process, but we have to do that from a position of economic strength. You can't raise costs, injure the economy and think you're going to get somewhere. Let me take you back to Alaska. In Aniak, people are paying $6.90 for a gallon of diesel. A gallon of unleaded gas is $7.37. It is not attached to any energy grid. Their options are burning wood or diesel. So when the New York Times says all we need to do is encourage people to burn less and that's going to reduce our emissions, you're telling me I'm going to contact my people back home and tell them that for the good of the order you're going to pay $10.99 -- but you could use less. The temperature at the Aniak airport was 48 below. How we deal with (energy) storage is key. We've got to figure out that piece. Q: Isn't that similar to what the Energy Department has been doing with the economic recovery grants and loans? A: Tax credits are here today, gone tomorrow. Talk to folks within the wind industry and they're saying, "Please give us some certainty." I'm not afraid to spend money on the R&amp;D that's really going to move us to a cleaner energy source that I think is so much the answer to the issues of environmental responsibility and climate change. Let's have a climate policy that's a no-regrets policy. Q: Where's the money going to come from? A: If we have increased production. Take Alaska, because we have such enormous opportunity there. We can open up ANWR. We have opportunity in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. We have offshore resources we can tap into in a more aggressive yet environmentally responsible manner. . . . The boom in natural gas, 96 percent of it has been on private or state lands. We've got huge fed lands. What are we doing to tap into those resources? Those are revenues we're sitting on. Let's extract those revenues as well and build out the future. There are lots of colleagues who say that what we really should be doing is putting that money toward the deficit. I agree but also feel that we should put in place a mechanism that directs part of the lease sales to a renewable-energy fund; we called it the "deployment fund." For a long time I've said this is how we can help build out these technologies. We can do this short of raising your taxes or increasing costs to the consumer. Right now the feds are getting zero percent of nothing. Q: How does one keep from getting cynical? A: I can remember when George W. Bush in his State of the Union said that when a child who was born today gets his driver's license he will be driving a hydrogen vehicle. I thought that was so cool. You've got to dream big. Q: But we're not driving hydrogen vehicles. That's been a bust. A: Well we're not driving hydrogen vehicles. But let's not give up on that. adnDOTcom/2013/02/10/2784412/lisa-murkowskis-2020-vision-for.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360610287947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 14:18:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360610308174-19</Id><Topic><Title>Austerity in France</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1360602793708</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 12:13:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What happens?"

More than 135 groups are banding together to take out a full-page ad in the Des Moines Register tomorrow, slamming Cuomo in advance of his decision in the coming days about whether to approve fracking regulations in the Empire State. Cuomo has come under fire from liberals and environmentalists over potentially permitting hydrofracking, which involves drilling for shale gas, in New York at a time when he is widely seen as looking to run for president in 2016. The ad features three words in World War III-style boldface type, reading, “NOT ONE WELL.” Below, it says, “Governor Cuomo, America is looking to you.

Rumour has it that early this week Germany's government will announce an initiative to support the purchase of battery based energy storage systems integrated with solar panel arrays. Owners of solar power systems up to 30kW capacity will be entitled to low-interest loans from state-owned bank KfW and a repayment allowance from the Ministry of Environment that will cover 30% of the cost of an energy storage system. Germany is no slouch when it comes to pioneering support for renewables - it was the first nation to implement feed in tariffs, which it launched in 1991. Within 5 years of the scheme being expanded in 2000, a seven-fold increase in installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity occurred in the country. Germany's efforts in pushing solar uptake played a major role in reducing the cost of solar panels and associated equipment globally. If the rumours are correct; such as scheme should go some way to reducing the cost of battery based energy storage systems. The initiative will be great news not only for households and businesses wanting greater energy independence, but also the many companies investing in energy storage R&amp;D. Last week, inverter manufacturer Power-One announced it was partnering with Panasonic to develop, produce and market energy storage systems for residential and commercial markets. Aside from providing a greater degree of energy independence by allowing harvested solar power to be "banked" for use during low light periods or at night , energy storage systems offer a number of other benefits. For example, the systems can be charged during off-peak periods with mains power when electricity is cheaper for use during more expensive peak periods. For solar power system owners who receive less than fair market value for the surplus electricity they export to the mains grid, storing instead of exporting that energy will send a clear signal to electricity companies that if they want the high-value green power - they are going to have to pay a reasonable price for it. energymattersDOTcomDOTau/indexDOTphp?main_page=news_article&amp;article_id=3584</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360612382981</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 14:53:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360613378240-23</Id><Title>EON Plans Hundreds of Megawatts of Wind Power in Norway, Sweden</Title><Msg>EON Plans Hundreds of Megawatts of Wind Power in Norway, Sweden By Torsten Fagerholm - Feb 8, 2013 4:11 AM MT 0 COMMENTS EON SE plans to build hundreds of megawatts of wind power in Norway and Sweden, where costs for developers are lower than other European countries. Germany’s biggest utility has proposals for nine onshore farms in Norway totaling 1,500 megawatts as the country’s low population density and strong winds allow larger and cheaper projects than in Germany or Poland, EON’s Mark Porter said. “Norway has a huge untapped potential,” said Porter, the northern Europe onshore wind power director. “It’s a new market that has many cost-efficient projects. We plan to complete a handful before 2020 though not all nine farms will make it.” Norway has agreed with the European Union to raise to 67.5 percent the share of energy demand it gets from renewables by 2020, up 6.4 percentage points from 2010. Norwea, the country’s wind power association, sees installed capacity rising to 3,500 megawatts by then, compared with 632 megawatts as of Dec. 20. EON, the largest developer of offshore wind power, is also planning to site one of the world’s largest sea-based farms in Sweden’s Soedra Midsjoebanken, exporting power from the proposed 700 megawatt facility to the Baltic region, Poland and Germany. “Sweden has great offshore potential, competitive with Germany and the U.K., but first new physical cables are needed and it’ll likely be the back end of this decade before we can harness the potential,” Porter said yesterday from Malmoe. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-08/eon-plans-hundreds-of-megawatts-of-wind-power-in-norway-sweden.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360613378240</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 15:09:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360614016815-24</Id><Title>IEA Says Energy Industry In Troubled Water With Future Water Usage</Title><Msg>IEA Says Energy Industry In Troubled Water With Future Water Usage February 11, 2013Chelsea It’s an easily forgotten necessity of energy production: the billions of cubic meters (BCM) of freshwater water that is necessary for cooling, irrigating, fracking, and other uses. This is water that is not returned to the water basin for future use — it’s temporarily lost to evaporation, consumption, or pollution. The International Energy Agency expects energy industry water consumption to double from the 66 BCM used today to about 135 BCM by 2035. Power plant with huge cooling towers via Shutterstock The IEA predicts that more than half of that 135 BCM consumption will be due to coal-fired power plants, along with 30% used in biofuel production. To imagine what 135 BCM looks like, the IEA equates it to 90 days’ discharge of the Mississippi River or four times the volume of Lake Mead. No drop in the bucket, friends. Water pulled in all directions As water is needed for increasing energy needs, water is also needed for an increasing population. To make matters worse, there’s concern over how robust the water supply will be in the coming decades as rainfall is less reliable and predictable thanks to climate change. Dwindling water supplies will affect agriculture, population distribution and political stability. How to sidestep excessive water usage Renewables! Increased reliance on wind and solar photovoltaic — which are decidedly less water hungry than coal and biofuels — will drastically reduce water usage. According to Think Progress the IEA calculates that “wind and solar photovoltaic power have such minimal water needs they account for less than one percent of water consumption for energy now and in the future, by IEA’s calculations.” Check out these tables of water use efficiency for conventional power plants versus wind and solar technology derived from 2010 data. However, the big loser of renewable energy water consumption is concentrating solar thermal power. The misfortune is that wet-cooled concentrating solar power plants use a lot of water to make power. Like coal-fired power plants, to reduce water consumption at concentrating solar thermal power plants, dry-cooling technology should be implemented, but this can be quite costly. sDOTtt/1zDTd</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360614016815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 15:20:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360614953110-25</Id><Title>Global solar capacity breaks through 100GW barrier</Title><Msg>Global solar capacity breaks through 100GW barrier New industry figures show 30GW of new capacity installed in 2012, despite slowdown in European market By BusinessGreen staff 11 Feb 2013 More from this author Comments: 1 Global solar capacity has surpassed 100GW, reducing energy sector CO2 emissions by 53 million tonnes a year, according to new industry figures. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) yesterday revealed that cumulative solar PV capacity reached 101GW in 2012, after 30GW of new solar technologies were installed. Significantly, the figures revealed a shift in the global solar market as emerging economies picked up some of the slack caused by a slowdown in European countries. New European installations dropped from nearly 23GW in 2011 to nearly 17GW in 2012, while 13GW of new capacity was installed outside Europe, up from 8GW in 2011. However, Europe remained the biggest market, with Germany installing 7.6GW of capacity during 2012. China came in second place in the global league table with 3.5GW of new capacity added, while Italy installed 3.3GW, the US added 3.2GW, and Japan installed 2.5GW. The UK also completed a record year, installing 1.1GW of capacity, the first time it has deployed more than 1GW in a year. EPIA said the preliminary figures might be revised up to 32GW of new capacity when it releases its Global Outlook Report in May. "No one would have predicted even 10 years ago that we would see more than 100GW of solar photovoltaic capacity in the world by 2012," said EPIA president Winfried Hoffmann. "The photovoltaic industry clearly faces challenges but the results of 2012 show there is a strong global market for our technology. Even in tough economic times and despite growing regulatory uncertainty, we have nearly managed to repeat the record year of 2011." businessgreenDOTcom/bg/news/2242773/global-solar-capacity-breaks-through-100gw-barrier</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360614953110</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 15:35:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360615346678-26</Id><Title>Do you think XOM is a good investment above $88.00 share?</Title><Msg>Or should I wait?

The biodiesel industry is celebrating the news. National Biodiesel Board Technical Director Steve Howell says many people don’t realize that today’s new technology diesel engines powered by ultra-low sulfur biodiesel blends provide tailpipe emissions as clean or cleaner than natural gas or gasoline – while providing superior fuel economy, horsepower and durability. NBB says a bumper crop of new 2013 clean diesel vehicles are beginning to arrive in dealership showrooms nationwide – including more new B20-approved vehicles from domestic automakers Ford and Chrysler. Ford is introducing a new diesel model in its Ford Transit full size van that is approved for use with B20 and Chrysler’s new 2013 Ram Heavy Duty diesel pickups are approved for general use with B20. According to the National Biodiesel Board – more than 33 light and medium-duty diesel passenger cars and trucks – as well as heavy-duty diesel models from nearly 20 different brands – will be available in the market this year. NBB says nearly 80-percent of manufacturers selling diesel vehicles and equipment in the U.S. now warranty them for use with high-quality B20 biodiesel blends. The remainder are certified for use with five-percent biodiesel blends. The National Biodiesel Board is working cooperatively with those manufacturers to encourage and enable their support for B20 in all vehicles sold in the U.S. NBB is headed to the 2013 National Automobile Dealers Association and American Truck Dealers Convention in Orlando this week. As part of the American Truck Dealers Convention – NBB will educate dealers about biodiesel use in the vehicles they sell during two workshop sessions. NBB will also exhibit at the NADA/ATD Expo. hoosieragtodayDOTcom/indexDOTphp/2013/02/11/biodiesel-board-thrilled-with-growing-list-of-b20-ready-vehicles/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360632721558</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 20:32:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360633204682-35</Id><Title>EPA approves new blender pump for E15 fuel stations, 4-gallon rule still in effect</Title><Msg>EPA approves new blender pump for E15 fuel stations, 4-gallon rule still in effect By Danny KingRSS feed Posted Feb 11th 2013 4:01PM Comments2 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week outlined the conditions gas station operators need to meet to sell higher-ethanol gasoline from so-called "blender pumps" that may dispense gasoline with both 10 percent and 15 percent ethanol (E10 and E15, respectively). Among other requirements, stations need to have at least one pump that distributes solely E10, and to label to its blender pumps with a notice that says "Passenger Vehicles Only. Use in Other Vehicles, Engines and Equipment May Violate Federal Law." Additionally, as we heard earlier, anyone buying fuel from a blender pump has to be required to purchase at least four gallons of fuel. That way, any residual amount of E15 in the pump will be diluted enough to not pose harm for vehicles not designed to accommodate higher-ethanol gasoline. Last June, the EPA officially legalized public sales of E15 in a move federal regulators believe could cut foreign oil dependency, help US farmers and possibly cut emissions. Last month, a US federal appeals court upheld that decision and turned down a request from oil and food trade organizations to consider reversing the decision. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association and AAA are among groups that have publicly challenged the EPA decision, with AAA late last year requesting for the government to suspend E15 sales. Check out the EPA's press release below, and read about some of the conditions gas stations need to meet to operate such blender pumps here.
