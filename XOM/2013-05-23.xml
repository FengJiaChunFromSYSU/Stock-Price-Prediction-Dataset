The relatively new abundance of shale-sourced energy has left many believing that it could set the United States on a course to energy independence. As oil production from domestic shale plays has surged, imports have dropped from 60 percent of the nation’s oil supply in 2005 to less than 40 percent today, Deloitte author Joseph Stanislaw wrote in the report. But Stanislaw cautioned that nation’s shale resources are finite and should be used in part to finance longer-term investment in renewable energy. “We are in a world of energy abundance, not energy scarcity. But abundance doesn’t mean that we should make mistakes,” Stanislaw told FuelFix. “Abundance means we have the time to make alternative investments, both from the private sector and through government involvement.” Shale effect: Global oil boom forcing Saudi Arabia to cut oil production While the U.S. arguably could produce enough energy to sustain itself, its economic and geopolitical ties to the rest of the world make energy independence meaningless, Stanislaw wrote. The danger of climate change and the impact of increased carbon use throughout the world will affect the entire globe. Renewable energy could be the answer to both these issues, providing both economic wealth and a long-term energy future for the country, Stanislaw said. While knowledge of shale oil and the hydraulic fracturing technology have existed for decades, recent technology advancements have driven the boom, and Stanislaw expects that it is new technology that will make renewable energy advances more achievable.

Wheat and soybeans gained. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported sales of a combined 540,000 metric tons of corn to China and unknown destinations for delivery in the 12 months that start Sept. 1. Ethanol output rose to the highest in 11 months, and stockpiles dropped for the fourth straight week, government data showed. Supplies of ethanol, a gasoline additive, “are now as low as they usually are coming out of the end of the driving season in late August,” Jerry Gidel, the chief grain-market analyst at Rice Dairy LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There is little reason to expect production to slow as U.S. driving demand will increase demand the next several months.” Corn futures for July delivery rose 2.9 percent to settle at $6.585 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 13. U.S. supplies of the grain left from last year are forecast to fall to the lowest since 1996 before the 2013 harvest, the government said on May 10. Wheat futures for July delivery advanced 1.2 percent to $6.885 a bushel, the biggest gain since May 9, partly on signs of increasing use in livestock feedstock. “Wheat is a cheaper feed alternative to corn on a per-pound and protein basis,” Dave Marshall, a farm-marketing adviser at Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “Wheat supplies are not positioned where mills and exporters need them, and because of the shortage of corn, there is increased feed demand.” Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 1.1 percent to $14.9425 a bushel.

Naturally, with buildings full of money, they’re also fighting back and paying others to fight back. They’re struggling to survive. One way they are doing so is by attacking every incentive for clean, renewable energy that they can. State renewable energy policies have been a particular focus of attack as of late. One of the closest battles along these lines was recently held in North Carolina. Luckily for us, renewable energy won. Here’s an email I just received from the Solar Energy Industries Association (image added &amp; two notes included at the end): Today, the sun is shining brightly in North Carolina. Thanks to you – and a lot of hard work on the ground – attempts to pass the “Job Killing, Anti-Growth and Keep NC Dependent on Foreign Oil Act” have failed! This wouldn’t have happened without the efforts of solar supporters in North Carolina and around the nation — and the Solar Power Advocacy Network, which deserves a special shout out. Your voices make a huge difference. Please encourage your friends and collegues to join now. We want to express our sincere appreciation to everyone who took time to call, write or sign our online petition. Because of smart policies like North Carolina’s Renewable Energy and Energy Portfolio Standards (REPS), solar offers real hope for the future by reducing our nation’s dangerous dependence on fossil fuels and by helping to fight pollution. Sadly, these policies are under assault in state capitols around the nation. But working together, we can – and we will – make a real difference for America. Today, solar is generating enough electricity to power more than 1.2 million American homes – and right now a solar-powered airplane is making the first ever coast-to-coast flight in U.S. history. cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/05/23/anti-renewable-north-carolina-bill-defeated/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369313477441</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 08:51:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369313612813-13</Id><Topic><Title>Closing in on a new 52 week high.</Title><Username>stockminder</Username><Timestamp>1369239689338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:21:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good work there sport....</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369313612813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 08:53:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369314422006-14</Id><Topic><Title>oil &amp; gold crash....</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366032873167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:34:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369314422006</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 09:07:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369314489414-15</Id><Topic><Title>The death of fossil fuels will be on display in Dresden May 28-29</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369224816188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:13:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We will destroy them.

Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA Investing in new renewable power generation, rather than a "dash for gas", will be the lower-cost option for keeping the lights on while cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the government's climate change watchdog has said. The sooner the UK makes large investments in low-carbon generation – including offshore and onshore wind, nuclear power and energy from waste – the cheaper it will be, according to David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting emissions targets. The conclusions are likely to be controversial, as many MPs on the right of the Tory party have been clamouring for an end to onshore windfarms and reductions in renewable subsidies. They would prefer to see a new "dash for gas" that would require the UK to massively expand shale gas drilling and import tens of billions of pounds worth of fuel each year as North Sea reserves run down. They point to lower gas prices in the US that have resulted from the aggressive pursuit of shale resources. The CCC's analysis found that investing in renewable energy made sense even if the price of gas was relatively low. Previous analysis by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) relied on scenarios of large increases in the gas price to make renewables and other forms of low-carbon power, such as nuclear, more economic. Kennedy told the Guardian: "Not investing in renewables only makes sense if you don't want to meet our emissions targets – if you tear up the Climate Change Act."

John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.). Rumors have long swirled that if Obama approves Keystone, he might link approval to policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon standards for the nation’s existing power plants. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who opposes Keystone, told reporters in April that if Obama green-lights the pipeline, he should combine the action with other climate policy steps — comments that the Republicans flagged in their new letter. “If they are determined to go down that path, and they can’t be dissuaded, then the important thing is to make sure that they surround that decision ... [with] a whole formidable array of environmental and anti-carbon measures that can not just offset the harm that they do by approving [Keystone] ... but actually turn the whole package into a very strong, anti-carbon pollution suite of strategies,” Whitehouse said. The Obama administration is reviewing whether to issue a permit for TransCanada Corp.’s proposed pipeline, which would bring oil from Alberta’s oil sands projects across the border en route to Gulf Coast refineries. Republicans who signed the letter — a group that includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the rest of the Senate GOP leadership team — say the Keystone decision should proceed on its own. “We strongly urge you not to expand the scope of... thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/301559-republicans-to-obama-dont-link-keystone-pipeline-to-climate-policy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369333349498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 14:22:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369342806395-26</Id><Title>FracFocus drillers’ registry to create US chemicals database</Title><Msg>May 23, 2013 at 2:53 pm by Bloomberg By Mark Drajem Bloomberg News FracFocus, the website drillers use to disclose chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, is revamping its system next week to let regulators for the first time search and aggregate the information. The industry-backed system, which is used by drillers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., is resolving a criticism from environmental groups by converting the online information into a database of chemicals used in individual wells that can be analyzed, said Stan Belieu, deputy director of the Nebraska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, who testified on behalf of FracFocus today at a Senate forum. “The improvements that are going to be made to FracFocus will be a substantial improvement,” Mark Brownstein, associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said today at the Senate forum on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. For regulators, “this helps them target resources and enforcement.” Father of fracking: Gov. Perry honors shale pioneer George Mitchell FracFocus is a voluntary registry of the chemicals used in fracking. Of 18 states that require companies to disclose their chemicals, 11 require or allow the reporting to be on FracFocus. The Bureau of Land Management proposed last week that it would use the system for drillers on federal lands. The online registry, created in April 2011, has collected and published its information in online document form. To analyze that information across wells would require the user to extract and enter the data into their own database, Belieu said today. Database Format As of June 1, all information must be submitted, and can be accessed, in a database, he said. Each state will determine how much information, and in which form, it will be available.

Most were small little tea kettle operations that were only ever built for gov't subsidies put in place by Carter to fix the late 70's energy crisises</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1369351840914</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 19:30:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369352222023-32</Id><Topic><Title>Energy security, not independence, should be nation’s shale endgame</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369286179540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 01:16:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reagan signed an executive order that neutralized the costs to buy raw crude for refineries. Before his E.O. all refineries had to be sold crude at the same price. This leveled the field for the small refineries to be competitive with the large ones. hence America had 400+ refineries. and a 250,000 Barrel per day refinery got no volume price break for raw crude over a 50,000 Barrel per day. With that order he lifted the regulation of the pricing, thereby forcing small refineries out of business. You might do well to review E.O.'s from all our American Presidents.</Msg><Username>fallenangelsthree</Username><Timestamp>1369352222023</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 19:37:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369354416404-33</Id><Topic><Title>Energy security, not independence, should be nation’s shale endgame</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369286179540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 01:16:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Psssst a 250 mbpd refinery doesn't get a discount on crude today either vs a 50 mbpd refinery. It is NOT in crude price where a bigger refinery has its economies of scale. You might do well to understand how the refining business acutally works.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1369354416404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:13:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369354494154-34</Id><Title>The Iowa legislature passed H.F. 640 on May 22, legislation that protects retailers from Big Oil efforts to restrict</Title><Msg>The Iowa legislature passed H.F. 640 on May 22, legislation that protects retailers from Big Oil efforts to restrict competition by guaranteeing local retailers the right to offer the ethanol and biodiesel blends of their choice...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369354494154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:14:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369355277192-35</Id><Topic><Title>Anti-Renewable North Carolina Bill Defeated!</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369313477441</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 08:51:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Using renewables where possible is fine. But not at any cost does it made sense and "incentives" are a cost. The issue is much more complicated than your 'we should always use renewables' position allows.

But what is gained if we "force" them to do that? The crude will still be produced (so no environmental gain there) and it will still be processed and consumed again no environmental gain. In fact it is very likely it won't be processed or consumed as cleanly so pushin git to asia would actually be a evironmental negative. Or we could build the p/l and not only support a neighbor and longtime ally, but also secure a safe and secure supply of crude. Weren't you the one just saying that we should conserve our limited resources? how is that position aligned with this one? Force us to consume more of our own limited resources (or go get some from a much less aligned and possibly de facto enemy supplier?</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1369355983279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369356189794-37</Id><Topic><Title>maxipad ???</Title><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1369130857995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 06:07:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxi is a PITA, but who cares where he is.

With no keystone, Canada will be forced to deal with the B.C. intuits who oppose the pipeline across tribal lands. I am not directly concerned with Asian environmental air quality. Your excuse to help a neighbor (Canada) is lame at best. Why chance degrading the American soil with a possible pipeline break(s)? None of that crude will stay in the US, aka ZERO of that crude stays here. It is all contracted to Asia. Has does me being against letting Canadian crude affect my environmental thinking for the U.S.? You are quite naive in believing any of that Canadian crude will stay in the US. I owe communist China nothing. Have you ever read any of the crude oil details and the end user of it? I have.</Msg><Username>fallenangelsthree</Username><Timestamp>1369357446398</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 21:04:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369358118088-39</Id><Topic><Title>Keep climate change out of Keystone decision, GOP warns in letter to Obama</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369333349498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 14:22:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You might find it better in the long run to focus on facts instead of propaganda.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1369358118088</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 21:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369358258870-40</Id><Topic><Title>Keep climate change out of Keystone decision, GOP warns in letter to Obama</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369333349498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 14:22:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have read the keystone pipeline project papers.
