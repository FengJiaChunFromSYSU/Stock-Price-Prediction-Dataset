McGraw in Alternative fuels, Automobiles The new label mandated by the EPA is designed to make it clear to car owners which pumps are using 15% ethanol. Drivers will soon get to debate whether the cost-savings of E15 fuel is worth the lower fuel economy. E15, which contains 15 percent ethanol, received final approval by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this summer, and a Kansas gasoline station became the first station in the nation to sell the alternative fuel. The station began selling the fuel for $1.15 a gallon, but they quickly upped the price to $3.28, or two cents lower than regular E10. At those prices, Douglas Tiffany, a University of Minnesota assistant professor, said it’s a bit overpriced for its energy production. “At the moment, I would say that the E15 is maybe a little higher priced than it ought to be,” Tiffany told Midwest Energy News. Regular gasoline has around 114,000 BTUs, compared to the 108,000 BTUs of E15. So according to Tiffany, drivers would pay about 22 cents per mile on regular gasoline, but they’d pay about 23.5 cents per mile on E15. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, motorists are expected to get 3 to 4 percent fewer miles per gallon on E10 than straight gasoline, and it seems only logical to think E15 would also come with a similar hit to fuel economy. So E15 might save you a few cents at the pump, but you could end up paying more per mile. Supporters have argued the fuel has given Americans relief by knocking $134 billion off the price of gasoline, and they argue the ethanol-gasoline mix will get cheaper as corn prices decline. The fuel has also faced criticism for potential damage it might cause to car engines. A report earlier this summer found engine damage during an E15 test, but supporters of the fuel said the test was misleading and used questionable testing protocols. Would you use E15?

Anne Steckel, vice president of federal affairs for the National Biodiesel Board, said the move was a refreshing display of bipartisan cooperation to get this economy moving again." The extension is part of a $205 billion package called the "Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012." It will provide a $1 per gallon production tax credit for biodiesel producers. The bill also approves algae-based fuel for the tax break. Tax package would extend Biodiesel credit through 2013 Steckel said the biodiesel tax incentive is a job creator that will get biodiesel producers back to expanding businesses and hiring new employees, and urged the Senate to act on the bill. "We call on the full Senate to quickly pass this package, and for the House to follow suit so that biodiesel producers can get the certainty they need to begin hiring again." According to the bill summary, the proposed legislation will also extend the small agri-biodiesel producer credit of 10 cents per gallon. According to the National Biodiesel Board, the biodiesel tax incentive was first implemented in 2005 and also expired in 2010. After it was reinstated last year, the biodiesel industry set a new production record of nearly 1.1 billion gallons. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in September. http://farmfutures.com/story.aspx/senate-finance-committee-approves-biodiesel-tax-credit-17/62128</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344275091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344275243000-17</Id><Topic><Title>Senate Finance Committee Approves Biodiesel &amp; Algae-Based Fuel Tax Credit</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344275091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U.S. Biodiesel Production Up During June USAgNet - 08/06/2012 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that 112 million gallons of biodiesel were produced in June, bringing year-to-date production to 557 million gallons through the first six months of the year. Biodiesel production is reported under the EPA's biomass-based diesel category in the Renewable Fuel Standard. The EPA numbers show a total of 117.5 million gallons of Biomass-based Diesel for the month of June, but that figure also includes renewable diesel. Last year, the biodiesel industry set a new production record of nearly 1.1 billion gallons, supporting more than 39,000 jobs across the country.

The original post simply posted the article as is. Even the subject line was taken directly from the article. The only spin is on YOUR part wallboard. 2) Please tell us who is "literally going to starve". You can't fall back to say this is hyperbole as you chose to claim it to be 'literal'. Nothing in the post or the article talked about actions to lower payin or reduce payout other than to indicate that more pay in or less pay out will become a reality if something is not changed. But it did not advocate what the change should be or even if would happen. 3. The actuarial facts are what they are. Even assuming the Federal gov't can find the funds to pay back all the SS IOU's held, by about 2033 that surplus is gone. What is your plan then? Do you expect the general budget to make up the 25% in benefits that will be unfunded? 4. Before you characterize my position (which you neither know or could understand), try to realize MY preference would 'hurt' the wealthiest the most. In a very general sense, what I would like to see happen (OVER TIME) is for SS to slowly be reverted back to what it was intended. And that is NOT a retirement plan but a social safety net for those who are (through their actios or through not fault of theirs) less fortunate. But since we have sold SS as a retirement fund for so long now (and many have become dependent upon it being there for them when they retire) any changes must be over 'long' time periods to give everyone a chance to adjust accordingly.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1344280039000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:07:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344283140000-22</Id><Topic><Title>Calling BS on Reid's Bain tax claims</Title><Username>infernal.equinox</Username><Timestamp>1344200540000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 17:02:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harry Reid is an unabashed lair, he claims a friend told him Romney hasn't paid his taxes for the last.

NOONE As to whether I need SS or medicaide. Correct, I don't intend to need either. I am and have always based my plans on the assumption that SS will not be there for me and if I plan my retirement correctly w/o SS, I won't qualify for medicaid. You have an issue with someone planning to take care of themselves? Other than stating, I prefer making SS a social safety net (as was its original intent), I have not defined where or how I would draw the line on who would/would not get SS. You also mischaraterize what I ahve said about SS. I don't want my $'s back. Gov't can keep every dime I have paid in and I will never make a claim against SS. All that has to be agreed to is that they will never take another dime from me. They can keep the hundreds of thousands they already took from me. If you wallboard are planning to use SS as your retirement, you will be sorely mistaken come your turn in line. That has nothing to do with me or who I have faith in.

With prices down nearly 40% since the second quarter of 2011, Chesapeake says it cut its proved undeveloped reserves by 4.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent of reserves for the first half of 2012, to 17.4 trillion cubic feet equivalent. Most of the cuts come from the removal of proved, undeveloped reserves in the company’s Barnett and Haynesville Shale plays, Chesapeake says. The company also says it expects to enter into agreements to sell three assets in the oil-rich Permian Basin field in the third quarter. Chesapeake says it already has “a purchase and sale agreement” with affiliates of Houston-based EnerVest, Ltd. for assets in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian Basin, and accepted bids on two other packages in the Delaware Basin portion. Chesapeake, which needs the cash to pay down its heavy debt load, says it also expects to close various other asset sales during the third quarter. Shares are up 3.3% at $18.28 in after-hours trading. Through Monday’s close, the stock is down 21% this year. Meanwhile, Chesapeake’s debt continues to rise despite the company’s promise to cut it down. Its long-term debt has risen to $14.3 billion, up from $13 billion in the first quarter. Chesapeake now says it will have to gain even more than previously thought in asset sales to get its situation under control. That amounts to a minimum of $13 billion in sales for the year, compared to the former $11.5 billion minimum target. http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/08/06/chesapeake-energy-cuts-reserves-as-natural-gas-falls/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344295070000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:17:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344295220000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Chesapeake Energy Cuts Reserves as Natural Gas Falls</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344295070000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:17:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bloomberg News Chesapeake Net Income Rises as Asset Sales Offset Prices By Joe Carroll on August 06, 2012 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) (CHK) reported the highest quarterly profit in company history and increased the amount of cash it plans to raise from asset sales this year to plug a looming funding shortfall. Second-quarter net income rose 91 percent to $972 million, or $1.29 cents a share, from $510 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier, the Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement today. Excluding the gains from asset sales and other one-time items, Chesapeake earned 6 cents a share, 2 cents less than the average (CHK) of 31 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chesapeake increased the minimum it plans to raise through asset sales this year to $13 billion from $11.5 billion, and said more than half of that will come in the third quarter. The proceeds will be used to pay back a $4 billion bridge loan obtained in May from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) (GS) and Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) (JEF), and to reduce outstanding debt to $9.5 billion, according to the statement. The results were announced after the close of U.S. stock trading. Chesapeake rose 4 percent to $18.40 at 4:40 p.m. in New York. The company said it is negotiating sales agreements on its Permian Basin oilfield assets, which will be divided into three packages. EnerVest Ltd., based in Houston, has agreed to buy one of the packages, Chesapeake said, without disclosing a price. The Permian sales, along with various other assets, will be completed in the third quarter for expected total proceeds of $7 billion, the company said. Lower Prices Chesapeake lost one-fifth of its market value this year as the impact of tumbling gas prices was compounded by disclosures that Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon borrowed more than $800 million last year to finance his stakes in thousands of company-owned oil and gas wells. McClendon was stripped of the chairman’s role in June and more than half the board was replaced at the insistence of Chesapeake’s largest investors, Southeastern Asset Management Inc. and Carl Icahn. The board is conducting an internal investigation, begun April 26, of McClendon’s personal borrowings from some of the company’s biggest financiers. Chesapeake hasn’t said when the board will finish the internal inquiry. Probes also are underway at the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Founding Partner McClendon, 53, co-founded Chesapeake in 1989 with 10 employees and $50,000 in cash, building the company into the largest U.S. gas producer by embracing intensive drilling techniques overlooked by major international energy explorers. Chesapeake remained the top U.S. gas supplier until June 2010, when Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) (XOM) acquired XTO Energy. Gas futures traded in New York plunged 46 percent to $2.354 per million British thermal units, the lowest second-quarter average in 13 years. U.S. gas production rose 4.4 percent in May from a year earlier to the highest since at least 1973, Energy Department figures showed. Gas output has continued to climb as explorers accelerated efforts to harvest byproducts such as ethane, a plastics ingredient that commands higher prices. McClendon’s effort to shift Chesapeake’s production away from gas and more heavily toward liquid byproducts such as ethane and propane has been undercut by a growing glut of gas liquids from shale formations in Texas and Pennsylvania. Ethane, a hydrocarbon that is stripped out of the gas stream before the fuel is pumped into pipelines, averaged 40 cents a gallon during the second quarter, 48 percent less than a year earlier. Ethane reached a 3-year high of 95 cents a gallon as recently as October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-06/chesapeake-net-income-rises-as-asset-sales-offset-prices</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344295220000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:20:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344296738000-34</Id><Title>The Vast Potential For Renewable Energy In The American West</Title><Msg>The Vast Potential For Renewable Energy In The American West By Climate Guest Blogger on Aug 6, 2012 at 3:11 pm by Jessica Goad, Daniel J. Weiss, and Richard W. Caperton Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah—the “Four Corners” states plus their western neighbors—are home to some of the best renewable electricity potential in the country. These states have consistently sunny skies for solar power, wind-blown plains and deserts for turbines, and underground heat perfect for geothermal energy. They also have incredible potential for smaller-scale technologies like rooftop solar panels and energy efficiency improvements. Our analysis shows these states can house clean energy projects that could realistically provide more than 34 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal energy over the next two decades. This development could stimulate more than $137 billion in investment in the renewable energy sector, create more than 209,000 direct jobs, and provide electricity for 7 million homes. With supportive federal policies, these renewable electricity goals can be met and surpassed. Already, the American West leads the way in construction of clean and renewable electricity projects on the ground, spurred forward by policies including state renewable electricity standards and government investments in clean technologies. A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics study reflects this success, determining that in 2010, “green goods and services” accounted for: •49,717 jobs in Arizona •338,445 jobs in California •72,452 jobs in Colorado •17,254 jobs in Nevada •21,267 jobs in New Mexico •27,948 jobs in Utah This comes to 527,083 jobs altogether in these six states. Such projects and employment reinforce westerners’ perspective that renewable energy is a key component of their states’ economic future. A poll this year by the Colorado College “State of the Rockies Project” found that two-thirds of voters polled said “increasing the use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power will create new jobs” in their states. And when it came to comparing fossil fuels and renewables, western voters were far more likely to encourage more wind and solar power over coal and oil. In response to the question “which one of the following sources of energy would you want to encourage the use of here in [your state]?”, respondents answered overwhelmingly in favor of clean energy. (see Figure 1) The clean energy revolution in these western states is already under way, and http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/06/644271/the-vast-potential-for-renewable-energy-in-the-american-west/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344296738000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:45:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344299528000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Our Heartland and Our Warming Climate</Title><Username>walhieee12</Username><Timestamp>1344214607000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 20:56:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your incredible insanity on display (along with your lies).
