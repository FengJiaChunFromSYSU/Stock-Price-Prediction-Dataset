Resolute Marine Energy (RME) announced that its preliminary permit application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been approved, marking the official start of the Yakutat, Alaska Wave Energy Project. “This approval is an important milestone for RME. After several years of research and testing we are finally poised to move forward with a commercial project that will have us providing renewable power to a community,” said Bill Staby, founder and CEO of RME. “We look forward to working with our partners in Yakutat as we begin to move this project from vision to reality.” On July 25, 2012, RME filed an application for a preliminary permit under section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act to study the feasibility of the Yakutat Alaska Wave Energy Project. The project involves a 25-square-mile area within Alaska’s submerged lands off Yakutat, a remote community in the southeast portion of Alaska. As presently planned, the project will consist of an array of RME’s SurgeWEC™ wave energy converters for a total installed capacity of 750 kilowatts. The project would offer an estimated annual generation of over 3,000 MWh. RME Senior Engineer and project manager Clifford Goudey said, “With this FERC approval we can begin the studies and the planning that are necessary to design the project and to prepare the needed application for a FERC license to operate. We need to characterize the wave resource in detail and engineer a system that will provide the most benefit to the community by alleviating its current dependence upon its diesel-powered generating plant.” Scott Newlun, General Manager of Yakutat Power is excited about the prospects. He said, “Today we’re totally at the mercy of the price of diesel fuel. We see a huge energy resource going to waste over on Cannon Beach and hope this project brings sustainable power to Yakutat and eases the cost of energy on our rate payers, which is currently 55 cents per kWh for most residential customers.” In December 2012 RME successfully tested its latest SurgeWEC device off the Outer Banks in Duck, North Carolina. The tests demonstrated RME’s novel approach to low-cost deployment and provided performance data over the six weeks of testing. The tests were the final phase of work under an award from the Department of Energy that helped support the advancement of the technology to its present commercializable state. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and established in 2007, RME is a privately held, international industry leader in the development of ocean wave power generation technology. offshorewindDOTbiz/2013/02/08/usa-rme-begins-wave-energy-project-in-alaska/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360388430010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 00:40:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360412548934-3</Id><Topic><Title>ref steve is a ??</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1360359506969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:38:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how come u get tubs down always?

New figures from the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) published yesterday, reveal the UK now has 8.4GW of wind power capacity installed, although it still lags far behind Germany in first place with 31.3GW of capacity and Spain in second place with 22.8GW. The UK last year installed 1.9GW of new capacity, leapfrogging ahead of France and Italy from its fifth place ranking in 2011 to third place in 2012. Only Germany installed more new capacity last year with 2.4GW of capacity added. In total, the EU wind energy sector installed 11.6GW of new capacity in 2012, worth between €12.8bn and €17.2bn of investment, and accounting for more than a quarter of total new energy capacity across the continent last year. Total European wind power capacity now stands at 105.6GW, up 12 per cent on last year's figures. However, the EWEA warned that overall the EU is lagging behind the aims set by 27 EU Member States in their National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP). Although 15 member states now have more than 1GW of wind power capacity installed, 18 countries are not currently on track to meet their NREAP targets, including Slovakia, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, France and Portugal. The UK should have 8.6GW of new capacity by 2012 under its plans, meaning it remains just behind schedule to meet the 2020 target. Maf Smith, RenewableUK deputy chief executive, said the figures reflected the growing importance of the British wind industry to the economy, but called for greater certainty over the future of financial support mechanisms for the industry. "The government is calling for the UK to more than quadruple the amount of wind installed between now and 2020," he said. "The industry can achieve 31GW onshore and offshore by the end of the decade, but only with clear cross-party political support. "We can attract billions of pounds worth of investment to the UK and create tens of thousands of jobs, but only if the signals from Westminster are right. The proof of this will be in the Energy Bill, which is due to become law by the end of the year. So the decisions taken by government over next few months are absolutely crucial for the UK's wind industry." Despite the recent wind power boom, the EWEA also warned that the 2012 figures do not reflect the "significantly negative impact" of economic, regulatory, and political uncertainty in Europe since 2011. The turbines installed during 2012 were mostly permitted, financed, and ordered prior to the Eurozone crisis and concerns remain that the rate of installation could slow in the coming years. "The 2012 figures reflect orders made before the wave of political uncertainty that has swept across Europe since 2011, which is having a hugely negative impact on the wind energy sector," said Christian Kjaer, chief executive of EWEA. "We expect this instability to be far more apparent in 2013 and 2014 installation levels." In related news, Siemens today confirmed that it has signed a €700m deal to supply 80 wind turbines to a major new German offshore wind project by 2015. The SWT-3.6-120 machines will be installed at the 288MW Butendiek wind power plant in Germany. Siemens Financial Services has a 22.5 per cent equity stake in the project, alongside equal stakes by Marguerite Fund, Industriens Pension and PKA. "By 2020 we estimate there will be a worldwide installed wind energy capacity of 500GW," said Felix Ferlemann, chief executive of Siemens Wind Power division. "Offshore is by far the fastest growing market segment." businessgreenDOTcom/bg/news/2242524/uk-leaps-up-european-wind-power-league-table</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360416539211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 08:28:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360418073789-5</Id><Topic><Title>FOUR DOLLAR a Gallon Gas = Time for US Goverment Ownership of Oil Companies</Title><Username>deliciouspoke</Username><Timestamp>1360344018305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:20:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can it be done here also?

However, with €10 million in ready cash to invest in a place like Stuttgart, the economics look somewhat different. The willingness and ability to pay is entirely different. Ability to hold through any volatility or economic condition is different when you pay cash. Multiply that €10 million by thousands and tens of thousands of others, across multiple markets, and globally too... Property prices will certainly be pushed beyond the financing ability of the middle class going forward. They will just have to rent. As they are driven out of the market the market turnover and price volatility will decline...That is how it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries before the widespread use of bank mortgage finance by middle class borrowers... The stock market, on the other hand, is a total waste of time. It is easy to invest in but that ease is certainly obvious to all. Nobody needs a stock to live in either... Your figures on unemployment are all wrong and confused too...Stuttgart and Munich have almost no unemployment, and average incomes are rising. Equivalent places in the US, with the right combinations of human capital are doing well too...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1360424760192</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 10:46:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360446888083-9</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve goes back on PERMANENT IGNORE !!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360345478555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:44:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and not 1 thumbs up for u the coward commie #$%$.
