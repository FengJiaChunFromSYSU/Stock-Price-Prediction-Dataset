Since the previous Congress, House Republicans have exercised their majority power to pass measures calling for expanded oil and gas production, restricting EPA and cancelling other Obama environmental and energy initiatives. But the Democrat-controlled Senate has blocked every move. And perhaps the best way for Republicans there to challenge planned power plant regulations — the Congressional Review Act — won’t become an option until the EPA rules become final years from now. “I don’t know other than a CRA [what] could be done be done to stop these regulations,” Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said, adding he would seek a CRA vote to halt the EPA climate regulations. But even those Senate CRA challenges to EPA rules from Inhofe and other Republicans in recent years have failed to win the simple majority vote needed to pass, thanks to opposition from Democrats. “We all know how high a hurdle that Congressional Review Act is,” Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said. “There’s really nothing they can do,” said Dave Banks, a Republican consultant who once worked at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. “Republicans will need to rethink their climate strategy.” Republicans will eventually need to lodge CRA challenges to EPA power plant rules, Banks said, but even if they muster enough support to win a vote, they won’t be able to overcome an Obama veto. “Then I think we’re going to have to adjust our thinking about it because politico</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372252933154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372254261354-6</Id><Title>Get ready for another botched policy out of Obama...</Title><Msg>The optimal strategy is for him to copy Germany's energy policy. He will not do this. He may well tax US energy production with fines and regulations, but, judging from his previous leftist approaches, he will do everything he can to prevent the tax burden from falling on residential users of power, especially the low income voters who favor him. Those are the vary people the taxes must fall on for the policy to be effective. If he attempts to tax all power consumption to build renewable energy, or raise revenue for other purposes, it will simply increase industrial &amp; commercial power prices in the USA and drive business out of the USA. The USA also lacks the scientific base to go head-to-head with German industry without the benefit of US tariffs and lax environmental laws. The German government subsidizes industry with free university, excellent primary and secondary school, huge spending on R&amp;D, and well planned and maintained infrastructure, so complying with regulations and paying taxes is easy - because they get a benefit from government. His free trade plan will be helpful in increasing Germany's economic power, as will a botched environmental policy, as will Obamacare which is a pathetic shadow of our system. Still, Obama must be the best you can do.

LOUIS, June 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Peabody agrees with President Obama that greater use of clean coal is essential. We also support his proposals to increase deployment of higher-efficiency generation; expand research in carbon capture, use and storage technologies; and advance coal generation in poor nations. We would go further and say that all nations need the clean, reliable, low-cost electricity that coal-fueled generation provides. Such elements are a key part of the Peabody Plan, and it is good to also see these in the President's proposals. The Peabody Plan seeks to achieve universal energy access by 2050 in a way that puts people first and advances society's important goals of energy security, economic growth and environmental solutions. At the same time, any actions that would reduce coal-fueled generation harm Americans, who would feel the same pain at the plug that we all feel at the pump. The best economies in the world continue to turn to coal. Nations such as China and India are increasing coal use as hundreds of millions of people experience the dual benefits of electrification and urbanization. The U.S. is seeing a sharp rise in coal-fueled generation in 2013 as the most economic choice, with natural gas prices doubling from 2012 lows.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372254920575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372257177525-9</Id><Title>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending June 21, 2013</Title><Msg>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending June 21, 2013 U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15.7 million barrels per day during the week ending June 21, 2013, 173 thousand barrels per day above the previous week’s average.

Power generated by hydro, wind, solar and other renewable sources will be twice that from nuclear power in just three years, the international agency reported in its second annual Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report. National leader: Houston to buy half its power from renewable sources The report acknowledged renewable energy still faces a complicated economic future, but said renewable power is expected to increase by 40 percent in the next five years and will make up almost a quarter of the global power mix by 2018. That’s up from 20 percent in 2011. Most of that is hydropower; the share of non-hydropower will double, reaching 8 percent by 2018, according to the agency. Coal struggles: Sun sets on two more US coal plant projects “As their costs continue to fall, renewable power sources are increasingly standing on their own merits versus new fossil-fuel generation,” the agency’s executive director, Maria van der Hoeven, said as she presented the report at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum in New York Wednesday, according to a news release. “This is good news for a global energy system that needs to become cleaner and more diversified, but it should not be an excuse for government complacency.” Led by China, developing nations are expected to account for two-thirds of the global increase in renewable power generation between now and 2018, according to the agency. fuelfix</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372269380554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:56:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372270251533-16</Id><Title>Petroleum association regrouping after loss at Supreme Court</Title><Msg>Petroleum association regrouping after loss at Supreme Court Chris Woodward OneNewsNow Wednesday, June 26, 2013 The American Petroleum Institute is weighing its options after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on E15 ethanol. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge by the API to block sales of E15, a blend that contains 15 percent ethanol, higher than the normal blend currently sold at gas pumps, and intended only for vehicles made since 2001. "We're weighing our legal options right now," says Bob Greco of the American Petroleum Institute. The court's decision leaves in place a federal appeals court ruling that dismissed challenges from API and other groups, including food producers and restaurants, upset with the use of corn in ethanol and claiming it drives up food prices. "We still feel strongly that EPA's decision [to allow E15] was premature and that the use of E15 risks damaging engines in millions of vehicles," says Greco. Greco And Greco says API is not the only organization concerned. "No automaker is extending warranty coverage on these older vehicles that were retroactively approved by EPA," he adds. "Even AAA has recommended not using E15." Concerns about motorcycles and small engines have also been expressed. OneNewsNow recently spoke with ethanol proponent Tom Buis of Growth Energy about these concerns. He acknowledged that E15 is not approved for smaller engines - but only because EPA did not conduct the testing. Buis added that ethanol gets a bad rap for issues that are maybe 30 years old, and most of the criticism is from people who do not wish to see the industry succeed. Buis Bob Greco says that's not the case. "We're saying this because we want to supply fuels that a customer wants and can be used in their engine," he tells OneNewsNow. "At the end of the day, there will be ethanol used in gasoline, with or without a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)," he adds. "Ethanol has valuable blending properties." onenewsnow</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372270251533</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271746855-17</Id><Topic><Title>Petroleum association regrouping after loss at Supreme Court</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372270251533</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:10:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somebody should remind Greco and the API that the Renewable Fuel Standard is the law and failure to comply may place big oils management in the slammer!

Dlouhy Climate change science might just have become the new third rail in American politics. One day after President Barack Obama unveiled a broad blueprint for reining in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions and adapting U.S. infrastructure for more droughts and floods, Republicans are taking aim at the plan’s economic costs — not the science underpinning it. It’s a remarkable change for a political party with high-profile leaders who have declared climate change a hoax and held congressional hearings designed to amplify doubts about whether human behavior contributes to the phenomenon. It also may be a pragmatic one. As attitudes and beliefs about climate change have shifted — and the nation’s economic woes have come to the forefront — casting Obama’s plan as a job killer and “backdoor energy tax” may be a better strategy. Those were the overwhelming messages from Republican lawmakers criticizing Obama’s climate change plan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Natural gas: How Obama’s climate change speech supported fracking “Our argument with the president right now is that he’s picking energy winners and losers, he’s harming innovation and there’s going to be a direct assault on jobs,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters Wednesday. “There are direct economic and policy challenges to what the president decides net. There will be ramifications that will be lifelong.” Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said Obama’s approach amounted to unilaterally imposing a “national energy tax” and a “war on jobs, our economy, affordable energy, American families and small businesses.” Asked repeatedly Wednesday to address the science of the issue, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters that while “we all want to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can,” Obama’s plan is nothing more than “a national energy tax.” “The costs are real,” he said. “T</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372291522420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 20:05:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372304817972-20</Id><Title>Offshore Wind Energy &amp; Transmission Line Will Provide Huge Benefits to New Jersey</Title><Msg>Offshore Wind Energy &amp; Transmission Line Will Provide Huge Benefits to New Jersey Tuesday, 25 June 2013 08:25 (This is an Op-Ed submission from a group of wind developers, supply chain manufacturers and environmental groups. They are listed at the end) ]In August 2010, New Jersey’s legislature, guided by Senate President Stephen Sweeney, passed and Governor Christie signed the landmark Offshore Wind Economic Development Act. In adopting this law, New Jersey made a strong commitment to continue the shift to clean, renewable energy; creating new, good-paying jobs, keeping more of our energy dollars here in New Jersey, and reducing pollution. We are New Jersey businesses eager to provide services and equipment to the offshore wind farms and grid connection systems that will be built as a result of this legislation. We are environmental organizations urgently calling for the reduction of carbon emissions through large-scale deployment of New Jersey’s largest renewable resource: offshore wind. And we are the wind farm and grid connection system developers who will be organizing the billions of dollars of investment in New Jersey’s economy needed to build the projects. We are all proud to join together in commending the New Jersey legislature and Governor Christie on their forward-looking leadership to build this new industry for the state. We are also asking the state’s leadership to redouble their efforts to implement this important policy, to ensure that we don’t miss out on the tremendous economic and environmental benefits inherent in offshore wind development. According to a study by the global analytics firm IHS, constructing 3,000MW of offshore wind and shared grid connection in New Jersey will create over 10,000 full-time jobs in the state. The large majority of these jobs are good-paying, high-skilled jobs in areas like manufacturing, construction, engineering, and marine industries, and especially well-suite</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372304817972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 23:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
