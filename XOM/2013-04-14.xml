A new high was recorded Sunday in the amount of electric power produced by wind turbines in the state, according to the independent nonprofit that runs about four-fifths of the state's power grid. Wind gusts of more than 70 mph powered through the region beginning Saturday and lasting through Monday, with thousands losing power and drivers encountering poor visibility. Gusts were expected to continue in some areas late Tuesday into Wednesday. The new record was set at 6:44 p.m. Sunday, when turbines spinning of the California Independent System Operator grid reported 4,196 megawatts of power produced. That amount of power is enough to provide power to more than 3.1 million homes on average at once, according to data in a Cal ISO explainer. On Friday, April 5, wind turbines had produced 4,095 megawatts of power, surpassing California's record of 3,944 megawatts, which had been set on March 3. “With these impressive wind production levels, California is well positioned to meet the 33 percent by 2020 green power goal,” said ISO President and CEO Steve Berberich, referring to a sustainable energy target set by California law. Wind plants in California have a capacity of 5,899 megawatts on the Cal ISO grid, the organization said in a press release Monday, but not all of that capacity was available during the windstorm because of routine outages. In the United States, California comes in second in wind power to Texas, where the state's peak production is more than twice that seen the Golden State's Sunday record. nbcsandiegoDOTcom/news/local/SD-Windstorm-California-Wind-Energy-Record-San-Diego-202317641.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365917898116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 01:38:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365936519146-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOP working hard to disarm Red States</Title><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1365901254265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 21:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbocraps are communists Repubs are not.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1365936519146</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 06:48:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365936563317-3</Id><Topic><Title>MAXIPAD MAXIPAD</Title><Username>max_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1365730262552</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 21:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You tell em.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1365936563317</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 06:49:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365944685498-4</Id><Topic><Title>13G FILED BANKS BUYS 33 MILLION SHARES OF -YTRV-- MONSTER MOVE</Title><Username>tra.peace</Username><Timestamp>1365601292244</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:41:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talking about YTRV?

By eliminating land costs to deliver energy to the site with its facade based energy system the building can achieve many advantages. It could produce energy at a higher cost than fossil fuels and still be profitable. The cost of fossil fuels is irrelevant anyway, in a competitive sense, because of taxes. Technology will certainly improve the efficiency, which of course the German government will force to happen rather than rely on market forces. Also the building is located near an S-Bahn station. So their transportation costs are low, which is another thing the government forced to occur.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365944911110</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 09:08:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365948590446-6</Id><Title>check out this bashers post on BCCI..BARRIESNIGHTMARE6..REAL PRO</Title><Msg>YA</Msg><Username>tra.peace</Username><Timestamp>1365948590446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:09:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365949753828-7</Id><Title>Science Project for USA - Star Wars</Title><Msg>A 21st century Star Wars program, encompassing a military space station, military spacecraft, and space based weapons systems to intercept missiles and conduct ground bombardment would be the best use of the USA's resources. The US government simply lacks the institutional and political ability to develop energy, battery, fuel cell, and associated materials technologies. Its resources are not required anyway. Europe can handle the problem, and far more efficiently. The US military, however, does possess substantial potential. The "Manhattan Project" was designed and implemented by German-American scientists who were using German principles of centralization to achieve the goal. The scientists were either educated in German universities or American ones set up exactly like the German ones. The concept of organization was un-American, but possible because of a blank check from the FDR White House, and US military personnel just clearing the way for the scientists... After World War II German scientists introduced these same principles of centralization across a broad swath of U.S. industry creating a "military industrial complex" of great power and creativity. The NASA program and American Aerospace dominance can be traced directly to it. This institutional resource should be utilized.... The Republican Party does seem to favor the military so getting it to behave rationally and tax and spend in that area may be possible. One can only hope it does so...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365949753828</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:29:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365952276589-8</Id><Title>"when they outlaw guns...only outlaws will have guns."</Title><Msg>pay heed</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1365952276589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:11:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365952975735-9</Id><Topic><Title>"when they outlaw guns...only outlaws will have guns."</Title><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1365952276589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:11:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which would make them easy to arrest. The solution to America's crime problem is for the US Congress to copy German gun and criminal law. Considering the situation in the US, the death penalty for multiple firearms violations and felonies would clear your prisons rather quickly. 1 million executions per year for the first decade or so would easily reduce your gang problem. Certain English common law could be made to be efficient in this regard as it was in your colonial past. It only requires some imagination, and commitment to purifying and improving your society.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365952975735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:22:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365953077535-10</Id><Title>problem w/ gun control is---who controls the guns ???</Title><Msg>pay heed.</Msg><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1365953077535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365962983281-11</Id><Title>UK-based TMO Renewables building cellulosic fuel plant in Brazil</Title><Msg>UK-based TMO Renewables building cellulosic fuel plant in Brazil SAO PAULO | Fri Apr 12, 2013 8:27pm BST (Reuters) - UK-based TMO Renewables said on Friday it plans to build Brazil's first commercially viable second-generation ethanol plant, betting on the South American country's need for non-food-based biofuels. The firm is investing an initial $30 million with Brazil's Usina Santa Maria to open a 10 million liter cellulosic bioethanol plant, and later plans to build a full-scale industrial plant in Brazil's São Paulo state. Second-generation biofuels - such as cellulosic ethanol made from inedible plant parts - are still in their infancy, but are thought to have growth potential as some nations, including the United States, shy away from producing biofuels from food crops. High production costs have so far been a major impediment to deploying the technology on a commercial scale. "We believe that we will be the first to put a second-generation waste-to-ethanol plant into commercial operation," TMO representatives said in a written statement to Reuters. They said the plant would open in 2014 and is intended to supply flex-fuel cars on the Brazilian market. Bioenergy firm GraalBio is also planning to open an 82 million liter second-generation plant supplied with enzymes from Denmark's Novozymes in 2014. Brazil is a pioneer in the production of biofuels from sugar cane, and is the world's largest producer of the sweetener. TMO is also working building second-generation biofuel plants in China. ukDOTreutersDOTcom/article/2013/04/12/us-brazil-biofuel-tmo-idUKBRE93B10V20130412</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365962983281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 14:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365965557466-12</Id><Topic><Title>UK-based TMO Renewables building cellulosic fuel plant in Brazil</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365962983281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 14:09:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you and your BS government subsidized "energy solutions" are a joke.

China and the U.S. announced a new “Climate Change Working Group,” which will present a report at the next meeting of the joint Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, D.C. in July. “In keeping with the vision shared by the leaders of the two countries, the Working Group will begin immediately to determine and finalize ways in which they can advance cooperation on technology, research, conservation, and alternative and renewable energy. They will place this initiative on a faster track through the S&amp;ED next slated to meet this summer,” the announcement states. The two nations together noted the “sharp rise” in global temperatures over the past century, as well as “alarming” ocean acidification, rapidly vanishing Arctic sea ice, and the “striking incidence of extreme weather events occurring all over the world.” Todd Stern, the State Department’s special envoy for climate change and Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, will lead the working group effort. The new working group will review the two countries’ existing cooperation and ways to improve it, and look for new areas of “concrete, cooperative action” on “green” and low-carbon economic growth. China and the U.S. have a series of existing cooperation agreements on low-carbon energy, but Kerry... thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/293747-us-china-boost-climate-work-amid-increasing-dangers</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365985139822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 20:18:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365985580355-14</Id><Topic><Title>HEAVY DIP BUYING = GET YOURS TOO</Title><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1365620868822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:07:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Absurd.

Methane leaks (3.3% in the US based on the latest US EPA data and as high as 7.9% for methane from “fracking” coal seams). Using this information one can determine that gas burning for electricity can be much dirtier than coal burning greenhouse gas-wise (GHG-wise). While gas burning for power generates twice as much electrical energy per tonne of CO2 produced (MWh/tonne CO2) than coal burning and the health-adverse pollution from gas burning is lower than for coal burning, gas leakage in the system actually means that gas burning for powercan be worse GHG-wise than coal burning. This site is dedicated to informing the public that natural gas is not clean energy. Unfortunately pro-gas politicians and gas producers variously add to the popular misconceptions that “gas is clean energy ” or “gas is cleaner energy than coal”. While pricing any bad item (e.g. coal burning, smoking, drinking) is useful the devil is in the detail as to any desired Carbon Price and Carbon Tax as a market-based GHG pollution mitigation mechanism. Thus the Australian Government has made it clear that a significant intent of its proposed Carbon Tax is to promote a coal to gas transition. However, as set out below, a coal to gas transition will be disastrous, involving huge national investments to achieve an increase in GHG pollution. The current global Gas Boom, Gas Rush and Gasland perversion is enabled by corporate greed, lobbying and the falsehoods that “gas is clean” or that “gas is cleaner than coal”. Methane (CH4) is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) that on a 100 year time scale has a relative global warming potential (GWP) that is 25 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2).
