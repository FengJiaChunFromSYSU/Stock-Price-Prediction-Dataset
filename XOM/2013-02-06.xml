It is about perfectionism, hierarchy, and order. That superior cultural form was introduced to Germans by the nobility and specifically the Prussians. The elitist education system is the foundation of it, and it is firmly entrenched it will never be uprooted in Germany. The Americans had big plans to change it in 1945 and gave up, realizing their task was hopeless. Other powers can copy Germany to any degree it pleases them and have done so. Japan copied it. China is following the model way now, having introduced the same principles in their education system, abolishing liberal Marxist egalitarianism. Saudi Arabia's ruling class certainly believes in elitism, and King Faisal's government supports German scientific institutions (like the Max Planck Society), and they are of course buying panzers, and German solar power systems, along with much else... Working with country that embrace right thinking is no great difficulty. American Progressives were much inspired by Germany and copied parts of the system, before veering off on their Marxists tangent of late. The power of elitism and right wing government of by and for the "Universal Class" (Hegel) is indeed Universal... Let them copy. The world will be a better place.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1360135447837</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 02:24:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360137143608-3</Id><Topic><Title>Deutsche und Amerikanische Waffen für die Welt!!!</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1359990073384</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 10:01:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*King Abdullah's government at the moment.

Check out the columns by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) here and here. The committee’s first hearing of the new Congress, on Feb. 12, will explore natural-gas policy – including battles over whether the U.S. should greatly expand natural gas exports. “I want to ensure misguided government policy doesn’t shut down the manufacturing resurgence this country has seen as a result of reliable, low-cost natural-gas supplies. But I don’t oppose all exports. My aim is to find a sweet spot that allows some exports and keeps wells in production, while ensuring U.S. manufacturing and national security are not harmed by allowing unfettered liquefied natural-gas exports,” Wyden writes. Murkowski, for her part, touts the broad energy blueprint, called "Energy 20/20," that she unveiled this week and hopes will inform various committee bills. “I believe there’s a consensus that it’s in our national interest to make energy abundant, affordable, clean, diverse and secure. Our challenge is to align federal policy with that consensus. Energy 20/20 includes ideas to do so under seven headings: producing more, consuming less, clean-energy technology, energy delivery infrastructure, effective government, environmental responsibility and ‘an energy policy that pays for itself,’ ” she writes. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/281411-senate-energy-chief-wyden-get-gas-policy-right</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360177309013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:01:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360178319939-22</Id><Topic><Title>What Has Any Republican EVER Done To Help Middle Class?</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1359895848355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 07:50:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOUR RIGHT ON ---VOTE THEM OUT???</Msg><Username>a.hudkins</Username><Timestamp>1360178319939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:18:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360178758479-23</Id><Title>Obama Must Act On Climate Change To Meet Emissions Goals, World Resources Institute Report Finds</Title><Msg>Obama Must Act On Climate Change To Meet Emissions Goals, World Resources Institute Report Finds Posted: 02/06/2013 12:46 pm EST From Climate Central's Andrew Freedman: The Obama administration needs to act, with or without congressional legislation, in order to meet its short-term goal of reducing emissions of planet warming gases by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, according to a new report from the World Resources Institute, a Washington environmental think tank. A combination of federal actions, such as new U.S. EPA regulations on power plants and natural gas systems, as well as state initiatives, can achieve that goal, which the country is currently not on track to meet, the report said. According to the study, new congressional legislation will be required in order to meet the mid-century goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent or more below 2005 levels by 2050, in order to avoid the most severe consequences of manmade global warming. The current prospects for climate legislation on Capitol Hill are bleak, with the issue having little traction in both the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-led Senate following a failed attempt to pass a comprehensive emissions reduction bill, known as a “cap and trade” plan, in 2009. In his second inaugural address, Obama listed tackling global climate change as one of his top priorities for his second term. The WRI report, which is an update to a 2010 analysis, outlines the actions that the Obama administration can take to combat global warming with or without congressional involvement. The report recommends that the administration use the Clean Air Act to implement “strong standards” for carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, reduce non-energy sources of emissions, such as hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners and are a powerful global warming gas. Eliminating HFCs is the biggest opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions behind power plants, the study found. The report also found that the EPA can take steps to limit emissions of methane, which is another potent global warming gas, from natural gas production using its authority under the Clean Air Act, and that more actions can be taken at the federal level to make U.S. industry and home appliances more energy efficient. “The administration has multiple ways to move forward with smart policies to reduce U.S. emissions. The best opportunity is to enact new standards for existing power plants, which represent one-third of all U.S. emissions,” said Nicholas Bianco, Senior Associate, WRI, and the lead author of the report, in a press release. “The administration has the ability to put the U.S. on track to meet its commitments, and can do so in a cost-effective and efficient manner.” Recent trends in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions may make it more feasible for the administration to meet its short-term targets, since reduced economic growth, increased use of cleaner-burning natural gas to generate electricity, and reduced demand for transportation fuel have reduced U.S. carbon emissions to the lowest level since 1994. These trends are expected to be short-lived however, and the WRI analysis predicts “relatively modest growth” in U.S. total greenhouse gas emissions — largely driven by increases in gases other than carbon dioxide — over the coming decades. The increased use of natural gas presents a significant opportunity for reducing planet-warming emissions, the report found, since methane and other greenhouse gases can escape into the atmosphere from natural gas drilling and transportation infrastructure. At the state-level the report found that there are many opportunities to implement measures that would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, but that state-actions alone will not be sufficient to reach the near-term and long-term emissions reduction targets that scientists say are needed. According to the report, 29 states have set renewable energy standards, and 20 have energy efficiency standards. Some states, such as California, are moving ahead with ambitious plans to reduce emissions, while others are not pursuing such regulatory approaches. “The Administration has the tools. We look forward to seeing what steps they take to shift the country to a low-carbon pathway,” said WRI president Andrew Steer. During his first term in office, President Obama presided over several regulatory moves that are already resulting in emissions reductions, including new fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars and light trucks, energy efficiency standards for new appliances, and greenhouse gas regulations for new power power plants. huffingtonpostDOTcom/2013/02/06/obama-climate-change_n_2631037.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360178758479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:25:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360179356119-24</Id><Title>Wind Power Breaks Records In Spain — Produces More Electricity Than Any Other Source For 3 Months, &amp; Breaks 6 TWh in January</Title><Msg>Wind Power Breaks Records In Spain — Produces More Electricity Than Any Other Source For 3 Months, &amp; Breaks 6 TWh in January February 6, 2013 Zachary Shahan Denmark, the US, and Germany aren’t the only countries breaking wind power records these days. Spain is also a notable leader seeing strong wind power growth. In fact, it just saw its wind farms produce more electricity than any other source for a 3-month time period, for the first time ever. Wind turbines in Spain via Shutterstock “Since Nov. 1, wind has been the top technology in the electrical system,” the Spanish Wind Energy Association (SWEA) was quoted as writing on its blog. Additionally, data from grid operator Red Electrica de Espana concluded that 6 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity had been generated from wind in January, another first for the country. “The last time any technology exceeded 6 terawatt-hours of monthly generation was in 2010, when it was combined-cycle gas turbines,” SWEA added. In total, SWEA noted that 6 TWh of electricity was enough to power “enough to cover the electricity consumption of the majority of Spanish households” and that it “could cover the annual electricity consumption of countries like Honduras and Bolivia.” Pretty astounding. Wind power has certainly come a long way in the past decade or so! One more interesting fact from the SWEA blog is that the Spanish economy has gained €3 for every €1 of wind power incentives it has given. In other words, while Spain is suffering through some difficult economic times, wind power subsidies have had a positive net effect that has kept the country in a better situation than the one in which it could have landed. While Spain hasn’t hit 30% of electricity consumption like Denmark, it’s now up to about 25%, and it aims for 40% by 2020. Two final stats of the day: 1) on the whole, 70% of Europeans think that renewable energy sources should get priority in the coming 30 years; and 2) 81% of Spaniards think so (only behind Portugal, and tied with Germany, Denmark, and Austria). sDOTtt/1zrdb</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360179356119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:35:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360179822414-25</Id><Title>China Accounted For 35% Of Global Onshore Wind Capacity</Title><Msg>China Accounted For 35% Of Global Onshore Wind Capacity February 6, 2013 Joshua S Hill New figures compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance find that China installed 15.9 gigawatts (GW) of wind power in 2012, a number which accounts for 35 percent of the world’s new onshore wind capacity. Astonishingly this is actually an 18 percent drop from 2011′s record of 19.3 GW, a drop blamed on grid connection issues. This is the fourth year in a row since 2009 that China has ranked top of newly installed onshore wind capacity when they took the place from the United States. The US installed 13.2GW in 2012, a record figure for the country, but still 14 percent fewer turbines than China. Wind farm in Tianjin, China Image Source: Nick Cross Electricity generated by onshore wind has become China’s third-largest energy source behind coal and hydropower, totalling 61 GW of cumulative grid-connected wind energy capacity – 5.3% of the country’s total nameplate – and generating 2% of its total electricity. “2012 was a good year for the Chinese wind industry, considering how tough the environment was,” commented Demi Zhu, China wind analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The industry faced many problems including a reluctance by the grid operator to buy all the intermittent electricity produced by wind farms, plus stricter permitting requirements, unpaid subsidies and vigorous government efforts to cool down the industry’s rate of expansion.” Financial investment for wind energy in China fell by 12 percent to $27.2 billion in 2012 according to data gathered by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, however this has in turn meant that the same dollar amount of investment committed during 2012 financed 10 percent more megawatts than if it had been invested during 2011. On top of that, Bloomberg New Energy Finance found that a distressing 15 GW was unconnected to the national grid. “This year however, project approvals have sped up and we forecast a modest recovery in both financing activity and construction in 2013,” Zhu said. Looking forward, Bloomberg New Energy Finance are forecasting 16.6 GW of installations for China in 2013, followed by 17 to 18 GW in both 2014 and 2015, rates of increase which would help the Chinese government reach their end-2015 target of 100 GW of grid-connected new energy capacity a year early. In fact, according to GTM Research’s China Wind Market Quarterly, China is likely to shatter that goal by reaching 150 GW by year-end 2015. “The fact that China wind overtook nuclear as a generation source even in its most challenging year of recent times is a testament to the massive scale and momentum of the industry in this country,” Zhu said. Only 0.7 GW of nuclear was installed during 2012, allowing wind energy to become the third largest source of energy, a figure backed up by the China Wind Energy Association in a new report released late last month. China is regularly in the news here on Cleantechnica, exceeding new energy installation records and putting to shame industrialised nations. For sure, China has a more immediate problem to solve — a booming population and horrendously pollutant-driven energy generation — and a massive industry to throw at the problem, but it seems to me that nations across the planet could take lessons from the drive behind China’s new energy revolution. sDOTtt/1zrQm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360179822414</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:43:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360180652438-26</Id><Title>Marxist US School System</Title><Msg>A system that socializes the educational monies and opportunities in public schools is Marxist. It is a mystery why supposedly right-wing states in the US maintain such a system. They should be able to implement a three part school system, roughly corresponding to to upper, middle, and lower class, with students separated in elementary school on the basis of intellectual ability, discipline, and work ethic. Measuring such things objectively is not hard. Once the streams of students are separated the schools can be optimized to each group's potential... Such a system would save high income parents the cost of private school, and allow gifted low income students a chance. Indeed, private schools could possibly fill in for the role of the upper class public school track... The cost of the system would be lower from efficiency gains, and savings could be allocated to scholarships for top students.

But signs of a voluntary slowdown by the industry in response to a shrinking corn supply and other factors aren’t good enough for an array of ethanol critics headed for Capitol Hill on Tuesday. The Environmental Working Group, Taxpayers for Common Sense and other organizations that participated in a press briefing on Monday, will urge House and Senate lawmakers to lower the mandated ethanol production in the Renewable Fuels Standard. There also were renewed calls from those groups for the Environmental Protection Agency to issue a partial or complete waiver on all mandated ethanol production. If that sounds familiar, that’s because it was only a few weeks ago that the EPA said no to a similar request, maintaining that a waiver would have little effect on corn prices. In fact, the most recent adjustment in the mandate is meant to increase production of renewable fuels from 13.2 billion gallons in 2012 to 13.8 billion gallons in 2013. Continuing drought and rising food prices figured strongly in the arguments of critics of corn-based fuel. “The Renewable Fuels Standard is a man-made crisis; the 2012 drought is not,” said Tom Elam, speaking on behalf of the nation’s poultry producers. “The combination of the two is nearly insurmountable.” Elam, an Indiana-based consultant with FarmEcon LLC, said the price of retail turkey meat rose to a record $1.20 a pound in 2012, and eight major poultry producers have filed for bankruptcy since 2008. “We need to inject a dose of reality into the Renewable Fuels Standard,” he said, “especially when the corn supply is depleted by historically low inventories.” Sneller wasn’t buying it. “We’re seeing a market adjustment,” he said, “which means less corn demand through ethanol plants.” Cost of production isn’t the only cause of a production cutback that also extends to Ravenna, Albion, Atkinson and other Nebraska locations, he said. “Probably the biggest factor right now is lack of demand for ethanol,” said Sneller. That, in turn, reflects declining gasoline demand and other factors. “Drought is not a rational reason for waiving the Renewable Fuels Standard,” Sneller said. A major factor in its existence is the clean fuels programs in major cities trying to clean up carbon monoxide pollution from vehicle emissions. But in their litany of complaints about ethanol Monday, critics also pointed to loss of wetlands and increasing hunger and political instability in developing countries that depend on the United States' corn exports. Kristin Sundell of ActionAid said her recent trip to Guatemala underscored the latter point. “I heard over and over from people who felt squeezed by the rising price of food and shrinking access to land.” Although it’s white corn that’s more important to the human food supply there, white corn is diverted to livestock feed when yellow corn is in short supply, Sundell said. Looking ahead, an inflexible fuel mandate and continuing drought “would be devastating,” she said. Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group said the national wetlands inventory dropped by 23 million acres in the past four years. That’s an area about the size of Indiana, Faber said. That contributes to global warming and more runoff of farm chemicals into surface water, he said. “For these reasons and others,” Faber said, “now is very clearly the time for Congress to decrease our dependence on ethanol.” journalstarDOTcom/news/local/ethanol-slowdown-not-enough-say-mandate-critics/article_0c090845-2948-505c-a932-83c8a146e294.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360182448426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 15:27:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360182671716-29</Id><Title>Congrats To The Div Hunters That Got In Todays Low.</Title><Msg>You will also catch the next hikez in Divy,and probably 5 to 10 points,if You stick around.</Msg><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1360182671716</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 15:31:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360188289468-30</Id><Title>Yahoo says Xom was down to 86.59 today .. must be typo.</Title><Msg>Wish it would drop to 86.</Msg><Username>drpearso</Username><Timestamp>1360188289468</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 17:04:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360188731863-31</Id><Title>#$%$ Morris--Fox news--R I P</Title><Msg>#$%$ Morris predicted a Mitt Romney landslide.

You have just learned a valuable lesson. XOM had an open gap at 86.66. Gaps are filled 95% of the time, and it doesn't matter how long it takes to fill it. Just for the record, you will see the 86s again. How do I know. The EOD candlestick tells me so.</Msg><Username>dfscorner</Username><Timestamp>1360199385789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 20:09:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
