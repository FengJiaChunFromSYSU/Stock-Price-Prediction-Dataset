Did you know Obama's closest advisor Valerie Jarrett is Iranian and she is helping Iran in their goal of the destruction of Israel? The US Press and the ignorant US masses who continue to support Hussein and the Demoncrap Party are to be blamed for the assured destruction of the US, and possibly the world. "The greatest satisfaction today over the re-election of Obama is not being felt in the Democratic Party. It is not being felt among the media, who are no longer objective observers but have turned instead into corrupt partisans who ruthlessly censored the truth about Obama and helped peddle his demonising propaganda about his opponent. It is not being felt among the gloating, drooling decadents of the western left who now scent a great blood-letting of all who dare defy their secular inquisition. No, the greatest satisfaction is surely being felt in Iran. With four more years of Obama in the White House, Iran can now be sure that it will be able to complete its infernal construction of a genocide bomb to use against the Jews and the west. World War Three has now come a lot closer. It is said that, with likely gridlock in Congress over domestic issues, Obama will concentrate on foreign policy. We should all shudder. So far, Obama has empowered Iran to destabilise the region; supported Islamist takeovers in Egypt and Libya; is backing al Qaeda affiliates in Syria; refused to come to the aid of Americans being attacked by al Qaeda in Benghazi as a result of which four American officials were murdered; and hung Israel out to dry against its genocidal Palestinian attackers. A report last month that Obama was secretly negotiating with the Iranian regime took on an even more incendiary aspect a few days ago with a claim that these negotiations were being led by his close friend and adviser, Valerie Jarrett. If Jarrett was indeed involved, that should strike a deep chill into anyone who has not joined the lemming-like leap over the edge of the western cliff. For Iranian-born Jarrett – who Obama has admitted he consults before he takes any decision and who has been said to act as his ‘spine’ -- is a far-leftist with roots deep in the corrupt Chicago Democratic machine. Indeed, Jarrett has been credited with originally smoothing Obama’s entry into Chicago’s political elite, and is now said to be – despite her controversial background -- the most influential person in his circle."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1352459654183</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 06:14:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352460877791-3</Id><Title>Iranian Warplanes Fired on US Drone Over Gulf: Pentagon</Title><Msg>http://www.cnbc.com/id/49752585</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1352460877791</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 06:34:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352464975225-4</Id><Title>THE CIVIL WAR IS ON !!

You're asking for ONE Navy "Seal" to take action. Is that like the super Seal who has magical secret powers? Israel "bomb" Iran? One bomb? Then you say "even voters don't like him anymore", well more voters do and you lost so move to the fatherland you illiterate freak. Then your little screed rants on with, " sell all your stock and fund"??? Is that one fund really large and would it alone cripple the financial system? Then you claim "they will be begging for mitt romney" and finish with "that the new america". Ever think of using an s somewhere at the end of a word you wish to express as a plueral or 's to infer the word is after a word? No? I must admit that I can see why you are so stringently anti tax because whatever education you received was an enormous waste of $$. My guess is that you'll appear with alias's like americanpatriot or something to that effect while you scream for the nations demise.. You're a freak and a Nazi. You're a prime example of all that went wrong in our public school system. Maybe instead of the mysterious death panel, we should have a stupid panel and ensure that people lie you never have a dime of taxpayer $$ spent on them for education because it will merely be wasted on a hopeless cause?

Oil equivalent energy use removes the clutter of central bank manipulation, housing and speculator fluff from the economic series. The result is a clear shattering of the trend c. 2005-2006, followed by a collapse, then a new trend down which is confirmed now. The Hurricane ensures that 2012 will put in a new low on the trend too... The tax increase next year will bludgeon it even lower. It is a rare thing for this to happen in the USA. The last time was the catastrophic break that followed the crash of 1929, which in turn followed the collapse of the uptrend going back a century before world war I. Risk premiums will rise to factor this reality in. Look for 15-18% earnings yields (6 to 7 P/E) on U.S. &amp; European stocks as the new normal.

Reagan lowered them. Clinton lowered them. W lowered them. Obama has not raised them - yet. When they do raise them the stock will crash along with all stocks. A stock with a dividend or capital gain taxed at 50% is worth only 50/85 as much as one taxed at 15%... The size of this deficit is so massive it may well take a higher tax rate than that to balance it. Stocks traded at very lower P/E ratios 1930s-1970s for a reason - taxes were very high.</Msg><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352500551215</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 17:35:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352501640903-37</Id><Topic><Title>THE CIVIL WAR IS ON !!

The American Petroleum Institute, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups had urged the SEC to stay the requirements while the groups’ litigation against the rules plays out. But on Thursday the SEC said there’s no reason for a stay. The regulators said in an order that the groups “failed to carry their burden to demonstrate imminent, irreparable harm.” The SEC notes that the federal court hearing the case ordered a quick briefing schedule, making a decision likely as soon as next spring — almost a year before companies’ first disclosure filings are due. The SEC rejected claims that initial compliance costs would be burdensome. Claims of competitive harm are too speculative to warrant a stay, the SEC said. The order is the latest move in a long-running battle over rules required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The rules, finalized in August, force SEC-listed oil, natural gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses, taxes, royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects. The rules are aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the “resource curse,” in which impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth. But the rules have faced legal, administrative and political pushback from trade groups and individual companies, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell. The oil industry argues the rule will put SEC-listed companies at a big disadvantage when competing abroad against state-owned companies such as Russia’s Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Co. Industry officials say they support transparency too, but that the SEC rules go too far. The industry favors disclosure carried out under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a voluntary, multilateral group that brings together energy-producing nations, companies and civil society organizations. Human rights and transparency advocates cheered the SEC for rejecting the stay request. “This is a victory for anyone who cares about fighting poverty, protecting investors, making markets more efficient, or reducing corruption,” said Raymond Baker, director of the group Global Financial Integrity. The American Petroleum Institute bashed the SEC rule after the stay was denied. “We’ve been working hard to increase transparency for a decade, but this rule could interfere with ongoing efforts by making U.S. firms less competitive against state owned firms in China and Russia that have no interest in transparency,” said Justin Spickard, the group’s director of federal relations. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352509461319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 20:04:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352509891237-39</Id><Topic><Title>Election poetry</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352506329746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:12:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>R you are still leaving</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1352509891237</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 20:11:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352509951967-40</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wahleeee, looks like we're still standing</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352506092597</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:08:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are still going swimming.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1352509951967</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 20:12:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352510221984-41</Id><Title>To the rich</Title><Msg>Declare your residence outside of america and save your $.

Taxes simply must be raised. All the Bush tax cuts need to be abolished, except possibly for the poorest of the poor and those on social security - they don't make enough to amount to anything anyway. Long term capital gains need to go back to level of the late 1970s - 39.875% Dividends should be treated as ordinary income and taxed at 50%. The top marginal income tax rate needs to go back to the Reagan level of 1981 - 50% Home interest deductions need to be phased out for high income people entirely. This list is not exhaustive of course... Of course there is the out-of-control military budget which needs to be slashed. Obama must not bend - the fate of the country is at stake. Anyone foolish enough to own a stock going into these negotiations deserves their fate - the nice thing is someone will have to own them and pay the tax...lol</Msg><Username>whiggeryrules</Username><Timestamp>1352514713134</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 21:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352522089080-43</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wahleeee, looks like we're still standing</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1352506092597</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:08:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's an old medicare and social security taking right wing hypocritical fool.

These filthy vile right wingers will try to impeach him. That's all they have left. Because they hate this country and could care less if they stranglke her for another 4 years so long as they get to rape her for all her glitter when they're done.
