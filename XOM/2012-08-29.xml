Then Bring Millions of Illegal Aliens To Undercut Those Minimum Wages. Illegal Immigration Makes The Poor Poorer. Notice What Party Supports Making the Poor Poorer With Illegal Immagration Policies Like Sanctuary Cities, And The Dream Act of Making the Poor Poorer, by undercutting even minimum wages. The Supporters of the Dream Act are just Dreaming of making the poor poorer with low wages, by undercutting minimum wage and living wage. Plus, Sanctuary Cities keep wages low, thus poverty high, by encouraging illegal immigration and maximize profits. Illegal Immigration and Sanctuary Citis are to maximize profits on the low wages of the poor. The real solution to getting the poor, out of poverty in America is billing the country of origin for service rendered to illegals. And charging all imports, cost of goods produced, price of goods sold income tax just like every American manufacturer and farmer pays. Do you understand who ran the largest slave port in the USA, and where it was at, and why Wahington D.C. is where it is at. You better start reading up on history. Anti-Slavery is anti-poverty as humanist movement. Right now Illegal Immigration is slavery, those who support it are poverty Profit mongers, and the new slavers. Better re-think that helping the poor model in a more historical, slavery context.</Msg><Username>warrcee</Username><Timestamp>1346257183000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 12:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346257612000-39</Id><Title>XOM Refinery/Platform Shut Downs=lower profits?</Title><Msg>Will all these shut downs and shut ins, hurt bottom lines?

Since reaching a 2012 low of $89 per barrel on June 21, Brent spot prices have increased almost $25 (27 percent) to more than $113 per barrel on August 28, after reaching a high of almost $117 per barrel on August 16. Evidence of a tightening market can be seen in the increasing backwardation of the Brent futures curve and the related steady decline in crude oil inventories in the United States. While total U.S. crude oil inventories remain above their five-year average level, U.S. crude oil inventories outside of PADD2, which holds large inventories in transportation-constrained locations (notably Cushing, Oklahoma), are close to their seasonally typical level (Figure 1) despite today's inventory build. Globally, oil balances have been tightening over the course of the third quarter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) August Short- Term Energy Outlook (STEO), global liquid fuels supply is expected to average 88.73 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in the third quarter, a decrease of 70,000 bbl/d from the second quarter. Lower production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is driving the reduction in global supplies. Crude oil production from OPEC is expected to be 370,000 bbl/d lower in the third quarter than in the second. A major part of this decrease comes from lower Iranian production. Iran's crude oil production capacity is being eroded due to the country's inability to carry out investment projects necessary to offset the natural decline in production from existing wells, as well as the impact of lower Iranian crude oil exports due to recently enforced EU and U.S. sanctions. The decrease in OPEC crude oil production is expected to be offset somewhat by increases in both non-OPEC liquid fuels supply and OPEC non-crude liquids. At the same time, global consumption is expected to increase 1.70 million bbl/d in the third quarter. Higher global consumption is being driven by seasonal demand increases in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. This tightening of global supply-demand balances, along with market expectations of reduced crude oil loadings in September from the North Sea, has put upward pressure on the front end of the Brent futures market. After briefly slipping into contango in June, front-month Brent futures steadily increased their premium to third-month futures contracts during July and the first half of August. That spread reached almost $3 per barrel on August 15, the day before the expiry date for the September contract, before falling back closer to $1 per barrel as the October contract became the front month contract. The October contract is set to expire after the expected return of a significant portion of production in the North Sea that has been curtailed for maintenance. http://www.eia.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346262735000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 13:52:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346262745000-61</Id><Topic><Title>This Week In Petroleum August 29, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346262735000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 13:52:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Increasing backwardation has prompted participants in the seaborne physical crude market to shed inventories. Since reaching a record high of 387.3 million barrels on June 15, U.S. crude inventories have fallen by 22.8 million barrels (325,000 bbl/d). This draw is significantly larger than the 8.0-million-barrel draw typically seen over this period. The largest draws have been on the Gulf Coast, where inventories have decreased 8.1 million barrels since June 15, a period during which they are typically flat. Reduced import flows are supporting the inventory draws on the Gulf Coast. Weekly data indicate that for the week ending August 3, four-week average crude oil imports on the Gulf Coast reached their lowest point since 1996. This low can be partially attributed to depressed differentials for light sweet U.S. coastal crude grades, such as Louisiana Light Sweet, relative to comparable globally traded crudes. Increased tight oil production in the United States has backed out demand for imports into the Gulf Coast. Moreover, relatively favorable economics have incentivized high levels of runs at U.S. refineries this summer. As of August 24, total U.S. crude oil inventories were 25.4 million barrels above their five-year average level. However, because of infrastructure capacity constraints to ship crude oil from PADD 2 to the Gulf Coast, a large portion of these inventories are accessible only to the limited number of refineries with connections to the Cushing hub. In contrast to the backwardated global oil markets, the high levels of crude inventories in Cushing and PADD 2 as a whole continue to keep the time structure of the NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures market, which has its trading hub at Cushing, in contango. Depressed prompt prices in the central United States have persisted since growing production volumes outpaced the capacity of pipelines to bring sufficient volumes of the landlocked crude to global markets, and the price structure of the NYMEX futures contract reinforces high inventory levels at the hub. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices continue to climb The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased three cents this week to $3.78 per gallon, 15 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices increased in all regions of the Nation for the second time in the last three weeks. All regions except the Midwest saw a price increase of four cents. The Midwest average price is $3.78 per gallon, up two cents from last week. Prices are $3.75 per gallon, $3.58 per gallon, $3.58 per gallon, and $4.04 per gallon in the East Coast, Gulf Coast, Rocky Mountain, and West Coast regions, respectively. The national average diesel fuel price increased six cents to $4.09 per gallon, 27 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices increased in all regions of the Nation for the fourth consecutive week, with the largest increase coming on the West Coast, where the price increased 10 cents for the second consecutive week to $4.35 per gallon. The Rocky Mountain price is $4.15 per gallon, up nine cents from last week. On the Gulf Coast, the average diesel price is up seven cents to $3.98 per gallon. The price on the East Coast increased seven cents to $4.07 per gallon. Rounding out the regions, the Midwest price had the smallest increase, at four cents, to $4.05 per gallon. Propane stocks show a sizeable build Total U.S. inventories of propane continued to build last week, adding 0.7 million barrels to end at 71.7 million barrels, 18.1 million barrels (34 percent) higher than a year ago. The Gulf Coast region added 0.4 million barrels last week, and East Coast inventories grew by 0.2 million barrels. Midwest and Rocky Mountain/West Coast regional stocks were each up 0.1 million barrels. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 7.2 percent of total propane inventories.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346262745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 13:52:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346263722000-62</Id><Title>End wind energy tax credit - Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.)</Title><Msg>End wind energy tax credit By REP. MIKE POMPEO | 8/29/12 12:59 AM EDT There’s been a steady drumbeat recently from those seeking an extension of the wind production tax credit. For many reasons, including some that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has carefully highlighted in his opposition, this is a bad idea. First, an extension continues this unsettling policy trend in which citizens are asked to bear all the risks and gain none of the rewards. This socialization of risks and privatization of profits guarantees disasters, for corporate boards and even their federal overseers can become careless and, in some instances, reckless. This fact was clearly demonstrated by the Solyndra debacle — when a company with close ties to the Obama administration lost more than a half billion dollars of taxpayers’ money. At the heart of that fiasco was both the company and the administration’s indifference to the taxpayers. Solyndra also revealed something else damaging about federal involvement in markets: the potential for political corruption. It’s clear that the Obama administration became emotionally, and inappropriately, invested in the fortunes of one company and one sector. When that happens, the system is compromised, cronyism flourishes and corruption is inevitable. President Barack Obama talks about the need to “invest” in alternative energy sources. But the reality is that he is not investing his money — he’s spending yours. I’m not sure that too many Americans would choose the president to manage their retirement accounts. His record – a jobless and exceedingly shallow recovery – is not good. With this production tax credit extension, the wisdom of the investment is especially dubious. Wind companies and their lobbyists have, for the last year, been telling all who would listen that the expiration of the tax credit could spell doom for their industry. Obama repeats this claim regularly on the campaign trail. But what does that say about the industry? If you need a tax credit to compete, you are probably not that competitive. In addition, the tax credit is not de minimis for either taxpayers or companies lobbying for it. It will likely cost the taxpayers more than $12 billion inside the budget window. Worse, the credit is set at 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour. http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80317_Page2.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346263722000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 14:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346263732000-63</Id><Topic><Title>End wind energy tax credit - Rep.

This means the wind industry gets an almost 40 percent subsidy for each unit it produces. How many companies would like that? You also have to remember that wind power enjoys a mandate in more than 30 states. That is, regardless of cost – or price to ratepayers – utilities must use wind or other renewables for specific amounts of power generation. So, the wind companies enjoy not only a tax credit, but a must-use mandate as well – regardless of cost. It would be one thing if we were running out of natural gas and confronted a real national requirement to use alternative energy. But it’s the reverse. The United States has more traditional energy resources than anywhere else on Earth, according to the Congressional Research Service. With the surge in production from the shale formations, a new Barclays report just concluded, , natural gas will likely dominate wind in the marketplace for the foreseeable future. Even now, in places like Williston, N.D., companies are hiring everyone who can get there to work on rigs or in ancillary jobs. If the president is genuinely worried about jobs, maybe he should visit the Bakken in North Dakota, or the Marcellus in Pennsylvania or the Eagle Ford in Texas. Using wind power to generate electricity is not a new idea. The first windmills used to generate electricity went up in the 19th Century. The production tax credit is also not a new idea. It is now about 20 years old. Romney’s opposition to continuing the wind subsidy is absolutely correct. At some point, an industry has to either succeed or fail on its own merits. For wind companies, we are at that point now. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is on an AEA energy panel Wednesday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346263732000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 14:08:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346265259000-64</Id><Topic><Title>Summary Of Who We Were and What We've Become</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346258501000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 12:41:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whether The Wahlieee listened to the speech is irrelevant, what he said is true, I began school the yer ww11 ENDED AND WHEN THE MEN CAME HOME, To a man, their message was; We are working to build a better world for you children and all future generations!

The Dems seek funds with lowest burden of subtraction when the Reps feel a 'flat' subtraction is fair. This is because the Reps are so far out of touch with what most people have to live on. Both parties have not formed a fool-proof system of distributing funds to those in need. So why is it that only the Reps complain? Because they don't want to give anything to those who need it. A big difference between Dem and Rep is that the Reps think our economic system is perfect and those that need assistance are just not using the system properly, Dems know that the system is not perfect and some fall to the wayside. Reps are also seem not to know that welfare it helps the rich. Why don't the Reps know that it is obvious that many in need will get what they need by anyway they can which causes unrest and insecurity for the rich? Reps just don't get it.</Msg><Username>luke_oflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1346270622000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 16:03:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346271236000-69</Id><Title>EU initiates anti-dumping action against Argentina</Title><Msg>EU initiates anti-dumping action against Argentina Wednesday, August 29, 2012 The European Union threatened today to impose tariffs on biodiesel imported from Argentina and also Indonesia. The announcement was made today on the bloc’s Official Gazette. “The European Commission has received a complaint on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, alleging that imports of biodiesel, originating in Argentina and Indonesia, are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Union industry”, can be read in the statement. The investigation will determine whether biodiesel from the two countries “is being dumped and whether the dumped imports have caused injury to the union industry”, the European Commission, the EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said today in the Official Gazette. The inquiry highlights tensions accompanying EU efforts to increase the use of biofuels, a renewable energy from crops such as rapeseed, corn, wheat and sugar, amid a crackdown on fossil fuels blamed for global warming. Ethanol is another kind of biofuel. Now, the commission has nine months to decide whether to impose provisional anti-dumping duties for half a year and EU governments have 15 months to decide whether to apply “definitive” levies for five years. http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/110112/eu-initiates-antidumping-action-against-argentina</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346271236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 16:13:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346271614000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Jesus Spoke About Helping The Poor</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346100064000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 16:41:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm always shocked by the behavior of rightwing Christians.

President Obama spoke with the governors of three Gulf states on Wednesday as Hurricane Isaac pounded the coast. The White House said the president briefed Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) on a conference call in which he opened by acknowledging that Wednesday was the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator (FEMA) Craig Fugate and National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb then updated the state officials on “the storm’s impacts, as well as on the resources and steps FEMA has taken to support their teams as they respond to the slow-moving storm,” according to a statement from the White House. The Category 1 hurricane is battering the Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 75 miles per hour. More than half a million people in Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are currently without power as the center of the storm passed through New Orleans and Baton Rouge on Tuesday. “The president made clear that the Federal government was prepared, and he had directed Administrator Fugate to continue to provide all necessary support and available resources,” the White House said. “The president heard from the governors and mayor about the current conditions on the ground and the steps their teams are taking to respond. The president asked the governors to continue to identify any additional needs if they arise as the effects of Isaac and the response efforts continue.” The White House did not address criticism from Jindal, who has been openly blasting the competence of the federal government over Twitter and who on Monday sent a letter to Obama saying that not enough was being done to help his state cover the expenses it’s taking on in preparation for the storm. The president on Monday declared a state of emergency for Louisiana. The action by Obama makes federal funding to the state available immediately, but Jindal said it “only provides for direct federal assistance” and doesn’t “provide for reimbursement of expenses that the state is taking to prepare for the storm.” Jindal, once considered a potential GOP vice presidential candidate and a fierce critic of Obama, announced this week that he would not be attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., where he was expected to speak, so that he could be on the ground in Louisiana to deal with the storm. Some have speculated that his criticism over Obama’s handling of the hurricane is politically motivated, as the Times-Picayune pointed out that the assistance Obama offered is the same that was offered by then-President George W. Bush during Hurricane Gustav in 2008, which Jindal did not take issue with at the time. In addition, Louisiana’s Republican Sen. David Vitter told the Los Angeles Times this week that FEMA has “been a lot more proactively engaged ahead of the event than ever before.” The Obama campaign has kept the president’s campaign schedule this week, with a stop Wednesday in Virginia, but said the president would be closely monitoring the situation in the Gulf. http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/246463-obama-briefs-gulf-state-governors-on-hurricane-isaac</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346282151000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346282255000-87</Id><Topic><Title>I See Infernal's Fecal Foot Prints</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346259814000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 13:03:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOPE, Infernal and I don't even agree on everything.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1346282255000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:17:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346282362000-88</Id><Topic><Title>Jesus Spoke About Helping The Poor</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1346100064000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 16:41:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You shall not covet your neighbor's house.

Economic warfare is raging across the world as countries target foreign investments for massive taxation, or nationalization. Intellectual property is stolen.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Tuesday cited soaring gasoline prices in the wake of hurricane predictions, asking President Obama to take emergency action to suspend the federal “petroleum mandate” for four to six weeks. “Due to the current petroleum challenges, if gasoline prices increase by only a modest 20 cents per gallon for four weeks, that equates to a ‘mandate tax’ of over $300 million dollars — more than a quarter of a billion dollars!” the letter said. The petroleum mandate refers to the petroleum component of fuels blended with ethanol. Most ethanol blends sold have only 5 percent ethanol, although retailers are now allowed to sell 15 percent ethanol blends to newer model cars in areas where the blends have become available. Most retail outlets do not yet have pumps set up to sell the E15 blends. The request appeared to be a response to petitions for a waiver of the Renewable Fuel Standard that sets forth the amount of ethanol and biodiesel that is required in the nation’s fuel supply. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has been petitioned by industry groups, governors and senators seeking to have the standards waived due to high corn prices caused by the ongoing drought. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has supported keeping the standard in effect in order to avoid job loss and the fears that of instability in the renewable fuels industry. Iowa Renewable Fuels Association President Monte Shaw said there is no law referred to as the petroleum mandate, but federal law creates a de facto petroleum mandate. That’s because retailers cannot sell non-approved fuels, and pure petroleum-based gas is the only approved fuel other than E5 and E15 ethanol blends. “They’ve got a distinct monopoly because they control what goes into the pipeline,” Shaw said of the petroleum industry. http://thegazette.com/2012/08/29/group-tells-obama-hurricane-isaac-warrants-higher-ethanol-blends/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346288367000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346289268000-117</Id><Title>Rand Paul: Don’t ‘punish’ Exxon or you’ll hit workers</Title><Msg>Rand Paul: Don’t ‘punish’ Exxon or you’ll hit workers By Ben Geman - 08/29/12 08:06 PM ET [b]Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is making the case against White House efforts to nix billions of dollars in oil industry tax breaks by arguing that it would hurt stockholders.[/b] “When you seek to punish Mr. Exxon Mobil, you punish the secretary who owns Exxon Mobil stock,” the freshman senator told the GOP convention in Tampa, Fla. President Obama has sought to eliminate roughly $40 billion worth of tax breaks for fossil fuel industries over a decade, arguing that profitable oil-and-gas companies don’t need the incentives. “Repealing fossil fuel tax preferences helps eliminate market distortions, strengthening incentives for investments in clean, renewable, and more energy efficient technologies,” the White House fiscal 2013 budget plan states. But oil-and-gas companies have battled the plan, which has sputtered in Congress, arguing it would curb domestic energy development. Paul’s comments echo claims by the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful oil industry lobbying group, which has highlighted pension fund investments in oil-and-gas producers and other retirement account holdings in the companies. Paul also took aim at the Obama administration’s lack of a permit — thus far — for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. “When you block the Keystone Pipeline, you punish the welder who works on the pipeline,” he said in his speech in Tampa. http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/246553-rand-paul-dont-punish-exxon-or-youll-hit-workers</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346289268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 21:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346290400000-118</Id><Topic><Title>Funny how</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1346282863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:27:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a civil war in Syria.

They were pure liberals in every sense of the word. You do get the fact that the Nazi's were hard core liberals. Odd how that liberal party is still banned in almost every nation on earth.

Seems like a lose lose situatoin for XOM, even if Venzuala Refinery is offline. Most of the Venzualan oil goes to the huge refineries on Aruba by undersea pipelines. The burnt up refinery only supplies domestic needs. So they buy fuel from Aruba, instead of making in country. Doesn't seem like a real big deal.</Msg><Username>bluelivermore</Username><Timestamp>1346293127000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 22:18:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346296712000-128</Id><Topic><Title>Funny how</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1346282863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:27:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The current situation is easily recognized as "peaceful" given the true times of war being the world wars, vietnam, korean etc. affecting the US, where Europe, Japan etc are also not in a war conflict. You introduce "global" in a vain attempt to arrange your rants into an arguable position, yet there is no evidence for even doing that will support your nonsense. "Politics determines economic outcomes. War, conflict, resource nationalism, etc all flow from political trends." remains a very stupid thing to say. The absence of peace in the statement (because you love war and conflict; are you the one worried about blacks revolting?), given the presence of peace today, means that you are just a fool.</Msg><Username>westward969</Username><Timestamp>1346296712000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 23:18:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346297696000-129</Id><Topic><Title>RNC attende racist</Title><Username>lc298h</Username><Timestamp>1346280371000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 18:46:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, nothing new.
