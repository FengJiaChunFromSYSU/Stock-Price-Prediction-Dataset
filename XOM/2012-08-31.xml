I offered to bet a million (or 2 or 3) to prove it. You ran away. Then you stated unequivocally that Rush Limbaugh would soon be off the air. I offered to let you try to win your lost million back by betting you that Limbaugh would still be on the air when Obama was no longer President.

Just my opinion? No, it was widely panned by observers across the political spectrum. "Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic," legendary Chicago film critic Roger Ebert said in a message on Twitter.com. "He didn't need to do this to himself." Former Romney adviser Mike Murphy tweeted: "Note to file: Actors need a script." Eastwood said he "never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president," Didn't Eastwood know that Romney holds a law degree? Republicans don't know a lot of things. Often he was nearly incoherent, meandering from one topic to another, including the state of the economy, the war in Afghanistan and the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay. Well, Eastwood, did back John McCain and Palin.</Msg><Username>westward969</Username><Timestamp>1346403222000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 04:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346408637000-9</Id><Topic><Title>Romney - Energy Front &amp; Center</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346384140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:35:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's energy plan: Give billions in tax paper money to bankrupt solar companies run by his donors; freeze drilling by US oil companies in the gulf but spend US tax dollars on foreign companies invested in by Democrat scion George Soros; don't allow a pipeline to transport oil from Canada to US refineries; freeze coal as an energy source; allow gasoline prices to double during your first term and them allow them to double from that in your second term; allow electric prices to rise 20 to 40% during your fist term and do that again your second term; and laugh &amp; play golf all week long and go on million dollar vacations every other month at the expense of taxpayers.

Obama and the post-Bill Clinton Democrat Party does not see the world that way. Their view is the environmental fascist view which holds that C02 is the enemy of mankind, and also that the exploitation of natural resources despoils the environment. Protecting access or encouraging the development of strategic natural resources is therefore against the national security interests of the United States, which they confound with the environmental agenda. With such an attitude they will not make decisions that appear rational. It makes no differences what the poll show, they will still stick to their position - it is their dominate strategy based on their views. It is perfectly consistent with their position and logic to allow the Middle East to turn into a cauldron of war and chaos - indeed that is a good outcome for them as it will make energy prices "necessarily skyrocket" discouraging the use of fossil fuels...

The Energy Department emphasized that the loan of sweet crude oil does not constitute a release of oil from the SPR, but noted that remains an option. “The administration continues to keep all options on the table to address additional or sustained supply issues,” DOE said, echoing comments by White House spokesman Jay Carney in recent days. The last release of oil from the SPR occurred in June of 2011. President Obama announced the release of 30 million barrels at a time when the conflict in Libya had removed supplies from the market, part of a larger coordinated release with other International Energy Agency member nations. The oil provided to Marathon Petroleum marks the ninth time DOE has used its loan authority. The last time was in response to 2008’s Hurricane Gustav. Under the agreement, Marathon must return an equal amount of oil of similar quality within three months, and provide “premium barrels” that amount to a form of interest, DOE noted. http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/246953-doe-lends-refiner-1m-barrels-of-reserve-oil-after-isaac-disrupts-supplies</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346436361000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346437096000-57</Id><Title>Pipeline to Sherwood Park gets go-ahead - specifically from Imperial Oil's Kearl project</Title><Msg>Pipeline to Sherwood Park gets go-ahead By Sheila Pratt, Edmonton Journal August 31, 2012 Enbridge will construct a new, 400,000-barrel-a-day pipeline from Fort McMurray to Sherwood Park to carry bitumen as production from the oilsands continues to grow. The new pipeline - slightly smaller than Enbridge's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline designed to send 585,000 barrels a day to the British Columbia coast - met few objections from landowners at a June hearing in Edmonton, according the Energy Resources Conservation Board, which announced its approval on Thursday. The 385-kilometre line, parallel to existing pipelines from the northeast, is needed to bring increasing bitumen production, specifically from Imperial Oil's Kearl project, to Enbridge's Edmonton hub, the ERCB report says. Enbridge told the board its existing Waupisoo pipeline "would be operating at capacity in the near future," making it necessary to build the new line, called the Woodland pipeline extension. "The board also notes the need for the project was not challenged and was not an issue raised at the hearing." In approving a new pipeline, the ERCB is not concerned with where the bitumen will end up, just with the operation of the pipeline, spokesperson Bob Curran said. Enbridge was unavailable for comment on Thursday, and did not release any details such as a completion date or the costs. The ERCB approval comes days before federal hearings resume in Edmonton into Enbridge's controversial Northern Gateway pipeline, which would run from Hardisty to Kitimat, B.C., if approved. The Woodland pipeline in Alberta has no connection to Northern Gateway, which is a federally regulated project, said Curran, adding about 7,500 kilometres of new pipeline has been added in Alberta annually in recent years. Jennifer Grant of the Pembina Institute, an environmental research centre, said it's important to know whether the bitumen will go into Enbridge's U.S. pipelines for American refineries or whether the company is ramping up for the proposed Northern Gateway. The Pembina's view is that there is enough capacity in existing pipelines to handle current production into the U.S. http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Pipeline+Sherwood+Park+gets+ahead/7171979/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346437096000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:18:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346438040000-58</Id><Title>Obama "Eat The Poor!"</Title><Msg>Driving over the fiscal cliff as fast as he can!!

One would think.But in fact,it's not that daunting,provided government acts before we go over the cliff. The main problem is long range debt IE -"Entitlement" spending.Yet there are numerous pension systems around the world now functioning better than social security.Following the Chile model,they include private accounts that takes ALL future pension debt off govt hands.With the stroke of a pen the prez could reduce future debt by uncountable trillions.That alone would restore the Triple A rating. As to discrestionary [year over year debt] it's more a matter of increasing tax revenues than cutting spending.Some cuts would be made,but the focus has to be on growth.Simplify the tax code,target tax rates to create growth and increase tax revenues,exploit our natural resources more aggressively - just like the rest of the modern world.Over time tax revenues will rise enough to rebalance the debt to GDP ratio.We don;t need a balanced budget.We just need a much lower debt to GDP ratio. All these things are do-able,and being done around the world.It's simply time we actually joined the 21st century,instead of having these endless,archaic 20th century politcal arguments.</Msg><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1346445116000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 16:31:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346445656000-71</Id><Topic><Title>Obama "Eat The Poor!"</Title><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1346438040000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:34:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If there is anything in America with less `Worth` than the poor and their children I wish someone would tell me what it is!

Economic and military imperialism is a powerful force for economic growth. Military power in the hands of a fool like Barack Hussein of Obama is not very effective however. All it amounts to is the expenditure of resources for no tangible benefit. He rejects the use of power to achieve Imperialistic aims, making the deterrent power of a powerful military meaningless. Spending more on the military with him in command is just pointless waste.
