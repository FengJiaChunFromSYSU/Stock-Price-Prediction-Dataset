The issue of Chinese ownership was raised Saturday at federal hearings in Edmonton considering whether to approve the proposed pipeline from Bruderheim, northeast of Edmonton, to Kitimat, on the northern British Columbia coast. China’s state-owned Sinopec is among 10 companies expected to be in the group that would own the new pipeline company along with Enbridge Inc. The 10 companies include French oil giant Total, along with Suncor, MEG, Nexen — currently under sale to another Chinese national oil company — and Cenovus. Enbridge is expected to own about 50 per cent of a new separate company to be called Northern Gateway Pipelines. The other 50 per cent would be owned by the group of 10 other owners, four of which have not been publicly identified. Calgary lawyer Barry Robinson raised the issue of Chinese ownership at Saturday’s session. Robinson also noted that state-owned Chinese companies do not always act “like rational free-market companies.” Robinson was acting for a coalition of B.C. environmentalists including Forest Ethics Advocacy, Living Oceans Society and Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Chinese state-owned companies already own some bitumen production in the oilsands, said Robinson. They also own the refineries in China that would handle the Alberta bitumen. “Have you ever considered the scenario that China might want to close the loop and take a run at commercial control of the pipeline?” said Robinson, in questions directed to Enbridge officials at the federal Joint Review Panel hearings. Enbridge vice-president Paul Fisher replied emphatically: “Absolutely not.” Fisher also stressed that the nationality of any of the companies involved is not relevant to the regulatory hearing. He said it is more appropriately a policy consideration for the federal or provincial governments. Outside the hearing, Enbridge spokesman Paul Stanway dismissed questions about China as “fearmongering” and “a red herring.” “Whoever owns this pipeline, it has to run it under Canadian regulations,” said Stanway. In his testimony, Fisher agreed that Enbridge’s ownership could shrink “under commercial negotiations” and that any owner of the other 50 per cent of the pipeline company would be free to sell their share. Robinson said the issue of Chinese ownership is relevant because the federal review panel must also consider the public interest in deciding whether to recommend approval of the pipeline project. In an interview later, Robinson said the concern is that China might want to lower the price it pays for Alberta bitumen to send to its state-owned refineries. Robinson also noted the company’s economic studies did not include costs such as the additional cost of maintaining clean air and water, and the range of municipal services such as new roads needed to meet demands of expanding oilsands production in Alberta. The studies underestimate the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, he added. Enbridge studies peg the cost of reducing carbon emissions at $20 a tonne. The last national study put that cost at $50 a tonne. Alberta charges a levy of $15 a tonne on excess greenhouse gas emissions. The Northern Gateway studies calculate additional emissions from construction and operation of... Also read 8 comments...

I'm searching elsewhere. How high is California’s electricity demand, and where does the power come from? California uses 265,000 Gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. Consumption is growing at a rate of two percent annually. In the last decade, between 29 percent and 42 percent of California’s in-state generation used natural gas. Another 10 percent to 20 percent was provided by hydroelectric power that is subject to significant annual variations. Almost one-third of California’s entire in-state generation base is more than 40 years old. Fifteen percent to 30 percent of statewide electricity demand is served from sources outside state borders. Peak electricity demands occur on hot summer days. California’s highest peak demand was 52,863 megawatts and occurred July 10, 2002. Peak demand is growing at about 2.4 percent per year, roughly the equivalent of three new 500-megawatt power plants. Residential and commercial air conditioning represent at least 30 percent of summer peak electricity loads. Privately owned electric utilities serve 80 percent of the load in California.

That’s his way of admitting he’d rather Americans not look too closely at his poor job performance so far. The Obama campaign slogan “Forward” is apt because Barack doesn’t want voters to look backward at the wreckage in his wake. Exhibit A is the nearly trillion-dollar “stimulus” package of 2009 that promised to lower unemployment rates to about 5.5 percent by now. Instead, it’s 8.1 percent, and it’s only that low because 368,000 stopped looking for work and aren’t counted by bureaucrats. Democrats warned if the stimulus plan were rejected, unemployment in the third quarter of 2012 would be way up at 6 percent. In retrospect, the country could have avoided adding a huge chunk to the national debt and still had more people working today if that boondoggle hadn’t been enacted. Another Obama promise not kept is cutting the federal deficit in half. In his convention speech Thursday, the president said, “You do the math.” OK, fine. In his first budget proposal, Mr. Obama projected that if his policies were enacted, the federal budget deficit for fiscal 2012 would be $581 billion. Instead, it’s about double that as Mr. Obama racks up budget deficits of more than a trillion dollars year in and year out. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product was at 3.1 percent in 2008, but under Mr. Obama it has averaged over 8 percent. In his first 986 days in office, up to Oct. 3, 2011, Mr. Obama oversaw a $4.2 trillion increase in the national debt. That’s more than the debt accrued by all presidents from George Washington to George H.W. Bush combined. While Mr. Obama likes to blame his predecessor for the mess, the deficit for all of 2007 was $161 billion. Mr. Obama can rack up that kind of red ink in a single month without breaking a sweat. While running for re-election, Mr. Obama refuses to talk in detail about Obamacare, which was supposed to be his signature achievement. Health care was only mentioned in passing in his convention speech. He denounced, “Washington politicians who want to control health care choices that women should be making for themselves” — which is exactly what Obamacare does. Mr. Obama’s unwillingness to point with pride at his most significant legislative success says a lot about what Americans have learned about the law after Congress passed it without reading it. Listening to Mr. Obama’s spin about his foreign-policy record makes it seem like our rocky world has spent four years singing kumbaya. The lofty rhetoric about peace and dignity doesn’t bear close scrutiny. America’s adversaries are emboldened by the weak U.S. leader while allies like Israel openly question the U.S. commitment to its security. Radical Islamic governments are taking over in the Middle East. Fortunately, Mr. Obama even failed to deliver on his first promise in office: to close the terrorist-detainee facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We’ll concede one point: Osama bin Laden isn’t better off now than he was four years ago. In that respect, he has something in common with the American people.

Last Updated: 6:18 AM, September 8, 2012 Posted: 12:52 AM, September 8, 2012 Share on emailShare on facebook More Sharing ServicesMore Print Jika González Village punks bounce up and down on an Audi, leaving its windows smashed. A mob trashed a white Audi in Greenwich Village — with several people jumping on the vehicle and smashing its windows after the driver got into an argument with a cyclist, witnesses said. The sedan’s owner, identified by a witness as Mitchell Levine, was driving through the intersection of Broadway and Bleecker Street at about 11:15 p.m. Thursday when his car was halted by the cyclist. As the two men exchanged words, several members of the crowd — some of whom had been dancing atop other cars earlier — circled the Audi A4. Some people jumped on top of the car, kicking the vehicle’s front and back windows, witnesses said. “There were maybe two main guys who were jumping on the car and started smashing the windshield,” a witness told The Post. “A lot of the people were cheering, a lot were just spectators. “The guy was trying to drive. He was going as slowly as he could without running anybody over,” the witness added of Levine. “He later told me he was afraid for his life. He was just trying to go home.” Jika González A crowd surrounded the Audi before people jumped on top of the car. He couldn’t move any farther as the crowd got even thicker, with dozens of passersby filming the incident while others yelled obscenities at the driver. Police arrived minutes later. But by then, the suspects had fled. “There were a lot of people when police got there, but it wasn’t clear if they were involved,” the witness said. During the chaos, Mark Fernandez, 21, of Brooklyn, was arrested for allegedly pushing his way through the crowd and striking an officer as cops tried to clear the area, police said. Jika González The car's driver reacts to the situation. He was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest, harassment and disorderly conduct. A 17-year-old male whose name was not disclosed was issued a summons for disorderly conduct in connection with the incident. It is unclear what started the incident, but a local resident said the attack may have been sparked when Levine’s car got too close to the bicycle. “Downtown traffic on Broadway was trying to push through the crowd when the Audi nearly hit a bicyclist crossing Bleecker and Broadway,” a tipster told Gothamist. “Not clear who was at fault. The bicyclist stopped in front of the Audi and began screaming at the driver. I couldn’t hear what was being said.”</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347201366283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 10:36:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347201606294-8</Id><Title>Calif.

This bill would require, on or before December 31 of each year, a fleet, as defined, to comply with the regulations and standards for that calendar year.

Three pumps are installed on Turnpike BOTTOM LINE IMAGE An E85 pump is shown at the eastbound service plaza on the Massachusetts Turnpike in Charlton. It is one of three such pumps that were installed recently on the Pike capable of pumping fuel that is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. (T&amp;G Staff/JIM COLLINS) By Melissa McKeon CORRESPONDENT 2 comments | Add a comment The technology is in place and this fueling station will make it easier for consumers to choose a cleaner fuel option. -- State Sen. Stephen M. Brewer State, local and federal officials were beaming last week about three little pumps at gas stations on the Massachusetts Turnpike, an offering they hope will make a dent in American dependence on fossil fuels and the harmful emissions they produce. At the service plazas in Charlton, both eastbound and westbound, and at the westbound service plaza in Westboro, three pumps will be dispensing an alternative fuel, E85. E85 is a fuel that turns the old-fashioned gasoline mixture upside down. While regular gasoline meets emission standards by adding a small percentage (usually about 10 percent) of ethanol to the mix most folks pump every day, E85 is composed of 85 percent ethanol (from vegetable sources, mostly corn) and 15 percent gasoline. It’s a fuel source that burns cleaner and reduces the use of fossil fuels, a nonrenewable resource that produces harmful emissions and is mostly bought at great expense from foreign sources. In Massachusetts, the promotion of E85 meets the states GreenDOT policy initiative of June 2010, which aims to incorporate sustainability into all Massachusetts Department of Transportation activities to reach greenhouse gas reduction targets mandated by the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act. Funding for the $600,000 effort to install the three tanks (and one more to come) was provided through the Federal Highway Administration’s Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. And just how many cars will be stopping at these Mass Pike pumps? In the United States, there are more than 10 million flexible-fuel vehicles on the road, vehicles that can use either unleaded gasoline or E85, or both, in the same tank. In Massachusetts, there are around 100,000 flexible-fuel vehicles registered, according to DOT spokeswoman Sara Lavoie. So far, the DOT reports that more than 10,000 gallons have been dispensed since the pumps were installed in August. But the availability is so new officials aren’t sure what can be achieved. “We don’t have a target yet, that I’m aware of, but we want to make sure that the public that has flex-fuel vehicles know that this is available,” Ms. Lavoie said. Those in charge of these programs believe there are enough flexible-fuel vehicles on the road to make a difference, and that availability of the E85 fuel will make those who have a choice, choose E85. “The technology is in place and this fueling station will make it easier for consumers to choose a cleaner fuel option,” said state Sen. Stephen M. Brewer, D-Barre, whose district includes the Charlton fuel plaza. “The Charlton location is the first travel plaza service area for many travelers coming off Interstate 84, and it is a great place to reach a very large number of motorists.” While the opportunity to fuel up and feel good about the environment may be a draw, and the number above the pump might be attractive as well, the final equation might give motorists pause. When the pumps first started dispensing fuel in August, the price was $3.39 a gallon, far below the $3.73 charged for a gallon of unleaded gasoline. But flex-fuel vehicles get lower gas mileage than regular vehicles, 20 percent to 30 percent fewer miles to the gallon, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The fuel use isn’t without controversy, either. Some argue that the ...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347215023911</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 14:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347215102888-16</Id><Title>New Fracking costs</Title><Msg>This is outrageous, what is Obama thinking.... The Bureau of Land Management estimates that increased fracking regulations will cost an estimated $11,833 a well. EOG's independent engineers suggest the cost will be $253,839. That's $242,006 more per well then BLM suggests. That's a lot! The result will be that a number of wells, if not entire fields, will not be drilled. The cost/risk/profit ratio is just not reasonable. Sunday, September 9, 5:17 AM Complying with tighter fracking regulations on federal lands will cost $253,839 per well, says EOG Resources (EOG), Wyoming and Utah, citing a study from John Dunham &amp; Associates. That's well above the $11,833 that the Bureau of Land Management estimates, and would cost natural gas producers a total of $1.5B-$1.62B a year.</Msg><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347215102888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 14:25:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347219233467-17</Id><Topic><Title>SPLIT SEEMS IMMINENT</Title><Username>plantmatter</Username><Timestamp>1347052626730</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 17:17:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>12 years since the last split, the longest period without a split in the last 40 or so years, so yeah sure, why not a split.

No exceptions. On Numbers compared the jobless rates for 102 major metropolitan areas in July 2007 (five months before the official onset of the recession) and July 2012 (the latest month available). Every single one of those markets suffered an increase in unemployment over that five-year span. The pain has been especially sharp in the 15 markets whose unemployment rates soared by at least five percentage points in half a decade. The sharpest jump occurred in Las Vegas, whose gaming and hospitality sectors were heavily damaged by the recession. Las Vegas' jobless rate shot up by 7.9 points from 5.0 percent in July 2007 to 12.9 percent in the same month this year. The nationwide increase was 3.6 percent during the corresponding period. The U.S. unemployment rate grew from 4.7 percent five years ago to 8.3 percent today.
