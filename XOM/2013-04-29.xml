They propose to pay for a bigger war with a 1.5%/year wealth tax and 4% increase in the income tax (of course most of their voters would not pay the taxes). The way one goes about deflecting such taxes is to buy something that will profit from the war spending – middle class rental property in places the government is certain to spend. What you lose in taxes you make up in rents as money earned in wages &amp; salaries by others flows into housing demand. Merkel’s plan is better however. The current war effort is sufficient and a more vigorous one is likely to be less profitable in the rate of return on capital employed. About the only substantive the Green’s bellicose rhetoric will result in is an even bigger victory for the right – they have just increased the chance the conservative half of their party, and any outsiders, will vote for the right and Merkel. The oil &amp; gas interest is of course a loser since the right will need to escalate its plans to counter the Greens and left.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367237784284</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367238710092-3</Id><Title>URGENT: RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATES INCREASINGLY SMUGGLE HEROIN FROM</Title><Msg>SOUTHEAST ASIA INTO EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES!</Msg><Username>salomonbernstein</Username><Timestamp>1367238710092</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367239006530-4</Id><Title>Executive Order on C02...</Title><Msg>Obama should just issue an Executive Order to launch a war on fossil fuels in the US, that is assuming he really supports the goal. In 2007 the US Supreme Court ruled that C02 is a greenhouse gas and air pollutant, and that the US government has an obligation to regulate it under the laws of the United States, as per the Clean Air Act. So what was introduced as theory by German government supported climate change researchers in the 1970s is now a matter of US law. According to the ruling, EPA’s action not to regulate (because of Bush) C02 and other greenhouse gas emissions was “arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” So it is not a matter of choice whether to regulate. Obama should simply issue an Executive Order imposing a comprehensive list of fines for every polluter in the C02 spewing large amounts of C02, based on his interpretation of what is in accordance with the law. When the time comes to make more nominations to the US Supreme Court he can ensure there will no future objections to his policies.

Oil and gas drilling companies had pushed for the change, but there have been differing scientific estimates of the amount of methane that leaks from wells, pipelines and other facilities during production and delivery. Methane is the main component of natural gas. The new EPA data is “kind of an earthquake” in the debate over drilling, said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental group based in Oakland, Calif. “This is great news for anybody concerned about the climate and strong proof that existing technologies can be deployed to reduce methane leaks.” The scope of the EPA’s revision was vast. In a mid-April report on greenhouse emissions, the agency now says that tighter pollution controls instituted by the industry resulted in an average annual decrease of 41.6 million metric tons of methane emissions from 1990 through 2010, or more than 850 million metric tons overall. That’s about a 20 percent reduction from previous estimates. The agency converts the methane emissions into their equivalent in carbon dioxide, following standard scientific practice. The EPA revisions came even though natural gas production has grown by nearly 40 percent since 1990. The industry has boomed in recent years, thanks to a stunning expansion of drilling in previously untapped areas because of the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which injects sand, water and chemicals to break apart rock and free the gas inside.

Mosaic is looking to raise nearly $700,000 to fund installation of 487-kilowatt (kW) solar PV array on the roof of New Jersey’s Wildwoods Convention Center. Individual investors are snapping up opportunities to invest directly in solar PV projects via Mosaic’s online marketplace. Mosaic’s most recent solar PV project – a $152,700 loan to install a 114-kW solar PV array on top of the Ronald McDonald House in San Diego – sold out in less than six hours. In addition to helping the charitable foundation create clean energy and save money on electricity bills, the loan yields an estimated 4.5% return to investors. Image Credit: Mosaic Democratizing Solar PV Project Finance Located on New Jersey’s southern shore and within a day’s drive of one-third of the US population, the Wildwoods Convention Center has hosted more than 1 million visitors since opening its doors in 2002, according to a Mosaic press release. Open only to California investors, Mosaic’s solar rooftop investment opportunity coincides with Earth Week 2013 celebrations. The project to install a 487-kW solar array on top of the convention center is expected to provide 24% of the facility’s electricity and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 179 tons annually, the equivalent of 387,500 vehicle-miles not traveled. Commented Dan Rosen, Mosaic’s CEO and founder: “We want to give people the opportunity to do good and do well at the same time. Investing in real, tangible, solar projects, that generate electricity, is a great way to do that.” Investing In Solar Rooftops: Big Up From the Investing Public Mosaic launched its first three crowdfunded solar PV projects in January.

The report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) – you can access the executive summary here and the draft report here - canvasses the potential costs and practicality of transforming Australia’s coal-dependent electricity system to 100 per cent renewables, by either 2030 or 2050. It creates two scenarios – depending on the pace of falls in the cost of renewable and storage technologies – but both are considered conservative. It concludes that the cost could range between $219 and $338 billion and would require wholesale electricity prices of $111-$133/MWh (more than double the current price). Unfortunately, and somewhat controversially, AEMO was not asked to compare these forecasts with “business as usual”, but it does provide one interesting set of data that does put it into some perspective. The first is the impact on retail prices. See the table below (excuse the draft stamp): It shows that the impact on consumer electricity costs from a 100% renewables scenario could be as little as 6.6c/kWh, assuming a reasonably optimistic view of technology costs. That compares to the forecast national average increases in retail costs made by the Australian Energy Market Commission from 2011/12 to 2014/15 of 5.4c/kWh.Taking in the two earlier years of increases, the jump in retail prices has been higher. This should not come as a surprise. The AEMO study is almost unique in the world in not taking into account BAU.

The huge three-year construction project is expected to employ around 650 workers and generate more than $500 million in regional economic impact. Split into two projects located in Kern and Los Angeles counties (California), the Antelope Valley Solar Projects will be the world’s largest solar power development under construction. Once completed, the solar projects are expected to produce enough energy to power approximately 400,000 average California homes with clean, renewable solar power. According to Paul Caudill, president of MidAmerican Solar: “ The Antelope Valley Solar Projects are already creating needed jobs and economic opportunity in local communities, while at the same time, providing direct, long-term environmental benefits. We look forward to continuing our involvement in the Rosamond, Lancaster and Palmdale communities and, as we move forward, in the surrounding areas. MidAmerican Solar owns the Antelope Valley Solar Projects, while SunPower is designing and developing the projects and is the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. SunPower will also provide operations and maintenance services for the plants via a multiyear services agreement. SunPower president Howard Wenger had this to say about the projects: “ The start of construction on the Antelope Valley Solar Projects underscores that solar is a reliable, cost-competitive energy source. SunPower is proud to partner with MidAmerican Solar and Southern California Edison on this historic project, which is bringing critically needed jobs and economic opportunity to California today and will generate abundant clean, renewable power to the state over the long-term.
