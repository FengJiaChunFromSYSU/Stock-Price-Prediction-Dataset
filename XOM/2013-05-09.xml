Dlouhy Interior Secretary Sally Jewell delivered a blunt message to some of the nation’s top oil industry executives during an inaugural meeting with the group on Wednesday: Don’t cast blame our way. “I did poke them a little bit about not throwing the regulators under the bus or blaming us when there is actually shared responsibility, perhaps, when something doesn’t move forward,” Jewell said after meeting with the business leaders on the sidelines of the Offshore Technology Conference. “We don’t want to be in the way of development, but we have a job to do protecting the assets of the American people.” The closed-door gathering included top representatives from oil companies Anadarko, BP and Marathon Oil, as well as contractors FMC Technologies, Halliburton, Transocean and Schlumberger, and the trade groups American Petroleum Institute and National Ocean Industries Association. Some oil industry leaders have loudly complained about the pace of regulatory changes coming from the nation’s capital and pleaded for a more stable, predictable landscape. And ConocoPhillips cited regulatory uncertainties last month when the company announced it would delay its plans to drill in Arctic waters north of Alaska. Related story: Offshore operators seek clarity on regulations But on Wednesday, Jewell said she sensed the executives understood that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement have worked “to be responsive to the needs of industry” even as they craft new rules, some borne from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. “I did not sense …a reluctance to embrace regulation,” Jewell said. “What they want and what we are committed to provide is regulatory certainty, predictability (and) consistency, recognizing that different circumstances warrant different ways of behaving.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/08/interior-secretary-to-oil-industry-dont-throw-regulators-under-the-bus/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368075984890</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 01:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368076701725-2</Id><Title>Buffett’s MidAmerican Plans $1.9 Billion of Wind Farms in Iowa</Title><Msg>Buffett’s MidAmerican Plans $1.9 Billion of Wind Farms in Iowa Andrew Herndon - May 8, 2013 4:54 PM MT A unit of Warren Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. plans to invest $1.9 billion to build additional wind farms in Iowa that would increase its wind generating capacity in the state by about half. MidAmerican Energy Co., Iowa’s largest utility, plans to build as much as 1,050 megawatts of new wind power plants in the state, adding to about 2,285 megawatts of projects that it already owns and operates, the Des Moines, Iowa-based company said today in a statement on its website. MidAmerican is the largest U.S. owner of wind generation capacity among rate-regulated utilities, according to the statement. Iowa ranks third in the U.S. for states with the most wind generating capacity, behind Texas and California, according to the American Wind Energy Association. The projects may include as many as 656 new wind turbines and be completed by the end of 2015, and the proposal requires approval from the Iowa Utilities Board, according to the statement. MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. is a subsidiary of Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

That includes the notorious budget sequester as well as any objections from the anti-renewable energy crowd in Congress, which has already used the budget as an excuse to sink the Navy’s biofuel initiatives. So, let’s see what kind of firepower the Army has on its side. The Army Renewable Energy Initiative The Navy biofuel program really has attracted a lot of negativity from certain legislators over the past couple of years, but as far as renewable energy goes, the Navy has a fairly modest outlook compared to the Army’s Net Zero Vision. Army Net Zero is just what it says – a net zero plan for energy, water and waste at Army facilities – but it goes far beyond that to embrace environmental stewardship and community health as essential elements of national defense. That holistic perspective is reinforced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Take a look at the USACE Earth Day statement from a couple of years ago: “For those of us who are part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), it’s one more day in our journey toward ensuring that our actions are sustainable and that we are the very best stewards we can be of this country, of this planet…We are the nation’s environmental engineer. No other federal agency is addressing environmental issues of the same scope and magnitude as we are…” Keeping that in mind, in 2011 the Army established the Energy Initiatives Task Force to streamline the process for getting utility-scale renewable energy in the pipeline for construction on its bases, the idea being that hyper-local energy sourcing is cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/05/09/army-renewable-energy-gets-7-billion-boost/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368106321824</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:32:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368107007947-5</Id><Title>OIl prices will free fall</Title><Msg>IT has all been manipulated with the market buying sectors etc. Reality is these markets are going to crash world wide.

They could easily lead to very frustrated male and female partners and much disharmony, disharmony that is not useful in winning the game that matters: survival of the fittest There should be no need for cheating if a man is smart enough to pick a woman who is a good genetic match. Any man who cannot use his eyes to determine this in seconds is a poor player at games of survival of the fittest. Survival of the fittest has defined biological payoffs and spoiling them (producing no children or freaks) because of ill discipline or stupidity (I blame the male for these outcomes) just means one loses the game. So if a woman dresses up in a French maid’s outfit and hands you a riding crop she selected it is an opportunity to please or make woman frustrated.

Dlouhy The Energy Department is sifting through some 200,000 public comments as it prepares to issue verdicts on energy companies’ applications to broadly export natural gas, a top Obama administration official said Thursday. “We are moving through the process as expeditiously as possible,” said Christopher Smith, the acting assistant secretary for fossil energy. “We want to make sure that the decision that we make is consistent with our interest in making a good policy decision and our goal is to get to that that process as quickly as reasonable and still make sure we’re open and transparent with all the stakeholders we have to deal with.” More than a dozen companies have asked the Energy Department for licenses to export natural gas to Japan and other countries that do not have free-trade agreements with the United States. Although Houston-based Cheniere Energy won export approval last year, the Energy Department has put other applications on hold while it considers the economic effects of the decisions. Onshore: U.S.-Mexico collaboration seen necessary on Eagle Ford drilling The crush of comments came on a study completed last year for the Energy Department that concluded even if the government doesn’t limit natural gas exports, there will be a net economic benefit for the United States. Some manufacturers, led by Dow Chemical Co., dispute that conclusion, saying unfettered exports could boost the price of natural gas and chip away at the competitive advantage for U.S. companies that rely on the fossil fuel. Smith stressed the Energy Department’s deliberative approach to analyzing public comments and a number of factors as it weighs export license applications. “We’re looking at balance to trade, we’re looking at job creation, we’re looking at energy security, we’re looking at environmental issues, we’re looking at fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/09/energy-department-using-broad-criteria-to-judge-lng-exports/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1368122747170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:05:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368122783444-14</Id><Title>beware of Motley(madoff)Fool.

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee was scheduled to vote today at 9:15 on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to be the next EPA Administrator. Despite the fact that she has answered more than a thousand of the committee’s questions, Senate Republicans announced just before the hearing that they would be boycotting the vote, denying the committee quorum and postponing the confirmation hearing. The committee rules require that at least two members of the minority party be present during a vote. Not a single Republican bothered to show up. Senator Barbara Boxer, Chair of the committee, still held a meeting, allowing the Democrats in attendance to try to explain to the American people why they still have no EPA Administrator. The ostensible reason that the Republicans boycotted today’s vote was because they said she did not satisfactorily answer their questions. Senator Boxer reminded those present that Gina McCarthy has already answered more than a thousand questions from the committee and moreover is eminently qualified with an excellent track record of working with the business community and and both parties to do her job. Boxer later floated the idea of changing the rules of the committee so that a boycott such as this would not gum up the works. She urged her GOP colleagues to listen to the many “mainstream” Republicans who support Gina McCarthy’s nomination and “get out of the fringe lane.” If senators oppose a nominee, they should show up and vote against the nominee, not hold the process hostage for ideological reasons. In 2009, the Senate easily confirmed the highly qualified McCarthy by a voice vote to head the Clean Air division of the EPA.

But finally, Tesla has earned its first quarterly profit ever, and going forward the outlook for Tesla looks bright. Tesla managed to make a profit of $15 million on sales of $562 million in the first quarter of 2013, delivering an estimated 4,900 Model S units to customers. Tesla also earned $63 million by selling zero-emissions credits to automakers in California, and going forward the electric auto maker could earn as much as $250 million from selling environmental credits. Tesla is apparently on pace to meet their target of 20,000 vehicle sales in 2013, and it receives up to $35,000 of environmental credits for each Tesla Model S electric car it sells. These ZEV credits can be sold to automakers in California, whether or not they sell zero emissions vehicles, to help these automakers meet California’s strict environmental laws. This helped offset the some $200 million in company investments Tesla is expected to make in the next year, opening new stores and installing supercharger stations. These investments will go down over time, leading to even higher profit margins. This profit helped bolster Tesla Motors stock, which briefly jumped to over $70 before settling around $55. Tesla stock has been growing stronger, and the fact that the company has finally made a profit is sure to make investors happy. Elon Musk has defied the odds, and made money with a pure electric car.
