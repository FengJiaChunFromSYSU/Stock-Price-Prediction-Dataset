The EPA recommended that State reassess the amount of greenhouse gas that would be emitted by the development of oil sands in Alberta, Canada, as a result of construction of the pipeline, which eventually could transport as much as 830,000 barrels of diluted bitumen crude to refineries in Texas. Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator in the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, suggested the total gas released could be higher than State has estimated, depending on assumptions in the analysis. She recommended that State acknowledge that large portions of the crude will sink if there is a spill into a waterway and spell out how it would require pipeline operator TransCanada to respond. She asked State to take another look at an alternative route for the proposed $5.3 billion pipeline, one that would take it away from the Ogallala aquifer, one of the world’s largest sources of fresh groundwater. The EPA’s objection provides opponents with political ammunition and could force President Obama to weigh in on the permitting decision. Secretary of State John F. Kerry will decide whether the pipeline is in the U.S. national interest unless another federal agency objects. If the EPA continues to challenge State’s analysis, Obama will have to make the call. The EPA sharply criticized a draft environmental analysis issued by State in April 2010. Anthony Swift, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a washingtonpostDOTcom/national/health-science/epa-wants-state-dept-to-rework-analysis-of-keystone-xl-pipeline/2013/04/22/1c6e9812-ab9f-11e2-b6fd-ba6f5f26d70e_story.html?wprss=rss_energy-environment</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366723852643</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 09:30:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366725356664-6</Id><Title>Universal Bioenergy Inc.

You believe egalitarianism will beat elitism. The conclusion is implicit. I’m from Generation “X,” easily the most elitist, “narcissistic” (in Hippie terminology) one for quite some time. Your values sound very “hippie” and liberal and they are on their way out globally, irrespective of whether they persist in the USA because of its sub-cultural groups. Certainly they are useless to me. Whenever I tell my favorite goddess that she is very smart it makes her very happy. If she wants to think herself a goddess that is quite alright with me. She’s a little bit younger than me (Generation Y I suppose) and I’m quite pleased we see things the same way. I’m sure a similar dynamic is going on in the scientific institutions I’ve mentioned with the people involved. With super-computers and leveraging the power of mathematical rationalism many times over we can really have some fun… We have unlimited money courtesy of government. You ask what is god's precision. We define it with quantum theory. All history is a contest of survival of the fittest. Those who are unfit fail… History is not a mess.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366730336730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 11:18:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366734130157-9</Id><Title>XOM is too boring.

Foreign Minister Elias Jaua responded with a promise to retaliate if that happens, prompting State Department Spokesman Patrick Ventrell's remarks on Tuesday. “I think the Venezuelan side may have looked at that … and read into [it that] we're considering something,” Ventrell said at his daily press briefing. “I'm saying that that's not something that we're currently contemplating at this moment.” Jaua had promised to counter with “trade, energy, economic and political measures as we deem necessary to respond forcefully to this unacceptable threat.” “We do not accept any empire threats,” he told Venezuela's Telesur. “You can be sure that faced with any kind of sanctions, we will respond with economic, political, social and diplomatic actions to defend the sacred rights of the Venezuelan people.” Several Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), have urged President Obama not to recognize the election of Nicolas Maduro unless allegations of voter fraud are investigated. Obama did not send a delegation to Maduro's inauguration as Hugo Chavez's successor on Friday, but the White House has expressed confidence in Venezuelan electoral officials' promise to audit the the vote, which falls short of a full recount... thehillDOTcom/blogs/global-affairs/americas/295595-us-backs-off-sanctions-talk-after-venezuela-threatens-to-cut-oil-exports</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366762678728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 20:17:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
