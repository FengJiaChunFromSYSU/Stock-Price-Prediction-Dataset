Andrew Cuomo came as close as he ever has to approving fracking last month, laying out a limited drilling plan for as many as 40 gas wells before changing course to await the findings of a new study after discussions with environmentalist and former brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy Jr., several people familiar with his thinking told The Associated Press. The turning point, which could delay a decision for up to a year or longer, came in a series of phone calls with Kennedy. The two discussed a new health study on the hydraulic fracturing drilling method that could be thorough enough to trump all others in a debate that has split New York for five years. "I think the issue suddenly got simple for him," Kennedy told the AP, then went on to paraphrase Cuomo in their discussions: "'If it's causing health problems, I really don't want it in New York state. And if it's not causing health problems, we should figure out a way we can do it.'"

To Chip Away At Renewable Energy Standards By Jeff Spross on Mar 1, 2013 at 1:55 pm The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that twin votes in Kansas State House and Senate on Thursday put the kibosh on legislative efforts to roll back and delay Kansas’ renewable energy standard (RES). Passed in 2009, Kansas’ RES requires investor-owned utilities to generate 20 percent of peak demand electrical capacity from renewable sources by 2020. The American Wind Energy Association has actually highlighted the RES as a driving factor in the states burgeoning wind power sector — half of Kansas’ wind farms began operating between 2010 and 2012, after the RES went into effect. Unfortunately, Kansas has also been targeted by conservative anti-renewable efforts. Republican Rep. Dennis Hedke, the chairman of Kansas’ House Energy and Environment Committee, recently acknowledged he had private talks with a lobbyist for Koch Companies Public Sector LLC concerning the House bill to dilute the RES. (HB 2241) Even anti-tax activist Graver Norquist got in on the action, telling the state’s legislature it ought to abandon the “costly renewable energy mandate so as to mitigate its negative impact on the economy.” But to Kansas’ credit, it looks like neither effort bore fruit: [T]he Senate responded by voting 17-23 to defeat Senate Bill 82 that would have postponed the deadline for complying with the Kansas renewable portfolio standard. Instead of Kansas utilities reaching 15 percent of power from wind, solar or other alternative source in 2016, the bill would have moved the date to 2018. The measure also pushed the 20 percent mandate to 2024 from 2020. […] The House answered by voting 63-59 to send House Bill 2241 back to a committee for additional deliberation.

Tom Carper and Chris #$%$ and Rep. John Carney (all D-Del.) introduced the Incentivizing Offshore Wind Power Act to provide critical financial incentives for investment in offshore wind energy. This legislation would provide the offshore wind industry with enhanced stability by extending investment tax credits for the first 3,000 Megawatts of offshore wind facilities placed into service, which is an estimate of 600 wind turbines. These tax credits are vital for this new clean energy technology because of the longer lead time for the permitting and construction of offshore wind turbines, compared to onshore wind energy. Once awarded a tax credit, companies would have five years to install the offshore wind facility. Companies would not be able to receive other production or investment tax credits in addition to the offshore wind investment tax credit. “Developing wind energy off our nation’s shores, especially in places like Delaware, is a critical part of boosting American energy independence and jumpstarting our clean energy economy,” said Senator Carper. “Offshore wind is a true ‘win-win-win’ – it is cleaner for our environment, reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign energy, and helps create jobs. If we want to harness this untapped, domestic energy source, providing investment tax incentives for our country’s first offshore wind projects is essential. Our bill would do just that. Additionally, it would help spur an industry that can be an engine for new, good-paying jobs in manufacturing, construction, maintenance and production. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation and encourage the growth of the American offshore wind industry.” “Wind energy generated off our shores has the potential to strengthen domestic energy production, lower energy costs, and create jobs,”... offshorewindDOTbiz/2013/03/03/usa-delaware-congressional-delegation-introduces-incentivizing-offshore-wind-power-act/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362349172057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:19:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362351078215-22</Id><Title>Duke Explores Rooftop Solar as Panels Slow Demand, CEO Says</Title><Msg>Duke Explores Rooftop Solar as Panels Slow Demand, CEO Says By Jim Polson - Feb 28, 2013 1:54 PM MT Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), the largest U.S. utility owner, may expand into rooftop solar as wider use of photovoltaic panels by customers cuts into demand for electricity in states including California, Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers said. Rooftop panels are gaining popularity as the industry faces “anemic” growth in power demand that may redefine the traditional utility business model, Rogers said at an analyst meeting in New York today. “It is obviously a potential threat to us over the long term and an opportunity in the short term,” Rogers said in an interview after the meeting. “If the cost of solar panels keeps coming down, installation costs come down and if they combine solar with battery technology and a power management system, then we have someone just using us for backup,” he said. Duke, based in Charlotte, North Caroline, has built 1,600 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar since entering the renewable-electricity business in 2007 with the purchase of the wind developer Tierra Energy. It bought a second wind-farm developer, Catamount Energy Corp., for $240 million in 2008. Rooftop photovoltaic panels are more common in California, the biggest U.S. solar market, than in North Carolina, where Duke has the most customers, Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good said in the interview. “We’re certainly looking at the economics of residential and rooftop solar,” Good said. “The financing of these investments also needs to be explored.” Duke has capital available to fund an expansion into rooftop solar if the company decides to pursue the market, Good said. “Our thinking hasn’t matured to the point that we’re actively pursuing anything.” bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-28/duke-may-expand-into-rooftop-solar-as-panels-hinder-forecasting.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362351078215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:51:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362353801306-23</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a bonafide COWARD</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340542136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:22:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxwizard68 • Feb 8, 2013 11:22 AM Flag 0users liked this postsusers disliked this posts8Reply ref_steve is a bonafide COWARD Big talk, no action !
