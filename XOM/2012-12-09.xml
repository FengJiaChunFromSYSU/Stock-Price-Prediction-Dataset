Doha (CNN) -- After two weeks of climate negotiations in Doha, bleary-eyed ministers, negotiators, and advocates are headed back home to the various regions around the world. Few, if any, are leaving entirely satisfied. The pace of progress on climate change is still too slow and the political will for greater ambition remains elusive. That said, these talks did achieve the basic goal of extending the Kyoto Protocol and moving countries onto a single negotiating track toward a new climate agreement by 2015. This leaves the door for more progress ahead. This year's talks took place against the backdrop of two disturbing trends. On the one hand, there are multiple signs that climate change is here and its impacts are already being felt around the world. On the other hand, the world remains tied to the consumption of fossil fuels that drive more and more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. With each passing day that we don't shift directions, we are increasingly locking ourselves into more unstable climate future. The real question is: Can the international talks have a real impact on climate change? But before we get to that question, let's look more closely at the two trends: First, in recent years, we've seen a surge in climate and extreme weather events, along with analysis and other evidence that the world is on an unsustainable course. The most recent and tragic example was Super Typhoon Bopha that swept across the Philippines this week, killing at least 500 people and leaving tens of thousands displaced. Typhoons aren't unusual in the Philippines, but this one is the most southern on record and it arrived particularly late in the year. The storm, of course, comes on the heels of Hurricane Sandy, which swept through the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States, leaving hundreds dead, and thousands without power or property. These are the kind of extreme weather events that are becoming more common in a warming world. On top of these examples are a series of powerful new reports that reinforce the dangerous direction the world is headed. For instance, the World Bank just released a report, "Turning Down the Heat," which explores a world with four degrees Celsius of global temperature growth. The picture is not pretty. Four degrees would bring more intense wildfires, heat waves, and droughts. Ocean life would die off, while pests and disease would increase, the report says. Already we are seeing that polar ice is melting faster than expected and sea levels are rising beyond many projections. For instance, NOAA just released a study showing that sea levels could rise as much as 6.6 feet by the end of the century. Furthermore, temperature records continue to fall. The United States is on course to have it hottest year on record, as withering drought spreads across two-thirds of the country. That brings us to the second major trend, which is the world's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. WRI recently released an analysis showing that there are nearly 1,200 new proposed coal plants worldwide. While not all of these will be developed, even a fraction of them would drive up global emissions. Oil, likewise, remains a dominant fuel source. And, despite the enormous profits, the International Energy Agency has reported that government subsidies for fossil fuels were six times those for renewable energy in 2011. This dependence on fossil fuels keeps pushing up the global emissions. (2011 also broke the record for greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.) That's why what happens in the global climate agreements is so crucial. The UN is the only venue that brings all countries together and gives each a chance to have a voice. It provides a common arena that enhances transparency and accountability among countries. But, the UN is only as effective as the political will of its members. Right now, when it comes to climate change, we are simply not seeing nearly enough commitment nor ambition from national leaders. Greater domestic action can instill confidence and help build momentum. With more national leadership, the UN can move faster and take a bigger bite out of global emissions. Of course, the international system cannot solve the problem on its own. We need business leaders, government officials, and the public to step up as well. We need more of their voices in the debate. Fortunately, public understanding of climate change is on the rise, as is support for action. Turning again to the Doha meeting, it's certainly clear that the meeting alone won't do enough to address this issue. But it does put countries on a track and provides them with the opportunity to raise their ambition. The time we have to cut emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate change is running short. The stakes are high. It's time for world leaders, negotiators and the public to increase their intensity, to develop more specific strategies, and deliver more emission reductions. We need to build on Doha and get on a path to a strong, fair and ambitious climate agreement. cnnDOTcom/2012/12/09/opinion/morgan-climate-change-talks/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355037389937</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 02:16:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355046139343-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama pushes ahead with high-speed rail plan</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354857708180</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 00:21:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ cali. freaks.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1355046139343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 04:42:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355046269980-3</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Party Of Stupid Brings Nothing But Destruction to USA</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354852507844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:55:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watch and see what happens to america #$%$ #$%$ clown.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1355046269980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 04:44:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355062477261-4</Id><Title>Valley congressmen slam high-speed rail at hearing</Title><Msg>Valley congressmen slam high-speed rail at hearing 22 hours ago • By Sentinel Staff (1) Comments HANFORD — Rep. Jeff Denham, a Valley congressman from Turlock, slammed the California High-Speed Rail project in a testy exchange with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood this week. The Thursday hearing in Washington, D.C. before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee featured a testy exchange between LaHood, a support of high-speed rail, and Denham, who is a vocal critic of the project. Denham said the project lacked $38.6 billion in funding, and insisted that it shouldn’t receive additional federal money until a private investor comes forward. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, questioned whether the federal government can afford to continue funding the project with the “fiscal cliff” approaching. The comments previewed a showdown between House Republicans and President Barack Obama over high-speed rail spending. LaHood told Denham he hoped there were some House members willing to support the project. “As long as there’s language in bills to prohibit us from funding, we’re going nowhere,” LaHood said. “I am a business owner,” Denham shot back. “I know that I can’t go out there and borrow money until I have a business plan.” LaHood then asked if Denham would like to review the existing business plan with California High-Speed Rail Authority Board of Directors Chairman Dan Richard. However, farming groups have given LaHood credit for saying that officials in the project’s early stages didn’t do a good job of dealing with farmers. “I was stunned by the way they have been treated,” LaHood said. “We’re trying to work with these people.” MCT news wire contributed to this story. hanfordsentinelDOTcom/news/local/valley-congressmen-slam-high-speed-rail-at-hearing/article_2a08ecda-4159-11e2-a677-0019bb2963f4.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355062477261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 09:14:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355062574598-5</Id><Title>More voices needed in climate debate</Title><Msg>More voices needed in climate debate By Jennifer Morgan, Special to CNN updated 12:18 AM EST, Sun December 9, 2012 Editor's note: Jennifer Morgan is the director of the climate and energy program at the World Resources Institute, a global think tank that works with governments, businesses and individuals to promote a low-carbon future.

The city’s new biodiesel plant was paid for by a $208,000 grant from the $3.2 billion Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program, under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Energy, meant to “deploy the cheapest, cleanest and most reliable energy technologies we have,” according to the department’s website. City spokeswoman Jennifer Bennett said the plant does just that. “Biodiesel cleans the fuel lines. It runs and burns cleaner. It extends the life of the vehicle. It’s easier on the engines and creates a whole lot less pollution,” she said. Biodiesel also relieves sanitation and stormwater staffs and budgets by keeping fats, oil and grease out of the pipeline, said Ann Kirk, director of the city’s Keep Smyrna Beautiful campaign. Not to mention it saves money, beginning with shaving off $1.20 or more per gallon of diesel, which has prices hovering around $4 in metro Atlanta. The F-450 and F-550 pickup trucks used by the water and sewer departments and for trash pickup do not need retrofitting beyond a $10 fuel filter to use the biodiesel. Nor will the city need to hire anyone to run the conversion plant. Fleet manager Mark Breugh and Public Works Assistant Director Frank Martin can operate the machinery bought from Tecumseh, Kan.-based Alternative Energy Systems Integrated Solutions, and they in turn will train other existing staff members in the process. The city has a ready supply of raw materials: Residents and restaurants can donate used cooking oil at seven collection stations around the city, which also dispense empty plastic jugs. “You can pick up a container at any location,” Kirk said. “Return it to the cage, leave it curbside or bring it to the recycling center. Swap it out just like a propane tank.” The city notified residents of the collection efforts by social media and its online newsletter, which helped stockpile 400 gallons of oil before the plant went online Nov. 28. “The Saturday after Thanksgiving, we got 22 gallons of oil,” Kirk said. Public Works director Scott Stokes said the city began filling up the eight 250-gallon holding tanks 2011. “We’ve been collecting for a year, on and off,” he said. “We started in earnest in the spring.” The project has been in the works since 2009, when city officials visited Hoover, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, to inspect a prototype. Grant money came through in December 2010 and the project was announced in February of this year. “It’s been a long process because searching for equipment took longer than expected,” Kirk said The conversion plant, which occupies a 1,200-square-foot addition to the public works department’s Broyles Road facility, combines the vegetable oil with a mixture of potassium hydroxide and methanol to make the biodiesel. “We can make 80 gallons in five or six hours,” Breugh said. The grant included enough money for an additional plant in the shed, which is big enough for two biodiesel processors. “It depends on the raw materials,” Stokes said. “If we get it, we’ll expand.” If two plants operate at full capacity, making more than 25,000 gallons a year, the can city reduce its nearly 100,000-gallon annual consumption of diesel by more than a quarter. “At maximum production of biodiesel, the city would have the ability to reduce diesel fuel consumption by approximately 27 percent per year at a savings of approximately $32,000,” Bennett said. The city expects to hit that mark in 2020, followed by a 25 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions by 2025. Kirk said Smyrna is the only metro Atlanta city she knows of with its own biodiesel plant; however, it is not the only municipality interested in the concept. “We have been using biodiesel for the last four years,” Marietta City Manager Bill Bruton said. “We purchase it from a local vendor. Within the next 30 days we will have a request for proposals out for alternative fuel options.” mdjonlineDOTcom/view/full_story/21075574/article-Smyrna-using-biodiesel-for-city%E2%80%99s-vehicle-fleet?instance=secondary_story_left_column</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355065280777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:01:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355065848124-8</Id><Topic><Title>saves money, beginning with shaving off $1.20 or more per gallon of diesel</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355065280777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:01:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Subsidized oil doesn't belong in the market!

That is just a restatement of the above, and nothing but a restatement of the position that gold is in a bubble. The Chinese are buying gold because they have to do something with the dollars that pile up when they peg the yuan to the dollar below market value, and sell exports. They print yuan to depress their currency and make the dollars pile up. The Arabs and Russians buy gold with dollars they earn selling oil at prices driven up by China. The process of where the export money is coming from is obvious: Chinese coal -- power -- manufactured good -- export sale -- dollar or euro in China's hands They can burn coal to produce cheap power and manufactured goods where others cannot because of the Kyoto Protocol and the EPA. Eventually the price of the manufactured goods they are selling will drop to the Chinese production cost, as either they will be the only ones selling the items, or others will figure out how to produce them as cheaply as the Chinese. Whichever way it unfolds the Chinese will lose their source of dollars and euros when price converges downward to production cost, and they will have no money to buy gold with. They are buying stocks and bonds as well. The Chinese won't have the money to buy oil either when their exports collapse, and the Arab and Russian demand for gold, stocks, and bonds will evaporate. Expect interest rates to climb over 10% when the Chinese export surplus collapses, and the stock market to lose around 70% of its value. As for gold it will be lucky to hold $300/oz. Gold is exactly like the tulip mania. The item being bid has no real use value, at least not one remotely related to the price. It rises because someone with a lot of money is bidding it. It crashes when they stop. The other things mentioned have value as they at least produce cash flows, but their value is inflated by the big buyer the same as the tulips.</Msg><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1355068453126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:54:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355069685295-10</Id><Topic><Title>This board (bored) needs an enema</Title><Username>khalid_p_khan</Username><Timestamp>1355063928750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 09:38:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are a few nuts who specialize in 100 character or less lines that amount to circular logic and gibberish in the end.

Although I obviously dislike the Demoncraps, I also dislike the Republicans. I am a fiscal conservative but a social libertarian. In essence I want our federal government to be fiscally conservative and to stay the HLLLL out of our personal lives - the government should have absolutely no say so on who can marry who and who can have an abortion, among other things. Although the Republicans of late have not been fiscally conservative, they are no where as bad as the Demoncraps of late. Ron Paul would have been a better choice for President but he couldn't have beat Obama or Romney - being an old squeaky voice white guy, he just doesn't look or sound the part - but his economic ideas are good.

By Paul Hammel World-Herald News Service | 0 comments LINCOLN — A preliminary decision from the U.S. State Department on the fate of the Keystone XL pipeline project is coming soon, catching some by surprise because Nebraska’s review of the controversial project is not yet done. A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a draft environmental impact statement on the rerouted crude oil pipeline is coming “in the near future.” The leader of a Lincoln-based group that opposes the pipeline said her sources say the draft could be released as early as this week. Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska said she was “discouraged” by the reports because Nebraska’s review of the detoured pipeline route through the state is not completed. Last Tuesday, 105 people testified in Albion at the last public hearing held by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality on the project. The agency is scheduled to issue its final review around the end of the year. After Tuesday’s hearing stretched to 2 a.m. Wednesday, the department said it was extending the deadline for written comments on its review, accepting them until 5 p.m. last Friday. “We haven’t even finished our Nebraska process,” Kleeb said. “How can the State Department put out an environmental impact statement if we’re still figuring out things in Nebraska? What information are they using?” Ken Winston of the Sierra Club’s Nebraska chapter said the State Department’s review would be a “sham” if it is released before Nebraska’s decision on whether to approve the pipeline’s new route around the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region. “I would hope a thorough review would be done,” Winston said. A NDEQ spokesman said the possibility of a federal draft coming soon is not a surprise to the agency. Brian McManus of the agency said it had been understood that Nebraska’s review and the federal review “could happen concurrently.” McManus said the State Department’s final report, which is expected during the first quarter of 2013, would take into account Nebraska’s analysis of the new route. The State Department has the final say on approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which will carry crude oil steamed out of tar sand deposits in Canada to oil refineries on the Gulf Coast. In January, the Obama administration rejected a permit for the pipeline, saying that a February deadline set by congressional Republicans didn’t allow enough time to evaluate the project, particularly its impact on the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground sea that provides drinking and irrigation water. Obama later approved a segment of the Keystone XL from Oklahoma to Texas, but the State Department agreed to allow Nebraska to evaluate the proposed new route around the Sandhills. Gov. Dave Heineman will have the final say on whether the state approves the new route. The State Department then has the final word on whether construction can begin. Obama’s decision is being portrayed by environmental groups as a test of whether he’s serious about combating global warming by rejecting a source of oil that requires greater releases of greenhouse gases to extract. Business and labor groups say the United States needs the pipeline to enhance energy security and provide construction jobs. theindependentDOTcom/news/regional/official-federal-draft-on-keystone-pipeline-due-in-near-future/article_4a1c21c4-41b6-11e2-91eb-0019bb2963f4.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355079519468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 13:58:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355079675401-14</Id><Title>Official: Federal draft on Keystone pipeline due in *near future*</Title><Msg>Official: Federal draft on Keystone pipeline due in ‘near future’ Comments Posted: Saturday, December 8, 2012 11:45 pm | Updated: 10:10 pm, Sat Dec 8, 2012.

The German electronics giant Siemens AG SIE.XE +0.24% also submitted a qualified bid at the auction, which kicked off Thursday at the Chicago office of Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm representing A123 in its Chapter 11 case. A spokesman for A123 Systems declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Johnson Controls couldn't immediately comment. A123, which was awarded nearly $250 million in grants from the Department of Energy in 2009 to build a factory in Michigan, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October with a plan to sell its automotive-business assets, including the plant, to Johnson Controls. But Wanxiang, a unit of China's Wanxiang Group, stepped forward to purchase the lithium-ion-battery maker despite having been left at the altar earlier this year when a $465 million deal collapsed. While A123's bankruptcy has been a black eye for the Obama administration's efforts to foster a domestic market for electric vehicles, the entire battery industry in the U.S. is struggling as demand for electric vehicles hasn't lived up to expectations so far. The cars being built still are using Japanese and Korean suppliers that have more manufacturing expertise and bigger scale. In recent weeks a number of critics have warned of the risk that some of A123's taxpayer-funded technology could wind up in the hands of a Chinese purchaser. At least two dozen members of Congress have written to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. warning that a sale to Wanxiang requires careful scrutiny. Any sale to Wanxiang requires approval from the CFIUS, a government body led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, which reviews deals that could result in the control of a U.S. business by a foreign person or company. A123—which in addition to its automotive-battery business has a consumer arm and grid-energy storage division—has a number of contracts to provide high-power batteries and other services to the U.S. military. Wanxiang has tried to stem the criticism that helped derail its earlier deal to buy A123 Systems. The Chinese manufacturer's most recent offer carves out A123's government business, and the company has said it intends to keep A123's Michigan operations in business. A123's government business was purchased by a Chicago-area firm, according to the person familiar with the matter. The Chinese manufacturer initially offered about $131 million for A123's assets, according to a person familiar with the proposal. Johnson Controls had initially offered $125 million for A123's assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey has scheduled a sale hearing for the afternoon of Dec. 11 in Wilmington, Del.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1355089555814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 16:45:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355091658753-16</Id><Title>Nexen Approval Paves Way for More Foreign Deals in Gas</Title><Msg>Nexen Approval Paves Way for More Foreign Deals in Gas By Jeremy van Loon and Rebecca Penty on December 09, 2012 Canada’s approval of two Asian takeovers worth $20 billion may spark more foreign acquisitions of natural gas producers in the country while capping state- owned control of Alberta’s oil sands. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper approved China-owned Cnooc’s Ltd.’s $15.1 billion bid for Nexen Inc. (NXY) and a C$5.2 billion ($5.2 billion) offer for Progress Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ) by Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Malaysia’s state-owned energy company on Dec. 7. At the same time, Harper unveiled foreign investment guidelines to prevent future takeovers of oil-sands companies by state-owned companies, except under “exceptional circumstances.” “Canada is open for business but it’s not going to be a garage sale,” Robert Cooper, an analyst at Haywood Securities Inc., said by phone from Calgary. Cooper highlighted Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. and Tourmaline Oil Corp. as takeover candidates in the gas sector. “If I was a betting man and that’s where you were in the markets, those names will catch a bid.” The two takeovers tested Harper’s ability to balance the need to bolster economic relations with Asian economies without letting them gain too much influence over the world’s third- largest pool of proven oil reserves. Joint Ventures Harper, who has appealed to Asian investors to help develop Canada’s resources, didn’t preclude takeovers in the nation’s gas industry from companies controlled by foreign governments. Minority stakes and joint ventures in all Canadian businesses will still to be welcomed. “When we say that Canada is open for business, we do not mean that Canada is for sale to foreign governments,” Harper told reporters. Under the guidelines, the government will strengthen scrutiny of state-owned bids for companies outside the oil sands, assessing the control they would have on the target and its industry. Shares of Calgary-based Nexen rallied 15 percent to $26.94 in U.S. trading after exchanges closed, 2 percent below Cnooc’s $27.50 offer. The Canadian dollar strengthened, rising 0.3 percent to 98.84 cents per U.S. dollar as the announcements were made. The Cnooc-Nexen transaction is the biggest in Canada since Calgary-based Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) bought Petro-Canada in August 2009 for about $18 billion. Through its C$2.1 billion acquisition of Opti Canada Ltd. last year, Cnooc already owns 35 percent of the Long Lake oil-sands project operated by Nexen. It would gain Nexen’s 20 percent interest in the Usan offshore Nigerian project operated by a unit of Total SA. Oil Sands The oil sands restrictions may cause a sell-off in oil- sands companies, said Kevin Kaiser, energy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, an independent investment research firm based in New Haven, Connecticut. Canada’s three largest oil-sands companies by market value are Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. respectively, all based in Calgary. Imperial Oil is about 70 percent-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas. “Harper is explicit that you won’t see a corporate takeover in the oil sands. Not by a state-owned enterprise,” Kaiser said by phone on Dec. 7. “Oil sands are going to be lower on Monday. MEG Energy Corp. (MEG) will plummet. Cnooc has a stake and investors were thinking that at some point, China would take out MEG. That is wiped clean off the table now.” A telephone message and e-mail left with Brad Bellows, a spokesman for MEG, outside of regular business hours, wasn’t immediately returned. The sheer “magnitude of the oil sands resource” explains Harper’s new rules, said Ryan Bushell, who helps manage C$2 billion at Leon Frazer &amp; Associates Inc. in Toronto. Merger Acceleration Oil-sands production is controlled by about 15 companies that represent a “huge portion” of the country’s oil industry and 60 percent of global oil output that’s “not in state hands,” Harper said. The gas industry won’t face such explicit limits under the new guidelines. With surging Asian demand for natural gas and a narrow window for projects due to competition from the U.S., Australia and the Middle East, foreign buyers must act, Eric Nuttall, a fund manager at Sprott Asset Management Inc, said by phone from Toronto. “There should be an acceleration, imminently, of merger and acquisition activity,” among gas companies, said Nuttall, who oversees C$110 million in assets, including Painted Pony, a likely target, he said. Choosy foreign energy companies will limit the number of Canadian gas producers to get bids, Bushell said. “It’s a short list of buyers and those buyers are very savvy and they’re probably looking at a short list of assets,” he said. Shale Rock The takeover of Progress by Petronas helps speed exports of Canadian gas to markets outside North America, said Michael Culbert, chief executive officer of Progress. “Really what this does for Progress Energy and for the Canadian natural gas sector is it’s a material infusion of capital that allows us to accelerate the growth of our Canadian assets,” Culbert said in an phone interview Dec. 7. A glut in North American gas output from shale-rock formations caused the price of gas to reach a 10-year low in April, prompting energy companies to propose liquefying the gas by cooling it to reduce the volume and ship it by tanker to higher priced markets. British Columbia’s natural gas is isolated from the main North American markets and closer to the Pacific coast ports of Kitimat and Prince Rupert, making liquefied natural gas exports one of the few options for monetizing the fuel. Petronas is planning an export facility worth C$9 billion to C$11 billion, joining rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil proposing LNG terminals. LNG Projects LNG interest is driven by demand in Asia, where Chinese consumption of the fuel has increased an average of about 16 percent annually from 2000 to 2010 and will continue expanding as much as 12 percent a year through 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates. Japan and South Korea are the world’s top LNG importers. Companies looking for Canadian gas assets and LNG projects may include Chevron Corp. (CVX), India’s Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp Ltd. (ONGC) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., said Bob Schulz, a business professor at the University of Calgary who specializes in the Canadian oil and gas industry. “What you’re going to see on the gas side is consortiums,” he said. “Those global companies are going to go incorporate somebody else’s assets to go and make the deal work on the supply side.” Competition Increasing Canada’s oil and gas industry has generated $42.7 billion in merger and acquisition activity this year, with Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian companies among the top acquirers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That has risen from $11.5 billion in 2000, of which Canadian acquirers were responsible for 78 percent of the transactions. “The Canadian industry is now seen as being on the global stage,” said Greg Stringham, vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, in an interview from Calgary. “On natural gas there’s an opportunity for Canada, but the window of opportunity is fairly tight because you’re competing with the Middle East, with America and Australia. We need to step through that window fairly quickly.” Petronas has the world’s largest single site producing LNG in Sarawak, Malaysia, according to its website, and also operates the world’s largest LNG carrier fleet. The Sarawak compound has begun taking LNG imports to quench domestic demand. Montney Formation Recent Canadian gas transactions include Exxon’s C$2.92 billion offer for Celtic Exploration Ltd. Both Progress and Celtic drill in the Montney shale, one of Canada’s biggest proven shale-gas reserves with an estimated 49 trillion cubic feet and far from the main North American markets that are already oversupplied by shale gas from eastern and southern parts of the U.S. To make itself a more attractive takeover candidate, Painted Pony on Dec. 4 said it would acquire about 15,800 acres in the Montney Shale region to add to its existing land British Columbia. “Recent Montney-related transactions have highlighted the importance of large, contiguous Montney gas resource positions to global consolidators,” the company said at the time. Other Canadian companies operating in British Columbia’s Montney formation include Canbriam Energy Inc., Yoho Resources Inc. (YO) and Tourmaline Oil. Canadian producers developing the province’s Horn River gas reserves include Encana Corp., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Pengrowth Energy Corp. Yellow Flag While natural gas companies may see an upswing in transactions, some smaller oil sands producers may struggle to find financing partners as potential investors absorb the new rules, said Tony Baldanza, partner at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP with expertise in foreign investment and chairman of the law firm’s antitrust law group. “This will cast a shadow on oil-sands investments,” he said. “It’s putting up a yellow flag, not a red flag, but it remains to be seen what those exceptional circumstances might be.” Alberta Premier Alison Redford welcomed Harper’s approval of the Nexen and Progress Energy takeovers and reserved judgment on the new restrictions involving state-owned investments in the oil sands. “As owners of the oil sands resource, we believe we have a stake in the decisions that affect the development of those Resources, Redford said. ‘‘We will seek clarity on how ‘exceptional circumstances’ will be defined.’’ Watching Cnooc Canada is already the world’s sixth-largest crude producer and most of the expected increase in production in the coming years will come from the oil sands. The $1.7 trillion economy, whose biggest export is crude, relies on foreign investment to spur growth and help develop the bitumen resources in Alberta. Investment in Canada’s oil sands, the world’s third largest with more than 170 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, will probably reach C$23 billion this year, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Smaller oil sands producers include Athabasca Oil Corp., BlackPearl Resources Inc. and Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. Potential investors will watch how successfully Cnooc is able to integrate Nexen’s far-flung assets and set up a headquarters and management structure in Calgary, said Wenran Jiang, adviser to the Alberta government on China and director of the Canada-China Energy and Environment Forum. ‘‘It’s not going to be easy and there’s no sure guarantee it will succeed,” he said. “Cnooc has limited resources in terms of how they can engage such a big venture, but again it’s a test case,” being China’s largest overseas purchase. businessweekDOTcom/news/2012-12-09/nexen-approval-paves-way-for-more-foreign-deals-in-gas</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355091658753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:20:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355091900534-17</Id><Topic><Title>Gold Crash Coming</Title><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1354895223990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:47:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Totally agree that GW Bush was actually a Demmoncrap!

I'm not sure what a German authoritarian government would be these days (wasn't that back in the 1800's?), but I suspect it would not include the welfare freebies the USA gives to "the poor" and "the minorities". Probably the only way the US can quickly change the current welfare state is to have a dictator and military control of the masses currently on welfare to immediate get them off welfare and working the jobs their education level will allow them to work, which would also include kicking the illegal immigrants out of the country to provide space in the lower paying job market for the lower educated welfare masses. But that is not the "American way" and it will never (or at least not in the near future) happen here. Instead, the Demoncraps will keep control of Federal politics, the Press, and the entertainment industry, and provide more freebies to an increasing number of welfare #$%$ so that the USA can become like Venezuela or Cuba under Hugo Chavez Obama.</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1355091900534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:25:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355102041483-18</Id><Title>Obama and Boehner Talk Deficits at the White House</Title><Msg>Obama and Boehner Talk Deficits at the White House By BRIAN KNOWLTON and JACKIE CALMES December 9, 2012, 1:13 pm 27 Comments With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama’s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between the Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders’ public statements decrying the lack of progress and the president’s refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes from high earners. The White House and Mr. Boehner’s office issued identical statements afterward saying, “The lines of communication remain open.” On Friday, Mr. Boehner told reporters that another week had been wasted, with just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis. Also on Friday, Mr. Obama spoke privately with Congressional Democratic leaders, Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, presumably to gauge what positions the Democrats in Congress could support. Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescence on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlements. Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had earlier presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said on “Fox News Sunday” that if Republicans gave in to the president’s chief demand, then “all of a sudden, the shift goes back to entitlements and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.” Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country’s huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say that the party ultimately will have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton. That group of Republicans, he said on Fox, was beginning to realize “that we don’t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end” – but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jiu-jitsu style, into a tactical advantage. Mr. Corker’s comments came as key figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the fiscal-crisis negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy – greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China. “It would result in the stock market really taking a hit,” Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F. She called for a “balanced” agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word President Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American “pragmatism” would prevail and avert the worst outcome. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, also predicted that an agreement would be reached. Perhaps more optimistically, he said he thought it would include a stipulation that the national debt ceiling be raised, without further drama, when it comes due in late January or February. “I believe, frankly, our Republican colleagues have learned that to say the government is not going to pay its debts and hold it up for something else is bad substance and bad politics,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I don’t think they’ll prevail on that.” Mr. Corker said he agreed with Mr. Schumer that a deal would be reached and “we’re not going to go over the fiscal cliff.” But he suggested that Republicans would not so easily give up on the debt-ceiling leverage. “Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that’s coming up right around the corner and the leverage is going to shift,” he said. A Senate vote is required to raise the nation’s statutory borrowing limit. One author of the much-disputed Simpson-Bowles debt-reduction plan, the former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson, a Republican, expressed some optimism on Sunday. He said he thought a deal would be reached but that if it were too narrow – if it failed to make deep enough cuts in health care spending or other big social programs – the economy, and Americans, would still suffer. “I’m an optimist,” he said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “I think they’ll do something, but if they do small ball, that won’t work: The markets aren’t going to listen to that.” His partner in the plan, Erskine Bowles, who was White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, warned that a failure in the ongoing negotiations would be “disastrous.” But he said he was somewhat more upbeat than he was a week ago, because of signs of movement from both sides. After weeks of what he called “kabuki theater,” the two sides have “started to tango now,” Mr. Bowles said, also on CBS. Asked if a deal could be reached by the end of the year, Mr. Bowles replied, “They absolutely can do it. If they don’t do it, shame on them.” Mr. Corker, who will be the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee in the new Congress, was also asked whether he thought Mr. Obama should nominate Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, given criticism of Ms. Rice’s role in the Sept. 11 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. “I do think that Ambassador Rice is viewed as a political operative, and I don’t think he’s going to nominate her, I really don’t,” Mr. Corker said. “I think that time has come and gone.” He said that if she was nominated, he would give her “a fair hearing,” but that Ms. Rice would probably face opposition from “both sides of the aisle.” Two Democratic senators disagreed, however. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said he believed Ms. Rice would be confirmed. “I do believe so,” he said on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “She’s an extraordinary person.” And Mr. Schumer suggested a way for Republicans to express opposition without taking the drastic step of blocking what would be one of Mr. Obama’s most important second-term nominations. “If she’s nominated by the president – and I think she’s very capable – they shouldn’t filibuster,” he said. “They don’t have to vote for her, but don’t require 60 votes to get her on, and that’s traditionally what’s been done.” thecaucusDOTblogsDOTnytimesDOTcom/2012/12/09/officials-foresee-progress-on-fiscal-talks/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355102041483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 20:14:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
