Under the proposal, RINs would be verified through a new voluntary quality assurance program that also includes alternative compliance options which leverage existing industry practices and market forces. This proposal will be available for a 30-day public comment period. EPA will consider feedback from a range of stakeholders before the proposal is finalized. Quality Assurance Plans (QAPs) would provide a recognized means for independent third parties to audit the production of renewable fuel and verify that RINs have been validly generated. For RINs that have been verified according to an approved QAP, the program would provide protection against liability for civil violations resulting from the transfer or use of invalidly generated RINs under certain conditions. The rule would also specify both the conditions under which invalid RINs must be replaced with valid RINs, and by whom. The proposed rule allows verification of RINs to begin this year. The RFS program, which was established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later modified through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, requires that specified volumes of renewable fuel be used as transportation fuel, home heating oil, and/or jet fuel each year. Renewable fuel producers and importers generate RINs based on the volume of compliant renewable fuel that they make available. RINs can then be traded and used by petroleum refiners and importers (“obligated parties”) to show compliance with their volume obligations. Following a number of high profile RIN fraud cases, EPA expects its rulemaking to improve the overall liquidity in the RIN market and in particular make it easier for smaller renewable fuel producers to sell their RINs. EPA worked closely with stakeholders in developing the proposal.

February 1, 2013 Tina Casey GE is billing its latest wind turbine design, the new 2.5-120, as the company’s “first brilliant wind turbine,” and while it’s no Einstein (Einstein was much shorter, for one thing) it is pretty darned smart. Aside from an integrated energy storage feature, the 2.5-120 includes a data-driven system that could help boost its efficiency 25 percent higher than GE’s current 2.5 megawatt wind turbine, and it also improves power output by 15 percent. The first prototype of the new turbine is being installed in the Netherlands some time this month so it will be a little while before we see how closely expectations match performance, but in the meantime this is a good opportunity to check out that data-driven system, aka GE’s “Industrial Internet. GE and the Industrial Internet GE’s concept for the Industrial Internet is based on the progress of technological history, except that instead of moving out of the Industrial Age and into the Internet Age you add them together to get new systems and, more importantly, gain productivity. That’s already occurring to one degree or another in the energy field (“smart grid” comes to mind), and GE aims to accelerate that trend while cementing itself in a position of global leadership. Specifically, GE envisions the Industrial Internet as a seamlessly integrated network of “intelligent” machines, facilities vehicle fleets and shipping fleets combined with advanced analytics, which in the right hands (there’s always a catch, right?) could promote a better quality of life and improved working conditions. Or, as GE puts it: “The deeper meshing of the digital world with the world of machines holds the potential to bring about profound transformation to global industry, and in turn to many aspects of daily life, including the way many of us do our jobs.” GE’s Brilliant Wind Turbine That brings us to the 2.5-120 wind turbine (120 refers to the 120-meter rotor). The 2.5-120 is designed to achieve greater efficiency at low wind speed sites, enabling more regions to take advantage of local wind power. A taller tower (maximum hub height of 139 meters) is credited with some of the improvement, but that’s only part of it. The real meat is in the Industrial Internet, which the turbine harnesses through an advanced control system. In a conventional wind farm, units have to be stopped and restarted to smooth out energy generation spikes. GE’s software controls the output at each turbine, which in addition to achieving a more predictable stream of energy also helps to reduce maintenance, repair and replacement costs. Here’s the description by GE’s vice president for renewable energy Vic Abate: “Analyzing tens of thousands of data points every second, the 2.5-120 integrates energy storage and advanced forecasting algorithms while communicating seamlessly with neighboring turbines, service technicians and customers.” Wind Power on the Rise Concerns about the intermittent nature of wind are rapidly falling by the wayside as new energy storage solutions like the 2.5-120 come online. Among other options (such as compressed air and pumped hydro), advanced battery-based wind energy storage has already reached utility-scale proportions as demonstrated by the Notrees Windpower wind farm in Texas and the Auwahi wind farm in Hawaii. With the storage issue pretty much resolved, wind power has really taken off. In 2012 the U.S. wind industry installed more than 13 gigawatts of new capacity, accounting for 42 percent of total new U.S. energy capacity, more than any other resource including natural gas. And there’s plenty more where that came from… sDOTtt/1zfbR</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359747952417</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:45:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359749408913-31</Id><Title>Compliance with Missouri's Renewable Energy Standard</Title><Msg>Compliance with Missouri's Renewable Energy Standard Missouri utilities are blatantly disregarding the state’s renewable energy requirement. So Renew Missouri and our partners across the state have filed legal action to require compliance with the law. Add your voice with this petition! Image.. Read it History/Context: In 2008, two-thirds of Missouri voters demanded that investor-owned utilities increase their use of renewable energy. This was the highest passage margin of any statewide renewable energy initiative ever. Last year, utilities were required to demonstrate that 2% of their energy came from renewable sources. However, utilities have built virtually no new renewable energy; instead, they have sought to confuse the intent of the law through their influence in Jefferson City. How are they out of compliance? 1. Roll-Over Energy: Utilities claim they can comply by using "old renewable energy" created at a time when the law wasn’t even in effect. This is like trying to roll over cell phone minutes from a time before you even had the phone. 2. Old Hydro-Electric Plants: Utilities are trying to use large, century-old hydroelectric facilities, even though the law explicitly forbids the use of these large hydro facilities. 3. We Demand Power, Not Credits: The Missouri renewable energy law was passed to bring Missouri new, cleaner sources of energy and create jobs here at home. Instead, IOUs are wasting our money on “renewable credits” from far-away states that deliver no electricity to Missouri. This means that Missouri sees no new jobs and no change in how we get our energy, while out-of-state energy producers see larger profits. We need to invest in Missouri's economy and create local jobs! Missouri gets roughly 85% of our energy from Wyoming coal, sending $1.3 billion out of our state every year. If we instead invested in clean energy back home, we would keep some of that money in our local economies and create thousands of jobs, giving us cleaner air and healthier people in the process. Help us deliver 21st century jobs and clean energy to Missouri by signing on to this petition that asks the Public Service Commission to do THEIR job and FORCE utilities to follow the law.

It made up 42% of new power capacity additions in the US last year. Wind turbines and bicyclist in Denmark via Shutterstock But another huge wind power stat from Denmark is also worthy of a trumpet or two. Wind provided enough electricity for over 30% of Denmark’s electricity consumption by the end of 2012. That’s actually a much bigger deal than it may sound if you aren’t familiar with the nuances of this market sector. While the 42% of new capacity figure above is pretty impressive, that’s just new capacity, not total capacity. Furthermore, wind is more variable than conventional power options, so a lower percentage of its capacity is utilized throughout the year. Wind still accounts for just 3–4% of electricity production in the US, and the target is to hit 20% by 2030. So, with that context, I think you can see that Denmark’s figure is very impressive. Pull out your trumpet! And this isn’t the end of the line for Denmark. The Scandinavian country has actually set a goal to get 50% of its electricity needs from wind power by 2020 (it appears to be well on its way there), and is aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2050. “The share of 30% wind energy in the electricity consumption is an increase of approx. 2 percentage points compared to 2011. The increase is based on some 170 MW of new capacity built on land and more than 50 MW at sea. At sea, it comes from wind turbines connected to the Anholt Offshore Wind Farm and onshore some 20% comes from Kalundborg Municipality, where 36 MW were installed last year,” the Danish Wind Industry Association wrote on January 31, 2013 (thanks to one of our readers for passing along the information). “An increase of 2 percentage points may not sound as much, but it is in line with what we expect to reach the official target of 50% in 2020. We will see a slightly larger jump in 2013, when Anholt completed and there will again be some jumps when we connect the next big wind farms and near-shore turbines in 2017-2020,” says chief economist at the Danish Wind Industry Association, Sune Strøm. The Danish Wind Industry Association’s article on the news adds: “Anholt Offshore Wind Farm will be completed at the end of 2013 and by the time the park’s 400 MW will provide 4% of the Danish electricity consumption. In addition, the planning process has started for Horns Rev III of 400 MW, Krieger’s Flak of 600 MW and the near-shore turbines which will have a combined capacity of 500 MW, of which 50 MW will be test turbines.” [sic] The new data on wind’s share of electricity consumption come from the Danish Energy Agency’s wind register. sDOTtt/1zeM8</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359749904598</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 15:18:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359750416501-35</Id><Topic><Title>pinned @90.00</Title><Username>r42442</Username><Timestamp>1359740568530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:42:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At 3:26 PM 90 looks great. lol</Msg><Username>aeskylosa</Username><Timestamp>1359750416501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 15:26:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359754188025-36</Id><Topic><Title>★★★ GALE @ 1.68 ★★★★★ ANX @ .70 ★★★★★ APPY @ 2.11 ★★★★★ DARA @ 1.02 ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>clearwire_soonover325</Username><Timestamp>1359647821891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:57:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ellison Foundation companies.</Msg><Username>catamaran_outremer5x</Username><Timestamp>1359754188025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:29:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359757673442-37</Id><Topic><Title>★★★ GALE @ 1.68 ★★★★★ ANX @ .70 ★★★★★ APPY @ 2.11 ★★★★★ DARA @ 1.02 ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>clearwire_soonover325</Username><Timestamp>1359647821891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:57:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spam.</Msg><Username>ihategooks</Username><Timestamp>1359757673442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:27:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359757758365-38</Id><Topic><Title>XOM is too superior to skip right now.

At issue is a change in the production tax credit, which was extended for one year in January. Renewable energy projects, such as wind, biomass and geothermal, can now collect the incentive if the development begins construction this year. Previously, those projects needed to produce power by the end of the year. But the ambiguity of what constitutes “commenced construction” has kept developers waiting, 30 members of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition wrote to the IRS and Treasury Department. “As supporters of clean energy development and production, we believe it is critical to develop and maintain policies that move our country toward a clean energy future. Because the PTC (production tax credit) has been extended for one year only, it is imperative that you work to clarify the specific criteria that will define the commencement of construction as soon as possible,” the lawmakers wrote. Differing interpretations exist as to what qualifies as “commenced construction.” Some experts say developers need only invest 5 percent of the total project cost, while others contend physical construction must be underway. The wind industry and its congressional allies lobbied hard for the credit extension and the language change last Congress. Supporters worry that too much delay in determining what “commenced construction” means will blunt new installations for this year. The threat of the credit’s expiration helped drive a record amount of new wind generation capacity last year, the American Wind Energy Association said Wednesday. But that uncertainty also stunted investment for this year, as planned installations plummeted for 2013. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/280639-house-democrats-warn-tax-credit-ambiguity-sidelines-renewables-investment-</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359760935368</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 18:22:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359765406009-41</Id><Title>Obama faces angry liberals over pipeline</Title><Msg>Obama faces angry liberals over pipeline Posted on February 1, 2013 at 10:19 am by San Francisco Chronicle in Environment, Keystone XL, Politics and Policy Comments(1) Demonstrators hold up signs in front of the White House in Washington, Friday, Sept. 2, 2011, to protest the Keystone XL Pipeline project in the US, and the Tar Sands Development in Alberta Canada. (AP Photo/Luis M. Alvarez) By Joe Garofoli SAN FRANCISCO — As he begins his second term, President Obama is barreling toward what one Bay Area activist predicts could be “all out warfare” with environmentalists who want him to stop the Keystone XL Pipeline, the transcontinental conduit for tar sands fuel from Canada that many scientists say could expedite climate change. Obama’s political dilemma lies in the pipeline’s potential upside: The State Department projects that it could deliver 6,000 temporary jobs to the U.S., where 12.2 million people are unemployed. Bay Area liberals leading the Keystone opposition say Obama has only one choice. “If he doesn’t reject it,” said Piedmont attorney Guy Saperstein, a former Sierra Club Foundation president and prominent liberal donor, “then I think it should be all out warfare for the next four years.” Environmentalists are drawing a line in the tar sands with a series of high-profile demonstrations planned this month in Washington. The timing of the protests is crucial because sometime before April, Obama will receive the State Department’s recommendation on whether to green-light the 1,700-mile Canada-to-Texas pipeline, forcing him to make a decision he delayed during last year’s presidential campaign to avoid alienating his liberal base. Liberals who bided their time through four years of little action from the White House on climate change, and who bit their tongues during the 2012 campaign, expect payback. Civil disobedience Obama will feel heat from them in the nation’s capital, where the Sierra Club, based in San Francisco, plans to participate in civil disobedience for the first time in its history to call attention to the issue. Saperstein has contributed $50,000 toward the protests, which include a Feb. 17 demonstration on climate change that is expected to be the largest of its kind in U.S. history. The nonviolent civil disobedience, which will occur on an undisclosed date, will involve only a couple of dozen invited participants, organizers said. The nature of the action hasn’t been revealed. Among those participating will be Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, club board President Allison Chin, and Michael Kieschnick, the president and co-founder of Credo Mobile, the San Francisco cellular phone company that has given more than $75 million to progressive causes over a couple of decades. Using her clout This week, San Francisco resident Susie Tompkins Buell – the co-founder of the Esprit clothing company who has given more than $25 million to progressive causes over the past 10 years – wrote a letter to Obama, and to her vast political network, urging the president to take “bold action” on climate change. “We cannot betray (our children’s) future by confining ourselves to small, cautious steps,” Buell wrote. Buell, like many liberals, praised Obama for mentioning climate change more prominently than any other issue during his inaugural address last week. “We will respond to the threat of climate change,” Obama said in his Jan. 21 speech, “knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.” The president “made a big commitment and he’s got to live up to it,” Buell said in an interview. Saperstein is among the liberals who say that Obama’s rhetoric on climate change doesn’t match his record. In 2009, during his first inaugural address, Obama said, “With old friends and former foes, we’ll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.” But little happened. The House, controlled in Obama’s first two years by Democrats and led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, passed a climate measure that included a cap-and-trade system to control emissions. But it never got a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate. “Obama never pushed for it,” Saperstein said, expressing the frustration of many liberals. ‘Purest test’ Now, Obama has a chance to redeem himself to environmentalists. “This is the purest test Obama is ever going to face,” said Bill McKibben, a prominent environmentalist and writer who is helping organize the Feb. 17 demonstration as part of a climate-change awareness organization called 350.org. “He doesn’t have to ask John Boehner. He doesn’t have to ask Mitch McConnell. He just needs to do it.” Even with an unfriendly Congress, activists say, Obama could do more to protect the environment through executive and administrative actions. The Sierra Club’s Brune said Obama could instruct the Department of Energy to stop the approval of liquid natural gas export terminals. Brune said approving those terminals “would intensify fracking (hydraulic fracturing) across the country and intensify greenhouse gases across the country.” “This is among the first biggest tests of (Obama’s) commitment to climate change and his willingness to stand up to the oil industry and their toadies in Congress,” Brune said. Brune said his organization’s credibility was not compromised after Time magazine reported last year that the Sierra Club accepted $25 million from the gas industry to help fund its “Beyond Coal” campaign from 2007 to 2010. “We realized that was a mistake,” Brune said. “You can’t accept funds from industries that need to be reformed.” Now the organization wants Obama to stand up to the oil and gas industry. “The president has not fully put his muscle behind the effort to combat climate change,” Brune said. “That’s what needs to change more than anything else.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/01/obama-faces-angry-liberals-over-pipeline/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359765406009</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:36:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359766505814-42</Id><Title>★★★★★I say "BULLSHEET" to, employment, earnings, numbers, &amp; Bernanke SELL</Title><Msg>asap</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1359766505814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:55:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359766723167-43</Id><Title>WAHLEE WAS DEPORTED!</Title><Msg>I found out wahleee was deported, back to his country.

Batteries are miniature toxic chemical plants with a high carbon footprint, limited life and disposal problems and hydro and compressed air are impossible to use or not to be found in the vast majority of places. When the wind does not blow, (50%) of the time you need fossil fuel backup and the best turbines are about 30% efficient and require substantial maintenance. In short, without your tax dollars propping up the turbine installations they would not be viable at all just like ethanol, electric cars and all the other rubbish the politically connected lobbyists for the largest corporations push at us so they can make money on YOU!
