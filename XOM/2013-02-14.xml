Obama and fellow Democrats for years have targeted oil and gas tax breaks, a move that Republicans and some Democrats from oil-producing states fiercely oppose. The measure focuses on provisions such as immediate expensing for drilling costs and the use of a tax break for manufacturing. A bill to end these benefits died in the Democratic-controlled Senate last year, with four Democrats voting to block it. This year's plan is unlikely to move forward in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Sponsored by Senate Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey and with more than a dozen co-sponsors, the bill would curb breaks used by the "big five" oil companies: Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Ending the breaks would raise $24 billion over a decade to help reduce the federal deficit, its backers say. Some Democrats want to use money to stave off $85 billion in automatic spending cuts set to kick in on March 1. "The industry is often thrown out there as a short-term revenue grab," Brian Johnson, a tax adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, said this week. "You will get revenue in the short-term. But the long-term economic consequences are a dramatic loss of revenue from our industry." reutersDOTcom/article/2013/02/13/us-usa-taxes-oil-idUSBRE91C1I620130213</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360854092934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:01:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360854536326-14</Id><Topic><Title>Big Oil Poised to Post Surging Profits This Earnings Season</Title><Username>roxieaskeyhwykapjj6837</Username><Timestamp>1303486983000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-04-22 11:43:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the site</Msg><Username>nancyrobert76</Username><Timestamp>1360854536326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:08:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360855058349-15</Id><Topic><Title>EDISON SEEKING ENERGY STORAGE TO MEET CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENT</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360816921190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 23:42:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Duke Energy Renewables completes Notrees Battery Storage Project in Texas M2 Communications ENP Newswire - 25 January 2013 Release date- 24012013 - CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Duke Energy Renewables, part of Duke Energy's Commercial Businesses announced today the completion of its 36-megawatt energy storage and power management system at its Notrees Windpower Project in west Texas.

The politicians were even more optimistic and they too were wrong. The reason is high oil prices. The high oil prices undermine the ability of low income people to repay the debt they should never have been allowed to run up to begin with. Monetary policy aimed at increasing asset prices through low interest rates increases oil prices as well and creates a vicious cycle of defaults and expectations of still more defaults as interest rates are pushed down. The money being lent out on mortgages (with high net worth individuals' money mostly) is best used by high net worth people to buy real estate directly, abolishing the financial intermediaries' role and the problems caused by things such as high oil prices. This will happen as the low income people default one after the other and their properties move into the hands of high income people. Communities will come to look much nicer too as properties are properly managed and maintained... Estate agents can easily be used to manage large portfolios of real estate efficiently too. Their ranks will grow as property is progressively bought up and rented out... I plan to have 66.67% of my net worth in real estate by summer. It takes time to inspect properties and close deals.

There are also other important issues with new nuclear; such as the unresolved issue of nuclear waste, and its dependence on further subsidies, which will be illegal under European Union rules. Investors have been steadily dropping out of plans. The British utility company Centrica is just the latest to pull out of the program. This week it wrote off £200 million ($315 million) while doing so, following on the heels of previously involved German utilities. In order for the program to still go forward, the government would need to break “two important electoral pledges and may face legal challenges that it intends to breach European Union subsidy rules in guaranteeing a minimum price for nuclear power,” Climate Central writes. Construction delays and rising costs seem to be an issue with new nuclear everywhere in the world, not just the UK. The French nuclear industry, arguably the strongest in the world, has been facing numerous delays in the development and construction of its new power plants, and rapidly rising costs. “Centrica’s chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, said the company had pulled out because the project was more costly and extended further into the future than had been planned four years ago. Together with its partner, the French government-owned EDF, Centrica has spent close to £1 billion ($1.5B) on the project and is now writing off its 20 percent share of £200 million ($315M), concentrating instead on renewables and natural gas for electricity generation.” Essentially, renewable clean energy technologies are a better choice than nuclear in every way. They are cheaper, faster to build, don’t create radioactive waste, aren’t as susceptible to environmental disasters, don’t require the same level of safety measures, and have far more public support. At current rates of growth, renewables are predicted to generate more electricity in the UK than nuclear by 2018, and expected to power 1 in every 10 homes in the UK by 2015. And the issue of nuclear waste is still very much a problem in the UK. Just last week, the Cumbria County Council rejected the government’s plans to dump the nation’s nuclear waste in the Lake District. And with no alternative locations put forward yet, the government still doesn’t know what to do with its growing nuclear waste. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee just released a new report on Monday detailing (and highly critical of) the rising costs of dealing with such waste.

FEB 12 2013, 9:27 AM ET 46 First the gold rush. Then the slowdown. Reuters "The luckiest place on earth" is how Chip Brown characterized today's North Dakota, flush in its energy frenzy. His article in the New York Times Magazine showed chief execs and miners both giddy about their topographical luck and only slightly nervous that this boom would end as the last ones have -- in a bust. To borrow a line you'll hear tonight, let me be clear: North Dakota is not busting. It led the 2012 national job creation index -- with both the highest hiring rate and the lowest firing rate of any state in the country, for the fourth straight year. Here are the top five states for hiring, according to that Gallup poll, with their indexed 2012 growth from BLS figures. This chart tells two stories about America's little petro state. First story: At the beginning of 2012 (much like in 2011 and 2010), North Dakota's stratospheric job creation numbers made even the next frothiest states look like they're were suffering a post-Soviet-breakup depression. Second story: Something happened in the second half of 2012. North Dakota's economy fell back to earth. Let's dig deeper. Here's the graph of 2011 job creation across North Dakota industries versus the last six months of 2012. You might say, don't be unfair, North Dakota never could have kept up its 2011 rate!, and I might respond, you're right. If the U.S. had experienced Dakotan growth across 2011, we would have added about 400,000 jobs per month, and that's just absurd. Still. The drop-off is striking, and it's not without explanation. Let's begin at the left, with mining. The rig count across North Dakota, and particularly in the rich Bakken shale, dropped sharply in September and hiring has slowed since the summer, as drilling companies have turned their focus to efficiency as capital costs (and concerns of regulation) rise in the Bakken. That's probably had spill-over effects in transportation hiring. The story in construction is a story about migration. The state's population grew by four percent according to Census figures between mid-2010 and mid-2012. That would be like the entire U.S. adding an extra Pennsylvania in two years. As a result, new houses blossomed in the late 2011 and 2012, but that ridiculous bump (see below) has returned to trend-line growth, which has slowed down construction hires. The only large private sector category that is growing faster now than in 2011 is hotel and food services jobs, at the far right of the second graph. These jobs are lagging indicators of population growth because they respond to growing cities. This is how an energy boom should go, you could argue. First come the core mining jobs and manufacturing jobs. Then you build the houses and roads to accommodate the miners and factory workers. Then you open restaurants to feed their families. And you build hotels to room their visitors and petro-tourists. That's not a bust story. It's a modern growth story. Okay, fine. Perhaps that's all the North Dakota slowdown is. Chapter Two in North Dakota's modern gold rush. The state's job creation isn't weak, after all, it's just, well, average. But that's just the problem. When you're girded for a historic gold rush, average growth isn't average news. It's bad news. theatlanticDOTcom/business/archive/2013/02/is-north-dakotas-miraculous-boom-already-over/273072/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360864901777</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:01:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360865462577-25</Id><Topic><Title>Gigantic Update for XOM. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>williebryant105</Username><Timestamp>1360844747316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:25:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>amazing stuff</Msg><Username>thomasclarence24</Username><Timestamp>1360865462577</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:11:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360865906949-26</Id><Title>Obama’s clean-energy fund seen gaining if oil drilling expanded</Title><Msg>Obama’s clean-energy fund seen gaining if oil drilling expanded Posted on February 14, 2013 at 7:07 am by Bloomberg in Oil, Politics and Policy President Barack Obama’s proposal to fund clean-energy research with fees paid by oil and gas producers is renewing a debate over whether the promise of innovation tomorrow is worth expanding drilling today. Obama’s “Energy Security Trust” — which he announced this week in the State of the Union address — would redirect about $200 million in royalties for drilling on federal lands to pay for the development of biofuels, electric batteries and cars and trucks powered by natural gas, the White House said yesterday. The trust would operate for 10 years and spend a total of $2 billion. While Obama’s plan doesn’t open new areas to producers, clean-energy advocates say the idea of an oil-backed fund could ensure further support for fossil fuel alternatives even in an era of austerity and federal budget cuts. “There is a lot of logic to it,” said Mark Muro, a clean- energy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It resonates to a broad segment of the population that we should make the best of fossil fuels while accelerating the effort to transform our energy system.” ...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360865906949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:18:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360866158647-27</Id><Title>❤❤❤FIRST Hedgie/Broker/Bank to SELLOFF ALL stocks WINS this game !!</Title><Msg>really</Msg><Username>purple_man91</Username><Timestamp>1360866158647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:22:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360866284954-28</Id><Title>Federal energy regulators give no timeline on natgas rules</Title><Msg>Federal energy regulators give no timeline on natgas rules By Jeanine Prezioso NEW YORK | Wed Feb 13, 2013 4:15pm EST Feb 13 (Reuters) - Federal energy regulators said on Wednesday they had no time frame for when they may finalize new rules requiring natural gas companies to report market-specific physical gas transactions in a bid to tighten regulations and clamp down on market manipulation. In November, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sent out a notice of inquiry to wholesale natural gas market participants to gauge whether gathering detailed next-day and next-month transactions and reporting the data quarterly would be useful in promoting market transparency. The comment period ended on Tuesday. The changes would be made under the Natural Gas Act. The FERC is gathering information and reading through the comments it has received, a FERC spokeswoman said. "The commission doesn't give time lines on these types of things," she said. Dozens of energy companies, trading firms and trade associations expressed concerns about the proposed changes, and many outright disagreed with the premise that quarterly reporting of data would bring about more market transparency. "The quarterly transaction reporting requirements under consideration are neither necessary nor appropriate, will be unduly burdensome, and will harm natural gas markets," said Shell Energy North America in comments filed on Tuesday. The data that FERC is considering requiring market participants to report includes company name and address, how a trade was executed (on or off an exchange), name of any broker used, volume of gas traded, price, name of the counterparty and the names of any Index to which each transaction was reported. Eight natural-gas related trade associations jointly filed a comment to FERC on Tuesday saying that new requirements would harm, not improve transparency. In a letter to FERC on Feb. 1, the U.S. Department of Justice expressed concern that if such information made its way into the public domain, it may cause collusion among the companies who set the price of natural gas. "In particular, public disclosure of firm- or transaction-specific information may reduce competition by facilitating coordination among suppliers that can increase prices, thereby harming consumers," the Justice Department said. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/02/13/ferc-natgas-rules-idUSL1N0BDBMT20130213</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360866284954</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:24:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360870982356-29</Id><Title>Senate Dems unveil $110 billion sequester-replacement package</Title><Msg>Senate Dems unveil $110 billion sequester-replacement package By Alexander Bolton and Erik Wasson - 02/14/13 01:51 PM ET Senate Democratic leaders unveiled a $110 billion sequester-replacement bill at a closed-door caucus meeting Thursday that would replace $85 billion in automatic spending cuts set to hit March 1. The Senate Democratic package is split evenly between spending cuts and provisions raising new tax revenues, according to a Democratic source. It would raise nearly $55 billion in taxes by implementing the Buffett Rule, setting a minimum effective tax rate for wealthy individuals and families. It would raise additional revenues by changing the tax treatment of oil extraction from tar sands. The $55 billion in spending cuts are evenly divided between defense and non-defense programs. It would save $27.5 billion by eliminating agricultural subsidies and another $27.5 billion though defense cuts. If passed, the package would stop the sequester through the end of 2013. It would cost $85 billion to halt the automatic cuts through the end of the fiscal year, which ends in October. The bill would appear to have little chance of reaching President Obama’s desk, however, given opposition from House and Senate Republicans to increasing any taxes to replace the sequester. Opposition in the Senate also came Thursday from liberals, who said it should have been tilted more to tax hikes. Liberals voiced concern about the 1-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax revenues in the package. By their estimation, Congress has already cut $1.7 trillion in spending and raised taxes by $700 billion since 2010, they note. “We’ve let it be really lopsided,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). “I’m going to support a more balanced approach than what we have now.” Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) worked with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to craft the package. They presented it to Democratic colleagues at a Thursday lunch. Walking into the meeting, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said he and other liberals would instead propose raising $157 billion in new revenues through changes to the tax code to pay for the sequester. He said the liberal counteroffer would reform tax breaks for private jets, S corporations and foreign subsidiaries. Democratic aides predicted there would not be a large number of defections, however. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who has co-sponsored legislation to raise tax revenues by ending an array of niche tax breaks, said he would vote for Reid’s sequester package even though no parts of his bill were included. And another Senate liberal, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), indicated her support. “I would prefer doing all tax loophole closing, but I can do this,” Boxer said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/on-the-money/budget/283209-senate-dems-unveil-110b-sequester-replacement-bill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360870982356</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:43:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360873772426-30</Id><Title>GREEDINESSS MADE ME LOOOK STUPIDDD!!!</Title><Msg>DID NOT SELL APPLE @700</Msg><Username>mlg4044</Username><Timestamp>1360873772426</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:29:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360874064970-31</Id><Title>Senators propose long-shot carbon tax bill for big polluters</Title><Msg>Senators propose long-shot carbon tax bill for big polluters WASHINGTON | Thu Feb 14, 2013 1:55pm EST (Reuters) - Two of the most liberal senators on Thursday proposed a bill to tax carbon emissions, raising up to $1.2 trillion in revenue over 10 years that would largely be returned consumers. Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California, attempted to seize on the momentum from Tuesday's State of the Union speech when President Barack Obama expressed support for efforts to battle climate change. "We have the opportunity right now, with the president's commitment in the State of the Union to make major progress," Sanders said at a press conference Thursday. The bill would set a goal to slash heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 - in line with the Obama administration's long-term emission reduction target. It would set a $20 tax for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent a polluter would emit beyond a set limit, which would rise 5.6 percent annually over a 10-year period. Boxer, chairwoman of the Senate environment and public works panel, had drafted several bills in the past to make polluters pay for their carbon emissions. Earlier versions focused on setting up carbon cap-and-trade systems rather than imposing taxes. Boxer said she planned to bring the bill to her committee for a vote in the spring with the aim of bringing it to the Senate floor for debate in the summer. It is expected to face stiff competition, especially from House Republicans, who as a rule are wary of measures that could increase energy prices. The tax would target upstream emissions from 2,869 of the country's largest emitters, such as coal mines, oil refineries and natural gas processing points, or 85 percent of the economy. But it does not target power plants, which would continue to be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The tax would also apply to foreign companies who export their fuels to the United States if their home countries do not have equivalent carbon measures. Unlike other carbon tax proposals, the Sanders-Boxer measure would return 60 percent of collected revenues to consumers instead of filling government coffers. In doing so it would take a cue from a program in Alaska that provides a monthly dividend payment to residents from oil revenues. Other money generated by the tax would be used to invest in energy efficiency and cleaner technologies, such as weatherizing U.S. homes, tripling the current energy research at the U.S. Department of Energy and seeding a fund that would encourage public-private partnerships to develop renewable energy. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/02/14/us-usa-climate-legislation-idUSBRE91D1BX20130214</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360874064970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:34:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360875128277-32</Id><Topic><Title>Senators propose long-shot carbon tax bill for big polluters</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360874064970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:34:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the Republicans fail to negotiate on a carbon tax, President Obama will likely use executive orders.</Msg><Username>moooooooooooooooooooooooo4u</Username><Timestamp>1360875128277</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:52:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360881307805-33</Id><Topic><Title>When Nat Gas hits $4</Title><Username>no1matemary</Username><Timestamp>1360860513478</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:48:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes imagine that is true with the XTO acquisition but question is when will gas hit $4 might be awhile now?</Msg><Username>golf_tennisfootball</Username><Timestamp>1360881307805</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:35:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360899512097-34</Id><Title>Republicans Love War Profits, Hate Soldiers</Title><Msg>All they want to do is fleece the treasury as they refuse to allow an actual war hero a cabinet post.
