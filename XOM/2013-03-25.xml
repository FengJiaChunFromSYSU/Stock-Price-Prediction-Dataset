The speculator community learned they will not get bailed out as they have been before - their losses could be as high as 40% in the banks of Cyprus, which is good. Also all the useless employees of one bank will be fired - excellent. If Cyprus had been under Bernanke's jurisdiction he would certainly have bailed it out, borrowing whatever he needed to from someone, which is the way the US government runs its entire economy. The US embraces "casino economy" economics. The French have obviously realized that there is only one way: the way of discipline. For most of their history they were that way anyway, so it is not a big change. Germany's economic leaders are not influenced by the pernicious forces that influence American/British ones. Such influences went away quite some time ago. Things will turn out badly for America thanks to its poor policies, but Europe will be there for it. It is going to need much reconstruction at some point...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364220494560</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364220633389-9</Id><Topic><Title>higher dividends?</Title><Username>hrant4005</Username><Timestamp>1364087805846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From what I read in the business sites and the newspapers, XOM is due for a hefty dividend increase.This move could increase this stocks value many fold and end the current sluggishness.The management can do both- play with the buyback and still raise the dividend adequately.</Msg><Username>aeskylosa</Username><Timestamp>1364220633389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:10:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364220942943-10</Id><Topic><Title>Perhaps Cyprus can phone Obama....</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363863825773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 07:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We cannot bail out Cyprus at this time.

The USA will get to carry almost the entire burden too when it finally comes. Great Britain is almost bankrupt, having followed the idiotic policy of the Federal Reserve, only there its twice as much, and the result is twice as bad. The German army has sent a small force of 400 troops and a patriot missile team to Turkey, but the German soldiers have been treated poorly. When a Turkish officer insulted a German policewoman directing traffic, there as nearly an international incident. The German press was not amused. I doubt France has much to offer... Germany owns very little US Treasury debt, preferring gold, which it is moving to Germany presently. The Chinese and Japanese are your big bankers, having loaned you trillions between them, so maybe they can provide some support... The Chinese do love oil, so many they can be induced.

The forces of the Ottoman Empire were besieging Vienna. It took all summer to marshal the forces for the counter-strike. About 20,000 cavalry were provided by German nobles "Junkers" ruling Poland and Saxony, the Teutonic Knights of the Baltic, and the forces of the Western German nobles of Bavaria. They swept in down the Kahlenberg hill into the Ottoman flank the morning of September 12, 1683 in a surprise attack. A rough reenactment can be seen in J.R.R. Tolkien's Two Towers, in the lifting of the siege (Tolkien's book is full of Germanic themes from end to end) The Ottoman army collapsed, and its Sultan fled east leaving his harem of thousands of women, and mountains of coffee and camp followers to be taken as plunder. The coffee houses of Vienna owe their foundation to the stores of coffee plundered from the Ottomans. The Austrians then then set up a military frontier over the ensuing decades which they pushed east. The garrison towns were thoroughly Germanized. The sons of the local population were taught to speak German, and tutored in German methods of discipline by the Austrians. In time the Ottomans forget any plans they had for controlling the Eastern Europe. By World War I they were a German ally.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364227700252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:08:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364229819168-16</Id><Topic><Title>The last time Germany went to war against a Muslim power...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364227700252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:08:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The last time Germany went to war against a Muslim power? Gretel, you are at war with the Muslim right now. There places in Germany where the police refuse to go, because of Muslim violence. Each year it gets worst, I believe over the last five years Muslim violence has increased over 50%. You need to get your head out of the past and look to see what's going on around you right now.

The Turkish population of Germany is about 2.5% of the total. Many of them are poor and some are violent. However, if you live in Germany for long you will discover you will pay high taxes on everything you buy. People who are poor, lazy, or just refuse to assimilate get ground down under the weight of the German tax machine. I've got so much income the consumption taxes mean nothing to me, indeed I profit from then in rental income coming from people working for the government or subsidized by it. People arrested for crimes in Germany do not have the pleasure of trail by jury either. There will be no difficulty grinding any minority culture to pieces, and making Germans out of it over time. As for going to war against Muslim countries....
