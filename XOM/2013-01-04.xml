A TWO-PRONGED STRATEGY When it comes to American energy consumption, what are the biggest issues on the minds of the U.S. government, businesses and the general public? Clearly, one of these is finding ways to use less petroleum-based fuel, in order to reduce energy costs and decrease dependence on foreign oil. Another is to reduce emissions, including carbon, from vehicles that consume diesel fuel and gasoline. Through extensive hardware and software development, and Detroit automotive engineering ingenuity, American Power Group (APGI.OB) has created cost effective systems enabling it to address all of these issues for most large diesel engines produced in the past two decades. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We have all read articles indicating the abundance of natural gas in the U.S., which has transformed the global energy landscape. American Power Group Corporation ("APG") based in Algona, Iowa, has patented dual fuel conversion technology, which enables diesel fuel users to take advantage of the disparity between diesel fuel costs and lower natural gas prices. The company is currently focused on two primary application areas: the first applies to a potential $5 billion market for heavy-duty truck engines, with a particular focus on the long-haul Class 8 "semi" truck market. These are diesel turbocharged trucks that are compression ignition based, not spark based. There is the potential for penetration into the mid-sized diesel trucks down the road. The second area addresses a smaller yet also very profitable market: stationary power generation. This includes primary and standby power generators, oil and gas drilling rig diesel engines (1500-2000 HP) as well as high pressure diesel pumps for oil and gas hydraulic fracturing (fracking) rigs (2000-2500 HP). In each case, the company's "Dual Fuel Turbocharged Natural Gas™ System" allows the aftermarket diesel engine to displace a large percentage of diesel fuel with natural gas without making any modifications to the componentry or fuel injectors of the existing engine. Instead, the system is a non-invasive retrofit upgrade that uses digital electronics and 3D natural gas engine software mapping from Detroit to meet the EPA's new safety and environmental conversion requirements. APG's main product lines have undergone extensive testing and subsequent emission approval by the EPA for heavy-duty trucks as well as drilling rigs. As of this writing, the company has received EPA approvals on 88 different truck engine families and anticipates many more over the next several months. APG is on the front end of a major paradigm shift by utilizing natural gas with diesel fuel in a non-invasive way to solve a wide range of government and consumer concerns. Given the abundance of natural gas due to recent shale gas discoveries throughout North America and the advent of "fracking" technology, which allows economic access to that gas, the price of natural gas has declined substantially. U.S. natural gas production is up 28% between 2005 and 2011, according to U.S. government figures, and this is expected to be just the beginning of a massive increase in domestic gas production. In April of this year, by way of a flight to Minneapolis and a 2.5 hour drive southwest in a rental car, I, along with a now current member of the company's Board of Directors, arrived at the company's headquarters in Algona, Iowa, to meet with management and see a live demonstration of the technology in action. While riding in the passenger's side of a truck with the APG system installed, it was self-evident that there is a paradigm shift going on in the industry: in real time, I could see the ratio of natural gas to diesel increase along with the miles per gallon improvement over using diesel fuel alone. The proprietary technology seamlessly displaces up to 80% of the normal diesel fuel consumption with the average displacement of diesel gas ranging from 40% to 65%. The energized fuel balance is maintained with a proprietary read-only electronic controller system, ensuring the engines operate at original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) specified temperatures and pressures. Installation on a wide variety of engine models and end-market applications require no engine modifications, unlike the more expensive and invasive systems in the market, which require modifying the engine block with high-temperature parts and designing custom high-pressure natural gas fuel injectors. The key breakthrough is that this non-invasive system allows existing diesel truck engines to run either on both diesel fuel and natural gas simultaneously but still have the flexibility to return seamlessly to run only on diesel fuel if needed. APG's system does not change the OEM engine, and as important, this APG system can be removed and re-flashed to be used on another approved engine family. APG has a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons: It is one of the least costly solutions in the marketplace, with a relatively short breakeven period. Because APG's system does not modify the existing engine structure, the engine can switch to 100% diesel gas when natural gas is unavailable. APG's conversion system does not increase maintenance costs. Unlike its competitors, APG's solution does not require costly, high pressure fuel injectors. Because the company's solution: [I] replaces less than 80% of the diesel gas used; [ii] does not use high-pressure fuel injectors; and [III] has a proprietary software platform that monitors the amount of natural gas introduced into the engine, the engine operates within OEM guidelines. Competitors' conversion systems run outside of OEM guidelines, which means that the engines run hotter and therefore require additional maintenance, special high-temp parts and high-temp oil. APG has first-mover advantage, with 88 out of 200 approvals in the OUL (Outside Useful Life) market, comprising heavy-duty trucks older than two years and greater than 435,000 miles. The company expects to be the first company to have approval in the Intermediate IUL (Inside Useful Life) market, which is made up of heavy-duty trucks with engines at least two model years old but with less than 435,000 miles. APG's non-invasive system can be removed from the engine at any time (for example at the engine's end of life) and reused on another engine. The company is very far along in its testing and EPA approvals, which is a major competitive advantage as well as a barrier to entry. KEY STRATEGIC VALIDATION IN THE MARKETPLACE On November 28, APG and Wheel Time Network LLC ("Wheel Time") announced a joint venture (pdf). Wheel Time is a multi-billion dollar organization with high quality installation network made up of 18 member groups, which provide installation and warranty support via 200 centers throughout North America. With over 3,000 factory-trained technicians, 2800 service bays, and 30 training centers, Wheel Time is an optimal joint-venture partner for APG to execute on its long-term business plan. Why is this announcement significant? First, it is a true independent, third-party validation of APG's dual fuel system, as Wheel Time did its own extensive due diligence and concluded that this is the superior product in the marketplace - now and for the foreseeable future. Wheel Time also received warrants to purchase shares in APG. It is interesting that a large, private company would ask for warrants in order to strike a deal to market a company's product, and I view it is a major endorsement with respect to the potential upside of APG. Second, Wheel Time is a leader in the industry, and it allows APG to "scale" immediately without spending significant amounts of time and capital outlays to build out its own installation network. Third, it confirms the importance of natural gas for truck fleets as an alternative (and complement) to diesel fuel in a low risk, cost-effective way.</Msg><Username>tom995</Username><Timestamp>1357299621969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 06:40:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357304517913-2</Id><Topic><Title>Substantial Advancement for XOM. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>glen.goudreau</Username><Timestamp>1357303077277</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 07:37:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looking good</Msg><Username>demaiob</Username><Timestamp>1357304517913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:01:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357306122859-3</Id><Topic><Title>More Dem hypocrisy</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1357257961790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Same ol, same ol Democrats. How anyone not taking govt handouts can support them is incredible." 1. Treasury bond holders and investors in dollars like the dollar to rise not fall. The only reason the dollar has any value is taxes and the power of the US government to collect more taxes. Ideologies that do not believe in taxes and government are not very useful to financiers and serious investors. 2. Collectivism goes hand in hand with economic growth. You equate speculation and personal aggrandizement with economic growth so naturally there is some difficulty grasping the concept. Collectivism does not mean communism either. You are no doubt too ignorant of the past to even attempt a proof, aside from wild ideological ranting. All the same, facts are facts and the force of history is on the Democrats side. 3. Minimalist government attitudes go hand in hand with speculation, societal and cultural decay, and economic failure. That is why the Republicans have lost and will continue to lose. They were not always this way but they certainly are now. Such groups come to power occasionally and wreck havoc, and then disappear as people get tired of the failure and declining living standards they cause. This pack of fools should be gone in 2 years time, and then many more avenues of investment and growth will open up. Simplistic views suit you best of course...Everyone is on the take... Much the attitude of the speculator...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357306122859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:28:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357306861177-4</Id><Topic><Title>For Full time posters!</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1357265635718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 21:13:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It probably took you all day to think up that barely literate line and write it too...sad</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357306861177</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:41:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357307323886-5</Id><Title>China Share Of Electricity From “Clean Energy” Increases To 20.2%</Title><Msg>China Share Of Electricity From “Clean Energy” Increases To 20.2% January 4, 2013 Zachary Shahan China’s Xinhua recently announced that the nation’s share of electricity coming from “clean energy” has increased to 20.2%, 3.3% more than at the same time last year. As you may well know, “clean energy,” according to China, includes nuclear and large-scale hydropower. Wind turbines in China In the first 11 months of 2012, the China State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) reports that there was 20.3% increase in electricity generated from clean energy sources (compared to 2011)… resulting in, coincidentally, the 20.2% figure noted above. Climate Connect writes: “In the first eleven months of 2012, 877 billion kWh of electricity was generated from non-fossil based sources. Country’s clean energy power generation was 74.8 billion kWh in November; but a decrease in clean energy generation as compared to October, 2012.” During these 11 months, hydropower grew by 19.4%, nuclear power grew by 22.9% and wind power grew by 54.2%. Clean Energy? “Clean energy” is a rather nebulous term, as I note over on our Clean Energy page. For those who support nuclear power and don’t think nuclear waste is anything to worry about, nuclear is include. As I note on the page above, until it’s clear we can really find a way to get rid of highly radioactive nuclear waste, we hear at CleanTechnica don’t consider nuclear to be clean. Beyond the nuclear issue, large-scale hydropower has been shown to have horrible effects on ecosystems, human populations, and even global warming in some cases. So, in summary, some hydropower certainly deserves to be callen clean, while some projects should actually be filed under the dirty column. From what I’ve read (though, admittedly, I haven’t read a ton on this subject), China’s hydropower projects shouldn’t be trumpeted as clean energy. If you have more info on this subject, though, please share it with us. China’s Future China recently increased its 2015 solar power capacity target to 40 GW (40,000 MW). Less than two years ago, the same 2015 target was just 5 GW — it has increased 8 times over in just about 19 months. The country also plans strong wind power growth. Furthermore, China is putting a cap on its coal production and use in 2015, and it has scaled back its nuclear power plans. So, while its emissions aren’t going to decrease anytime soon, it is putting a lot into clean energy, and the long-term goal seems to be cleaning up its electricity production. Also, I think the country’s leaders are well aware of its growing drought, flooding, and other extreme weather concerns, as well as the fact that these threats only grow in size with coal-fueled global warming. If you have any thoughts on this recent news, or China’s electricity production and goals, in general, feel free to chime in below! sDOTtt/1xXKu</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357307323886</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:48:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357307677678-6</Id><Title>Shell Kulluk Ship Investigation Called For By House Democrats</Title><Msg>Shell Kulluk Ship Investigation Called For By House Democrats By DAN JOLING 01/03/13 08:54 PM ET EST ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Calls for federal scrutiny of Royal Dutch Shell PLC drilling operations in Arctic waters swelled Thursday with a request for a formal investigation by members of Congress. The House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition called on the Interior Department and the Coast Guard to jointly investigate the New Year's Eve grounding of the Shell drilling vessel Kulluk on a remote Gulf of Alaska island, and a previous incident connected to Arctic offshore drilling operations in 2012. The coalition is made up of 45 House Democrats. "The recent grounding of Shell's Kulluk oil rig amplifies the risks of drilling in the Arctic," they said in a joint statement. "This is the latest in a series of alarming blunders, including the near-grounding of another of Shell's Arctic drilling rigs, the 47-year-old Noble Discoverer, in Dutch Harbor and the failure of its blowout containment dome, the Arctic Challenger, in lake-like conditions." The coalition believes these "serious incidents" warrant thorough investigation, the statement said. Shell Alaska spokesman Curtis Smith said in an email that the company is in full support of, and is providing resources for, the investigation of the grounding by the Unified Incident Command, made up of federal, state and company representatives. Smith said the findings will be available to the public. Shell incident commander Sean Churchfield said at an Anchorage news conference later Thursday that two more salvage crews had boarded the vessel and found damage to emergency and service generators, and to the Kulluk's upper deck. The vessel is upright and stable, and the Coast Guard has said there is no indication of a fuel leak. "Findings include some wave damage to the top sides of the vessel, and a number of watertight hatches have been breached, causing water damage inside," Churchfield said. The team has secured some of the open hatches, he said. Damage to the generators means salvagers may have to bring external generators on board or work without power, Churchfield said. He confirmed salvagers heard "breathing" from a vent but said they couldn't immediately determine whether it was a breech or natural venting. Salvage is in the assessment stage, Churchfield noted, and options are being developed. He wouldn't speculate on whether the Kulluk is seaworthy or when it might be moved. An emergency towing system was deposited on deck, and spill response equipment has been staged. "I want to reiterate there is no limitation on resources, personnel or equipment being deployed as part of the response and recovery activities," Churchfield said. Coast Guard Capt. Paul Mehler said the top concern remains the safety of responders working in what continues to be hazardous flying and marine conditions. The Kulluk is a non-propelled, 266-foot diameter barge with a reinforced funnel-shaped hull designed to operate in ice. It is carrying more than 140,000 gallons of diesel and about 12,000 gallons of lube oil and hydraulic fluid. Centered on the vessel is a 160-foot derrick. It drilled during the short open-water season in the Beaufort Sea. A 360-foot anchor handler, the Aiviq, was towing the Kulluk from Dutch Harbor to Seattle last week for maintenance and upgrades when the tow line snapped south of Kodiak. Lines were reattached at least four times but could not be maintained. A lone tugboat still attached Monday night in a vicious storm couldn't control the vessel and cut it loose as it neared land. After the grounding, critics quickly asserted it has foreshadowed what will happen north of the Bering Strait if drilling is allowed. Environmentalists for years have said conditions are too harsh and the stakes too high to allow industrial development in the Arctic, where drilling sites are 1,000 miles or more from the closest Coast Guard base. Two national organizations kept up the drumbeat Thursday by calling for a halt to all permitting for Arctic offshore drilling in the wake of the grounding. "This string of mishaps by Shell makes it crystal clear that we are not ready to drill in the Arctic," said Chuck Clusen of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Shell is not Arctic-ready. We have lost all faith in Shell, and they certainly don't have any credibility left." Lois Epstein, a civil engineer who works for The Wilderness Society in Anchorage, said Shell has made troubling, non-precautionary decisions that put workers and the Coast Guard at risk. "These ongoing technical and decision-making problems and their enormous associated costs and risks taken by our military personnel once there were problems should lead the federal government to reassess its previous permitting decisions regarding Shell," Epstein said. In the short term, she said, damage to the Kulluk may prevent it from being ready for the 2013 open water season. Besides drilling in the Beaufort, the barge was supposed to be on hand for drilling a relief well if Shell's drill vessel in the Chukchi Sea, the Noble Discoverer, experienced a wellhead blowout and was damaged, Epstein said. Shell has maintained it has taken a heads-up approach to anticipating and reacting to problems. Shell Alaska spokesman Smith said Wednesday the Kulluk had been towed more than 4,000 miles and had previously experienced similar storm conditions. Shell staged additional towing vessels along the route in case there were problems, he said. "We know how to work in regions like this," Smith said. "Having said that, when flawless execution does not happen, you learn from it, and we will." huffingtonpostDOTcom/2013/01/03/shell-kulluk-ship-investigation_n_2404904.html?utm_hp_ref=energy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357307677678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:54:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357308380583-7</Id><Title>Duke Energy starts three power plants in North Carolina, US</Title><Msg>Duke Energy starts three power plants in North Carolina, US EBR Staff Writer Published 04 January 2013 US-based Duke Energy announced that three new power plants have begun serving North Carolina customers, representing a total investment of about $3.65bn. The 825MW Cliffside Steam Station Unit 6 in Mooresboro, the 920MW H.F. Lee Plant near Goldsboro, and the 620MW the Dan River Combined Cycle Station in Eden started operation in December 2012. The company said this move marks another significant milestone in its commitment to meet electricity needs with advanced, cleaner generation. Duke Energy had invested another $7.5bn in upgrading plants to cut down emissions, in addition to investing around $6bn in new plants since 2007. These investments helped the firm in bringing down regulated fleet's emissions of sulfur dioxide by 74% and nitrogen oxides by 57% since 2005. Duke Energy Power Generation Operations senior VP Charlie Gates said, "Cliffside Unit 6 has one of the most stringent air quality permits in the country, and our emissions testing program has demonstrated that these sophisticated controls are performing very well." The company has retired four coal units having 198MW of combined capacity at Cliffside in October 2011, and plans to retire another 1,469MW. fossilfuelDOTenergy-business-reviewDOTcom/news/duke-energy-starts-three-power-plants-in-north-carolina-us-040113</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357308380583</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:06:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357308582149-8</Id><Title>Thank goodness there is some some sanity on this board</Title><Msg>I love Obama because he gives me a check each month to write and post message all day long on the Yahoo message board.

Wednesday's opening of the 2,298 kilometer (1,428 mile)-line was commemorated by the 9 a.m. departure of a train from Beijing for Guangzhou. Another train left Guangzhou for Beijing an hour later. China has massive resources and considerable prestige invested in its showcase high-speed railways program. But it has in recent months faced high-profile problems: part of a line collapsed in central China after heavy rains in March, while a bullet train crash in the summer of 2011 killed 40 people. The former railway minister, who spearheaded the bullet train's construction, and the ministry's chief engineer, were detained in an unrelated corruption investigation months before the crash. Trains on the latest high-speed line will initially run at 300 kph (186 mph) with a total travel time of about eight hours. Before, the fastest time between the two cities by train was more than 20 hours. The line also makes stops in major cities along the way, including provincial capitals Shijiazhuang, Wuhan and Changsha. More than 150 pairs of high-speed trains will run on the new line every day, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Ministry of Railways. Rail is an essential part in China's transportation system, and the government plans to build a grid of high-speed railways with four east-west lines and four north-south lines by 2020. The opening of the new line brings the total distance covered by China's high-speed railway system to more than 9,300 km (5,800 miles) — about half its 2015 target of 18,000 km. fostersDOTcom/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130104/GJLIFESTYLES/121229315/-1/foslifestyles</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357309340639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:22:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357310275211-11</Id><Title>Hess Acquisition.</Title><Msg>Return To Retail Mini -Marts.From Acquisition Of Hess.</Msg><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1357310275211</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:37:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357310313680-12</Id><Title>Currency Trade IV</Title><Msg>Selling all dollars to buy British pounds. 1.6034 $/£</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357310313680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:38:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357311090939-13</Id><Topic><Title>Currency Trade IV</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357310313680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:38:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sold all £ for $. 1.6044 $/£ +0.062%...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357311090939</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:51:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357311431469-14</Id><Topic><Title>Currency Trade IV</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357310313680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:38:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>100% $.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357311431469</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:57:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357313336881-15</Id><Topic><Title>Currency Trade IV</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357310313680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:38:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the pop in the pound after the sell-off has dissipated now...

In so many ways, cellulosic ethanol sure looks like a good idea, or maybe biobutanol (where you can access a higher price for the fuel product). But then capex reality sinks in. Even a 25 million gallon cellulosic add-on at POET’s Emmetsburg, IA plant is costing $250 million and the DuPont plant adjacent to Lincolnway Energy in Nevada, Iowa is costing $200 million. The biobutanol conversion costs are not as public, but you know you are expected to be the deep pockets there, too. Hmmm. OK, we have good news today. There’s a side door opening into cellulosic ethanol. Costs you very little up front, payback is quick, and the risk is going to be generally borne by the cellulosic feedstock supplier. Who also assumes the responsibility for building, owning and operating the facility supplying feedstock to you. All you do is ferment cellulosic sugars mixed in with the corn mash, in blends (eventually) of up to 50 percent. That’s the shape of the deal that emerged overnight between Wisconsin’s Ace Ethanol and New York’s Sweetwater Energy. Deal timeline and expansion opportunity Sweetwater, for its part, will build, own and operate a cellulosic sugars facility dedicated to supplying cellulosic feedstock to Ace Ethanol. Ace will mix the sugars in with its corn mash, and produce ethanol. Pre-permitting work has already started up, and construction of a first cellulosic sugars facility is expected to be completed by mid-2014. Permitting is no walk in the park — there’s going to have to be a resubmission on the air permit. But its in a state with a lot of experience with ethanol. “Ace Ethanol has been bench testing Sweetwater’s cellulosic material for some time and we’re confident that this project will be commercially profitable,” says Neal Kemmet, President of Ace Ethanol. “With Sweetwater, we’ll move from 100% corn to a combination of corn starch and 7% cellulosic sugar as our feedstocks.” It’s the first in a hub-and-spoke model that could result in up to six such facilities supporting the Ace Ethanol plant. But that’s down the line. The Economic impact The initial project delivers enough refined monomeric sugar for Ace to produce up to 3.6 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. It’s a 16-year deal for this phase of the relationship, with a total deal value of up to $100 million – or around $1.73 per gallon of ethanol. Now, according to work that the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) has been doing for some time in measuring returns on ethanol production — corn ethanol is a break-even proposition based on corn at around $6.50 per bushel. At the $7 prices today, there are challenges. Now, in the case of Ace, like other producers, they are buying at contract prices from a group of 300 growers in the natural “draw area” as well as supplying themselves from a half-interest in a nearby grain elevator. But they are also supplementing with buys from outside of the draw area from other elevators — that’s where the bite is, that’s where corn prices spike into those $7 price ranges seen on CBOT screens. That’s where this deal proves helpful – not only in addressing price volatility and risk, but in addressing the costs associated with spot buys. But let’s look at price, too. The RIN impact Keep in mind, cellulosic ethanol sells at a premium to corn ethanol – it’s a mechanism built into the Renewable Fuel Standard to encourage the migration to cellulosic ethanol. last year, the cellulosic biofuel waiver credit ran $0.78 per gallon, a sharp increase over $0.05 corn ethanol RINs. Also, there’s the $1.01 per gallon cellulosic biofuels tax credit, just extended for 2013 – and may be available in 2014 and beyond. Now, today is not 2014, and woe betide the producer banking his plan around the value of RINs and tax credits. We asked Ace’s Neal Kemmet about that. “Clearly, we feel this is beneficial and profitable for our shareholders,” he reflected. “Based on the business model, it’s a good project for us. You have to have that high level of trust in the business case, and your business partners, to have the willingness to be the first. As far as RINs, we won;t go live until 2014, and there’s no guarantee, ever, that RINs will be in place at a given price, but if they are available and trading, we very much appreciate the support that Congress has created via the RFS.” The Ace Ethanol – Sweetwater partnership “Over the last year we’ve had some incredible conversations with everyone at Ace Ethanol, and the more we talked about the benefits we could provide for one another, the more we realized that a partnership between our two companies made for a fantastic fit,” says Arunas Chesonis, Chairman and CEO of Sweetwater. “We’ve now signed a definitive agreement for a long-term commercial relationship for cellulosic sugar, effectively moving an existing dry-mill corn ethanol facility to cellulosic ethanol without interrupting their operations. And best of all, since the process is scalable, Ace can increase the amount of cellulosic sugar they’re adding to their process in the coming years.” The technology Sweetwater Energy uses a unique, patented technology to produce low-cost sugar solution from non-food biomass. This sugar solution is sold to biorefineries, which use it to produce biofuels, biochemicals, and bioplastics. Unlike petroleum-based technologies, Sweetwater Energy’s process uses carbon from renewable biomass that is grown or procured domestically, and significantly reduces greenhouse gases. The company received an unusually broad patent in cellulosic sugar production last month. Lots of data there on C5 and C6 separation, feedstock flexibility, products produced, production process and more. Take a look here. Feedstocks Those in the feedstock supply business, rev up your engines. The technology works with a wide variety of feedstocks — even energy canes. “It’s a matter of timing,” reflected Sweetwater COO Jack Baron, “in terms of cellulosic pathways, but we think that several feedstocks will qualify. Product diversification “Our patented, decentralized sugar-production model is designed to let us work in tandem with a refiner’s existing infrastructure, which fosters strong collaboration on both sides,” said Baron. “Furthermore, our refined sugars can be used for biochemical or bioplastics production, giving Ace diversification options in the future. Ace is a progressive industry leader located near affordable biomass; they are financially successful and constantly incorporating proven new technologies to maintain their leadership position.” Good project for Ace. For a relatively small (41 mgy) facility, they’ve been remarkably adept over the years in getting new technologies tested and deployed – diversifying their product set and reducing cost – whether it is capturing CO2 or extracting corn oil. One of the reasons the plant has not shut down in all the topsy-turvy of this past year’s ethanol market. It’s like a small POET or Green Plains – fiercely pursuing process improvement and product upside. Looking at the capex and opex There are some uncertainties in this deal because the two companies are private and some numbers are not available for discussion. Let’s look at it this way. Project cost for Sweetwater is expected to be slightly over $15 million for this phase. “It’ll be a combination of debt and equity ,” according to Sweetwater COO Jack Baron. That works out to just north of $4 per gallon of capacity, and clearly Sweetwater is generating enough cash flow on 3.6 million gallons of $1.73 ethanol to provide payback. If, for the sake of argument, we figure a 15% rate of return in order to cover the cost of equity and debt – it is suggestive that Sweetwater’s operating costs are in the $1.10 per gallon range (excluding any residual value in lignin byproduct) Now, we look at a lot of data in Digestville, and $4 capex and $1.10 opex is, as they say, a compelling outlier. Doubly so in terms of having the investment absorbed by the feedstock provider – Sweetwater in this case, with limited capex and risk to the thin balance sheets of hard-pressed midstream ethanol producers. Not to mention, a $15 million entry point into the cellulosic ethanol business, regardless of who is paying. You can hardly get a meaningful Series B venture round done for that mind of money. The Bottom Line Low capex. Low opex. Low nut for getting in. And cellulosics can competing today with $7 corn on a dollar for dollar basis, fully loaded. Where are you going to go with this, we asked Sweetwater CEO Arunas Chesonis. “Our goal is 25 facilities like this in the next 5 years – in some cases, we will have multiple modules in a hub-and-spoke system with a given customer,” Chesonis told the Digest. “So it may be, for example, 25 projects with 16 customers. The market is there – not only with this corn ethanol sector, but with bioplastics and biochemicals. For us, though, executing 25 projects is a lot, and we are going to walk before we run; we have a long ways to go in building up from where we are today, with 25 employees.” biofuelsdigestDOTcom/bdigest/2013/01/04/sweetwater-energy-ace-ethanol-sign-landmark-cellulosic-ethanol-deal/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357322623863</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 13:03:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357323804696-20</Id><Title>BP Wind Energy and Sempra complete 470MW Kansas plant</Title><Msg>BP Wind Energy and Sempra complete 470MW Kansas plant Published: Friday, January 4 2013 BP Wind Energy and Sempra US Gas &amp; Power have started full commercial operations at the $800m Flat Ridge 2 wind farm in the US state of Kansas. The 470MW plant is located on a 66,000-acre site covering parts of Harper, Barber, Kingman and Sumner counties in southern Kansas. Flat Ridge 2 – owned 50-50 by BP and Sempra – is the state's biggest wind project, say the two companies. The owners say the plant was built in Kansas in part because of its business environment but largely because of its wind resources, which have been ranked the second-best in the US. The wind farm uses 294 GE 1.6 MW wind turbines and will generate enough electricity to power more than 140,000 homes. Power output from the wind farm has been sold under long-term agreements to Associated Electric Cooperative Inc (310MW); Southwestern Electric Power Company (109MW); and Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation (51MW). The power generated will be exported to Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana. BP Wind Energy, which had previously built a 100MW wind farm in Kansas, says it has more land in the state that could be used for additional projects. rechargenewsDOTcom/energy/wind/article330325DOTece</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357323804696</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 13:23:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357324815394-21</Id><Topic><Title>+ + XOM Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT) + +</Title><Username>soloryan44</Username><Timestamp>1355239202777</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 10:20:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please name the "research report", preferably with a web address attached.</Msg><Username>gyrogearcrunch</Username><Timestamp>1357324815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 13:40:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357325670578-22</Id><Title>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending December 28, 2012</Title><Msg>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending December 28, 2012 U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged over 15.3 million barrels per day during the week ending December 28, 13 thousand barrels per day above the previous week’s average.

In 2012, for the first time, more Brent futures contracts traded on the IntercontinentalExchange for the year as a whole than WTI futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Figure 1). This increase in Brent futures trading volume is prompting other changes in the financial markets, including a reweighting of commodity index funds away from WTI futures and toward Brent futures. The volume of options written on prompt Brent futures is also rising. Two years ago, the difference in the volumes traded of Brent and WTI futures contracts began to narrow as growing supply combined with transportation infrastructure constraints to disconnect WTI from the global seaborne crude oil market and, as a result, WTI prices no longer reflected global crude oil price levels. In April 2012 the volume of Brent crude oil futures traded exceeded that of WTI futures for the first time. Prior to December, Brent trading volumes had been higher than WTI volumes for eight consecutive months. In December, Brent volumes dipped lower than WTI volumes, but December typically sees light trading volumes and is not necessarily indicative of a trend. Trading volume is one of the major determinants of how a specific commodity is weighted in the indexes that are used by many investors to include commodities in their investment portfolios. Index fund managers tend to shift investments to commodities with higher trading volumes. The S&amp;P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) has increased its target weighting of Brent from 15.9 percent in 2011 to 22.3 percent in 2013, while dropping WTI from 32.6 to 24.7 percent. Similarly, the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index (DJUBS), which included Brent for the first time in 2012 with a 5.3-percent weighting, has increased the 2013 target weight to 5.8 percent. Note that the crude oil weightings in the DJUBS are less than the GSCI because the DJUBS restricts the total exposure to any one sector, such as energy, to 33.3 percent of the total index. Another reason index funds have become more interested in Brent is the difference in roll yields, which reflect the value (either positive or negative) of maintaining the portfolio positions from one month to the next as expiring contracts are sold and replaced with active contracts. Crude oil futures are dated and require delivery in a specific month. To maintain their positions, index funds must sell the front month contract and buy the second month contract before the front month contract expires. A commodity in backwardation (when the second month price is less than the front month price) lets the index fund realize a small gain when it purchases the second month futures contract for less than the price at which it sells the front month contract. The opposite is true when the commodity is in contango (when the second month price is higher than the front month price) and the fund loses a small percentage. Since the spring of 2012, the WTI futures market has been consistently in contango and the Brent futures market has almost always been backwardated. As a result, WTI has consistently had a negative roll yield while Brent, with the exception of two weeks in June 2012, has had a positive roll yield ranging as high as 1.5 percent. The increase in Brent futures trading volume has also helped spur a volume increase in options traded on Brent futures contracts. In November 2011, an average of 11,800 Brent options were traded each day; in November 2012, about 40,100 were traded daily. Despite this growth in Brent options activity, the WTI options market is still considerably larger and more liquid, with 127,300 options traded on an average day in November 2012. Moreover, as most of the increase in Brent options trading has been concentrated in the prompt month, WTI remains the only crude oil with significant trading volumes in longer-dated options. Gasoline price up while diesel fuel price drops slightly to end the year The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased four cents to $3.30 per gallon, down a tenth of a penny from last year at this time. Prices increased in all regions of the nation except the Rocky Mountains, where the price decreased eight cents to $3.02 per gallon. The East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Midwest prices all increased a nickel, to $3.40 per gallon, $3.11 per gallon, and $3.22 per gallon, respectively. Rounding out the regions, the West Coast price increased three cents to $3.46 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price decreased less than a penny to remain at $3.92 per gallon, 14 cents higher than last year at this time. The U.S. average diesel price has decreased 12 cents in the last five weeks. The price on the East Coast was unchanged from last week at $4.01 per gallon. On the West Coast, diesel fuel remained at $3.99 per gallon, up less than a penny from last week. The Rocky Mountain price dropped a nickel to $3.75 per gallon, while the Midwest and Gulf Coast prices decreased less than a penny to remain at $3.89 per gallon and $3.83 per gallon, respectively. Propane inventories U.S. propane stocks fell 2.2 million barrels to end at 66.7 million barrels last week, 11.5 million barrels (21 percent) higher than a year ago. Gulf Coast regional inventories dropped by 1.5 million barrels, while Midwest inventories declined by 0.6 million barrels. Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks dropped by 0.1 million barrels, and the East Coast region gained about 0.1 million barrels. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.6 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating oil and propane prices increase Residential heating oil prices increased during the period ending December 31, 2012. The average residential heating oil price increased by a penny to $3.96 per gallon, nearly 12 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices increased by 2 cents per gallon last week to nearly $3.17 per gallon, almost 17 cents per gallon more than last year at this time. The average residential propane price rose by 2 cents to $2.43 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices increased by 7 cents to almost $0.98 per gallon for the week ending December 31, 2012, 36 cents per gallon lower than the January 2, 2012 price. eiaDOTgov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357325670578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 13:54:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357326335992-23</Id><Topic><Title>Duke Energy starts three power plants in North Carolina, US</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357308380583</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:06:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Duke owns Progress Energy in Florida as well. Here's how they are practicing socialism for the rich in Florida: QUOTE: Stephen Smith: Nuclear reactor tax puts unfair risk on customers November 30, 2012|By Stephen Smith A misguided state law that allows big power companies to shift costs and financial risk to customers for new nuclear power generation is the last thing Florida's families and businesses need as they dig out of the worst recession in recent memory. In 2006, the Florida legislature passed a bill to promote the construction of new nuclear reactors, but it did this by shifting all the costs and financial risk from utility company shareholders to its customers. It allows companies, such as Florida Power &amp; Light to bill customers for specific costs before new reactors are built. The law essentially imposes a "nuclear tax" by forcing customers to pay preconstruction costs, including a hefty return to power company shareholders, through their utility bills. Customers are charged before the reactor has even produced electricity. In fact, the law allows a big power company to recover all of its construction costs for a reactor project even if it chooses to abandon it. This could leave FPL customers on the hook for billions of dollars. Last year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved $196 million in costs that were passed on to FPL customers for nuclear-related projects, including proposed new reactors at Turkey Point, 25 miles south of Miami. This year, FPL sought and was recently granted another $150 million. What's particularly stunning about this is FPL continues to request and be granted recovery of these costs by the PSC without ever expressing a clear commitment to build the proposed new reactors. This law, while saddling customers with significant costs and risk, turns traditional utility regulation on its head. Power company shareholders typically shoulder the risk for the construction of power plants because prior to this new law, utilities could not charge customers for new plants until they delivered power to customers. In return, the state allows them to earn a rate of return on their investment in the plant. But this law now socializes costs and all the risk of reactor construction by shifting it to customers. Meanwhile it privatizes all the reward to big power company shareholders, such as FPL — even though they shoulder no risk. FPL has recently requested an 11.25 percent return for its shareholders as part of a base rate increase. The FPL project, if ever completed, is estimated to cost upwards of $20 billion. Clearly an 11.25 percent return on $20 billion is a sweet return for FPL shareholders for a risk-free investment. Projected cost estimates for new reactors have nearly quadrupled in the last decade. The in-service dates for the proposed Turkey Point reactors have been delayed to at least 2022, due to lack of demand for electricity. Similar projects in the '70s and '80s were abandoned due to big cost overruns and a drop in electricity demand. Back then, though, many of the losses were shouldered by power company shareholders. Today, Wall Street won't finance these risky projects, unless, as has been done in Florida, the company is successful in shifting the risk to customers. Southern Alliance for Clean Energy appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the law and to overturn the commission's 2011 decision awarding cost recovery to FPL and Progress Energy Florida. We believe the vague legislation — with its lack of standards —- allows the commission to approve unlimited expenses for companies claiming to pursue new nuclear generation. A decision by the Court is expected soon. Regardless of how the court rules, all Floridians should be troubled by state legislators who are unwilling to revisit a nuclear reactor tax that is unfair, by a governor who has remained silent on the issue, and by a PSC that is willing to help big power companies by heaping more costs and risk on customers. Rather, Floridians would be better served if the state instituted a transparent utility planning process, and ramped-up lower cost energy efficiency programs – a move that would help customers reduce their energy use and save money on their bills.

The lawmakers who lead the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee want officials to find out whether miners are short-changing taxpayers when they tap the coal-rich Powder River Basin in eastern Montana and Wyoming. The basin is mainly federal land and so taxpayers are due a share of those sales. Any wrongdoing by the mining companies must be found out and punished, the lawmakers said. "If any violations of the law have occurred, companies should be required to cure any gap in royalty payments and, if misconduct has occurred, civil penalties should be levied," reads the joint letter from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, the incoming committee chairman, and the panel's leading Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski. The senators sent the letter on Friday. A spokesman for the Interior Department said the agency did not yet have a comment to the letter. CHEAP DOMESTIC POWER Powder River Basin coal, which supplies about 40 percent of U.S. demand, has typically gone to feed domestic power plants and policymakers never considered Asian sales when they conceived royalty rules, Reuters reported in October. The coal policies meant to keep domestic power cheap and abundant are now padding the bottom lines of companies like Arch Coal Inc, Peabody Energy Corp and Cloud Peak Energy Corp at the expense of taxpayers, Reuters reported last month. The companies did not reply to a request for comment. The senators cited Reuters reporting when they warned that coal miners may be selling to sister companies at artificially low prices to dodge royalty payouts. Congress' investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office, has for months been examining the federal coal program. The Department of the Interior also has an open investigation. "This is so obvious it shouldn't need to be said: Coal companies need to be paying taxpayers all of the money they are owed," Wyden said in a statement. "If regulators, or decades-old laws, are not doing enough to protect the public interest, our committee intends to find out, and to fix it." Murkowski, a supporter of free energy trade, said she expects officials to protect taxpayers' stake in sales from federal land. "Energy exports can create jobs, generate revenue, and improve our balance of trade," Murkowski said in a statement. "As we seek to maximize these benefits, we must be certain that coal exporters are following the rules." The lawmakers noted that 118 million tons of coal have been exported from Western states since 2001. They urged officials to audit those years and look for abuses. In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cloud Peak Energy was up 0.5 percent at $19.40 per share, Arch Coal was up 3.1 percent at $7.56 and Peabody Energy was up 0.6 percent at $26.79. NATURAL GAS PRECEDENT? While the industry says it is acting aboveboard, outside lawyers point to a natural gas precedent that they say indicates the issue is far from settled. In the late 1970s, Marathon Oil Corp used a similar accounting system for royalties on natural gas that was produced in Alaska but sold to Japan. A federal court eventually told Marathon to pay out royalties based on the overseas value. Officials fined Marathon $10 million. Peter Appel, a former Justice Department attorney, said the case shows that officials expect taxpayers to get a taste of the true gains on exported fuel but that the matter should remain a civil, not a criminal, case. "This seems to fall pretty squarely in the civil arena," said Appel, who prosecuted cases for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and teaches at the University of Georgia School of Law. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/01/04/us-usa-coal-investigate-idUSBRE9030GT20130104</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357328058109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:34:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357328658560-26</Id><Title>Gas Drilling Is Called Safe in New York</Title><Msg>Gas Drilling Is Called Safe in New York By DANNY HAKIM Published: January 3, 2013 ALBANY — The state’s Health Department found in an analysis it prepared early last year that the much-debated drilling technology known as hydrofracking could be conducted safely in New York, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times from an expert who did not believe it should be kept secret. The analysis and other health assessments have been closely guarded by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his administration as the governor weighs whether to approve fracking. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long delayed making a decision, unnerved in part by strident opposition on his party’s left. A plan to allow a limited amount of fracking in the state’s Southern Tier along the Pennsylvania border is still seen as the most likely outcome, should the drilling process receive final approval. The eight-page analysis is a summary of previous research by the state and others, and concludes that fracking can be done safely. It delves into the potential impact of fracking on water resources, on naturally occurring radiological material found in the ground, on air emissions and on “potential socioeconomic and quality-of-life impacts.” But it remains difficult to discern how much original research the state has done on potential health impacts, and environmentalists worry that the administration’s lack of transparency is hiding a lack of rigor in its assessment of public health risks. At the same time, the drilling industry, and landowners who have leased their land in the Southern Tier, have grown increasingly frustrated with delays by the Cuomo administration to announce a final plan. State regulators have now been studying the issue of fracking for about four years. Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said the analysis obtained by The Times was out of date. “The document you have is merely a summary, is nearly a year old, and there will be substantial changes to that version,” she said. She added that a revised version of the Environmental Impact Statement on hydrofracking — which last ran about 1,500 pages — would include more material delving into health issues. The administration has also turned to three outside experts to review the state’s own health assessments. Fracking — more formally known as high volume hydraulic fracturing — involves injecting large amounts of sand, water and chemicals deep underground at high pressures to extract natural gas from rock formations. The natural gas industry has aggressively sought to drill in the Marcellus Shale, a deep repository that runs through West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. The assessment obtained by The Times finds that fracking can be done safely within the regulatory system that the state has been developing for several years. “By implementing the proposed mitigation measures,” the analysis says, “the Department expects that human chemical exposures during normal HVHF operations” — short for high-volume hydraulic fracturing — “will be prevented or reduced below levels of significant health concern.” The analysis also rejects a broad quantitative risk assessment of fracking — the kind of study that would try to project the probability of various hazards — saying it would “involve making a large number of assumptions about the many scenario-specific variables that influence the nature and degree of potential human exposure and toxicity.” Environmental groups have long complained that the state has refused to make documents about its health assessments public. “The document itself is not a health impact study at all,” said Katherine Nadeau, the water and natural resources program director at Environmental Advocates of New York, who has reviewed it. “As drafted it is merely a defense or justification as to why the administration didn’t do a rigorous study.” Last September, Ms. Nadeau’s group submitted a state Freedom of Information Law request to the Cuomo administration seeking any health impact studies that had been conducted, but has yet to receive any such documents — a common delay tactic by the administration on various issues. “This is Governor Cuomo saying to the people of New York, once again, trust me on fracking, when on the health impact side of it, the public has been kept completely in the dark,” Ms. Nadeau said. nytimesDOTcom/2013/01/03/nyregion/hydrofracking-safe-says-ny-health-dept-analysis.html?_r=1&amp;</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357328658560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:44:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357331960691-27</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon CEO should think about his statement on BP with Macondo...like Shell CEO</Title><Username>buffet_munger</Username><Timestamp>1357328468440</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:41:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you may classify all 3 cases as accidents but BP "accident" was by choice of ALL BP management--to cut costs --shortcut safety procedures but it was a monetary decision from the BOP testing(or lack thereof) to the underweight cement to the alarm bypass etc the Exxon "accident" was a personal choice by 1 drunken capt--Exxon had nothing to gain from that decision/but lots to lose loose/broken moorings and groundings might be a result of many things but hardly a personal choice or executives cutting corners in latest "accident" and certainly not cost cutting</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1357331960691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:39:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357333308923-28</Id><Topic><Title>The End of the World As We Know It :)</Title><Username>biggatorhear</Username><Timestamp>1357316970724</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:29:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Atlanta has an elevation of 1000+ ft.

The grain-based additive was 58.33 cents cheaper than gasoline, based on February futures for both commodities. That compares with 60.07 cents yesterday. “That blend spread has gotten out there,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines, Iowa. “I’ve got to think we can buy into some demand.” Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.181 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. January futures, which expired today, dropped 0.4 percent to $2.17 a gallon. The front-month futures are down 2.6 percent in the past year. Gasoline for February delivery slid 3.34 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.7643 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.18 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive decreased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.235, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Ethanol on the West Coast declined 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.34 a gallon and in New York the biofuel climbed 0.5 cent to $2.28. Corn for March delivery tumbled 9 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $6.8025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from 29 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-04/ethanol-gains-against-gasoline-as-discount-may-spur-demand.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357345608973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:26:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357345758432-34</Id><Topic><Title>Ethanol Gains Against Gasoline as Discount May Spur Demand</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357345608973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:26:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Weekly U.S. Fuel Ethanol/Livestock Feed Production ethanolrfaDOTorg/pages/weekly-ethanol-feed-production ----------------------------- Monthly Biodiesel Production Report With Data for October 2012 | Release Date: December 28, 2012 | Next Release Date: January 30, 2013 | full report eiaDOTgov/biofuels/biodiesel/production/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357345758432</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:29:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357352235429-35</Id><Title>Enbridge to spend $400M to increase capacity of Alberta-U.S. pipeline</Title><Msg>Enbridge to spend $400M to increase capacity of Alberta-U.S. pipeline The Canadian Press Published Friday, Jan. 4, 2013 9:00AM EST Last Updated Friday, Jan. 4, 2013 11:37AM EST CALGARY -- Enbridge Inc. (TSX:ENB) plans to spend $400 million to expand the capacity of its pipeline system between Hardisty, Alta., and the U.S. border. The project involves increasing pumping horsepower and no new line pipe construction is involved, the Calgary-based company said Friday. It expects to increase capacity by 230,000 barrels a day when the upgrade comes on line in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals. The Canadian mainline is held by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (EPI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enbridge Inc. The company says the expansion has been approved by mainline shippers under the terms of EPI's Competitive Tolling Settlement. Enbridge is a major player in the North American energy market where it operates the world's longest crude oil and liquids pipeline system. The company also has a significant and growing natural gas gathering, transmission and midstream business and an increasing involvement in power transmission. The expansion announced Friday is one of many new projects to boost the amount of crude that flows through Enbridge's vast North American crude oil system. In November, Enbridge said it was planning a $1.8-billion pipeline between Edmonton, a key oilsands hub, and Hardisty. That new line will initially be able to carry 570,000 barrels per day but has the potential to be expanded to 800,000 barrels. Construction could begin as early as the first quarter of 2014, with startup targeted for mid-2015. In December, Enbridge and its U.S. affiliate announced they were spending $6.2 billion on a string of projects to bring growing volumes of Alberta and North Dakota light oil to market. The light oil market access program will see an additional 400,000 barrels per day of light oil flow to refineries in Ontario, Quebec and the U.S. Midwest. ctvnewsDOTca/business/enbridge-to-spend-400m-to-increase-capacity-of-alberta-u-s-pipeline-1DOT1100800</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357352235429</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:17:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357360558783-36</Id><Topic><Title>Thank goodness there is some some sanity on this board</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1357308582149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:09:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Investing reveals the psychological condition known as right wing talk radio brain rot.
