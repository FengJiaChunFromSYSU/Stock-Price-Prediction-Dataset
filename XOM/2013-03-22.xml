On the same day, the company reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as the entire fiscal year. According to the financial release, KiOR recorded its first revenues since inception during the fourth quarter 2012. Fred Cannon, KiOR’s president and CEO, called the cellulosic diesel shipment a major step forward for his company, the biofuels industry, and the renewable fuels sector. “With first production at Columbus, KiOR has technology with the potential to resurrect each and every shut down paper mill in the country and to replace imported oil on a cost effective basis while creating American jobs,” he said. “This facility demonstrates the efficacy of KiOR's proprietary catalytic biomass-to-fuel process with the potential to deliver cellulosic gasoline and diesel to the U.S. We are proud to be making history in Mississippi. The technology is simply scalable and we believe sufficient excess feedstock exists in the Southeast alone to build almost fifty KiOR commercial scale facilities." Cannon added that the U.S. EPA’s recent actions to qualify cellulosic gasoline for the renewable fuel standard (RFS) market and increase the gasoline blend rate to 25 percent have de-risked KiOR’s business strategy and created a market for the company’s hydrocarbon fuels that is nearly twice the size of the current ethanol market.

San Antonio-based Tesoro will be Sapphire's first commercial customer. (Sapphire Energy) San Antonio-based refiner Tesoro Corp. has agreed to purchase algae-derived “green” crude oil that will be made into diesel fuel at its West Coast refineries. Tesoro will buy the oil from California-based Sapphire Energy Inc., which maintains an algae farm in Columbus, N.M., about 80 miles west of El Paso. Use of algae-derived crude reduces the need for fossil fuels. Full terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Sapphire said Tesoro will be its first commercial customer. Tesoro’s agreement calls for it to buy the crude through the end of this year with provisions to extend its purchases beyond that. Also, Tesoro has the option to buy more of the crude as Sapphire expands production. Not so fast: Exxon decades away from making fuel from algae Sapphire, which counts Bill Gates and Monsanto among its investors, expects production to reach 100 barrels of crude a day in late 2014. The deal “is enormously important for the industry,” Sapphire CEO Cynthia Warner said in a statement, “as it validates the benefits and advantages of green crude and confirms its place as a market-viable, refiner-ready, renewable crude oil solution.” Tesoro vice president of renewable development Joel Larkins said in a statement that the company “is continuously looking at new technologies for producing renewable fuels.” Sapphire’s crude “shows promise as an alternative fuel solution.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/03/21/tesoro-to-buy-green-crude-oil/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363933183405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 02:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363933526330-4</Id><Topic><Title>Tesoro to buy ‘green’ crude oil</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363933183405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 02:19:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exxon decades away from making fuel from algae fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/03/08/exxon-decades-away-from-making-fuel-from-algae/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363933526330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 02:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363938603867-5</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a typical teabagger</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340514110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U r the dummy maxi pad u have no thumbs up.

The German noble or "Junker" class perfected the concept in the eastern marches of the German empire across eastern Germany and Europe during the middle ages through the 20th century. Those lands were German conquests going back over 1000 years and settled as ordered planned settlements. Peasants were made into disciplined workers, and the power over land became a power over people of awesome scope. The power became even more scientific and systematic with the reforms of Frederick the Great, and his successors, which built on the administrative and technical knowledge cultivated in the Universities, Prussian Academy of Sciences, and by the "Junkers" themselves. The French approach is not altogether different. Napoleon who created much of the foundation for the modern French state had little use for democracy, and set about to make France an administrative and economic machine governed by military discipline. Cyprus will do what it is ordered to, and if it does not the example will prove more useful than its compliance. There are other peoples who need more discipline in Europe, ones far more numerous than the Cypriots... In America I suppose the concept would be akin to a public flogging in your Puritan townships of old.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363954131155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363973103183-10</Id><Title>Symbols....dvax.....appy.........coiled springs......</Title><Msg>spec pics with exponential upside.</Msg><Username>teragr50</Username><Timestamp>1363973103183</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363975192771-11</Id><Title>Dem amendment would block regulations on power plant emissions</Title><Msg>Calling proposed power plant emissions standards unattainable, Sen. Joe Manchin is seeking to block their enactment with language in the federal budget resolution now under consideration in the upper chamber. The West Virginia Democrat’s amendment takes aim at pending regulations that would set limits on carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, which critics say would effectively prohibit new coal-fired plants and damage the economies of several states. The measure is among a flood of hundreds of budget amendments being voted on Friday. Republicans introduced the vast majority of the measures, eight of which target federal regulations. Manchin is part of a group of coal-country Democrats that has pressed for changes to the New Source Performance Standard, unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency a year ago. Under the proposed rules, new power plants that burn fossil fuels could release no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt‐hour. While new natural-gas plants could to meet the standard without additional technology, new coal plants would need to add updated technology to capture and store emissions. “The new regulations attempt to force standards on coal emissions that would not only be incredibly expensive, but impossible to achieve even with advanced technology,” Manchin said in a statement issued Friday. He argued that the regulations, part of the Obama administration’s effort to counter the effects of climate change, would not have a tangible benefit. “After all, experts agree that emissions from all U.S. power plants have only a marginal impact on global emissions, and this already small share is shrinking every year, as China, India, and others dramatically scale up their fossil fuel use," Manchin said. If adopted into law, the amendment would block funding to implement the regulations. thehillDOTcom/blogs/regwatch/energyenvironment/289837-dem-amendment-would-block-power-plant-emission-regulations</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363975192771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:59:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363975943940-12</Id><Topic><Title>Dem amendment would block regulations on power plant emissions</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363975192771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:59:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A temporary delay to the proposed power plant emissions standards may be appropriate as I expect inexpensive clean coal technology will become available by the late summer of 2014.

Environmentalists shouldn’t have much trouble deciding which side they’re on. After all, the major source of greenhouse gas emissions is fossil fuel combustion. That mostly means running cars, trucks, and other vehicles with petroleum products such as gasoline. If you don’t want to spew more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, there’s really only alternative fuel – ethanol. There is no other fuel available at scale today that matches ethanol’s ability to improve overall environmental quality, compared to gasoline. Moreover, today’s grain ethanol is producing the infrastructure – from innovative companies to blender pumps -- to develop and commercialize the next generation of advanced biofuels, which offer even greater advantages. That’s why it’s so troubling that some environmentalists are siding with Big Oil, which they have correctly criticized for polluting our air and water, to gang up on American ethanol, which is both renewable and cleaner than gasoline. As the saying goes, some of these environmentalists were against Big Oil before they were for it. thehillDOTcom/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/289845-environmentalists-shouldnt-side-with-big-oil-against-biofuels</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363976979975</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363978023668-14</Id><Title>U.S. Senator Wyden Asks EPA to Explain Ethanol RIN Volatility</Title><Msg>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden asked the Environmental Protection Agency for data that would explain recent volatility in ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers. The value of RINs, certificates used by refiners and the EPA to show compliance with government biofuel mandates, reached a record $1.06 on March 8 from 7.1 cents on Jan. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Petroleum interests and ethanol proponents have been battling over the reason for the surge in prices and its effect on the cost of gasoline at filling stations. The credits are a mechanism of the Renewable Fuels Standard, a 2007 energy law that calls for an escalating amount of biofuel consumption. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, chairs the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “Given that ethanol is an increasingly important factor in the cost and supply of motor fuel in the U.S., it is critical that the committee have a better understanding of the causes and effects of RIN market volatility and developments,” he said in a letter to the EPA today. RINs for the corn-based variety of ethanol were unchanged yesterday at 70.5 cents, while the advanced certificates, which include biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, slipped 1.3 percent to 75.5 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Gasoline Demand Gasoline demand is projected to average 133.5 billion gallons in 2013 and 2014, the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department, said in its March 12 Short-Term Energy Outlook. Under the 2007 energy law, the U.S. is required to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.

Power wires needed to be lifted along the delivery routes as the slow moving semi-trailers carrying the multi-tonned equipment moved across the snow-drifted prairies. The three duct monsters fabricated by SaskArc Industries Inc. of Oxbow consisted of the main duct for flue gas casing, along with the inlet and outlet pieces. The casing was put into place in the early part of the week after arriving on Monday. The 90-ton unit required two 150-ton cranes to lift it into place. The duct work inlet and outlet followed in mid-week. Steve Lodge, an engineer contracted by Stantec and seconded to SaskPower for the installation, said the work had to be planned around weather conditions since they were unable to move the huge pieces after winds reached certain velocities which was the case for several hours last Wednesday and Thursday. Lodge said there was a design side and power side to the project and he was involved on the SaskPower side of the equation. “The duct work sits adjacent to the stripper tower. It brings the flue gas temperature down to required values so that it can be entered into the stripper operation,” he said. "Flue gas comes out of the back of the plant (Unit No. 3) and some of the steam goes to the cooler and it knocks the temperature down about 100 degrees F so the material will be compatible with the stripper media. Then the heat is reclaimed and will be used for other purposes,” Lodge added. estevanmercuryDOTca/article/20130130/estmercury0101/130129838/-1/estmercury/big-piece-of-estevan-clean-coal-project-moves-into-place-at-boundary</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363981617830</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 15:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363982419028-17</Id><Title>Fuel demand hits 20-year low for February</Title><Msg>Posted on March 22, 2013 at 11:51 am by Jeannie Kever A gas station attendant pumps gas, in Portland, Ore. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) As other economic indicators are headed up — think housing and manufacturing — the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. demand for petroleum products in February hit a 20-year low for the month. American’s demand for crude-based fuels dropped more than 4 percent in February compared to a year earlier, API reported this week. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production jumped 13.9 percent over the previous year. “Declining numbers for most of the key products isn’t consistent with a robust recovery,” said John Felmy, chief economist for the trade group, which represents the oil and natural gas industry. “Although there’s been some encouraging news on employment and manufacturing, fuel demand is an important indicator of where the economy is — and it’s headed in a different direction.” Demand for gasoline fell 3.1 percent from a year earlier, while demand for residual fuel oil, used in industrial boilers, fell by 12.6 percent. Use of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, fell 7.3 percent, while demand for jet fuel dropped by 8.7 percent. The drop in demand was reflected in refineries operating at lower rates, according to the group, which reported that refineries operated at an average utilization rate of 83.8 percent in February, down 2.1 percent from January and down 2.7 percent from February 2012. But some U.S. refineries, especially those along the Gulf Coast, have been able to make up for dropping domestic demand by increasing their share of the export market. They also have benefitted from growing U.S. shale production of crude oil, using that cheaper crude oil to replace more expensive imported oil to keep their production costs down.
