Under the plan, environmental statutes and regulations would be removed or loosened to green-light more coal production and other industry priorities, and the United States would reach agreements for energy production with Canada and Mexico, including to build the Keystone XL Pipeline. While President Obama has funneled federal dollars toward subsidies and loan guarantees for wind, solar and other green-energy industries, Romney would spend more broadly on research for new energy technologies. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee plans to announce his agenda in a speech in Hobbs, N.M. His campaign advisers previewed the policies with reporters Wednesday afternoon. In a 21-page report released by his campaign, Romney says the United States would become “an energy superpower” by the end of his second term. “We have an unprecedented opportunity to make our natural resources a long-term source of competitive advantage for our nation,” Romney says in the report. “If we develop these resources to the fullest, we will not only guarantee ourselves an affordable and reliable supply of energy, but also enjoy benefits throughout our economy.” Romney’s campaign estimates that the plan would have an economic impact of $500 billion and result in three million new jobs, including more than one million in the manufacturing sector. The campaign projects more than $1 trillion in revenue for federal, state and local governments, although it did not specify over what period. It promises lower energy prices for middle-class families. Romney’s plan caters heavily to oil and coal interests, and oil executives are some of his biggest benefactors. Romney spent Tuesday raising an estimated $7 million across Texas, including $3 million at a dinner at the Petroleum Club of Midland. He spent the night at the home of Miles Boldrick, founder of Statewide Minerals Co., which has stakes in more than 25,000 oil wells. Obama has attacked Romney over supporting subsidies to oil companies, suggesting those tax breaks should instead go to producers of renewable domestic energy such as wind and solar. “My opponent thinks new sources of clean, homegrown energy like wind energy are ‘imaginary,’ ” Obama said Saturday in Rochester, N.H. “That’s what he called them. Congressman Ryan said they were a ‘fad.’ Listen, since I took office, America has doubled the use of renewable energy. Thousands of good American jobs have been created. It’s helping us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That’s not imaginary, that’s real.” Romney’s strategists believe his energy policy offers a sharp contrast with Obama and could be a winning issue for the Republican ticket. Senior adviser Ed Gillespie said Romney plans to campaign on his energy plan through the fall sprint, adding, “We think it’s a very high-priority issue for American voters.” http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-says-plan-will-achieve-north-american-energy-independence-by-2020/2012/08/22/1fc4079a-eca5-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345700906000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 01:48:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345700916000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney says plan will achieve North American energy independence by 2020</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345700906000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 01:48:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney’s plan for federally owned lands represents one of the most sweeping leasing policies ever. The Interior Department controls leasing programs, but under Romney the states would oversee the development and production of all forms of energy on federal lands — and states, according to the plan, would have “maximum flexibility to ascertain what is most appropriate.” This has long been a priority for conservatives, especially those in Western states who want to speed up the permitting process. Romney’s campaign says it takes 307 days for the federal government to approve permits to drill a well, while North Dakota can permit a project in 10 days. In Utah, for instance, the Republican governor has signed legislation demanding that the federal government transfer control of 30 million acres to the state. Environmentalists strongly oppose transferring power to the states. “Giving control of federal lands to states like Utah would result in destroyed treasured landscapes, including those surrounding national parks,” said Scott Groene, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “Sagebrush rebellion rhetoric comes and goes,” he added, “but it always stops when Westerners realize what an economic and environmental disaster it would be for us to hand over control of federal lands to the states.”</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345700916000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 01:48:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345701726000-6</Id><Title>Chemtex cellulosic plant project lands USDA loan guarantee</Title><Msg>Chemtex cellulosic plant project lands USDA loan guarantee By Susanne Retka Schill | August 22, 2012 Chemtex International Inc. received a conditional USDA loan guarantee to build a 20 MMgy cellulosic ethanol facility in eastern North Carolina’s Sampson County. Project Alpha is planning to use energy grasses as feedstock, with an estimated 30,000 acres of production needed to supply the facility. Chemtex will use Beta Renewables’ Prosea technology to produce cost-competitive ethanol using non-food biomass as its feedstock. This is the same technology that will be used at the world’s first commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant in Crescentino, Italy, expected to start operations this fall, and also in a series of plants to be built by GraalBio in Brazil. Novozymes has also partnered with Chemtex on the project. “Novozymes is excited to partner with Chemtex to convert energy crops into cellulosic ethanol in North Carolina,” said Peder Holk Nielsen, executive vice president of Novozymes. “It is a great step forward for the U.S. biofuels industry and an endorsement of the technologies Chemtex and Novozymes have each developed. I am confident our collaboration will become a benchmark for the advanced biofuels industry in the U.S.” In June, Chemtex was awarded $3.9 million by the USDA, under its Biomass Crop Assistance Program, to support the establishment of over 4,000 acres of miscanthus and switchgrass across 11 counties in North Carolina to help supply the new facility. The net increased revenue to local growers is projected to be $4.5 million per year, according to the USDA, and is targeted at helping to solve an issue faced by the state’s pork industry. In partnership with the Biofuels Center of North Carolina, Chemtex has identified farmland that is currently growing coastal Bermuda grass to manage swine lagoon effluent which will be converted to grasses such as miscanthus and switchgrass. “Today's announcement supports the Obama Administration's 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy to embrace alternative American-produced feedstocks that support our nation's energy independence and provide jobs in rural areas,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “At USDA we are focused on the production of renewable energy from a wide variety of nonfood sources, including energy grasses. The facility we are announcing today will help create more than 300 jobs in North Carolina and is a perfect example of how producing home-grown energy is good for the economy and good for our energy future.” “Chemtex wishes to thank the USDA for their vision and their confidence in our project,” said Guido Ghisolfi, president of Chemtex and the CEO of Beta Renewables, in a statement. “Realizing a first industrial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant here in the USA and proving that it can produce cost competitive sustainable ethanol is an important milestone in the commercialization process of advanced biofuels. We believe that Project Alpha can become a model for future cellulosic ethanol production in America. Local economies and U.S. energy security will benefit.” With a targeted start-up date in 2014, Chemtex is partnering in Project Alpha with the Biofuels Center of North Carolina, Novozymes, the North Carolina pork industry and North Carolina-based Branch Banking &amp; Trust. http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/9053/chemtex-cellulosic-plant-project-lands-usda-loan-guarantee</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345701726000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 02:02:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345703176000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Defended Stimulus When Bush Wanted It</Title><Username>bankhouseone</Username><Timestamp>1345533469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 03:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We are going in the wrong direction" OH U r full of BS !!!

NDP leader Adrian Dix says if he is elected premier next May, his government will withdraw from the current environmental assessment of the Northern Gateway project and set up a "made in B.C." review instead. That independent review will allow British Columbia to "reassert its authority" over the assessment of the controversial Enbridge (TSX: ENB) pipeline, power that Dix says the provincial Liberal government has turned over to the federal cabinet. "If we do nothing, then the decision of the B.C. government will be made by 1/8Prime Minister3/8 Stephen Harper," he told reporters Wednesday. "I don't think that's acceptable to British Columbians. I think the people of B.C. want to have a voice in that process and we intend to provide that." The panel reviewing the project jointly represents the National Energy Board and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Authority. More than 4,000 people and groups have asked to make oral submissions at the panel review. The panel has been holding hearings across Alberta and B.C., and has heard oral evidence from 16 B.C. communities since January. The panel will be hearing from more people in Victoria, Vancouver and Kelowna early next year, and the hearings are expected to wrap up next April with a report due by the end of 2013. One month after the hearings end, British Columbians will go to the polls in a provincial election. B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake accused Dix of playing politics. "This isn't about proper process," Lake said. "What they're doing is picking and choosing winners when they say what assessment applies to what and determining even before an assessment occurs whether a project deserves their support or not." The NDP could not say how much a separate review process would cost. Dix acknowledged there would be cost to taxpayers, but he said there is a lot more at stake financially and environmentally for the province. Dix acknowledged the federal government ultimately has primary jurisdiction over the fate of the 1,170-kilometre pipeline that would transport oil sands diluted bitumen from Alberta to Kitimat for shipping by tanker to Asian markets. "We have to have an environmental review and have our own certification process in British Columbia," he said. "What the federal government does at that point, given that they've accepted we have some of the jurisdiction, remains to be seen, but we're going to assert our jurisdiction." In June 2010, the provincial and federal governments signed an agreement that allows either party to withdraw from any National Energy Board's environmental assessment of a project upon giving 30 days' notice. Dix, who was joined by NDP environmental critic Rob Fleming and constitutional lawyer Murray Rankin on Wednesday, said he would serve Ottawa the notice within a week in office. http://www.vancouversun.com/business/2035/Northern+Gateway+pipeline+will+made+review+leader/7128470/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345728866000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345728876000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Northern Gateway pipeline will see 'made in B.C.' review: NDP leader</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345728866000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:34:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He also reiterated his opposition to the Enbridge pipeline, but when asked whether the outcome of a provincial environmental review can have the authority to block the project, both Dix and Rankin said it is a matter that a legal team is going to examine. "The primary jurisdiction for an inter-provincial pipeline is federal," Rankin said. "That does not mean, however, there isn't a number of provincial powers that can come to play in a circumstance like this. A team of constitutional lawyers right now is trying to analyze just what that would mean." A spokesman for federal Environment Minister Peter Kent said Kent will not comment on hypotheticals. Environmental advocates say they support Dix's decision, particularly when the federal government recently implemented budget cuts to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. "The federal budget bill earlier this year gutted the whole federal environmental process, basically paving the road for pipelines and tankers," said Karen Wristen of Living Oceans Society in a written statement. "The province of B.C. is more than justified in pulling out of the joint assessment agreement, because the federal process is no longer anything we could call 'equivalent' to proper environmental assessment. We will be pushing for a review that looks at the real risks that B.C. communities are asked to bear by the Enbridge proposal." Dix said he does not expect his proposal will result in strained relations with Ottawa. "It's my intention to have a business-like relationship with whoever is prime minister, whether that's Mr. Harper or Mr. (Thomas) Mulcair," he said. "That doesn't mean we're going to accept everything the federal government says on every issue." Last year, a proposal by Taseko Mines (TSX:TKO) to build an open pit gold-copper mine near Williams Lake was rejected by a federal governmental review, even though the project was approved by the B.C. government. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency said the New Prosperity mine proposal did not address fundamental issues central to environmental assessment, such as water quality and fish habitat. Ottawa has agreed to hear a second environmental review after Taseko reworks the project. Dix did not elaborate either on what the NDP would do if the proposed provincial review concludes that the Northern Gateway project should go ahead. "I don't think you set up an independent process to assume the result," he said. "They're going to review it independently, they're going to hear from British Columbians, and they're going to issue a report. As a British Columbian myself with strong views on (the pipeline,) I'd have to take that into consideration. "My position now is I don't think it's in the economic and environmental interest of B.C."</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345728876000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:34:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345729047000-19</Id><Title>Black Grasshoppers</Title><Msg>Like a plague of locusts the untermensch are running wild. 1 - They consume the cities, destroying neighborhood after neighborhood. 2 - They flood the banks with bad debt, after the deniers in government and academia force the bankers to loan to them. 3 - The schools, prisons, and welfare rolls are overwhelmed by them too.

Notes and Definitions Beginning with the report period for the week ending March 16, 2012, EIA is including salt dome and nonsalt-dome subtotals for the Producing Region in the Summary section. The sum of the components may not equal the total for the Producing Region, because of independent rounding. Summary Working gas in storage was 3,308 Bcf as of Friday, August 17, 2012, according to EIA estimates. This represents a net increase of 47 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 423 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 357 Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,951 Bcf. In the East Region, stocks were 115 Bcf above the 5-year average following net injections of 48 Bcf. Stocks in the Producing Region were 178 Bcf above the 5-year average of 930 Bcf after a net injection of 4 Bcf. Stocks in the West Region were 63 Bcf above the 5-year average after a net drawdown of 5 Bcf. At 3,308 Bcf, total working gas is above the 5-year historical range. Working gas stocks in the Producing Region, for the week ending August 17, 2012, totaled 1,108 Bcf, with 218 Bcf in salt cavern facilities and 890 Bcf in nonsalt cavern facilities. Working gas stocks decreased 2 Bcf in the salt cavern facilities and increased 7 Bcf in the nonsalt cavern facilities since August 10.

He started in 1974, and was finally stopped in 2002. Nathan Starts In 1974, When He Was 17 Years-Old In 1974, Nathan pleads guilty to impersonating a policeman and assaulting an eight-year-old boy, for which he received one year of probation. This was the first time he was caught, but most suspect he was on the prowl since puberty. Nathan Attacks Two Boys In 1977 In 1977, Nathan kidnapped and choked two boys. He was convicted of attempted murder, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. What did he do for the three years since his last arrest? A Zi_onist Psychiatrist Puts Him In A Mental Hospital Nathaniel Levi Bar-Jonah said he had fantasies involving murder and cannibalism, and he was transferred to the Bridgewater State Hospital for Sexual Predators. He was released in 1991. Another Assault Then on August 9th, 1991, Mr. Bar-Jonah is arrested for battery on a 7-year-old boy, during an incident outside an Oxford post office. He is sentenced to two years probation, on the condition he move to Montana with his mother. Moves To Montana In 1991 He moved to Great Falls in August 1991, to serve out a two-year sentence of probation. December 18, 1993 Bar-Jonah molests an 8-year-old boy he is babysitting in Great Falls, Montana. He is charged, but the case is later dropped when the mother refuses to let the boy testify. Feburary 6, 1996 Ten-year-old Zachary Ramsay disappears on his way to Whittier Elementary School in Great Falls. December 13, 1999 Nathaniel Bar-Jonah is arrested while lurking around the Lincoln Elementary School in Great Falls in the early morning dressed as a policeman. According to police, he is carrying a stun gun, a can of pepper spray, a fake police badge and a toy revolver. He quickly becomes the focus of the Ramsay investigation. December 17, 1999 Police search his apartment and find nude photos of him and young boys June 6, 2000 Police dig up a portion of Bar-Jonah's garage and recover a bunch of human bones. On December 18, 2000, Bar-Jonah is charged with the kidnapping and murder of Ramsay. Authorities contend Bar-Jonah ate the boy's remains. February 26, 2002 Nathan stands trial in Great Falls, Montana Evidence Police found 28 boxes of potential evidence that links Bar-Jonah to Zachary's disappearance. Investigators have found stun guns, knives, batons, a blue police-style coat, police badges. They also found a list of names, including Zachary, young relatives and children of friends. Police Found Recipes Police also found writings where Bar-Jonah allegedly makes references to "Little Boy Stew," "Little Kid Desert," "Little Boy Pot Pies". Authorities reveal that Bar-Jonah ate the boy's remains and also fed them to unwitting friends and family. Police Suspect More Victims Bar-Jonah kept a list of 27 names that police suspect could be his Massachusetts victims from 1963 to1977. The story sends law enforcement scrambling to find earlier atrocities the suspected serial killer may have committed. Their search includes Arkansas, Florida, Colorado, and into Canada. Nathan Was Convicted On Three Counts Nathan received the maximum sentence of 130 years without parole. Prison video. High-Priced Lawyers His attorneys appealed to the state supreme court and lost.

As there is enough sun falling on domestic roofs to potentially supply most, if not all of America's electricity, scientists are excited about future prospects. Tiles that take electricity from the sun, and can be fitted just like traditional roofing, are already commercially available. Now, solar cells created from "earth-abundant" materials are more productive, affordable and flexible than ever, making it easier to deploy photovoltaics into new areas of buildings, the scientists believe. The scientists' comments came during a sustainability symposium at the American Chemical Society's (ACS) 244th National Meeting &amp; Exposition. ACS is the world's largest scientific society. One of those taking part, Harry A. Atwater, Ph.D., says, "Sustainability involves developing technology that can be productive over the long-term, using resources in ways that meet today's needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. That's exactly what we are doing with these new solar-energy conversion devices." The new photovoltaic devices use freely-available cheaper metals such and copper and zinc, described as "earth-abundant materials". They replace indium, gallium and other "rare earth" elements. These often come from foreign countries. For instance, China mines more than 90% of the rare earth elements in batteries for hybrid cars, magnets, electronics and similar high-tech products. Dr Atwater and James C. Stevens, Ph.D., described how to replace expensive rare earth metals in photovoltaic devices with cheaper and more sustainable materials. Dr Atwater, a California Institute of Technology physicist, and Dr Stevens, Dow Chemical Company chemist, led collaboration between the two in researching and developing new electronic materials to be used in solar power generation devices. New devices using zinc phosphide and copper oxide shattered records for the amount of electrical current and voltage generated by thin-film solar energy conversion devices that were made with zinc and copper. The advance reinforces evidence that zinc phosphide and copper oxide could achieve very high efficiencies and produce electricity at a similar cost to coal-fired energy plants within 20 years. Dr Stevens assisted in the development of Dow's PowerHouse Solar Shingle at the end of 2011, which generates electricity and can be fitted like traditional roofing. The special shingles make use of copper indium gallium diselenide photovoltaic technology. Dr Stevens and his team are now aiming to incorporate sustainable earth-abundant materials into PowerHouse shingles. He says, "The United States alone has about 69 billion square feet of appropriate residential rooftops that could be generating electricity from the sun. The sunlight falling on those roofs could generate at least 50 percent of the nation's electricity, and some estimates put that number closer to 100 percent. With earth-abundant technology, that energy could be harvested, at an enormous benefit to consumers and the environment." http://www.earthtimes.org/energy/cheaper-solar-panels-scientists/2132/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345745706000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345745716000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Cheaper solar panels on the way, say scientists</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345745706000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The ACS symposium has also heard about: • Moves by mining company Molycorp to increase and update its Mountain Pass, Colorado, facilities to boost production of rare earth elements with more eco-friendly and cheaper technology. • A summary of the challenges of how to maintain a sustainable supply of critical materials from rare earth elements to more abundant metals such as copper. • A new material that can recover rare metals from the 800 billion gallons of wastewater that comes from mining and oil and gas drilling annually.

He was just an ignorant bum who read a few newspapers, magazines, and had an undistinguished career in the army. Ascribing the cultural views of the times to his doing is as ridiculous as giving Obama credit for creating Hollywood's liberal cultural agenda. Fascism is not based on the physical sciences either. It is based in the social sciences, particularly 19th century cultural Darwinism, and its German academic equivalents, with a healthy dose of mysticism thrown in. Such things are how you define untermenschen. Americans had quite similar views and equivalent terms long before Hitler was born.

I will be putting every dollar I have into the market the day after Obama loses, if he loses. The signal to unload stocks was when Barack Hussein Obama won the Democrat nomination back in 2008. The economy collapsed utterly not long after he was nominated. There was no way to be certain who would win until September which is why the market really started falling apart. From the time he was nominated to the time he was comfortably nested in the Oval Office the stock market had plunged over 50%. The economy still has not recovered the economic level it was at before he was nominated. If he wins again it never will...

And, as a by-product of INCREASED ENERGY SUPPLIES, the cost of electricity, gasoline and FOOD are going to drop like a rock! More Americans will have more of their own money in their pockets. Owebama = Entitlement Society - Dependent on Government handouts; Success and hard work is PUNISHED with high taxes; Government limits YOUR FREEDOM with intrusive regulations throughout society, disjointing the financial markets, etc. etc. Romney = Capitalism - Self-reliance and incentives for "Capital-Creation" such as a low tax burden, few government regulations, USA Energy Independence (using OUR resources, not importing/sending OUR money overseas), etc. The choice is clear. If you hate America and want to see America changed into a European-style Socialist Society, then vote Owebama. If you appreciate the fact that FREEDOM unleashed in America has changed the world for the better through innovation, investment and job creation, then vote Romney. Ronald Reagan gave America hope again after the miserable Carter years. I truly believe that Romney's business experience may SAVE AMERICA from the miserable, stalled-growth economic recovery we are now experiencing. If you use your brain in the voting booth in November, then the choice is clear. American did not become an economic superpower on the back of a big, bloated debt-spending Federal Government.
