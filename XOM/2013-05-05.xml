There are 1,633 megawatts of new generation capacity in the 2H 2013 queue, according to the 2012 Annual Report on Market Issues and Performance from the California Independent System Operator (the ISO). Of that, 1,581 megawatts are new solar and 52 megawatts are biomass. By the end of the first half of the year, the ISO will have added 3,391 megawatts of nameplate capacity, of which 2,296 megawatts will be natural gas, 565 megawatts will be wind and 530 megawatts will be solar. However, what is in the ISO’s queue is not necessarily what will end up in the state’s energy mix, REC Solar Director of Governmental Affairs Ben Higgins pointed out. But in this report, California ISO Manager of Monitoring and Reporting Keith Collins noted, “the ISO has done its best in determining which projects have a high probably of coming on-line instead of just taking generation in the queue as-is.” This is likely a very good indication of the new generation the marketplace will build to replace the 2,200-megawatt deficit caused by the San Onofre nuclear facility outage and the mandated closures/retrofits of fossil fuel plants that over-consume the state’s water resources. And it is a strong indication of the kind of building that will be driven by the state’s 33 percent by 2020 Renewable Portfolio Standard. “This is the shape of things to come,” observed V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (CEERT). But it raises two important questions. First, what kind of natural gas plants will be added? And, second, are we getting a lumpy renewable energy portfolio that is heavy on solar and light on everything else?"

Bob Inglis, a former GOP House member from South Carolina, is part of a very loose collection of policy wonks and advocates fighting to change the politics of taxing emissions. “It’s a longer-term play here,” Inglis said. Inglis, who launched the “Energy and Enterprise Initiative” at George Mason University last year, sees several forces converging that will enable a carbon tax to surface in a broader fiscal policy deal. It would happen, he said, by “immaculate conception,” but not until 2015 or 2016. “It will be nobody claiming paternity for it. It will just develop on its own,” Inglis said in an interview Thursday. Proposals to impose taxes on emissions from burning coal and oil have been around for years. But they’ve gained new traction and fresh opposition of late, owing to the collapse of cap-and-trade legislation in 2010, the Beltway search for new revenue sources and the renewed attention to climate change. Advocates range from longtime backer Al Gore to Inglis to Art Laffer, one of the godfathers of conservative economics. They all back a “revenue-neutral” carbon tax that would be offset by reductions in personal taxes. Other proposals call for using a tax on various industry sectors — such oil and coal producers or power companies — to pay for deficit-reduction, consumer rebates, green energy programs or some combination. Tyson Slocum, head of the energy program at the left-leaning group Public Citizen, said there are discussions occurring in “multiple types of formats” and “involving a lot of different kinds of stakeholders.” None of it is going very far right now. White House spokesman Jay Carney said in late 2012 the administration would “never” propose a carbon tax.

Solar &amp; wind power use no fuel so the marginal cost of their power is very low. The fixed cost, by definition, is not going to be reflected in a marginal cost and a price governed by it. Someone has to pay the fixed cost, and it is easy to find someone to pay it besides the consumer of marginal power, as we are doing in Germany. If fossil fuel providers had their way they would have the utilities manipulate the market price to make it equal to average cost or some higher number they made up, allowing them to recoup fixed costs, and stay in business against low marginal cost power sources. If, however, the objective is to drive them out of business all one need do is just keep fielding solar and wind power systems and make everyone compete without the benefit of a manager or regulator manipulating prices. This summer will certainly set new records for solar power output in Germany. The investments of the past year will reap large gains as industrial power rates are forced down irrespective of the cost of fossil fuel based power. Every passing season the industrial power cost will fall further and further as solar &amp; wind capacity is new fielded, increasing German industrial dominance in export markets. Foreign industry will certainly feel the pressure of the world’s most technologically advanced industry matched with a power price nobody will be able to compete with except, that is, if they copy Germany’s system.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367763127334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:12:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367777966405-7</Id><Title>Cheap natural gas prompts states to sour on renewables</Title><Msg>11 hours ago • Christopher Martin Bloomberg News (34) Comments More than half the states with laws requiring utilities to buy renewable energy - including Arizona - are considering ways to pare back those mandates after a plunge in natural gas prices brought on by technology that boosted supply. Sixteen of the 29 states with renewable portfolio standards are considering legislation that would reduce the need for wind and solar power, according to researchers backed by the U.S. Energy Department. North Carolina lawmakers may be among the first to move, followed by Colorado and Connecticut. The efforts could benefit U.S. utilities such as Duke Energy and PG&amp;E as well as Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil producer, and Peabody Energy Corp., the largest U.S. coal mining company. Those companies contributed to at least one of the lobby groups pushing the change, according to the Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison, Wis.-based nonprofit group. It would hurt wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems and First Solar Inc., which develops solar farms. "We're opposed to these mandates, and 2013 will be the most active year ever in terms of efforts to repeal them," said Todd Wynn, task force director for energy of the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a lobby group pushing for the change. "Natural gas is a clean fuel, and regulators and policymakers are seeing how it's much more affordable than renewable energy." Hydraulic-fracturing technology opened aging reservoirs for natural gas drilling, driving prices down about 72 percent from their record 2005 high. That's making more expensive wind and solar power projects harder for utility regulators to justify, according to ALEC and its allies, which include the Heritage Foundation in Washington.

The December futures contract advanced 22 per cent since April 26 to close at 3.78 euros ($4.90) a metric ton on London's ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest since April 16. The contracts jumped as much as 23 per cent today, and trading volume doubled to 27 million tons from yesterday's levels. Prices plunged to a record 2.46 euros last month after the European Parliament rejected a plan to postpone the sale of some permits over the next three years and reintroduce, or backload, them to the market in 2019 and 2020. Prices have slumped 50 per cent from a year ago as the euro area's second recession since 2008 cut demand for permits, exacerbating a glut. “This is a strong boost, it's exactly what the market needed,” Milan Hudak, an analyst at Virtuse Energy sro in Prague, said by e-mail. “Even though this is a strong signal from Germany, backloading will not happen sooner than in 2014 and we still don't know the final version of it.” Advertisement Europe's emissions-trading system imposes limits on about 12,000 power plants and factories. The program allocates permits to polluters that must surrender enough allowances to cover their discharges of carbon dioxide or pay fines. Lower prices mean it can be cheaper for companies to buy emission rights rather than invest in climate-friendly technologies. 'Great intensity' Germany's clean-energy law must be overhauled with “great intensity” after the country's elections on Sept. 22 and action should also be taken in the carbon market as lower-than-expected economic growth led to falling prices for certificates, Merkel said today at a Protestant church event in Hamburg. “Something also has to be done on backloading, businessdayDOTcomDOTau/business/carbon-economy/carbon-prices-rocket-on-merkel-hopes-20130506-2j20c.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367795875358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 19:17:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367797106311-10</Id><Title>OIL moving much higher</Title><Msg>Not even the summer yet.</Msg><Username>yainvestor2</Username><Timestamp>1367797106311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 19:38:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367803487468-11</Id><Topic><Title>World’s Largest Solar Power Project, 579-Megawatt Antelope Valley Solar Project, Under Construction</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367282178250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:36:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two engineers associated with renewable energy say this will be a huge win win project.</Msg><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1367803487468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 21:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
