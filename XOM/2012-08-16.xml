The agency is on schedule to develop a platform for a Nov. 14 auction of allowances, each allowing for the release of one metric ton of carbon under a state program that caps emissions from plants beginning next year, Chairman Mary Nichols said during an interview at Bloomberg’s San Francisco office. California carbon futures have tumbled 12 percent from this year’s high on speculation that the auction may be delayed after Philip Moeller, a Republican member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, warned California’s Democratic Governor Jerry Brown on Aug. 6 that the system may “seriously impact” the West Coast economy. “The chances are overwhelmingly good that we will start on time,” Nichols said in the interview. “We’re in the process of cleaning up every loose end or issue that hasn’t yet been definitively addressed.” Nichols was scheduled to speak with Moeller today about his concern that a provision prohibiting companies from sending carbon-intensive power outside the state was unclear and would hurt businesses. California’s cap-and-trade program would create the second- largest carbon market in the world, behind only the European Union’s emissions trading system. Carbon Allowances Allowances to be used as part of the state’s program are commanding higher prices than any other carbon permits traded on futures exchanges as regulators develop rules for a system that eventually will cover 85 percent of the greenhouse gases released in the state. It would become the first economy-wide program of its kind in the U.S. California carbon allowance futures for December 2013 delivery slipped 15 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $17.75 per metric ton today, data compiled by CME Group Inc. (CME)’s Green Exchange shows. Prices are up 13 percent this year and peaked on July 24 at $20.25 per metric ton. “The market’s on pins and needles about this first auction, hoping it goes smoothly,” Jeff King, managing director of environmental markets at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone Aug. 10. “We’re poring through every seemingly simple announcement looking for any clues to a potential delay.” Emissions Cap California plans to cap carbon emissions from power generators, oil refineries and other industrial plants beginning next year and cut that limit gradually to reduce emissions by 2020 to 1990 levels. The air board will issue carbon allowances through a combination of free allocations and auctions. Companies must turn in enough permits to cover their emissions. Those under the limit can sell allowances to companies above it. FERC’s Moeller said in the letter to Brown last week that a program rule banning companies from a practice known as resource shuffling isn’t clearly defined and may freeze power-trading in the region. The law is intended to prevent utilities from importing emissions-free power and sending carbon-intensive electricity generation outside the state. The air board agrees that such a “chilling” effect on the market would be inappropriate and plans to address Moeller’s concerns, Nichols said. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-13/california-air-chief-says-carbon-auction-won-t-be-delayed.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345123580000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345123594000-5</Id><Topic><Title>California Air Chief Says Carbon Auction Won’t Be Delayed</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345123580000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:26:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>‘Resources Shuffling’ “We don’t think it’s as likely to be a problem as his letter did, and we’re not backing down one inch on the issue of resources shuffling,” she said. “We agree it’s a problem that needs to be addressed, so we will address it.” The board decided in March to delay the first auction of permits to Nov. 14 from Aug. 15 to test the system and give participants more time to understand the process. The air board had already delayed compliance under the cap-and-trade program by a year, to 2013 from 2012. More than 400 regulated companies have been invited to participate in what the agency is describing as a practice allowance auction on Aug. 30. The state is prepared to delay the start of the program again should the “stress test” reveal failures in the system, Nichols said. “We certainly are prepared, or willing, to delay the start of the program if we need to, but it wouldn’t be something we’d do lightly and, as of now, we don’t think that’s going to happen,” she said. Market Participants PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) and other market participants pooled money to run their own market simulations, Fong Wan, PG&amp;E’s senior vice president of energy procurement, said during an interview in San Francisco. Nichols has been very open to that, he said. “If it’s not ready, I don’t think she will push us to go forward,” Wan said. “Everybody is trying really hard to make it work.” The air board has already put off a vote that would link the cap-and-trade program with a similar system in Quebec and allow companies to trade carbon permits across borders. Nichols said she expects the linkage to be established by the end of the year once the agency receives approval from Brown. California is also in talks with the Mexican state of Chiapas about partnering in efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, Nichols said. “They are looking at possibilities of working with California, probably not full linkage in a cap-and-trade system, but whether there are ways that they could be recognized in some sort of a market,” she said.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345123594000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345123998000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Stock</Title><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1345111298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 06:01:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just a suggestion.

People are willing to lend the government money for 30 Years at less than 3%, knowing full well that over the next 30 years the government is going to accumulate at least $50 trillion more in debt, or even more if the economy fails to grow at 3.5%/year or 5% or so after inflation. There is no way the government is ever going to be able to raise enough taxes to pay debts of that size, and if it tried it would burden the poor with such a massive load, and cause so many loan defaults among the poor that interest rates would rocketing upward from the losses of capital... Given this outlook, what the government is faced with is a great deal of idiotic investors who are willing to do the equivalent of write large checks to the government, nearly free of charge, rather like charitable donations to the U.S. Treasury. The herd of stock market fools is offering charitable contributions, too, doing the equivalent of loaning non-putable funds (to use bond market terminology) at absurdly low rates of return, which key off long term bond yields, the natural competition for stock market investment monies. Why should any rational government balance its budget given such a situation? There is no reason. It won't balance it until it runs out of cheap money to waste.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345127162000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:26:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345128003000-9</Id><Title>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report August 16, 2012</Title><Msg>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report Released: Released: August 16, 2012 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending August 10 Notes and Definitions Beginning with the report period for the week ending March 16, 2012, EIA is including salt dome and nonsalt-dome subtotals for the Producing Region in the Summary section.

Temperatures in the contiguous U.S. averaged 77.6 degrees in July, 3.3 degrees warmer than the 20th century average for the month. The previous warmest July was in 1936, when temperatures averaged 77.4 degrees. The largest deviations from normal were in states in the Midwest and Plains areas. The hot weather led to increases in natural gas consumption for power generation to meet air conditioning demand, particularly in areas that rely heavily on natural gas-fired power. Total natural gas consumed in power generation in July averaged 35.06 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, according to data released by BENTEK Energy LLC (Bentek), an increase of 4.42 Bcf per day (14.4 percent) from July 2011 (July 2011 averaged 77.0 degrees nationwide). Some of the year-over-year increase is due to changes in infrastructure and cost advantages of natural gas over coal. Natural gas power burn in the Midwest increased 1.20 Bcf per day from the previous year, from 2.18 Bcf per day to 3.38 Bcf per day, and power burn in the Southeast increased from 8.81 Bcf per day to 10.90 Bcf per day, according to Bentek estimates. Overview: (For the Week Ending Wednesday, August 15, 2012)•Natural gas prices generally registered overall decreases for the report week (Wednesday to Wednesday) at many of the country’s trading locations. The Henry Hub price, which had fallen 19 cents per million British thermal units (MMBtu) by Monday’s close, increased relatively modestly on Tuesday and Wednesday to close at $2.82 per MMBtu down 14 cents for the week. •The natural gas futures market dropped sharply after a modest increase earlier in the reporting week, then rebounded toward the end of the week. At the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the September 2012 natural gas contract lost 18.5 cents per MMBtu to close at $2.748 per MMBtu yesterday. •Working natural gas in storage rose last week to 3,261 Bcf as of Friday, August 10, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR). An implied storage build of 20 Bcf for the week positioned storage volumes 442 Bcf above year-ago levels. •The natural gas rotary rig count, as reported by Baker Hughes Incorporated on August 10, declined by 3 to 495 active units. Meanwhile, oil-directed rigs increased by 3 to 1,432 units. more summary data Prices: The Henry Hub day-ahead price registered an overall decrease for the week, declining sharply through Monday before regaining some ground on Tuesday and http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345143236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:53:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345143983000-17</Id><Topic><Title>False Left vs Right Paradigm</Title><Username>joe_rudi_49</Username><Timestamp>1345131394000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:36:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The United States has nothing to gain from continued warring in the Middle East.

The Ensus plant on Teeside, which can consume up to one million tonnes of wheat annually, has been closed for the past 15 months because cheap biofuels from the US had been undermining the EU market. However the European Union’s customs code committee has now acted to close the loophole in the tariff system that allowed the importation of Stateside biofuel to distort the market. This, together with the ending of US taxpayer subsidies for ethanol in the light of drastically reduced grain yield in the States, has been a major factor in the recent improvement of market conditions for biofuels. Ensus employs around 100 people directly. These have been kept on full pay throughout the shutdown and the plant also supports over 2,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. Apart from taking in the equivalent of approximately 5 per cent of the UK wheat crop, the Ensus plant produces high-protein animal feed from the refining process and this will be of major importance to the country’s livestock farmers. http://www.scotsman.com/business/food-drink-and-agriculture/bio-refinery-to-reopen-after-eu-closes-loophole-on-us-imports-1-2466961</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345153029000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:37:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345153491000-23</Id><Title>CO2 emissions in US drop to 20-year low</Title><Msg>CO2 emissions in US drop to 20-year low By ASSOCIATED PRESS | 8/16/12 1:56 PM EDT PITTSBURGH — In a surprising turnaround, the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere in the U.S. has fallen dramatically to its lowest level in 20 years, and government officials say the biggest reason is that cheap and plentiful natural gas has led many power plant operators to switch from dirtier-burning coal. Many of the world's leading climate scientists didn't see the drop coming, in large part because it happened as a result of market forces rather than direct government action against carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, said the shift away from coal is reason for "cautious optimism" about potential ways to deal with climate change. He said it demonstrates that "ultimately people follow their wallets" on global warming. "There's a very clear lesson here. What it shows is that if you make a cleaner energy source cheaper, you will displace dirtier sources," said Roger Pielke Jr., a climate expert at the University of Colorado. In a little-noticed technical report, the U.S. Energy Information Agency, a part of the Energy Department, said this month that total U.S. CO2 emissions for the first four months of this year fell to about 1992 levels. The Associated Press contacted environmental experts, scientists and utility companies and learned that virtually everyone believes the shift could have major long-term implications for U.S. energy policy. While conservation efforts, the lagging economy and greater use of renewable energy are factors in the CO2 decline, the drop-off is due mainly to low-priced natural gas, the agency said. A frenzy of shale gas drilling in the Northeast's Marcellus Shale and in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana has caused the wholesale price of natural gas to plummet from $7 or $8 per unit to about $3 over the past four years, making it cheaper to burn than coal for a given amount of energy produced. As a result, utilities are relying more than ever on gas-fired generating plants. Both government and industry experts said the biggest surprise is how quickly the electric industry turned away from coal. In 2005, coal was used to produce about half of all the electricity generated in the U.S. The Energy Information Agency said that fell to 34 percent in March, the lowest level since it began keeping records nearly 40 years ago. The question is whether the shift is just one bright spot in a big, gloomy picture, or a potentially larger trend. Coal and energy use are still growing rapidly in other countries, particularly China, and CO2 levels globally are rising, not falling. Moreover, changes in the marketplace — a boom in the economy, a fall in coal prices, a rise in natural gas — could stall or even reverse the shift. For example, U.S. emissions fell in 2008 and 2009, then rose in 2010 before falling again last year. Also, while natural gas burns cleaner than coal, it still emits some CO2. And drilling has its own environmental consequences, which are not yet fully understood. "Natural gas is not a long-term solution to the CO2 problem," Pielke warned. The International Energy Agency said the U.S. has cut carbon dioxide emissions more than any other country over the last six years. Total U.S. carbon emissions from energy consumption peaked at about 6 billion metric tons in 2007. Projections for this year are around 5.2 billion, and the 1990 figure was about 5 billion. China's emissions were estimated to be about 9 billion tons in 2011, accounting for about 29 percent of the global total. The U.S. accounted for approximately 16 percent.

After years of aeronautical review of the $1 billion Cape Wind plans, the FAA has concluded that the project “poses no hazard to air navigation”. The 486 MW offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound has now received all federal and state approvals and has been issued an operations lease by the federal government. Meanwhile, a 50 MW wind farm on the outskirts of Ulan Bator in Mongolia is nearing completion. Mongolia currently generates 80% of its electricity from five large coal-fired power plants and the region is the biggest exporter of coal to China. But the new wind farm being developed by Mongolian investment firm Newcom will provide 5% of Mongolia’s needs and represents the start of the region’s exploitation of its abundant renewable potential. According to experts, the region has vast swathes of land bathed in sunlight for more than 300 days a year and with an almost constant wind. All in all, Mongolia could have the potential to generate some 2.6 TW of renewable energy. Closer to home, Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas has signed a deal with Italian developer Santa Luce, part of the Fera group, for 11 of its V100-1.8 MW turbines. The V100s will be installed at the 19.8 MW Santa Luce Wind Power Plant in Tuscany starting in the third quarter of the year. But in less good news for the industry, Vestas is reported to be laying off 450 workers at its tower factory in Colorado and Indian turbine manufacturer Suzlon Energy may join it after reporting its second biggest quarterly loss since 2007. http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/articles/i/5330/?cid=4 ----------------- US Cape Wind project clears latest hurdle ‎ Energy Efficiency News - 11 hours ago</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345153995000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:53:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345154614000-26</Id><Title>Markey: Romney-Ryan ticket would cut Big Bird to pay Big Oil</Title><Msg>Markey: Romney-Ryan ticket would cut Big Bird to pay Big Oil By Ramsey Cox - 08/16/12 01:58 PM ET Rep.

Alison Redford visit to Vancouver omits Christy Clark By James Wood, Calgary HeraldAugust 15, 2012 Premier Alison Redford's brief visit to Vancouver Tuesday had no time for diplomacy as Alberta and British Columbia remain at odds over the Northern Gate-way pipeline proposal. But no resolution appears to be in sight in any case, with the showdown likely to drag on as the project moves through a lengthy regulatory and political process Redford spoke at the Canadian Bar Association's annual Canadian Legal Conference, but had no meetings with Premier Christy Clark or any other member of the B.C. government. The interprovincial spat was sparked after Clark demanded a "fair share" of the economic benefits of the $5.5-billion Gateway project, including a potential slice of the energy royalties that would come to Alberta. That was flatly rejected by Alberta and at a tense Council of the Federation meeting in late July. B.C. refused to take part in provincial discussions around Redford's call for a Canadian energy strategy. In a seeming swipe at Clark, Redford told the CBA crowd that premiers need to work together for the future of the Canada - not for the next election cycle. She told reporters the B.C. government can't make Alberta energy royalties a bar-gaining chip when it comes to whether Gateway goes ahead. "It's entirely appropriate for people in British Columbia to have a discussion with respect to whether or not this makes sense for people in British Columbia," said Redford in a recording of a media scrum posted online by her communications staff. "What I've been saying as premier of Alberta is that it's important for us all as political leaders to work together to ensure there is access to international markets and that there isn't any particular province that should get more access or less access to international markets based on a geographical location." If approved by the National Energy Board - and the federal cabinet - when the review process in completed in 2013, the project by Calgary-based Enbridge will carry bitumen to the B.C. coast and Asia-bound tankers. That would open vital new export markets for Alberta's oilsands, but public opinion appears to be running high against the project in B.C., with fears about the environmental impact of a potential spill along the pipeline's wilderness and coastline path. Clark's Liberal government faces an election in early 2013. The provincial NDP - far ahead in the polls - has come out unequivocally against the pipeline, while Clark has set a number of conditions for support. In a recent interview, Wil-drose Leader Danielle Smith said Gateway will be in stasis until the B.C. vote is complete. "Hopefully, after the election some of this will get sorted out and we can get back to having a reasonable discussion, a reasonable negotiation. But I don't anticipate there's going to be any discussion while we're watching what happens in B.C. to sort itself out," she said. Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt thinks a provincial vote isn't likely to reset the clock on the Gateway fight, given the positions staked out by the two main B.C. parties. http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/sight+Alberta+Northern+Gateway+pipeline+feud+with/7091843/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345155113000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345155123000-28</Id><Topic><Title>No end in sight for Alberta's Northern Gateway pipeline feud with B.C.</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345155113000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:11:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is little the Alberta government can do at this point to move Gateway for-ward as an individual project, though Redford should continue to emphasize the importance of energy exports to the country, he said. "I think they should talk about the general principles, maintain their jurisdictional issues, focus on the need for dialogue as part of a Canadian energy strategy, but not go hell-bent on behalf of one project," said Bratt. Redford noted Gateway is a commercial project, not an Alberta government initiative. She told reporters she expected there would be discussions with B.C. in the future, but noted that other provinces are onside with the Canadian energy strategy idea. "We have every other premier across the country understanding the importance of the energy economy and understanding that it's important for all Canadians that we do work together," she said.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345155123000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345155448000-29</Id><Topic><Title>No end in sight for Alberta's Northern Gateway pipeline feud with B.C.</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345155113000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:11:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doctors call for study of oilsands' impact on health Canadian Medical Association passes motion at annual meeting CBC News Posted: Aug 16, 2012 6:09 AM MT Last Updated: Aug 15, 2012 7:09 PM MT Doctors with the Canadian Medical Association are calling for more research into the health effects of resource extraction projects such as the http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2012/08/15/north-doctors-oil-sands.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345155448000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345156342000-30</Id><Title>Study: 26 corporations paid more to CEOs than in federal taxes</Title><Msg>Study: 26 corporations paid more to CEOs than in federal taxes By Bernie Becker - 08/16/12 12:45 PM ET More than two dozen large U.S. corporations paid their chief executives more than they handed over to the federal government in taxes in 2011, according to a new report from a liberal group. The Institute for Policy Studies says, in a study released Thursday, that those 26 chief executives work for companies that average $1 billion in pre-tax income — and are helped along by a tax code, the institute says, that encourages excess executive pay. For instance, the group argues that rolling back four tax breaks readily used by corporate America could create tens of thousands of jobs in clean energy or education. “Tax dollars are flowing from average Americans who depend on public services to the kingpins of America’s private sector,” the report says. “They’re subsidizing, directly and indirectly, the mega-million paychecks that go to the top executives at our nation’s biggest banks and corporations.” The 26 corporations cited in this year’s study is an increase of one from last year, and the institute says that seven corporations — Boeing, Chesapeake Energy, Ford, International Paper, Marsh &amp; McLennan, Motorola Mobility Holdings, and Motorola Solutions — made the list both years. In general, the group said companies were able to greatly reduce their tax bill by relying on offshore accounts, a credit encouraging research and development, another tax break allowing companies to more quickly write off the cost of new purchases and preferences for energy development. Boeing, for instance, is a heavy user of the research credit, while AT&amp;T has relied on the write-off provision known as accelerated depreciation. Chesapeake Energy, meanwhile, has leaned on credits for drilling. Companies cited in the study have questioned the methodology the group used, and also said that their use of certain tax provisions has allowed them to create jobs and investment in the U.S. economy. The institute used, among other things, salary, bonuses, non-equity compensation and stock values to calculate a chief executive’s earnings. It used Securities and Exchange Commission filings for how much a company paid in taxes, which don’t include what is paid to state, local or foreign governments and also, some analysts say, is not the best method of tracking exactly what a company pays to the federal government. http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/243991-study-26-corporations-paid-more-to-ceo-than-in-federal-taxes</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345156342000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:32:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345157579000-31</Id><Title>Cult of Equity/Debt Dead</Title><Msg>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/worship-stocks-dead-bill-gross-193648902.html Bill Gross gives a quite succinct and brilliant analysis of the impossibility of stocks and bonds returning anything approaching past returns going forward - the loss of the rising capitalization factor on cash flows due to interest rates approaching a limiting value of zero makes gains above the current paltry interest and dividend yields, both of which are bounded in their expansion by the rate of economic output (by the equality that GDP = rents + interest + profits (dividends) + wages) impossible.
