James Lankford told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “It is not that the fuel is economical, it’s not that the fuel is what the consumer wants, it’s that the federal government is requiring this much to be sold.” “Whole companies have sprung to life knowing that they have a potential of creating a product that the government mandates that everyone purchase,” Lankford told TheDC News Foundation, adding that the RFS should be repealed in such a way as to not totally disrupt the industry. Earlier this year, it was reported that fuel refiners were hitting the “blend wall” — the point at which refiners refuse to blend more ethanol into the fuel supply. Bloomberg reported in March that refiners will come up 400 million gallons short of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 13.8 billion gallon blending mandate. Currently, refiners blend 10 percent ethanol into the fuel supply, but the EPA has allowed a 15 percent blend since 2011. However, 15 percent ethanol-blended fuel — E15 — has been criticized by the oil industry as dangerous for some engines. Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told Congress last week that “millions of automobiles could face engine and fuel systems damage” from E15 and that the fuel was “an unnecessary risk to consumer safety, automobiles and small engines.” RFS repeal has attracted staunch opposition from Democrats, the ethanol industry, and environmentalists. “Keeping the renewable fuel standard on track is critical if America is to succeed in the clean energy race of</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371532120755</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 01:08:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371545059613-2</Id><Title>It must be that time of the month for the XOM oil pigs…</Title><Msg>Some are in obviously menstruating, and others are out of their "state" and in heat… A party miscegenation and #$%$ no doubt awaits.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371545059613</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 04:44:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371545189988-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanomics vs. German economics…</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371475723208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>German economic policies mean certain destruction for the oil industry.

Along with money and jobs, the boom has brought smells and fumes that are adding to the greenhouse gas emissions from Canada’s oil sands. Emissions from flaring, or burning of natural gas, methane and hydrogen sulphide associated with oil production, have risen in each of the last three years as drillers increased activity and the government failed to implement new industry targets. “There’s no new absolute target to reduce flare or vent emissions,” said James Vaughan, who works at the Alberta Energy Conservation Board’s surveillance branch, in an interview. “The economics for conserving gas just doesn’t seem to be there” because of a decline in natural gas prices. Flaring by companies including Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) is rising even as the Canadian government touts the country’s efforts to limit emissions to win support for TransCanada Corp. (TRP)’s Keystone XL pipeline. Prime Minister Stephen Harper met his European counterparts last week in Paris and London, appealing for them to stop EU plans to single out Alberta as a source of high-polluting energy.

Quinn signs bill to regulate fracking</Title><Msg>Gov. Quinn signs bill to regulate fracking By Julie WernauTribune reporter 2:58 p.m. CDT, June 17, 2013 Gov. Pat Quinn today signed sweeping legislation to regulate horizontal hydraulic fracturing, better known as "fracking." The move, which was expected, adds a bevy of restrictions and protections to an industry that while legal, was largely unregulated. Legislators, who overwhelmingly supported the bill, say they hope the new regulations will encourage the oil and gas industry to invest in Illinois, bringing jobs. Many oil and gas companies have held off on investing in drilling operations pending the outcome of proposed regulations. "It's about jobs, and it's about ensuring that our natural resources are protected for future generations," Quinn said. "I applaud the many environmental advocates and representatives from government, labor and industry who worked with us to make Illinois a national model for transparency, environmental safety and economic development." The legislation calls for oil and gas drillers to be subject to one of the toughest disclosure laws in the country. It also gives individuals the opportunity to appeal permits and launch lawsuits when they suspect the law has been skirted. "We know high-volume fracking is already underway in Illinois, and this legislation is needed more than ever to protect the environment while allowing for job creation and economic growth not just in downstate communities but throughout Illinois," said State Sen. Michael Frerichs (D-Champaign), who sponsored the legislation along with Rep. John Bradley (D-Marion). Environmental groups helped hash out the law, which places most of the responsibility for enforcing the law with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, together the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental groups said they would have preferred a moratorium on fracking over concerns about the impact a potential oil boom could have on the environment and public health but said t</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371563190747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371563670993-8</Id><Title>Iowa renewable fuels group sees more stations in state carrying E15</Title><Msg>Iowa renewable fuels group sees more stations in state carrying E15 1:40 PM, Jun 17, 2013 | by Christopher Doering Despite allegations that six Iowa gas stations are being forced to stop selling fuel blended with 15 percent ethanol because oil companies don’t want to supply them, a top official with the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said he was optimistic that many more stations would agree to carry it later this year. Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said after slowly building the ranks of stations carrying E15 — a blend of fuel containing 15 percent ethanol — to a half dozen he was confident that other businesses within the state, including smaller chains with about 50 stations in their portfolio, would soon want to sell it to motorists. “We’re having some very good conversations right now,” Shaw said in an interview without naming the companies. “I am optimistic that we can land one of those.” Shaw said just how many companies would agree to sell the corn-based blend this fall is uncertain. He said by October if smaller companies decide to carry E15 “then we’re looking at counting by the dozens” of stations, but if some of the mid-sized or large businesses embrace it the total could be “in the hundreds.” Shaw added that some of the bigger chains are evaluating E15 but so far they have not signaled whether they are interested in carrying the fuel. desmoinesregister</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371563670993</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371570906914-9</Id><Title>DARPA’s Black Credit Card – a slashing device aimed at XOM’s throat</Title><Msg>DARPA and the USAF seem to be leading the USA’s space program now.

Dlouhy Christopher Smith, acting assistant secretary for fossil energy at the Department of Energy, speaks on current government research on oil and gas during the Offshore Technology Conference at Reliant Park Thursday, May 9, 2013, in Houston. ( Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle ) Lawmakers and energy industry leaders will scrutinize the Obama administration’s handling of applications to export U.S. natural gas during a congressional hearing Tuesday. (See below for live coverage) A major issue: Whether the Energy Department should be giving greater priority to companies who have inked agreements, secured financial commitments and filed with federal regulators as part of their bids to build massive multi-billion-dollar facilities to liquefy natural gas so it can be shipped overseas. So far, the Energy Department has pledged to individually review the applications to export natural gas to countries that don’t have free-trade agreements with the United States, following an order it established in December. That order gave preference to companies that had begun a pre-filing process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. But the Energy Department’s process has drawn criticism both from companies that believe their export applications should be considered sooner, because they are further along in the FERC review process, as well as firms that had not entered the pre-filing process with FERC before the order was set last year. Still others insist the Energy Department should be moving more slowly in considering applications to export liquefied natural gas, lest widespread foreign sales of the fossil fuel hike prices domestically. Christopher Smith, the assistant secretary for fossil energy, is set to defend the process when he testifies before a House subcommittee Tuesday morning. “The Department of Energy is committed to moving this process forward as ex</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371579405109</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 14:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371580280667-14</Id><Title>What price of corn is needed to make ethanol blends competitive?</Title><Msg>What price of corn is needed to make ethanol blends competitive? Wednesday, June 12, 2013 By SCOTT IRWIN AND DARREL GOOD Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois URBANA, Ill. — We and others have written extensively about the impending ethanol blend wall. The blend wall is defined as the maximum amount of ethanol that can be consumed in the domestic motor fuel market if ethanol blending is limited to 10 percent of total motor fuel consumption. The blend wall becomes an issue when the implied RFS mandated requirement for renewable or conventional biofuels consumption exceeds the size of the blend wall. Technically, there is not a mandate for conventional biofuels consumption. There is a mandate for total consumption of biofuels and a mandate for consumption of advanced biofuels. Since advanced biofuels have generally not been economically attractive, consumption of those fuels has not exceeded the mandate so that the difference between the total and advanced mandate has been met with conventional biofuels, almost entirely corn-based ethanol. It is this difference that is thought of as the mandate for conventional biofuels. Routes As we have noted before, there are a number of pathways for meeting the RFS mandate for biofuels consumption when the implied mandate for conventional biofuels exceeds the blend wall. These include: use blending credits (in the form of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs) accumulated from previous discretionary blending to meet current year blending requirements; borrow against future blending requirements to meet current year blending requirements; discretionary blending of advanced biofuels; or expand consumption of higher ethanol blends in the form of E15 or E85. The use of blending credits was an attractive alternative for meeting blending requirements that exceeded the blend wall until the price of RINs credits exploded beginning in January this year. In addition, the supply of RINs cre</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371580280667</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 14:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371580448158-15</Id><Title>Top industry lobbyist says US oil and gas production could grow even more</Title><Msg>Top industry lobbyist says US oil and gas production could grow even more Posted on June 18, 2013 at 12:23 pm by Harry R. Weber American Petroleum Institute chief Jack Gerard said Tuesday that U.S. gas prices and the unemployment rate would be higher if not for the tremendous growth in oil production in America over the last few years. Gerard asserted during a meeting with the Houston Chronicle editorial board that keeping those measures from worsening is as important as creating a jobs boom and reducing pump prices. “Think of what the unemployment rate would be if we didn’t have the job growth we are already seeing,” Gerard said. “We need to put it in context and think how much worse it would have been if not for what has been happening over the last four or five years.” EIA: US daily crude supply could surge to 10M barrels by 2040 During his eight years in the White House, former President George W. Bush invoked a standard refrain during each of his State of the Union addresses: America is way too dependent on foreign oil. In his 2005 address, at a time when the unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent and the country had just come off a year in which 2.3 million new jobs were created, Bush said enacting his pro-energy industry policies was “essential to expand this economy and add new jobs.” Eight years later, the U.S. is producing record amounts of oil, energy firms are expanding their operations and the country is on a path to one day in the not too distant future becoming energy independent. Yet, the unemployment rate is at 7.6 percent and the country, through the first five months of the year, is on pace to add only about 2 million jobs in 2013.
