In addition, a gigawatt of offshore wind was added. Vattenfall Ormonde offshore wind farm: crew transfer vessel with Cumbrian landscape in background. Ben Barden Correction: an earlier version of this article stated that Europe had reached 1 gigawatt of offshore wind, but it has closer to 4.3 gigawatts offshore. The correct figure for 1 GW concerns new installations in 2012. While the news sounds good, the market itself has slowed down considerably, with only 6 GW having been newly installed in the first three quarters of 2012 – compared to 9.6 GW in the first three quarters of 2011. 90% of that amount has been installed over the past 13 years, with half of it being less than 6 years old. But 2009 was the peak year, with growth exceeding 10 GW. Since then, the market has remained below 10 GW. EWEA estimates that 100 GW of wind power is enough to replace 39 nuclear plants or, as EWEA head Christian Kjaer puts it, “We would need to burn 72 million tons of coal in coal plants to get that much electricity. If you had to transport all of that coal by train, you would need 750,000 wagons, and the train would be 11,500 km long – enough to reach from Brussels to Buenos Aires.” Increasingly, offshore wind is making up a bigger share of the pie. At the end of September, the first turbine from Denmark's Anholt project in the Baltic, where 111 Siemens turbines will eventually be installed with a total capacity of 400 MW, was connected to the grid. In addition, Renewable UK announced last week that 3 new wind farms with a total capacity of 967 MW were going into operation. The largest is Greater Gabbard, which has a capacity of 500 MW. On September 27, Sheringham Shoal was completely hooked up with 317 MW. Finally, Vattenfall's Ormonde wind farm with 150 MW was hooked up in mid-September. In Germany, new turbines were also added to the Bard Offshore 1 offshore wind farm, where construction will continue until the end of 2013. Near the mouth of the Thames, London Array now has more than 100 wind turbines with a total capacity of 360 MW, the first of which have been connected to the grid; the first construction phase will bring the project above 600 MW. Onshore, some wind farms of similar size have also been recently completed or are currently under construction: Romania's Fantanele and Gogealac along with the UK's Whitelee and Clyde, which have a capacity of 600, 539 and 360 MW.

The easiest way to identify such a policy is a rising debt/gdp ratio... You will find no such example in history The Bush years and the collapse that followed certainly offer no support. The recession that followed the election of Bush and the kickoff of his policies doesn't help either. The Reagan years fail to meet it, too, as they ended in a real estate crash and recession. They also began with a depression that followed the Tax Cut and onset of the leveraging process. The scheme was tried again during World War I and after World War I and ended in the Great Depression World War II does not offer much support either: it ended in a recession in the U.S. and nearly 60% drop in economic output in Europe when it was over. The war was financed through massive taxation, however, which did help retard speculation and the severity of the recession which followed the war. You can troll the annals of the 19th century and will find no support either...just one sorry tale of bubble run up by borrowing to finance war, most typically with unchecked speculation to by war profiteers and "businessmen", then a bust wiping out whatever was gained by the borrowing and speculation. .....

That was the strategy Nazi Germany used, that is until they were defeated at Stalingrad and had to gear up for Total War, something it could not do until it was too late. The Nazis followed the strategy of borrow-and-spend because it appealed to their conservative social policies, and allowed the Aryan people more breathing room for outdoors sports, recreation, eating, and it was hoped by the SS - breeding. So, the Nazis looted as many corporate pension plans as they could and filled them with Nazi bonds to fund the military... They taxed their people lightly, and employed a "lightening war" strategy which suited their rather meager supplies of fuel, war material, and war budget. The United States, on the other hand, under the leadership of a Democrat President, went to war with a Total War mentality. Enormous taxes were raised, the private sector was reduced to allow for a bigger government, and the sporting needs and wants of the population were not given much priority. This strategy was pursued by the USSR too. The tax-and-spend approach achieved much better results. The US continued to follow it during the Cold War to match the Soviets. The dubious fascist model of borrow-and-spend was followed by Reagan, but by then the Soviets were on their way to collapse anyway.

Europe would collapse if the U.S. Treasury market broke, and Japan would collapse, and China would go into revolution as their banking system would collapse and they'd have no market for their exports and hundreds of millions would be on the streets. The Saudi Royal family has their wealth in U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Treasury bonds and other U.S. and European stocks and bonds, and they could not survive a breakdown of U.S. credit. The Swiss banking system would collapse if the U.S. Treasury market did. Every major bank from Citigroup, to Bank of America, to JP Morgan, to Barclays, to BNP Paribas, to the Italy banks, the Spanish banks, the Russian banks, etc, etc would collapse if the Treasury market froze and their reserves lost value. Gold is no haven the way I look at it - all those economies' banking systems would seize up if the U.S. Treasury market did, and they'd face runs, and be selling gold. The evaporation of paper money and credit would leave few dollars or euros, or yen to bid gold with. So the only way forward as, as I see it, is the U.S. Treasury brings in more money to keep its credit rating up. So far Obama has only produced rhetoric on his plans to increase taxes.

Environmentalists see president's decision as a litmus test. WASHINGTON - President Obama's decision on whether to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline looms huge now that the election is over, and it could define Obama's legacy on energy and climate change. The oil industry, which is pushing hard for approval, describes the choice as the president's "first test to the American people." Environmental groups are promising that thousands of activists will demonstrate against the pipeline on Sunday outside the White House, just the beginning of the efforts that are being planned to sink the project. Energy analyst Charles Ebinger said he thought two weeks ago that there was little chance Obama would kill the pipeline. But he's increasingly less sure about that. "It appears major environmental organizations and strong environmental supporters of the president are suggesting this is a litmus test for whether the second Obama administration is with them or against them," said Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution research center in Washington. Last January, Obama denied a permit for the northern section of the pipeline, saying the route through Nebraska needed more environmental review. That put off his final decision on the 1,700-mile pipeline, which would bring oil from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, until after the election. The Congressional Research Service concluded this year that oil from the sands produces 14 to 20 percent more planet-warming gases than the average oil in U.S. refineries does. It found that approval of the pipeline could be the equivalent of putting up to 4 million more cars on the road. The figures are disputed, but even a more conservative new assessment by the energy research group IHS CERA found that the oil sands produced 9 percent more greenhouse gases than average. "This decision has huge implications in terms of what direction we go in as a nation in the near term in addressing climate," said Jim Murphy, senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation. Murphy said the decision is coming as extreme weather events such as Hurricane Sandy were focusing attention on climate change. Obama has given little clue about his intentions. He said last week that, in general, he believes that climate change is real and that there is an obligation to deal with it. But he also talked about jobs. "Understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused, on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that," he said. The Keystone project is a chance for the president to boost the economy and create jobs, said Marty Durbin, the executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural-gas industry. startribuneDOTcom/politics/national/179818031.html?refer=y</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353208969694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 22:22:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353209552052-25</Id><Title>Algae-derived biodiesel hits San Francisco-area gas stations</Title><Msg>Algae-derived biodiesel hits San Francisco-area gas stations By AutoWeek Fri 12:09 PM Environmentally conscious drivers may have a new way of fueling up: a diesel fuel blend that consists of 20 percent algae-derived biofuel and 80 percent regular diesel arrived at four gas stations in the San Francisco Bay area earlier this week. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the fuel retails for $4.25 per gallon—the same cost as conventional diesel in the region. B20 is billed as compatible with any diesel-powered vehicle. As with any loudly trumpeted energy “breakthrough,” there are plenty of reasons to be both hopeful and intensely skeptical about the development. Peoria, Ill.-based Solazyme, the company responsible for the production of the B20 being sold to California consumers, has successfully run everything from a naval vessel to an airliner on its biofuel. Yet there's no word on how B20 compares to conventional diesel performance-wise, or what impact higher biodiesel-petroleum ratios might have on regular diesel engines. Further, the algae used in Solazyme's fuels are grown in a lab-like environment, feeding on sugar in large, stainless-steel vats—an energy-intensive process in and of itself. Still, there are other promising developments on the biodiesel front that may contribute to making renewable fuels economically viable down the road. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a method of quickly and efficiently converting algae into “biocrude” after a few minutes in a pressure cooker. As an added plus, algae used in that process can be grown in brackish ponds rather than the stainless-steel containers employed by Solazyme. We're willing to watch the biofuel saga play out with guarded optimism. After all, there'd be something intensely satisfying about a carbon-neutral, renewably fueled and gratuitously smoky tractor pull. The B20 biofuel available in California represents a small, significant step in that direction. editorialDOTautosDOTmsnDOTcom/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=e8e17005-6d49-4480-920c-a618e75cf9f1</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353209552052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 22:32:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353210900256-26</Id><Title>Gigantic Italian Oil Refiner Switches To Green Diesel - could pull the rug out from under the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline</Title><Msg>Gigantic Italian Oil Refiner Switches To Green Diesel November 13, 2012 By Tina Casey Leave a Comment In the midst of continuing economic travails across Europe, the largest petroleum refiner in Italy is placing a bet on biofuels. The Italian energy company Eni S.p.A. will retrofit one of its diesel refineries in Venice to produce renewable diesel, using a system designed by the Illinois-based Honeywell company UOP. The switch will eventually ecompass Eni’s entire operation in Venice and, if the project is a success, it could serve as a model for putting underused fossil fuel facilities back to work in the new green economy right here in the U.S.A. Converting a Diesel Refinery to Renewable Diesel Honeywell calls the new process UOP/Eni Ecofining, since it was developed jointly by UOP and Eni. Converting an existing refinery to Ecofining is fairly straightforward. The process does not require unusual extremes of heat or pressure and the resulting product, Green Diesel, is chemically identical to its petroleum counterpart. “The process for producing green diesel operates in mild conditions and integrates well within existing petroleum refineries,” according to UOP. // // The two-step process can use oils from conventional biofuel crops like soy and palm, but in practice UOP and Eni have already moved on to next-generation, non-edible oils such as algae oil. Also notably included are inedible animal tallow (waste from meat processors) and waste grease, which otherwise present thorny disposal issues. How Ecofining Works To simplify the procedure down to the bones (you can find complete details at UOP’s Green Diesel pages) — first the feedstock is pressurized and mixed with hydrogen, then sent to a catalytic reactor where it is deoxygenated. This part of the process yields propane, water, and carbon dioxide as byproducts. After the byproducts are removed, the resulting diesel gets another dose of hydrogen gas and is sent to a second reactor for further processing. The final distillation steps yield more byproducts including additional propane. Leftover hydrogen is also recaptured and sent back to the two reactors. As for the Green Diesel product itself, because it is chemically identical to petroleum, it can be used as a drop-in substitute, without any modifications to the vehicle or its engine, or to the fueling infrastructure. UOP also claims that Green Diesel provides better performance than conventional biodiesel, especially in cold weather. Ecofining in the U.S.A. Ecofining is already making inroads in the U.S. market, with the announcement last spring of a new Ecofining facility in Louisiana, built by the Chicago-based biofuel company Emerald Biofuels. That’s great as far as new refinery construction goes, but of much greater interest to environmental advocates in the U.S. is the potential for switching existing petroleum refineries to biofuel, since that could pull the rug out from under the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone XL project would not necessarily provide more oil to the U.S. market. Its purpose is to convey tar sands oil from Canada to the global market, through Gulf Coast refineries. So far, the Obama Administration has resisted approving the pipeline on environmental grounds. Keystone advocates have muddied the issue by arguing that the “shovel-ready” project will create badly needed construction jobs, and it will preserve jobs in the refining sector. However, the emergence of conversion-friendly biorefining alternatives like Ecofining pretty much eliminates that argument. After all, if the creation and preservation of energy jobs is what it’s all about, there’s plenty of work to go around.
