A State Department official said the pipeline "remains unlikely to significantly impact the rate of development of the oilsands or the demand for heavy crude oil in the United States." Building the northern leg of TransCanada's controversial Keystone XL pipeline won't have a major impact on Alberta's oilsands development, the U.S. State Department says — a finding that might make it easier for the White House to approve the controversial project. A State Department official said the pipeline "remains unlikely to significantly impact the rate of development of the oilsands or the demand for heavy crude oil in the United States." Kerri-Ann Jones, an assistant secretary with the department, said the pipeline doesn't pose any greater risks to the environment than any other modes of transportation. The State Department has now given that new route its blessing, too, despite claims by environmentalists that the risks to the Sand Hills region of the state remained dire. "The new proposed route is 509 miles [835 km] shorter than the previously proposed route; however, it would be approximately 21 miles [34 km] longer in Nebraska to avoid sensitive areas including the … Sand Hills region," the lengthy report reads. The department's findings represent the clearing of a significant hurdle for TransCanada in its marathon bid to win approval from the Obama administration.

This puts the NextEra Energy Resources project, located in Riverside County, on the fast track to development. Current plans are for it to be built in two phases, with phase one done by August 2014, followed by phase two in October 2016. The McCoy Solar Project was granted the expedited review under the Governor’s Jobs and Economic Improvement Act of 2011. That Act was created with the intention of helping clean energy development and job job creation by reducing bureaucratic red-tape. Under the terms of the expedited review, McCoy has agreed to invest at least $100 million into California’s economy during development and construction. Construction is currently scheduled to last 46 months, creating over 340 jobs during that time. With 20 permanent new full-time jobs created once the project is completed. Once finished, the project will cover 4,315 acres of federal land and 477 acres of private land. And it will generate enough electricity to support about 264,000 homes. PV Magazine writes: “According to a Plan of Development submitted in August 2011, the photovoltaic project will be built over two phases. An initial 250 MW is set to be built by August 2014, with construction commencing in May 2013. The second phase is then expected to start when commercial operations have begun on the first and will see an additional 250 to 500 MW added. Work is expected to be completed by October 2016.” At 750 MW, this would be the largest solar power plant in the world if completed today.
