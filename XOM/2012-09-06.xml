The Labor Day holiday marks the end of the peak driving season in the United States and provides an opportunity to review year-to-date gasoline consumption. U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) current data indicate gasoline consumption in the first half of 2012 was 0.3 percent lower than in the comparable 2011 period. Economic growth, gasoline prices, and vehicle fleet efficiency are key determinants of gasoline use. So far in 2012, year-over-year economic growth that would generally lead to increased gasoline consumption has been more than offset by increases in retail gasoline prices and higher fuel efficiency of the in-use vehicle fleet. Prior to February 2012, the United States had consumed less gasoline year-over-year for 13 out of 15 months since November 2010 (Figure 1). In 2011, U.S. gasoline consumption decreased on average almost 240,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), a 2.7-percent reduction from its 2010 level. Consumption continued to weaken, but at a slowing rate, into the first quarter of this year, declining by about 110,000 bbl/d (1.3 percent) from the comparable year-earlier level. In February 2012, however, almost 20,000 bbl/d more gasoline was consumed than in February 2011, the first year-over-year increase in 11 months. While gasoline consumption through June was slightly lower year-over-year, consumption in the second quarter increased by almost 60,000 bbl/d compared with 2011. Real GDP for the first six months of 2012 is estimated to be 2.3 percent higher than for the same period in 2011. According to EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) model, the short-term income elasticity for total vehicle miles traveled by light- and heavy-duty vehicles together is about 0.58 (meaning a 1-percent increase in income results in a 0.58-percent increase in miles traveled). This elasticity estimate suggests motor fuel consumption should have been 1.3 percent higher this year than in the same period in 2011, assuming no year-over-year change in fuel prices, the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and the light-duty vehicle share of total travel. In its STEO model, EIA estimates the short-term elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to the price of gasoline to be about -0.04 (a 1-percent increase in prices leads to a 0.04 percent decline in highway travel). The average pump price of regular-grade gasoline during the first six months of 2012 was 3.3 percent higher than the same period last year. Motor gasoline consumption would therefore have been slightly more than 0.1 percent lower than in 2011, assuming no year-over-year change in economic activity or improvement in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet. Combined, the estimated net effect of income and price changes and their respective elasticity estimates during the first half of 2012 imply a 1.2-percent increase in gasoline consumption over the comparable year-ago period assuming a constant share of light-duty vehicle travel. A rough estimate of average gasoline use per mile traveled, a measure of the efficiency of the in-use vehicle fleet, can be obtained by dividing total gasoline consumption reported by EIA by preliminary total highway miles travelled reported by the Federal Highway Administration. Based on this measure, the implied average fuel efficiency of the in-use light-duty vehicle fleet rose by roughly 1.1 percent in the first half of 2012 versus the comparable year-ago period. Efficiency gains likely reflect both increasingly stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that were implemented for light-duty trucks starting in model year 2008 and for passenger cars starting in model year 2011 and consumer vehicle choices in an era of higher gasoline prices. The net effect of the income, price, and fuel efficiency impacts as modeled by EIA implies almost flat year-over-year gasoline consumption. Keeping in mind that measures of freight activity suggest some actual decline in the light-duty vehicle share of total vehicle travel between the first half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, the STEO modeling appears to be roughly consistent with, the 0.3-percent year-over-year decline in gasoline use reflected in EIA's current data for January through June 2012. Hurricane Isaac's Impact Seen in Latest Weekly Data The impact of Hurricane Isaac on the U.S. petroleum industry is easily detectable in the weekly petroleum supply data for the week ending August 31, released earlier today. Data showed that U.S. crude oil production fell by 772 thousand bbl/d compared with the prior week, as much of the production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in during most of last week. Additionally, petroleum imports into the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) also dropped considerably (about 1.4 million bbl/d) compared with the previous week. Partly offsetting the drop in crude oil production and imports was a noticeable drop in refinery crude oil inputs (678 thousand bbl/d). However, the drop in refinery inputs was much less than the drop in production and imports of crude oil, so many companies had to draw down crude oil inventories to make up for the loss in supply, causing U.S. crude oil inventories to fall by 7.4 million barrels, with almost all of the drop (7.1 million barrels) seen in PADD 3. Unlike the drop in crude oil production, petroleum imports, refinery inputs, and crude oil inventories, keen analysts will note that reported petroleum product exports are unchanged compared with the prior week, despite the likelihood that exports from the Gulf Coast were also partly curtailed due to Hurricane Isaac. This is because EIA does not survey exporters, but instead estimates weekly exports using models driven by monthly data, which means that these estimates only change once a month. While EIA could try to adjust the estimates to account for the impact Hurricane Isaac may have had on exports during the week ending August 31, such adjustments would be little more than educated guesses based mostly on anecdotal information. While we realize that exports are likely to be somewhat overstated in the latest weekly report, in subsequent weeks the reported export estimates are likely to be similarly understated as exporters seek to make up for the days affected by Hurricane Isaac. In the end, we expect that Hurricane Isaac will not significantly affect cumulative petroleum product exports over last week and the next several weeks. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices increase for the 9th consecutive week The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased seven cents this week to $3.84 per gallon, 17 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices have increased in all regions of the Nation for the last two weeks. The East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Rocky Mountain region prices all increased more than six cents from last week, to $3.81 per gallon, $3.65 per gallon, and $3.64 per gallon, respectively. The Midwest price saw the largest increase, at 10 cents, to reach $3.88 per gallon. The West Coast price remains the highest in the Nation at $4.07 per gallon, an increase of three cents from last week. The national average diesel fuel price increased four cents to $4.13 per gallon, 26 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices increased in all regions of the Nation for the fifth consecutive week. For the second straight week, the largest increase was on the West Coast, where prices rose seven cents to $4.42 per gallon. The Rocky Mountain average price is $4.22 per gallon, up seven cents from last week. On the Gulf Coast, the average diesel price is up five cents to $4.03 per gallon. The price on the East Coast increased three cents to $4.10 per gallon. Rounding out the regions, the Midwest price had the smallest increase for the third consecutive week, rising two cents to $4.07 per gallon. Propane inventories continue to rise Total U.S. stocks of propane continued a seasonal build last week, adding 0.8 million barrels of new inventory to end at 72.5 million barrels, 18.9 million barrels (35 percent) higher than a year ago. The Gulf Coast region led the gain with 0.5 million barrels of new stocks. Meanwhile, the East Coast, Midwest and Rocky Mountain/West Coast regions each added 0.1 million barrels of propane.

U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) current data indicate gasoline consumption in the first half of 2012 was 0.3 percent lower than in the comparable 2011 period. Economic growth, gasoline prices, and vehicle fleet efficiency are key determinants of gasoline use. So far in 2012, year-over-year economic growth that would generally lead to increased gasoline consumption has been more than offset by increases in retail gasoline prices and higher fuel efficiency of the in-use vehicle fleet. Prior to February 2012, the United States had consumed less gasoline year-over-year for 13 out of 15 months since November 2010 (Figure 1). In 2011, U.S. gasoline consumption decreased on average almost 240,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), a 2.7-percent reduction from its 2010 level. Consumption continued to weaken, but at a slowing rate, into the first quarter of this year, declining by about 110,000 bbl/d (1.3 percent) from the comparable year-earlier level. In February 2012, however, almost 20,000 bbl/d more gasoline was consumed than in February 2011, the first year-over-year increase in 11 months. While gasoline consumption through June was slightly lower year-over-year, consumption in the second quarter increased by almost 60,000 bbl/d compared with 2011. Real GDP for the first six months of 2012 is estimated to be 2.3 percent higher than for the same period in 2011. According to EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) model, the short-term income elasticity for total vehicle miles traveled by light- and heavy-duty vehicles together is about 0.58 (meaning a 1-percent increase in income results in a 0.58-percent increase in miles traveled). This elasticity estimate suggests motor fuel consumption should have been 1.3 percent higher this year than in the same period in 2011, assuming no year-over-year change in fuel prices, the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and the light-duty vehicle share of total travel. In its STEO model, EIA estimates the short-term elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to the price of gasoline to be about -0.04 (a 1-percent increase in prices leads to a 0.04 percent decline in highway travel). The average pump price of regular-grade gasoline during the first six months of 2012 was 3.3 percent higher than the same period last year. Motor gasoline consumption would therefore have been slightly more than 0.1 percent lower than in 2011, assuming no year-over-year change in economic activity or improvement in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet. Combined, the estimated net effect of income and price changes and their respective elasticity estimates during the first half of 2012 imply a 1.2-percent increase in gasoline consumption over the comparable year-ago period assuming a constant share of light-duty vehicle travel. A rough estimate of average gasoline use per mile traveled, a measure of the efficiency of the in-use vehicle fleet, can be obtained by dividing total gasoline consumption reported by EIA by preliminary total highway miles travelled reported by the Federal Highway Administration. Based on this measure, the implied average fuel efficiency of the in-use light-duty vehicle fleet rose by roughly 1.1 percent in the first half of 2012 versus the comparable year-ago period. Efficiency gains likely reflect both increasingly stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that were implemented for light-duty trucks starting in model year 2008 and for passenger cars starting in model year 2011 and consumer vehicle choices in an era of higher gasoline prices. The net effect of the income, price, and fuel efficiency impacts as modeled by EIA implies almost flat year-over-year gasoline consumption. Keeping in mind that measures of freight activity suggest some actual decline in the light-duty vehicle share of total vehicle travel between the first half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, the STEO modeling appears to be roughly consistent with, the 0.3-percent year-over-year decline in gasoline use reflected in EIA's current data for January through June 2012. Hurricane Isaac's Impact Seen in Latest Weekly Data The impact of Hurricane Isaac on the U.S. petroleum industry is easily detectable in the weekly petroleum supply data for the week ending August 31, released earlier today. Data showed that U.S. crude oil production fell by 772 thousand bbl/d compared with the prior week, as much of the production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in during most of last week. Additionally, petroleum imports into the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) also dropped considerably (about 1.4 million bbl/d) compared with the previous week. Partly offsetting the drop in crude oil production and imports was a noticeable drop in refinery crude oil inputs (678 thousand bbl/d). However, the drop in refinery inputs was much less than the drop in production and imports of crude oil, so many companies had to draw down crude oil inventories to make up for the loss in supply, causing U.S. crude oil inventories to fall by 7.4 million barrels, with almost all of the drop (7.1 million barrels) seen in PADD 3. Unlike the drop in crude oil production, petroleum imports, refinery inputs, and crude oil inventories, keen analysts will note that reported petroleum product exports are unchanged compared with the prior week, despite the likelihood that exports from the Gulf Coast were also partly curtailed due to Hurricane Isaac. This is because EIA does not survey exporters, but instead estimates weekly exports using models driven by monthly data, which means that these estimates only change once a month. While EIA could try to adjust the estimates to account for the impact Hurricane Isaac may have had on exports during the week ending August 31, such adjustments would be little more than educated guesses based mostly on anecdotal information. While we realize that exports are likely to be somewhat overstated in the latest weekly report, in subsequent weeks the reported export estimates are likely to be similarly understated as exporters seek to make up for the days affected by Hurricane Isaac. In the end, we expect that Hurricane Isaac will not significantly affect cumulative petroleum product exports over last week and the next several weeks. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices increase for the 9th consecutive week The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased seven cents this week to $3.84 per gallon, 17 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices have increased in all regions of the Nation for the last two weeks. The East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Rocky Mountain region prices all increased more than six cents from last week, to $3.81 per gallon, $3.65 per gallon, and $3.64 per gallon, respectively. The Midwest price saw the largest increase, at 10 cents, to reach $3.88 per gallon. The West Coast price remains the highest in the Nation at $4.07 per gallon, an increase of three cents from last week. The national average diesel fuel price increased four cents to $4.13 per gallon, 26 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices increased in all regions of the Nation for the fifth consecutive week. For the second straight week, the largest increase was on the West Coast, where prices rose seven cents to $4.42 per gallon. The Rocky Mountain average price is $4.22 per gallon, up seven cents from last week. On the Gulf Coast, the average diesel price is up five cents to $4.03 per gallon. The price on the East Coast increased three cents to $4.10 per gallon. Rounding out the regions, the Midwest price had the smallest increase for the third consecutive week, rising two cents to $4.07 per gallon. Propane inventories continue to rise Total U.S. stocks of propane continued a seasonal build last week, adding 0.8 million barrels of new inventory to end at 72.5 million barrels, 18.9 million barrels (35 percent) higher than a year ago. The Gulf Coast region led the gain with 0.5 million barrels of new stocks. Meanwhile, the East Coast, Midwest and Rocky Mountain/West Coast regions each added 0.1 million barrels of propane. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 6.9 percent of total propane inventories. eia URL posted at stockhouse on the XOM message board</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346956099593</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346956463147-30</Id><Title>B.C. sends former A.G.

Geoff Plant to Enbridge hearings CBC News Posted: Sep 6, 2012 9:21 AM MT Last Updated: Sep 6, 2012 11:04 AM MT Read 51 comments The B.C. government has appointed former attorney general Geoff Plant as the province's chief legal strategist at the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline review hearings. Plant will lead the province's cross-examination at the hearings, which continue in Edmonton today, Environment Minister Terry Lake announced on Thursday morning. Premier Christy Clark said Plant, who was the attorney general of British Columbia and minister responsible for treaty negotiations from 2001 to 2005, will lead a legal "A team" at the complex hearings. "There are a lot of regulatory hearings that government gets involved in. This is not your average run of the mill hearing," said Clark. "Most people say he's one of the best legal minds in the country. He really gets politics. He really understands government and he understands how important the environment is to the people of our province." Final hearings underway B.C.'s cross-examination will focus on the financial liability and insurance of the operators of the Northern Gateway Pipeline in the event of a spill and the company's plans for a full environmental restoration after a possible spill, said Lake. The final hearings underway in Edmonton are focusing on the economic, financial and tolling issues linked to the project. The final hearings will them move to to Prince George in October, where they will focus on environmental and socio-economic effects, impacts on landowners and land use, routing, design and construction, and operation safety. They then move to Prince Rupert in November where they will focus on aboriginal rights and interests, environmental and socio-economic effects from the marine terminal and shipping, marine safety and accident response, and public and community consultation. Final arguments will be presented to the panel next spring, which must make a recommendation by the end of 2013. Ottawa is expected to make a decision within six months of the panel's review.

"Today is about making sure that we're protecting the environment no matter what fair share we finally ultimately negotitate for BC in terms of jobs and economic benefit, there is no fair share we can make up for catastrophic damage to the environment," Clark said, adding that Alberta premier Alison Redford should call her to negotiate "fair share." Clark made the comments in a surprise appearence with Environment Minister Terry Lake and former BC Attorney General Jeff Plant at the Vancouver International Airport this morning before Lake and Plant boarded their flight for Edmonton. However, critics disagreed with Clark's suggestion that BC could reach a deal with Alberta insuring the province against a potential oil spill. Well-known environmentalist and author Tzeporah Berman said that Clark is "grasping at straws." "No matter what she negotiates today she cannot assure BC that there will not be oil spills and leaks," Berman said. "She needs to stop trying to put a price on this unacceptable risk and just stand up for our coast." The Wilderness Committee's Ben West called Clark's comments about fair sharing "political theatre". "It's hard to imagine someone saying so much without committing to anything. She is clearly getting the message that people didn't like her emphasis of financial compensation but she still is far from actually saying that she would stop the pipelines let alone how she would do it," West said. Questions in Edmonton focused on whether Enbridge can pay for an oil spill Plant said that the province will focus mainly on Enbridge's ability to respond to and pay for "disasterous spill or accidents" at the hearings in Edmonton, while the hearings in Prince George and Prince Rupert will focus on "technical issues" related to the five minimum requirements the province released in July, which include First Nations accommodation, benefit-sharing, improved marine and land spill response. The proposed Northern Gateway pipeline involves constructing two pipelines approximately 1,170 km long carrying up to 525,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen (dilbit) from Bruderheim, AB to Kitimat, BC. The other pipeline would carry 193,000 barrels of condensate per day east to Bruderheim. Enbridge Inc. has come under close scrutiny and criticism for its poor record on pipeline safety and oil spill response. Across all of Enbridge’s operations there were 610 spills that released close to 132,000 barrels (21 million litres) of hydrocarbons into the environment between 1999 and 2008, according to the Polaris Institute. The most high profile spill to date was a 2010 spill in Michigan which was the largest on land oil spill in U.S. history, leaking 843,444 gallons of diluted bitumen and costing more than $800 million US in damage. "The government will focus on technical issues of what it would mean to have as British Columbia requires a world class world leading response capacity for either land based or marine based accidents and spills," Plant said, emphasizing that this is an important opportunity for the government to ask questions on behalf of British Columbians. Enbridge to be "in the hotseat" during cross-examinations "Enbridge is rightly going to be in the hotseat now at these hearings, and boy do they have a lot of explaining to do," said Josh Paterson of West Coast Environmental Law. "We’ve seen just how much we can trust them and their information whether it's misleading the public by deleting islands in their ads to make the tanker route appear safe, or their unspeakably bad safety practices that led to the US’s worst ever inland oil spill in Kalamazoo that have been slammed by the US."

Mary Landrieu (D-La.) told The Hill on Thursday. Landrieu said in a letter hand-delivered Monday to President Obama that the flooding caused by Hurricane Isaac calls for another debate on revenue payments to coastal states. The letter signaled the Louisiana Democrat would push a bill to alter the payment structure and schedule next Congress after coming up short last year. “Our effort to secure robust revenue sharing for coastal communities has been an ongoing fight for decades,” Landrieu said in the letter to Obama that asked for his support. “Currently, onshore states receive 50 percent of revenues. Coastal states, particularly Louisiana, should receive a similar allotment so they can engage these funds in flood protection.” Landrieu staff said the retiring Bingaman was one of the most significant obstacles to getting Landrieu’s offshore revenue amendment tacked to a drilling-safety bill in July 2011. It never reached a vote because Landrieu and some Republicans walked out of the meeting when it appeared the proposal would fail. With Bingaman out of the picture next session, Landrieu sees an opportunity, staff said. Her staff said that Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who appears poised to grab the committee gavel if Democrats retain the Senate after the Nov. 6 election, intimated he could eventually support the bill. And if Republicans take the Senate, committee ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — who supported Landrieu’s first attempt — would likely head the committee. The four states Landrieu seeks to aid — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas — are scheduled to get 37.5 percent of federal revenues from energy production in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in 2017. Landrieu’s proposal would lift the $500 million cap on those royalties and start paying the states in 2015. It also would create a revenue-sharing mechanism for states engaging in future federal offshore renewable energy production. Staff admitted the renewable energy portion of the bill was scraped together at the last second to sway some Democrats. Staff said those Democrats hinted they liked the idea but ultimately decided the language needed more work.

Once built, it will be capable of powering 40% of the homes in Scotland. For a price of £4.5 billion, the complex located off Caithness will contain 339 turbines covering a total of 300 square kilometres, and have a generation capacity of 1.5 gigawatts.

"The renewable industry has hailed it as a watershed moment but warned these new deep water farms might only be fully realised if the government provides policy stability by pushing through its proposed Energy Bill." The wind farm is being put together by Moray Offshore Renewables, which is a joint venture between the Spanish oil company Repsol, and part of the Portuguese power group EDP. "We estimate that the project will be capable of supplying the electricity needs of 800,000 to 1m households ...
