Maybe the markets are headed for a drawdown. The saying is out in May, stay away. Just think of the transfer of wealth going on through stocks, bonds, commodities, banking, government.

Cultural Marxism will lead only to the decline of the USA. If it goes on long enough it will become a third world country. A Green Party approach would fix America's dangerous decline in the sciences, its faltering industrial power, and its budget difficulties. Large numbers of low income people belong to the ideology that supports Cultural Marxism and they use more energy and carbon intensive products per $ of their income than higher income people. So a Green agenda that taxes carbon and pollution will necessarily force a large tax burden on them. High taxes on oil, gas, and electricity would plug America's fiscal gap too, and make America's tax system less progressive and more efficient at subsidizing success in lieu of failure. In Europe the lower classes have been taught by the government to protect the environment, and fully support this approach. They are willing tax payers and contributors... It really is irrelevant if global warming is real too... People believe it pay their taxes...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364737471208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 09:44:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364739369785-9</Id><Title>Exxon pipeline leaks thousands of barrels of Canadian oil in Arkansas</Title><Msg>#$%$ it!</Msg><Username>adamwangwang47</Username><Timestamp>1364739369785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:16:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364764487119-10</Id><Title>Free Tar Sands Oil for Those Living Close to Leaking Pipeline</Title><Msg>Plus 100s of new jobs created to cleanup the oil.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1364764487119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 17:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364772747269-11</Id><Topic><Title>The flawed Roman way...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358890917991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 16:41:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you Hansesteelyard,for your insightful,informative writing.
