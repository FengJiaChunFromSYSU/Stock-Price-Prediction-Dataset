The fact is that XOM is widely acknowledged to be the best of the majors at estimating costs and bringing projects in on time and on budget. A good example is the Sakalin Island LNG project that XOM brought in on tme and on budget unlike Shell which, on their Sakalin project, was 300% over budget and as a result had to sell out to the Russians. That said, all projects can have some problems. In PNG, these were currency and land disputes with the locals - the latter the responsibility of the government. Despite all that this project will still be profitable., 2. OPEC has controlled most of the world's reserves for many many years. So nothing new there. 3. Similarly oil companies have faced these same 'massive' taxes for generations, and XOM has still been massively profitable. 4. A BTU from natural gas is indeed the same as a BTU from oil. It's profitability is not necessarily the same. LNG projects have a history of long lives and excellent profitability and are uniquely suited to companies with lots of capital and low debt: i.e., XOM. Shale projects are more expensive than crude but have been profitable and will probably continue to be so. They are being expanded. 5. The fact that LNG is sold at a price linked to crude has been the basis of its profitability over the years. They would probably not have been so successful if that were not the case. With natural gas prices declining, that link is even more important in marketing and in preserving profitability today. 6. See #1 above. XOM has not been forced out of any projects in Russia and has commenced a new JV with Rosneft for Arctic exploration. Given that you have such a complete lack of understanding of the industry, it is fortunate that you are out of the stock. Maybe you'd also be happier being off the board.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352783505328</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:11:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352783686536-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOP will be moving left to win elections</Title><Username>potterkimberly44</Username><Timestamp>1352771269279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 20:47:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has piled up more debt than all of those combined and plans to add at least another $4 trillion during his second term.

Natural gas can easily replace coal in power plants which it is rapidly doing as its price stays low. It won't replace oil in trains but if/when the trucking industry believes CNG prices will be low for a long period, it will begin to replace diesel in trucks. Large, cheap supplies of natural gas (unless Obama succeeds in restricting them) will negatively impact oil prices in the US. But will be much less economic to export from the US so the Oil we are currently importing will just be diverted to other countries, like China or India.

Last fall, his stance on the Keystone project exemplified his waffling and contradictory climate policy. Faced with a solid front of the nation's foremost Earth scientists explaining that tapping Canada's tar sands for oil was a climate disaster, and confronting the biggest in-the-streets environmental movement in decades, the president delayed for a year a decision on whether to grant the required border-crossing permit. That put the northern portion of the pipeline on hold until after the election, but it allowed construction of the southern half to go forward -- accompanied by civil-disobedience protests in East Texas. And what's happened in the intervening 12 months? America has gone through the hottest year in its history, with an epic drought that raised world grain prices 40 percent; the Arctic continued to melt at such a shocking rate that NASA scientist James Hansen declared it a "planetary emergency"; and Superstorm Sandy washed ashore with one of the lowest barometric pressures ever recorded north of Cape Hatteras. As the cover of that radical rag Bloomberg Businessweek put it in large letters: "It's Global Warming, Stupid." Meanwhile, activists on the Canadian side have robbed the administration of the only real argument for proceeding with Keystone: They've rallied to effectively stop construction of the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the British Columbia coast, meaning that the tar sands tycoons can't simply send their oil off to China by some other route. Those oil barons, certain they will prevail, have kept pouring money into Washington. Just last month, a New York Times profile of a presidential confidante, Anita Dunn, revealed that her lobbying firm was on the Keystone payroll. In other words, in Washington terms, the pipeline is still wired. One oil executive, the morning after Tuesday's election, was quoted as saying, "We expect it will be approved." If that happens, it will mean the president doesn't understand that his legacy requires dealing with climate change -- and that dealing with climate change requires leaving carbon in the ground. There are lots of other actions that will be necessary, too: A serious tax on carbon, for instance, long has been the sine qua non of real progress. But that requires getting House Majority Leader John Boehner and the House Republicans on board. The truth is, we've got to do it all, and it will be hard; harder than anything else the administration is considering, since it runs straight up against the richest industry on Earth. Maybe the president was being serious when he promised in his victory speech, to one of the loudest cheers, an "America not threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet." Maybe he understands that we're ready for action -- exit polling showed that 42percent of Americans said the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy was an important factor in their choice. If so -- if he really gets that this is the legacy issue of all legacy issues, one that stretches out into geologic time -- then he'll listen to the scientists and not the lobbyists. Keystone is his first best chance to help keep serious quantities of carbon out of the atmosphere. That pipeline, if built, will carry the same amount of oil saved by his auto mileage standards. If it's approved, it will mean, for those of us who care about the environment, that his second term canceled out the one best thing done in his first. If he blocks it, he will emerge as a true champion, with an inspired movement behind him ready to take on the next, even harder, battles.

Not going to speculate on what a final package may look like,” Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith told The Hill. The Speaker is seeking a deal with the White House that would include new tax revenues without raising rates, a stance that has shifted the focus to the deductions and loopholes in the IRS code. The American Petroleum Institute (API), the industry’s biggest lobbying group, is bracing for fresh attacks against incentives that oil companies say are nourishing the nation’s oil-and-gas production boom. The group is announcing a TV and print ad campaign Tuesday aimed at shoring up support for the billions of dollars in deductions that companies receive on drilling costs, income from domestic projects and other areas. API CEO Jack Gerard told reporters last week that lawmakers shouldn’t tinker with specific industries’ deductions outside of comprehensive tax code reform, which he believed would begin in earnest next year. “The oil-and-gas industry will not be singled out for punitive treatment,” Gerard said. Republicans and oil-state Democrats in recent years have helped the industry fight off an array of White House- and Democratic leadership-led efforts to nix the deductions. Some bills have targeted only the “Big Five” oil companies, such as Exxon and Chevron, while others would reach independent producers too. All have failed. But Boehner, who is battling calls from Democrats to raise tax rates on the wealthy, has taken a more conciliatory tone since President Obama’s reelection while signaling openness to raising revenues. Capitol Hill Democrats, meanwhile, are readying fresh attacks against the oil industry. Aides to Democrats including Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) said Monday that they would seek to end oil-industry tax breaks in talks regarding the fiscal cliff. And while any final deal will get hammered out behind closed doors, environmentalists and perhaps some Democrats will seek to ramp up public pressure over what they call unneeded taxpayer support for a profitable industry. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said bringing a bill to the floor in the lame-duck session that strips the oil industry of its deductions is a “possibility.” Josh Saks, legislative director with the National Wildlife Federation, said the GOP-dominated House is a tougher challenge than the Senate when it comes to building support for nixing the breaks. He said his group is looking to work with Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who will move over to the Senate in January, and Rep. Steven LaTourette (R-Ohio), a centrist who is not returning to Congress. Oil Change International, which opposes fossil-fuel subsidies, and allied groups are planning a TV and online ad campaign during the lame-duck session that calls for ending the tax breaks in a fiscal deal. Steve Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International, said the political landscape has become more conducive to ending various forms of taxpayer support for the fossil fuel industry. “I think on the shortlist of things that may be politically possible to raise revenues from, the very profitable and very successful fossil-fuel industry in the United States is on it,” he said. “There is political space, for sure.” Market analysts are predicting the industry deductions will be at risk as the fiscal-cliff negotiations unfold. “[T]ax incentives for oil companies that encourage investment may return to the focus as well,” Moody’s said in a wide-ranging post-election analysis Monday, noting White House opposition to various deductions. “The administration believes the energy industry needs no assistance at a time of tight federal budgets and disputes over government spending. The Obama administration may try to end tax incentives for [exploration and production] companies, removing depletion allowances and deductions for intangible drilling costs for [exploration and production] companies,” Moody’s said. But it remains unclear what specific industry deductions might be up for discussion. While some tax break repeal proposals in recent years would only target major integrated companies, the White House’s fiscal 2013 budget plan called for raising roughly $40 billion over 10 years with a plan that would hit “Big Oil” and, in some cases, independent producers. The White House plan would repeal the so-called percentage depletion allowance, which isn’t available to the big integrated companies, as well as repeal expensing of “intangible” drilling costs, which is fully available to independent companies and partially for the others, among other provisions. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/267455-oil-industry-tax-breaks-face-new-peril-in-fiscal-cliff-talks</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352818866577</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 10:01:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352822483711-12</Id><Topic><Title>Oil industry tax breaks face the ‘fiscal cliff’ - John Boehner (R-Ohio) won’t rule out targeting oil-industry deductions</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352818866577</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 10:01:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We know what Hugo Chavz did,he just took over the oil industry.

The president has faced rising public pressure in the wake of superstorm Sandy to deliver on his promise to act on global warming. But none of those calling on Obama to act carries the moral authority of Gore, who has devoted his post-political career to building a climate movement. Now, Gore said, it is the president's turn. He urged Obama to immediately begin pushing for a carbon tax in negotiations over the "fiscal cliff" budget crisis. The vice-president's intervention for a carbon tax could give critical support to an idea that has gained currency since the election – at least among Washington thinktanks. The conservative American Enterprise Institute held an all-day seminar on the carbon tax on Tuesday. "I think all who look at these circumstances should agree that president Obama does have a mandate, should he choose to use it, to act boldly to solve the climate crisis, to begin solving it," Gore told the Guardian in a telephone interview. "He has the mandate. He has the opportunity, and he has the inherent ability to provide the leadership needed. I really hope that he will, and I will respectfully ask him to do exactly that." Gore will ratchet up his own pressure on Wednesday evening when he hosts a 24-hour live online broadcast from New York city on the connections between climate change and extreme events such as Sandy. The Dirty Weather Report, produced by his Climate Reality Project, will kick off with footage from New Jersey's devastated shore and interviews with governors Chris Christie and Andrew Cuomo. It begins at 8pm eastern time. In terms of policy specifics, Gore said he wanted the White House and Congress to start an immediate push for a carbon tax. "It will be difficult for sure but we can back away from the fiscal cliff and the climate cliff at the same time," he said. "One way is with a carbon tax." It would require a balancing act, but "the most direct policy solution to the climate crisis is a carbon tax, offset by reductions in taxes on wages," Gore went on to explain. "By including the carbon tax in the solution to the fiscal cliff we can [get] away from the climate cliff." Gore's endorsement of a carbon tax comes at a critical time, with less than 50 days left for Congress to work out a budget deal and avoid triggering a set of automatic tax increases and spending cuts. A number of conservatives have also raised the possibility of a carbon tax – even before Obama's re-election – giving hope to environmental campaigners. In the view of Gore and others, Obama's re-election in the wake of Sandy dramatically expanded the scope for action on climate change. So too did the endorsement from New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, which singled out Obama's efforts on climate, such as raising fuel performance standards for cars. American public opinion also shifted, after a summer of punishing drought and record high temperatures. Two-thirds (67%) of Americans now say climate change is real, compared to 57% in 2009, according to a poll last month from the Pew Research Centre. Then came last month's superstorm. A sizeable percentage of voters invoked Sandy as a factor in their vote, according to exit polls. The storm put climate change on the map after an election in which Obama and Mitt Romney went out of their way to avoid even mentioning the words, Gore said. The president also signalled in his victory speech that he saw climate change as one of the top three priorities of his second term. "We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet," Obama said. Gore said it was now up to the public to keep the pressure on. "Many elected officials have been frightened of the reaction should they even talk about the climate crisis much less propose the obvious solution we need to put a price on carbon," he said. "It is just as plain as day. But the only way to give these elected officials more backbone is to ensure that they hear more from their constituents who are deeply and rightly concerned that they are not doing anything to stop this accelerating destruction of the global climate balance." Other environmental leaders are also trying to seize the moment. Activists have called a demonstration at the White House on 18 November to demand Obama block the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to expand production from the Alberta tar sands by pumping crude to Texas refineries. Gore said he supported their campaign. "I do agree with those who are trying to stop the Keystone pipeline. The tar sands are just the dirtiest source of liquid fuel you can imagine," he said. "At a time when we are desperately trying to bend the emissions curve downwards it is quite literally insane to open up a whole new source that is much more carbon intensive and that makes the problem worse." But it is not his fight, he said. "For me, I believe that my efforts are best expended on the central challenge of building a sufficient support for action to solve the climate crisis. It's not that complicated ultimately. We have to put a price on carbon." guardianDOTcoDOTuk/environment/2012/nov/13/al-gore-barack-obama-climate-change</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352831144111</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:25:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352833823589-17</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>Stock continues to lag year after year.

"EPA is completing its review and analysis of the RFS waiver requests and the agency plans to reach a decision shortly," an agency spokeswoman said, referring to the ethanol mandate or Renewable Fuel Standards. Aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on foreign oil, the RFS requires 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol to be made from corn this year. In August, several governors asked the EPA to temporarily waive the mandate on ethanol because the worst drought in 50 years has driven corn prices higher and hurt livestock producers who depend on the grain for feed. Forty percent of the U.S. corn crop is used to make ethanol. A decision on the waiver is expected by the end of the month. In 2008, EPA denied a request from Texas to relax the mandate during a period of surging corn prices.

Reserves at the Fed are not money because they cannot be used to buy anything and consequently will never circulate in the economy, and so have no impact whatsoever on inflation. In times past the Federal Reserve has bought bonds directly from the U.S. Treasury and paid for them with Federal Reserve Notes. Buying bonds in that manner if inflationary but they are not doing that. The oil price responds to the Fed moves because interest rates are forced down encouraging speculation in stocks and commodities.

By 2014 they will have risen another 1,000,000 b/d in the U.S., with at least another million b/d after that. millions more barrels of daily capacity will be coming on line in Brazil and Iraq in the coming years. Saudi Arabia's production skyrocketed last year and they have more potential too. Oil companies, like all producers of goods with inelastic demand, maximize their profit whenever supply is less, not more. It is like the case in droughts - farm profits rise as prices rise much faster than output falls... Oil production profits will collapse as global oil output rises and prices plummet... The major oil companies have been dumping downstream assets and lack the capacity there to make up the profit losses at lower prices. Needless to say the demand side of the equation is atrocious too. Europe's economy is an a depression and even the oil industry admits oil demand will never rise there again. America has a Democrat President who is determined to force electric cars and/or improved fuel efficiency on the economy. Japan is a depression. China is slipping - and it is worth noting that China pays for its oil with foreign exchange, not yuan, and is constrained by the economic strength, or lack thereof, of its trading partners...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352844384704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 17:06:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352844823843-35</Id><Topic><Title>wahleee boy?</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352840751976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 16:05:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFY!

The massive increase that will come in Iraq you can thank Bush for, and major oil companies such as Petrochina, and others... The massive increase in Brazil has nothing to do with Obama either. Saudi Aramco's increase is not due to Obama, but to the Saudis. The massive surge in Russian oil production has nothing to do with Obama either. The Canadian Tar Sands oil is coming thanks to a) Canada ignoring the Kyoto Protocol in the first instance; and b) withdrawing from its provisions in the second, something Obama disapproves of - hence is blocking of Keystone. Whenever Libya's production comes it will be thanks to the Europeans pushing for military action, and in spite of Obama's feckless leadership. Obama has succeeded in driving up power rates with his war on coal which will reduce oil demand as it weakens the economy. As for the depression that awaits: he should have been raising taxes 3 years ago instead of using the national credit card to inflate yet another bubble as Bush did. The price for that folly will be paid for very soon. Either taxes are raised now obliterating the bubble, or the deficit will rise until the bond market crashes obliterating the government, the military, and much of the economy...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352852379461</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 19:19:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352856223540-39</Id><Topic><Title>major oversupply of oil coming</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352844384704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 17:06:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a cry baby!
