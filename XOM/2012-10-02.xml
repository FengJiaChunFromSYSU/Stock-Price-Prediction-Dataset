Not only is that enough to meet about 3% of customers’ power consumption with emissions-free electricity, the price Alabama Power will pay over a 20-year contract period is below that of what it would have cost the utility to produce the electricity itself, Birmingham News reports. “The purchase was made because it is expected to displace more expensive energy for other sources that we have,” Alabama Power director of forecasting and resource planning John Kelley was quoted as saying. “This helps diversify our portfolio of supply. It is always good to not have all your eggs in one basket.” Burning coal remains the predominant means of generating electricity in the US, the Southeast, and in Alabama. 58% of the electricity Alabama Power generated in 2011 came from coal-fired power plants. The utility’s fuel mix has been changing, however, as the costs of using cleaner natural gas and even cleaner renewable wind and solar power have come down significantly. Gradually, but Surely, Wind &amp; Other Renewables Catching On in the Southeast In 1999, coal-fired power supplied 77% of Alabama Power’s electricity. That’s fallen to 47% as of mid-2012, Alabama Power spokesperson Michael Sznajderman told Birmgingham News’ Thomas Spencer. At the same time, stricter environmental regulations aimed at reducing US carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as avoiding the high, socialized health, and other environmental risks and costs associated with coal mining and generating electricity from coal mean the cost of coal-fired generation has risen. By purchasing or generating electricity from wind power, Alabama Power avoids those risks, and secures electricity at a much more stable rate over the long-term, thereby insulating itself from the rising cost and higher volatility of coal and other fossil fuel prices. Alabama Power’s 404 MW of wind power is to come from the Chisholm View Wind Project in Oklahoma’s Garfield and Grant counties, which is expected to begin operations in December, and the Buffalo Dunes Wind Project near Garden City, Kansas, which is due to come online in 2014. Wind Power Development: Local Green Jobs, Big Economic Boost, Cleaner Air, and a Healthier Environment TradeWind Energy’s Chisholm View Wind Project has a rated generation capacity of 235 MW, with 140 GE 1.6-MW wind turbines spread across some 45,000 acres. More than 150 landowners are receiving royalties from the project. That’s in addition to the local green wind energy jobs, incomes, and tax revenue the wind farm produces. A 345-kilovolt (kV) Oklahoma Gas and Electric Transmission Line runs N-S directly through the project site. The high-voltage transmission line can deliver energy to North as well as South to load centers such as Wichita, Kansas and Oklahoma City, where interconnections enable the power to be delivered farther afield. With a projected rated capacity between 200-405 MW, Lenexa, Kansas–based TradeWind Energy also owns the Buffalo Dunes Wind Project outside Garden City, Kansas. Due to be completed in 2014, GE 1.6-MW and Siemens 2.3-MW wind turbines or similar are being installed over more than 75,000 acres of tilled farmland, taking just 1%-2% out of agricultural service. In addition to contributing substantially to the local economy by making use of local labor and materials, the project is projected to supply enough clean, renewable power for some 90,000 typical homes, offsetting approximately 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, 3,000 tons of NO2, and 4,200 tons of SO2. A state environmental group praised Alabama Power’s decision, and also that of Georgia Power, which this past week announced it would purchase 200 MW of solar power. “We were pleased to hear about the recent wind purchase by Alabama Power and applaud the Alabama Public Service Commission for researching the project and ultimately approving it,” Alabama Environmental Council executive director Michael Churchman was quoted as saying. “We also applaud Georgia Power for announcing this week a 200MW purchase of solar power,” he said. “Together, these kinds of projects will help offset negative impacts from fossil fuel electric generation and bring us closer to a clean energy future.” Churchman also called on state government and power industry leaders to engage the public and do more to open up energy policy strategizing and planning. “There may not be one silver bullet to address all our energy concerns, but if you add energy efficiency and conservation and increased public involvement in the planning process for renewable purchases, we would really be moving toward a brighter future.” Clean Technica</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349151091525</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 00:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349152083270-2</Id><Title>NYC biodiesel-blended heating oil requirement starts Oct. 1 - every gallon of oilheat in the city will contain at least 2% biodiesel</Title><Msg>NYC biodiesel-blended heating oil requirement starts Oct. 1 By The National Biodiesel Board | October 01, 2012 As New York City residents prepare for another winter, they can take comfort in knowing their oilheat is among the cleanest in the nation. Starting Oct. 1, every gallon of oilheat in the city will contain at least 2 percent biodiesel. The blend is known as Bioheat fuel, a greener heating oil that is gaining popularity in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. In 2010, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed an air quality bill that included the Bioheat provision for heating homes and buildings. A New York State bill also required a switch to ultra-low sulfur heating oil, which took place in July. “In passing this legislation, we set the stage to prevent the burning of 20 million gallons of petroleum each year,” said City Councilman James F. Gennaro, who sponsored the legislation. “This is the carbon equivalent of taking 30,000 cars off the road in New York City. But it's only the first step. Between the statewide requirement for ultra-low sulfur heating oil and this landmark Bioheat mandate, we are really starting to see the green future of home heating.” Biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from agricultural byproducts and coproducts such as soybean oil, and other fats and oils, including at least one abundant resource in New York City: recycled restaurant grease. It is the only domestically produced, commercially available advanced biofuel in the U.S., and supports 39,000 American jobs. “Our members truly recognize Bioheat as the evolution of oilheat,” said John Maniscalco, CEO of the New York Oil Heating Association, which strongly supported the Bioheat mandate. “NYOHA has worked closely with the National Biodiesel Board in ensuring that our member companies and their customers recognize the many environmental and other benefits of Bioheat and we are proud to say that Bioheat usage has already increased dramatically. We are just getting started.” Maniscalco points out that many pioneering New Yorkers have used even higher blends of biodiesel in their heating oil for years. The National Biodiesel Board hailed the groundbreaking municipal legislation. “The consumer is the ultimate benefactor of this law, now having access to truly 21st Century heating oil,” said Paul Nazzaro, who spearheads the Bioheat education program for the National Biodiesel Board. “The entire petroleum supply chain deserves credit for making the changes needed to embrace blending biodiesel with heating oil to deliver Bioheat.” Biodiesel used in Bioheat fuel is eligible to meet the federal renewable fuel standard, which requires 1 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel be blended into the fuel supply in 2012. No other city has a Bioheat requirement in place, but several states have passed requirements that will go into effect when contingent states pass similar laws. biodieselmagazine</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349152083270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 00:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349152837577-3</Id><Title>Northern Gateway not the only oil pipeline option VIDEO</Title><Msg>Northern Gateway not the only oil pipeline option VIDEO By JACKIE L. LARSON,Edmonton Sun First posted: Sunday, September 30, 2012 04:55 PM MDT | Updated: Monday, October 01, 2012 07:55 AM MDT VIDEO The Sun's Jackie L. Larson recently visited Kitimat, B.C., the end of the proposed Gateway pipeline. This is part two of her three part series examining the risks and rewards of the proposed pipeline on Canada. Click here for part 1 Click here for part 2 Make sure to take our quiz on the pipeline below this story. —— With Asian markets looming large to the west and the much-debated Northern Gateway pipeline to move Alberta bitumen to them via Kitimat taking heat from the environmental lobby, southbound and eastbound pipeline routes are making strides. LOOKING EAST Calgary-based TransCanada has turned its eye to eastern Canada, said spokesman Grady Semmens. “There is that discussion going on in Canada - can we be refining more of our crude oil here? I can say that TransCanada is interested in that idea ... creating an oil pipeline that goes across Canada to service Montreal and New Brunswick. It’s a project we are starting to look into quite seriously,” he said. The project would utilize the largest existing pipeline, currently used to transport natural gas, and convert it for moving oil from Alberta to Winnipeg. The line would actually have six lines within the tube, and convert part of that to oil. “The expanding Keystone system would be a key element in moving Canadian and American oil to markets — a key piece of energy infrastructure in North America,” he said. If it’s technically feasible, a new pipeline would be built to New Brunswick or whatever other refinery markets are interested in accessing crude oil from Alberta, Semmens said. DRIVE SOUTH Earlier this month, TransCanada resubmitted its revised application for the northern 1,897-km portion of the Keystone pipeline to the Texas Gulf Coast. Construction started in August on the 780-km leg of the Keystone from Cushing, Okla., to Nederland, Texas, on the Gulf Coast, with all permits a go. But the changed Keystone XL extension from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steel City, Nebraska, had lines redrawn in Nebraska’s northwest corner after reviewing hundreds of comments made by Nebraskans and others in the initial review. “We just submitted proposed reroutes in Nebraska to avoid the Sand Hills region,” said Semmens. On its way to the Steel City tie-in with the rest of the Keystone, the extension still travels over a portion of the Oglalla Aquifer, the massive sandstone formation underlying most of Nebraska. However, the reroute avoids wellheads where the aquifer is recharged. “We’re trying to minimize the impact overall,” Semmens said. An additional 57 safety measures were included with the revised route, including burying the pipeline deeper underground, adding more remote control shut-offs — including more at high-contact areas like river crossings, cities and towns. TransCanada hopes for approval of the Presidential Permit for the new route by the end of 2012, and a final decision in the first quarter of 2013. “This is an appropriate route, and it will be safest ever built in the U.S.,” Semmens said. “We’re continuing to do what’s asked of us,” he said. At five years and counting, the pipeline is taking longer than was originally planned, in large part due to permitting delays after President Barack Obama nixed the original map last summer. “That’s just the landscape we deal with now, pipelines are being subjected to more public considerations than in the past. This is obviously the newest pipeline built in the U.S. and Canada. Over and above that, the technology is a lot different than 50 or 60 years ago, when other pipelines still in operation were built,” Semmens said. “We have a very advanced operating system, and it’s proven to be an extremely safe system,” he said. TransCanada has moved 280 million barrels of Canadian crude oil to the U.S. since July 2010. There have been a handful of small spill cases, all of five gallons or less, coming to a total of 427 barrels of crude. They were all confined to pump station properties — and none to do with the pipe itself, but due to leakage at fittings where the pipeline comes out of the ground, Semmens said. There’s a ready demand from producers in Canada and the Bakken Shale in Montana and North Dakota for pipeline service. “The largest collection of refineries in the world are interested in getting access to more crude oil,” he said. “They’re highly reliant on overseas producers in places like Venezuela, Mexico, the Middle East and Nigeria. Oil from Canada and the U.S. is more stable and reliable, and it supports the North American energy industry.” —— FIRST NATIONS HAVE SAY ON PIPELINE With final joint review panel hearings underway, First Nations groups within 80 km of the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline path are weighing in on the tug-of-war between the well-heeled international environmental lobby and pipeline supporters. Under oath, Enbridge said it has 60% support among those groups. A regional aboriginal group’s demand for the names - covered by confidentiality clauses - wasn’t granted by the government panel, but the heat is on. Coastal First Nations attorney Brenda Gaertner said her clients wanted to know the names. Conflict could continue and wreak havoc with Enbridge’s reputation long after regulatory approval has been given for the project. With a treaty-bound say in issues affecting First Nations territory, local bands are important to the project, said Terrace developer Lael McKeown. “The key to this is going to be arranging for agreements with the First Nations people and if that happened, yes, but if you have an alliance between the First Nations and the environmentalists it will be very difficult,” she said. First Nations are cutting deals with major industries, like the one between Kitimat Valley’s Haisla nation and a Houston, Texas LNG company. The Haisla got $50 million in cash, seats on the board - and ongoing landlord status. Business leader Ron Burnett is president of the KT Industrial Development Society said it’s a sensitive issue. “There are First Nations bands that agreed that this is a good project and have come on board ... they don’t get any ink whatsoever,” he said. While First Nation attorneys are vocal, with some looking for profit numbers at the hearings, some First Nations groups in B.C. are staying mum on support of Northern Gateway because they feel threatened, said Kitimat business leader Bill Hickman. “They even fear sometimes for their physical comfort because it’s that bad ... they’re a little bit worried about unrest and it’s all being fomented by money coming from somewhere,” he said.

Companies like Poet Refinning and DSM Advanced Biofuels have been working for years on producing cellulosic ethanol as an alternative to corn grain based ethanol. It is an alternative that's environmentallly friendly, and its source, crop residue, is easy to come by. "We're not using that grain of kernel anymore that can be argued with as food or being used as feed and food. This is really a waste product. It's out there in abundance," said POET Biomass Logistics Director, Adam Wirt. Up until now, cellulosic ethanol has had its fair share of critics like those that feel using too much crop residue can damage a field. These concerns do come with merit as even engineers behind this idea say residue like husks, cobs, and leaves that are left on fields help put nutrients back into the soil. That is why POET and DSM teamed up with Iowa State University and researched just how much crop residue they could safely take from the soil. They decided that they will take only about 25 percent of what is on the field to ensure that the field stays healthy. "We take a lot of time and focus on what we do. That it is the right method and that we're not taking too much," added Wirt. Currently, the company's cellulosic ethanol plant also known as "Project Liberty" is being built just outside of Emmetsburg, Iowa. Already, about 140 farmers are signed up to supply crop residue for the plant. "It's a long process, but it's hopefully going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and hopefully help us out a lot," said farmer Mason Hoffman. The plant hopes to open late next year and have signed contracts from at least 300 more farmers which will hopefully help fuel the way of the future of ethanol. kcautv</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349185812156</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:50:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349193043301-10</Id><Title>Relatives of Obama Free Phone Lady</Title><Msg>take over gas station.

Surveillance video obtained by FOX 2 shows as many as a dozen teens hanging out inside the store, smoking cigarettes, sitting on countertops and even spitting into sinks. The owner says as many as 40 teens can be hanging out in front of the station at any time. "Destroying my store. Destroying my business," said the owner. He says his clerks are too frightened to take action against the teens and he's worried that the loitering could lead to violence.

The W.H. Sammis power plant in Stratton in Jefferson County, just south of East Liverpool, could be reopened within three days if needed, said Mark Durbin, spokesman for FirstEnergy. The change was made because the plant was no longer making money, he said. The coal plant, which has been renovated to meet all environmental standards, simply could not compete with the lower expense electricity generated by natural gas plants. “Demand hasn’t picked up,” Durbin said. “If we could bid out the power at a cost where we could recover our costs, the plant could restart. We don’t anticipate that happening any time soon.” FirstEnergy also is considering making its Hatfield’s Ferry plant at Masontown, Pa., on the Monongahela River operate using both coal and natural gas, Durbin said. The site currently is a coal power plant. “For it to be economically feasible the cost of natural gas would have to stay between $2 and $3 per mcf,” he said. If converted, the site would generate 25 to 40 percent of its power using natural gas with the remainder coming from coal, Durbin said. It is early in the decision-making process and something that is being considered, he said.

Not so, says a new study published this month, which makes an ambitious case for "sustainable sources" providing 95 percent of global energy demand by mid-century. This new analysis, "Transition to a fully sustainable global energy system," published in Energy Strategy Reviews, examines demand scenarios for the major energy use sectors -- industry, buildings, and transport -- and matches them up to feasible renewable supply sources. Over on VICE’s Motherboard, Brian Merchant dug into the study and put it into proper context. It is entirely possible, using technologies largely available today, to power nearly the entire world with clean energy—but we need to conjure the will to make revolutionary strides in public policy and the scale of deployment. His take is smart and thorough, and rather than excerpting him too heavily here, I’m going to urge you to go read his entire piece. I’ll admit, I opened the report with a bit of healthy skepticism. I’ve been spending a whole lot of time lately buried in EIA and IEA reports while working on an Energy 101 primer. The picture painted by the mounds of energy data and exhaustively-calcuated projections is not a pretty one, particularly as it portrays future demand. Energy demand, you see, is growing exponentially, and that growth lies at the heart of the great global energy (and climate) challenge. You’d be awfully hard-pressed to find any energy experts out there -- even the biggest boosters of renewables -- who would argue that we could ever meet future needs with existing renewable technologies alone, if rates of consumption continue as they are. So I was encouraged to see that this new “Transition” report addresses demand right off the bat. (Emphasis mine.) The energy scenario we have presented combines the most ambitious efficiency drive on the demand side with strong growth of renewable source options on the supply side to reach a fully sustainable global energy system by 2050. Both are important: the transition cannot be achieved on the supply side alone. This is key. As is clear in this overview graph from the report, for renewables to provide 95 percent of energy demand, global consumption would have to peak around 2020 and fall over time to levels just below where they were at the turn of the millenium. It does have to be said that this is pretty ambitious thinking (and the authors say so themselves). This graph shows the report’s projections next to a bunch of other reference cases, all of which land higher. (A quick aside for the real energy wonks out there: all of this Transition report’s energy numbers are “final energy,” not “primary energy.”) Fortunately, even these wildly ambitious reductions are possible, and the authors lay out case-by-case, sector-by-sector, how it could actually happen, mostly through efficiency and electrification. It must be emphasized: the drop in energy demand does not involve any consequent reduction in economic activity or quality of life. It is imperative to understand that the reduction of total energy demand in this scenario is not derived from a reduction in activity. It depends primarily on the reduction of energy intensity through aggressive roll-out of the most efficient technologies. We’re talking about increased energy intensity in industry (more output per Joule input, you could say). We’re talking about more plug-in hybrids and better batteries and better mass transit service urban hubs. We’re talking about more telecommuting and buildings that don’t leak heat and smarter shipping systems. We’re not talking about shivering in a cold, dark home. So where will the energy come from? Even under this ambitious demand scenario, we’re still going to need about 260 exajoules worth of final energy annually to power the planet. Where will it come from, and what do the report’s authors count as “sustainable” energy sources? In brief: solar (concentrated heat and power, and photovoltaic), wind (on- and offshore), hydro, geothermal (for heat and power), small amounts of wave and tidal, and a whole raft of bioenergy sources. Now that, as Merchant put it, “is what an 'all-of-the-above energy strategy' looks like.” What about cost? Here’s where you -- you pragmatist you -- start thinking, that looks great, but could we ever afford it? It’s a worthwhile question, and one you can be sure that the fossil fuel apologists and politicians (plenty of overlap, I know) will be crowing on about. While this report focused predominantly on the “technical feasibility,” and recognizes that it “does not necessarily present the most cost-efficient way of achieving this goal,” it does refer to an accompanying publication that puts the bill at under 2 percent of global GDP during the investment-heavy early years. While 2 percent of global GDP might sound like a lot, remember that Sir Nicholas Stern’s landmark “Economics of Climate Change” report found that the “overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.” What’s more, the 2 percent of global GDP is a short-term expense that itself pays off in terms of energy costs alone (putting climate aside, foolish as that may be). The Transitions report finds that “in the later years of the assessed time horizon, the net financial impact would be positive, i.e. the energy system proposed in this scenario would be significantly cheaper to operate by 2050 than a BAU system." What's the hold-up? In short: politics, perspective, ambition. To achieve such a bold goal we need to combine aggressive energy efficiency on the demand side with accelerated renewable energy supply from all possible sources. This requires a paradigm shift towards long-term, integrated strategies and will not be met with small, incremental changes. Now long-term thinking sure isn't our society's strong suit. If only a report like this was taken as seriously by the media as a totally non-sensical graph and hollow "plan" for "North American energy indepedence."

October 2, 2012 By Jake Richardson Leave a Comment CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets has estimated Japan could have 7.6 GW of wind power by 2016. For solar, that estimate is 17.3 GW by 2014. Combine those two and you have 24.9 GW by 2016. The total offshore wind potential is at least 1,600 GW. Onshore is 280 GW. Japan has set a three-year window for very high feed-in tariffs to encourage explosive renewable energy. (Extremely explosive might be more accurate.) Though these numbers may seem ludicrously ambitious and even laughable to some, one only needs to consider the shuttering of nuclear power in Japan to understand the urgency of the energy situation there. As already noted on CleanTechnica in June, Japan’s feed-in tariff rates could vault their clean energy production to levels alongside Germany and similarly enthusiastic clean energy early adopters. The tariff for wind there is currently the highest in the world. Japan had been getting about one-fifth of its power from nuclear reactors, so as they are phased out completely, there will be no alternative other than to develop new sources and nothing makes as much as sense as clean energy because it fits the view of a saner future much better. A big push for clean energy also might benefit the economy which is not doing well. In fact, there are early signs it could slip into a recession.

GE MRI technology might enable 15-MW wind turbine GE will use magnetic technology from its MRI systems, and $3 million from the U.S. Department of Energy, to develop a next-generation wind turbine generator that could support large-scale wind applications in the 10 to 15 MW range. News Item From: Composites World Posted on: 9/6/2011 Click Image to Enlarge GE wind turbine. (Source: GE) With the wind industry moving toward larger wind turbine platforms in the future, GE Global Research (Niskayuna, N.Y., USA), the technology development arm of the General Electric Co., on Aug. 30 announced it has begun work on the first phase of a two-year, $3 million project from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a next-generation wind turbine generator that could support large-scale wind applications in the 10 to 15 MW range. “With the industry’s desire for higher megawatt machines to maximize clean wind power opportunities in the U.S. and around the globe, new technologies will be needed to support larger scale wind platforms,” said Keith Longtin, wind technology seader, GE Global Research. “The key challenge will be delivering solutions that achieve the right scale and cost. Applying more than 30-plus years of experience with superconducting magnets for MRI systems in healthcare, we’re developing an innovative new generator technology that will deliver more power while at the same time helping to reduce the cost of wind power.” “For MRI systems, we’re applying superconducting magnets to make lower cost systems with higher image quality,” Longtin said. “For wind turbines, we want to apply them to generate more wind power at a lower cost of electricity. The applications are different, but the basic technology is the same.” Today, most wind turbines have conventional generators that are connected to a gearbox. The gearbox is used to step up lower blade speeds into higher speeds, so that you can reduce the torque requirements before it reaches the generator. While extremely effective in wind turbines out in the field today, they will incur higher costs as they are scaled up to larger wind platforms because of additional weight and maintenance needs that will be required. In addition to the next-generation wind turbine generator project, GE researchers are driving other key technologies that will enable the economic scale-up of wind. Major highlights include: Incorporating lighter, more advanced composite materials to enable longer wind blades that enhance wind capture without adding so much weight that it increases the cost of power; Delivering more advanced controls, sensors and condition monitoring algorithms to dramatically reduce operating costs; and Developing an array of grid integration technologies to seamlessly integrate larger amounts of wind into the grid. These technologies are focused on making sure wind turbines are grid-code compliant and provide new, grid-friendly features to help utilities more reliably manage larger wind power loads. The generator project will have two phases. Phase I will focus on developing a conceptual design and evaluating the economic, environmental, and commercial factors associated with it. Phase II will explore the potential commercialization of the technology. The Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) will be a key partner with GE on the generator project, helping GE to investigate and mitigate high-risk technology challenges associated with the project. compositesworld</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349199788140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:43:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349201334343-18</Id><Topic><Title>WE NEED A REAL AMERICAN PRESIDENT</Title><Username>johnmoney458</Username><Timestamp>1349179676481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's funny.</Msg><Username>westsbest0304</Username><Timestamp>1349201334343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349202746499-19</Id><Title>Why is the down?

New Chrysler, GM and Ford vehicles will accept a fuel blend that's 15 percent ethanol, as opposed to the standard 10 percent blend. For GM, that will begin with 2012 models, while Ford and Chrysler will accommodate the fuel in 2013 models, according to Oil Price Information Service, which first reported the news. The auto industry’s resistance to higher blends of ethanol — which it says are more corrosive to older engine models — has long been a roadblock in getting higher concentrations of ethanol fuel blends on the market. Clearing that is important for the biofuels industry, which has said it needs the higher blend, known as E15, to meet a mandate that requires refiners to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuels into traditional transportation fuel by 2022. “The pressure is now on other auto manufacturers to follow suit or explain why they offer substandard equipment,” Monte Shaw, executive director for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said in a Tuesday statement. Auto industry resistance to E15 has long been a major part of Republicans’ and a main oil trade group’s criticism of the fuel. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has lobbied Congress that automakers would not honor warranties for engine damage caused by higher concentrations of ethanol fuel. GM spokeswoman Sharon Basel indicated the company still advises against using E15 in vehicles made before the model year 2012, explaining that motorists should consult their manuals for proper fueling procedures. That is a key point because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said vehicles made in 2001 or later can handle E15 fuel. The U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia upheld that ruling in August. “GM as part of an industry group has performed a multitude of tests on 2001 and newer vehicles that are included in the EPA regulations for E15 and have found that damage to the vehicle's engines resulted,” Basel said in an email. API and Republicans have pushed back against the EPA’s decision, citing the automakers’ reluctance to honor warranties for engine damage. Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) told The Hill on Tuesday that the automakers’ decision to allow E15 in newer models does not change what he considered misguided EPA policy on the fuel. “But while the EPA decided E15 was safe for all cars made after 2001, automakers unanimously disagreed,” he said in an email. “For most vehicles on the road, and for those Americans who can’t afford to buy a new car in this economy, E15 will damage engines and void warranties.” thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349215052521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349218281394-22</Id><Topic><Title>GOP doubled welfare with control of House, Senate &amp; Presidency in 4 yrs</Title><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1349207037385</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:43:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good!

Clariant Corporation recently acquired Süd-Chemie, which has been developing its proprietary sunliquid® process since 2006, including the successful operation of a pilot plant since 2009. Clariant started operation of the largest cellulosic ethanol production facility in Germany in July 2012. “Clariant is pleased to join the Advanced Ethanol Council, which has emerged very quickly as a leading voice for the advanced ethanol industry in the United States,” said Prof. Andre Koltermann, Group Vice-President of the Clariant Biotech &amp; Renewables Center. “With our demonstration plant now operating, we are taking a major step towards the commercialization of our sunliquid® process and the deployment of climate-friendly cellulosic biofuels into the global liquid fuels marketplace including the United States.” The Clariant demonstration facility, located in Straubing, Germany will produce up to 330,000 gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year specifically from wheat straw, corn stover and sugarcane bagasse. The sunliquid® process is capable of producing bio-ethanol from a wide variety of agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops. “We are one of the few companies in the industry with proprietary process and enzyme development under one roof,” stated Dr. Markus Rarbach, Head of Biocatalysis of Corporate R&amp;D at the Clariant Biotech &amp; Renewables Center. “We believe that production of feedstock specific enzymes produced process integrated on-site, conversion of both C5 and C6 sugars into ethanol as well as process and energy efficiency in ethanol separation will allow the market to have both a technological and economical solution for the production of cellulosic ethanol.” Clariant has recently started plans to commercialize the sunliquid® process in the United States and has opened an office in Des Moines, Iowa. domesticfuel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349220571154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:29:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349222055673-24</Id><Title>B.C.

Liberal MLA reopens debate on offshore oil exploration New Democrats call John Rustad’s comments 'irresponsible' CBC News Posted: Oct 2, 2012 10:36 AM PT Last Updated: Oct 2, 2012 12:05 PM PT Read 64 comments64 VIDEO Pipeline meeting 2:34 LISTEN Premier won't rule out Alberta pipeline royalties 12:48 Despite the debate already raging between B.C. and Alberta over the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline, one backbench Liberal MLA wants to start a dialogue about offshore drilling in B.C. Nechako Lakes Liberal MLA John Rustad recently posted a message on Facebook about the merits of oil exploration. "With the debate raging around pipelines I'm sure there isn't much appetite for offshore oil and gas," he wrote. "However, if B.C. is ever going to become debt free, one day this is going to have to happen." Rustad wants to put the idea of oil exploration off B.C.’s coast on the table — despite the political consequences. "If it can be done environmentally sound, if it's something that can meet our standards, if there's a significant benefit, then we should have that conversation and it should be considered," he told CBC News. No support from Premier Clark But the proposition has no support from the premier. B.C. Premier Christy Clark spoke with Alberta Premier Alison Redford Monday about the five conditions B.C. says need to be met before the province will support Enbridge's bid to build the pipeline, which would run from the Alberta oilsands across B.C. to the port of Kitimat. Clark is demanding compensation for the environmental risks involved in the pipeline project. "I think that we've got our hands full with just this Enbridge pipeline," Clark said, adding it’s not an idea she’s entertaining at the moment. Still, the B.C. New Democrats have jumped on Rustad’s comments. "Mr. Rustad is being irresponsible by re-opening a deeply divisive debate about bringing further risks to our coastline that would affect the environment, the economy, First Nations, and all British Columbians," NDP environment critic Rob Fleming said in a release. "While the premier has failed to truly stand up for British Columbia on the Enbridge pipeline, I hope she will at least clarify her government’s position on offshore drilling." The New Democrats are calling for a continuation of B.C.'s long-term commitment to a moratorium on offshore drilling. cbc</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349222055673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349233426780-25</Id><Title>Cities Getting Local Energy Choice with Aggregation</Title><Msg>Cities Getting Local Energy Choice with Aggregation October 2, 2012 By John Farrell Leave a Comment Over 200 Illinois towns helped cut their citizens’ electric bills in 2012, and some even achieved 100% renewable energy, thanks to a state law that lets cities choose their electricity provider. The law, called community choice aggregation, lets municipalities pick from competitive electricity suppliers for their residential and small business customers, but without having to purchase and operate the local grid (as when becoming a municipal utility). The concept was pioneered in Massachusetts and Ohio, where large aggregation networks (consisting of dozens of cities and towns) have been getting inexpensive electricity by buying in bulk. This fall, community choice aggregation could be poised for a huge leap forward, as citizens of Chicago will vote on a referendum to allow the largest city in the Midwest to choose a new electric company. While many communities have used aggregation to simply select a new, less expensive electricity supplier, a few communities are also attempting to use their newfound control to maximize clean local energy development. Marin Clean Energy in California, Oak Park in Illinois, and Cincinnati in Ohio have all pursued much greener electricity options or attempted to encourage local distributed renewable energy development. This presentation I gave to the National Strategy Meeting of the Local Energy Aggregation Network (February 2012) explores the potential for community choice aggregation policy to increase local clean energy development, providing an overview of where the law is currently in force, and where the opportunities are. For more on this policy and its history, you may also like ILSR’s 2009 report on community choice aggregation.

The data, collected by the Environmental Protection Agency, are significant because the composition of the gas -- its isotopic signature -- falls into a range Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp. had identified as that of the Marcellus Shale, which it tapped through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. "The EPA data falls squarely in the Marcellus space" established by Cabot's scientists, said Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Duke University. That evidence backs up his findings linking gas drilling and water problems in the town of Dimock, applying the very methodology that Cabot established to try to debunk it, he said. Cabot maintains that its operations haven't contaminated homeowners' wells, and its scientists say further analysis shows this gas isn't from the Marcellus, a mile-deep formation running from New York to the southwestern tip of Virginia. Industry groups say there hasn't been proof of fracking contaminating water anywhere, and the dispute research that suggests pumping millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals underground to break apart rock and free trapped gas endangers the environment. The question of the provenance of the gas in the northeastern Pennsylvania town has taken on national importance after tainted wells there were featured in the film "Gasland." Last year, the EPA stepped in to test the water, one of only a few cases nationwide in which the federal agency intervened in a dispute over fracking and water woes. "Dimock is so important because it's so high profile," Kate Sinding, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, said in an interview. "It's been a poster child for what can happen with fracking." In a 2010 consent order, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection found that 18 drinking-water wells in the area were "affected" by Cabot's drilling. The company disagreed and applauded when the EPA cleared the water in Dimock as safe this July. State regulators ruled last month that Cabot could begin fracking seven wells in the affected area of Dimock, ending a moratorium imposed in 2010.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349233778642</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 23:09:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
