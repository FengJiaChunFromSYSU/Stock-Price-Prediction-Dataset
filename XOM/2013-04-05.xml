When do you anticipate a U.S. Constitutional Convention to elect your Kurfürsten? The Kurfürsten could then pick a ceremonial Kaiser (Emperor) and he could issue many more titles. You could have dukes and duchesses, counts and countesses, barons and baronesses, knights... In the meantime Germany will always be here, but without the official chambers and highest titles, of course…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365135237302</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 00:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365146226141-2</Id><Topic><Title>Stock</Title><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1365035968642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 20:39:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's true Exxon has done well over a period of 30 years. However if one has followed this stock at all, they would see that it has drastically underperformed all the averages and its peers over the last 4 to 5 years. If one had any familiarity with this stock's performance they would know that since 2009 while the Dow has risen 8000 points this stock hasn't budged. One would also know that any strong stock performance was under prior management, not the incompetent Rex Tillerson ( nothing personal just a fact.). Finally as far as "the great splits and good divvies" these are also things of the past: Exxon has a lower yield than the other major oils and if one cares about splits the last one was in 2000. My family has been a holder of Exxon for a long time and I wish the above weren't true but being a apologist for this stock and this terrible management adds nothing . One can't live on what a stock did 10, 20, or 30 years ago.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1365146226141</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 03:17:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365146703256-3</Id><Topic><Title>Divy Will be raised this month</Title><Username>christophmil</Username><Timestamp>1365018371770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 15:46:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope you are wrong but suspect you are right. Management gave a good increase in the dividend last year in response to pressure from shareholders and possibly to compensate for its long term under performing stock (which continues to this day). I'm afraid without this pressure we will again see one of these insulting 2 to 3 cent increases. Exxon management is aggressively anti shareholder.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1365146703256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 03:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365164469539-4</Id><Topic><Title>Stock</Title><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1365035968642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 20:39:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here...

The unpredictable nature of the North Korean regime must be sending off major alarms in the war department. The US and Germany are in the process of selling Iran's foes (US--- Israel, Germany--- Arabs) weapons that will ensure they have sufficient firepower to deal with their own problems.

This has been going on for 4 to 5 years day after day. The market recognizes this is a horribly managed oil company with NO growth prospects. To all you Exxon apologists, look objectively at how this stock does on a daily basis relative to the averages and its peers.
