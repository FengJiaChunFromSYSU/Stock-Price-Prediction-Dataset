In less than four years, the Obama administration’s policies have transformed the region into a powder keg with a hairpin detonator that could be set off by the slightest diplomatic misstep, engulfing the region and the world in war. And, as if an economy on the brink wasn’t daunting enough, the current administration’s feckless diplomacy in the Arab world have begotten a near-impossible foreign policy conundrum that Mitt Romney will be forced to attend to from the moment he is sworn in as the forty-fifth President of the United States. In order to help voters see clearly where unfolding events in the region are headed, I have summarized the salient facts and provided a brief analysis below. President Obama’s denial of various forms of Islamist radicalism have amplified the jihadist threat and altered American foreign policy in the Middle East. In his Cairo speech in 2009, Mr. Obama affirmed the misperception that America had been on the wrong side in wars “against the Muslim World” by announcing his new expiative approach to US foreign policy in the Arab world. Since then his and the State Department’s actions in the region have been characterized by retreat, abandonment of civil democratic reform movements, and partnership with Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. The administration’s freedom-antagonistic policies coupled with a desire to find common-ground with the Iranian regime, have effectively quashed hopes for true democratic reform while Obama remains in the White House. The Obama doctrine has dangerously impacted US national security. Barack Obama’s ill-advised pre-election commitment to bilateral negotiations with the Ayatollahs was put to the test in June 2009 when millions of mostly young Iranians took to the streets of Tehran in what almost became an “Iranian Spring.” With the Iranian regime teetering on the brink of collapse, the administration turned a deaf ear to demonstrators’ cries for America’s help as evidenced by the President’s silence on their plight and stubborn insistence on seeking understanding with the Khomeinist regime. But instead of obtaining concessions on Iran’s nukes, the Ayatollahs multiplied Uranium enrichment efforts and produced large numbers of long range missiles to deliver Apocalypse to Israel and the “Great Satan.” Hoping keep his grandiose illusion of US-Iranian nuclear talks alive, Obama imposed belated, near-symbolic economic sanctions on Iran with predictable negligible effect. In return, the Iranian regime expanded their destabilizing efforts in the Middle East, inciting Shia in Eastern Arabia, Bahrain and North Yemen to penetrate legitimate social movements and overthrow their US-friendly Governments. Mitt Romney’s position on Iran is radically different and infinitely more sensible than Barack Obama’s. Sanctions should be tightened and all-encompassing to force the regime abandon its nuclear ambitions, not induce negotiations toward a partial solution. Furthermore, Governor Romney’s policy on Iran would include partnering with the forces of civil democratic reform in their efforts to replace the current extremist regime once and for all. Obama’s miscalculation on Iran led to other regional catastrophes. As soon as the administration withdrew American forces from Iraq abruptly in December of 2011, Iranian influence penetrated Iraq. By not supporting Iran’s popular movement, Obama left Iran unrestrained. By failing to reach an agreement with Iraq before US withdrawal, Obama allowed Iran to infiltrate its neighbor, further threatening Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and reaching Syria’s borders. Romney would have contained the Iranian regime first, and then consolidated a pro-Western Government in Iraq. Similar strategic mistakes were made by the administration on the Arab Spring as a consequence of its misguided apology doctrine. Instead of working with the initial forces of change in Egypt—youth, women, middle class, workers and minorities—the Administration chose to partner exclusively with the Muslim Brotherhood. Obama’s team and the Islamists worked to put the Brotherhood and their Salafi allies in power, first by sidelining the secular reformers with the help of the army, then the army with the help of secular youth, before they rose to power and marginalized all other players. Under Morsi, Egypt is quickly morphing into an Islamist state, threatening the Camp David Accords, as well as seculars, women, and Copts. A similar scenario unfolded in Tunisia where Washington partnered with the Islamist Nahda at the expense of seculars, women, and reformers. Romney would pursue partnership with civil societies, particularly with women and seculars, and tie US financial aid to performance by governments. In Libya, the Obama Administration again sought partnership with the Islamists and neglected working with government and secular groups to disarm the militias and after Gadhafi’s downfall, sowed the seeds of al Qaeda’s growth, and opened a path for attacks against US targets, the most recent being a terrorist attack in Benghazi that killed the US ambassador and embassy staffers. A Romney Administration would first seek the disarming of the militias and, above all, provide better security for American lives in installations where Jihadists operate. Barack Obama’s worst and most dramatic failure has obviously been in Syria. One-year late to respond, Obama’s team was unable to create a coalition to bring down Assad. Out of Iraq by 2012, the US was unable to encircle Assad and prevent Iranian support from getting to the brutal regime. Thirty thousand civilians were massacred while the US administration was incapable of obtaining a UN resolution for action against Assad, despite its being called a “reset button” with Moscow. By being two years tardy, the administration has allowed the massacre in Syria to proceed. Iran is now connected to Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and has reached the sea by land. Furthermore, al Qaeda is now operating in Syria and Iraq. After Osama bin Laden was killed, the Obama Administration began claiming that al Qaeda was in decline, a claim proven false as AQ jihadists continue to conquer villages and towns in Yemen, fight in Somalia, are back in the Levant from Lebanon to Iraq, operating in the Sahel and Libya, with allies in Nigeria, and having established a solid base in northern Mali. Osama is dead, but al Qaeda is alive and flourishing. With the growth of jihadism and radical Islamism, the secular forces of the Arab Spring are being pushed back. More dramatically Christian and other ethnic minorities across the region, in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria and in Sudan, are under attack. Everywhere in the region reformers, women and minorities are suppressed and pushed back, while the Islamists and jihadists up and running and expanding their reach. Iran is arming and genocide is looming from Syria to Sudan. The Obama policies in the Middle East led to the rise of radicals and weakening of civil societies. A Romney alternative for the region is a must, not only on the basis of human rights and democracy, but also regarding US national security and the security of its allies.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351915493315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351918375435-2</Id><Title>President Obama: We're 'Not Moving Fast' Enough On Climate Change‪ - VIDEO</Title><Msg>President Obama: We're 'Not Moving Fast' Enough On Climate Change‪ - VIDEO 'This is an issue that future generations, MTV viewers, are going to have to be dealing with,' the president says during 'Ask Obama Live.' By Gil Kaufman, with additional reporting by Sway Calloway Nov 2 2012 10:11 AM EDT 568 One of the major topics that has gotten the least amount of attention during the long presidential campaign is climate change. Before the devastation wrought by superstorm Sandy on the East Coast— which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said is proof that global climate change is real— MTV News sat down with President Obama to discuss how he would approach this pressing issue in his second term if re-elected. Pointing out that the environment was mentioned in at least one debate in every presidential race since 1988 before being omitted from this year's three debates, during last week's "Ask Obama Live: An MTV Interview With the President"  special MTV News' Sway Calloway asked the president if he would make good on the promises he made during his first run for the White House to focus significant resources on environmental issues. "We're not moving as fast as we need to," Obama said. "This is an issue that future generations, MTV viewers, are going to have to be dealing with even more than the older generation is. So this is a critical issue." The president said he was surprised it did not come up in one of the debates because he feels that there is a "huge" contrast between his plan to deal with what some climate scientists have called a dire situation and that of his opponent, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. "Governor Romney says he believes in climate change, that's different than a lot of the members of his own party who just deny it completely, but he says he's not sure that man-made causes are the reason," said Obama. "I believe scientists, who say that we're putting too much carbon emissions into the atmosphere and it's heating the planet. And it's going to have a severe effect." For that reason, Obama noted, his administration has taken a number of steps over the past few years aimed at slowing down U.S. carbon emissions. Among the actions he cited: doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks (the first increase in 30 years in fuel mileage standards) and a doubling of clean energy production (wind, solar, biofuels). These acts, he said, will not only take "huge" amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere, but also decrease reliance on foreign fuel sources, save Americans money at the pump and allow private homes and companies to get electricity from clean sources. As he deals with the aftermath of Sandy, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg cited Obama's leadership on the environment in endorsing the president on Thursday. "We need leadership from the White House -- and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks," said Bloomberg, who also attributed the enormity of this week's storm to changes in the climate. "The next step is buildings and really ramp up our efficiency in buildings," Obama said of his future plans. "If we had the same energy efficiency as Japan, we would cut our energy use by about 20 percent ... that means we'd be taking a whole lot of carbon out of our atmosphere." If we do that, the president added, we can meet the targets he negotiated with other countries at a U.N. climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 to bring our carbon emissions down by 17 percent while creating new green jobs. "In order for us to solve the whole problem, though," he said. "We're going to have to have some technological breakthroughs, because countries like China and India ... they're building coal-fired power plants. They feel that they have to prioritize getting people out of poverty ahead of climate change. So what we have to do is help them, and help ourselves, by continuing to put money into research and technology about how do we get the new sources of power that are really going to make a difference?"

But the young industry has faced these types of uphill battles before, most recently in 2008 when corn prices skyrocketed and oil prices dropped. The industry recovered, however, and currently accounts for 10 percent of the U.S. fuel supply, with the ability to produce more. As the corn harvest comes to a close in the northern Plains, ethanol industry representatives express optimism that the industry will weather its latest series of challenges, but they caution that expanded market access is desperately needed in order for the industry to continue to grow. “The industry as a whole is struggling with access to the marketplace,” says Lisa Richardson, executive director of the South Dakota Corn Growers Association and South Dakota Corn Utilization Council. Earlier this year, E15 (a blend of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol by volume) was allowed into the market for use in 2001 and newer vehicles. The increase marked a much-needed opportunity to expand ethanol’s market share, but the oil industry immediately challenged the government’s decision to allow it and retailers have been slow to offer the new fuel option to their customers. “E15 is in its early stages of implementation,” says Jeff Zueger, chairman of the North Dakota Ethanol Council and general manager of Blue Flint Ethanol in Underwood, N.D. “Challenges with implementation primarily reside around retailers verifying pump and storage equipment compatibility with E15. The good news is that even at today’s elevated corn prices, ethanol is priced 50 cents to $1 lower than gasoline. As we work to implement E15 and higher level ethanol blends, this price advantage will put additional gallons of ethanol into the fuel supply.” North Dakota and South Dakota both offer incentives for retailers to install blender pumps, which dispense a variety of ethanol fuel blends, such as E15, E30 and E85, for use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs). Both programs have been extremely successful and, in fact, North Dakota has more blender pumps than any other state. Aside from offering higher blends to FFV drivers, retailers with blender pumps can more easily sell E15 to the larger vehicle pool, which can speed implementation. However, while local use impacts local producers and economies, even widespread adaptation in the Dakotas will not significantly impact ethanol’s national market share. “We really need the population bases to put their arms around it and the refiners to blend it up,” Richardson says. Currently, the nation’s ethanol production capacity is greater than the industry’s market share, which Zueger says has led to some plants slowing down or shutting down production. This year’s severe drought has delivered additional pressure in the form of high corn prices. Because drought conditions varied in South Dakota, Richardson says the success rates of ethanol plants in the state will likely reflect their proximity to good crops. Southeastern South Dakota suffered much drier conditions than the northern part of the state, for example. In North Dakota, the situation is a little brighter. “North Dakota corn growers produced a fantastic crop this year which will provide our plants with a market advantage in sourcing corn compared with facilities in drought impacted areas,” Zueger says. The future success or downfall of the ethanol industry will have a noticeable impact on economies in the region. Minnesota and South Dakota each produce more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually. North Dakota’s four ethanol plants produce a combined 400 million gallons each year. All three states rank among the top 10 states in terms of production capacity. Iowa, with approximately 3.5 billion gallons of annual capacity, leads the list. South Dakota’s ethanol producers are the No. 1 corn consumer in the state, requiring 350 million bushels of corn per year, according to Richardson. By comparison, livestock producers are the second largest corn customer, using 80 million bushels each year. North Dakota’s ethanol producers require approximately 140 million bushels of corn each year.

The President and his team continue to work with state and local partners to make sure that all available resources continue to be made available to support ongoing response and recovery. Already thousands of FEMA personnel and over ten thousand National Guardsmen are deployed in affected states to support the Governors and their teams. At the President’s direction, agencies are moving assets as quickly as possible, ensuring red tape is not standing in the way of making sure state and local responders have the federal resources they need. Now it is time for all Americans to join together so that we can recover, rebuild, and come back stronger than before. The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at whitehouse at 6:00 a.m. ET, Saturday, November 3, 2012. Remarks of President Barack Obama Weekly Address The White House November 3, 2012 This weekend, millions of our fellow Americans are still picking up the pieces from one of the worst storms in our history. I toured New Jersey on Wednesday with Governor Christie, and witnessed some of the terrible devastation firsthand. It’s heartbreaking. Families have lost loved ones. Entire communities have been wiped away. Even some of the first responders who repeatedly put themselves in harm’s way to bravely save the lives of others have suffered losses of their own. Today, I ask everyone to keep them in your prayers. And as President, I promise them this: your country will be there for you for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild. Throughout the week, I’ve been in constant contact with governors and mayors in the affected areas, who are doing an excellent job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. And we owe the first responders and National Guardsmen who have been working around the clock our deepest gratitude. Our number one concern has been making sure that affected states and communities have everything they need to respond to and recover from this storm. From the earliest hours, I ordered that resources be made available to states in the path of the storm as soon as they needed them. And I instructed my team not to let red tape and bureaucracy get in the way of solving problems – especially when it came to making sure local utilities could restore power as quickly as possible. Before the storm hit, FEMA pre-staged emergency response teams from North Carolina to Maine, and deployed resources like food, water, and generators up and down the coast. As the storm passed, thousands of FEMA personnel were on the ground responding to those in need. And by midweek, the Department of Defense was ready to fly in cargo planes that could be loaded with trucks and equipment to help local power companies get up and running faster. But recovery will be a long, hard road for many communities. There’s a lot of work ahead. If you’ve been directly impacted by this storm and need temporary assistance getting back on your feet, you can call ##, or apply at ##. If you know folks who are still without power, please spread the word and let them know. And if you don’t live in an affected area and want to help, supporting the Red Cross is the best and fastest way. This week, we have been humbled by nature’s destructive power. But we’ve been inspired as well. For when the storm was darkest, the heroism of our fellow citizens shone brightest. The nurses and doctors at NYU Medical Center who evacuated fragile newborns, carrying some down several flights of stairs. The firefighters in Queens who battled an inferno from flooded streets, and rescued people from an apartment building by boat. The Coast Guard crews from North Carolina who saved a sinking ship in stormy seas – and their rescue swimmer who, when he reached those in need, said, “I’m Dan, and I hear you guys need a ride.” That’s who we are. We’re Americans. When times are tough, we’re tougher. We put others first. We go that extra mile. We open our hearts and our homes to one another, as one American family. We recover, we rebuild, we come back stronger – and together we will do that once more. Thanks, God bless you, and God bless America. whitehouse</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351950944071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 09:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351951016480-6</Id><Title>Quotes...... for the clueless</Title><Msg>I contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. *Winston Churchill* A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul. *George Bernard Shaw* A liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man, which debt he proposes to pay off with your money. *G.

With 3 days to go, he is not the same candidate who left Barack Obama flat-footed in the first presidential debate in October...doing so by not beating the rightist #$%$ that got him to be the GOP's candidate.Now he's bleating the right-wing idiocy again.</Msg><Username>half_miles_davis</Username><Timestamp>1351971731057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351972797782-21</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney has shifted his views to suit conditions</Title><Username>half_miles_davis</Username><Timestamp>1351971731057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:42:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you're scared and you should be, especially if Obama gets another 4 years to push his socialist agenda.</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1351972797782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:59:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351974359053-22</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney has shifted his views to suit conditions</Title><Username>half_miles_davis</Username><Timestamp>1351971731057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:42:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That old line?</Msg><Username>half_miles_davis</Username><Timestamp>1351974359053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 16:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351975780383-23</Id><Topic><Title>Quotes...... for the clueless</Title><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1351951016480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 09:56:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look else where and find governments with out corporations and you will find no government at all.</Msg><Username>1molly2</Username><Timestamp>1351975780383</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 16:49:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351980842942-24</Id><Title>The Lie that uses 'socialism'</Title><Msg>Did Obama nationalize GM, AIG....all those companies the right said were "captured: by a socialist President? No. Is Obamacare socialist? The conservative Heritage Foundation said that if each citizen were required to take responsibility for their own healthcare the overall costs would drop. Romney took the idea, which became known as the ''individual mandate'', which eventually became the model for Obamacare. It has been hailed as a great success. The GOP blocked what they knew was best for the Country just to prevent Obama doing the job they knew he could do.</Msg><Username>westward969</Username><Timestamp>1351980842942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351982364137-25</Id><Title>More Republican Lies</Title><Msg>They say Obama is robbing the rich to pay the poor. Despite many major companies sitting on huge cash reserves, it was the Gov. that spent to prevent a depression. The banking crisis was perpetrated by those that will always vote for a Republican, and scream when they have to pay. Many US citizens are hurting right now, but not the rich. "Robbing the rich to pay the poor" means that the Republicans will add further pain to those that are already hurting.</Msg><Username>stenchengineer</Username><Timestamp>1351982364137</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:39:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351982503744-26</Id><Topic><Title>Mit Romney Calls Campaign A "Movement"</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1351962699620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:11:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not a bowel movement of course but, if it were, you would be a charter member.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351982503744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:41:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351983399430-27</Id><Topic><Title>How long before infernal and invest croak ???????????</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1351812178848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 19:22:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a complete fraud max. I have challenged you to back up your own statements with bets and you always run - just like the bully you always try to be. You won't take the bets to back up your bluster, you can't point out any bigotry or hypocrisy in my posts - but you still try to claim them. That's a typical lib tactic - embodied by the famous "JournoList." As to betting on my convictions, I am convinced that Romney would be a good president Obama is a disaster, and I do think Romney has a god chance of winning - but not betting on something as important as a presidential election doesn't mean I don't have convictions. If Obama can buy or steal enough votes, as Dems love to do, he could well win. You know, I used to actually think you were a lawyer as you claim but, reading your posts for this long produces serious doubts. I think you are just a big bluster trying to be a bully.
