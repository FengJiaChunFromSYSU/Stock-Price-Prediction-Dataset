These flex fuel pumps are located at Stop-N-Go and are two of roughly 80 E85/flex fuel pumps in Nebraska that offer fuel blends that include renewable ethanol. Flex fuel vehicles owners will find E30 and E85 at this location. These pumps also offer unleaded and E10, the most commonly sold fuel in the state. One in 10 Nebraska motorists currently own a flexible fuel vehicle that can run on any blend of ethanol and gasoline, up to E85, yet many drivers don’t realize it. Drivers can confirm whether their vehicle is flex fuel by checking the owner’s manual, gas cap or by looking for the flex fuel emblem on their vehicle. “We are seeing more flex fuel pumps going in across Nebraska because of the flexibility for motorists and also for the retailers,” said Kim Clark, director of biofuels development with the Nebraska Corn Board. “Every vehicle filling up is able to use flex fuel pumps, not just flex fuel vehicle owners, and retailers have started to recognize this.” Todd Sneller, administrator of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, said Nebraska is the nation’s second-largest producer of ethanol. When drivers fill up on E85 and other ethanol blends, they’re strengthening Nebraska’s economy, making the country more energy independent and going easier on the environment, he added. “Ethanol is also a less expensive alternative gasoline,” he said. The flex fuel pumps in Hartington were supported in part from a grant funded by the Nebraska Corn Board and Nebraska’s 23,000 corn farmers. norfolkdailynewsDOTcom/news/flex-fuel-pumps-now-open-in-hartington/article_d6976ac8-54ee-11e2-8052-0019bb30f31a.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357483894565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 09:51:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357490691512-3</Id><Title>Chaos...</Title><Msg>Energy Price Bubbles in the past 1792-1812. 150% increase in grain, wood, and coal some items rise in price more...global depression follows after war spending ends in 1814/1815. 1870-1873.

Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits? Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes? You and I don't propose a federal budget. The President does. You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does. You and I don't write the tax code, Congress does. You and I don't set fiscal policy, Congress does. You and I don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does. One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President, and nine Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country. I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank. I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a President to do one cotton-picking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes. Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party.</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1357500776902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:32:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357500915836-6</Id><Topic><Title>Politicians have betrayed our Country</Title><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1357500776902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:32:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits. The President can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it. The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House? John Boehner. He is the leader of the majority party. He and fellow House members, not the President, can approve any budget they want. If the President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to. It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist. If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair. If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red. If the Army &amp; Marines are in Iraq and Afghanistan it's because they want them in Iraq and Afghanistan ... If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way.</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1357500915836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:35:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357500971328-7</Id><Topic><Title>Politicians have betrayed our Country</Title><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1357500776902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:32:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are no insoluble government problems.

The “fiscal cliff” deal that lawmakers struck this week delayed the sequestered budget cuts until March, buying Congress a few more weeks to negotiate an agreement to stop them. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that the across-the-board cut from sequestration should be stopped, but remain deadlocked about what programs should get the axe instead. The stakes are high for the Energy Department (DOE), which would see its budget slashed 8.2 percent if sequestration were allowed to take effect. Democrats are vowing to protect funding for clean energy research in a sequestration deal, arguing the spending is critical for the environment and the country’s economic future. Democrats are also vowing to protect programs in DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). “The air we breathe, the water we drink, the energy we generate, and the environment in which we live should not be compromised by funding cuts now, or ever,” Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.) told The Hill in a statement. “There is bloated government spending that must be cut, but this is not the place for it, not when the sustainability of our people and our planet is at stake.” But Republicans say many of the clean energy programs —particularly the loans and grants that are designed to bring technology to market faster — are wasteful meddling in the marketplace that should be scrapped. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), a second-term lawmaker who opposes energy credits, said he believes Congress “can get rid of a big swath” of energy subsidies. “I’ve spent the first two years in Congress talking about these market distortions,” Pompeo told The Hill. “This is the stuff that five years ago wasn’t even talked about. I think we’ve made a lot of progress in getting awareness.” The battle to stop sequestration is being wrapped into the fight over a debt ceiling increase, which will likely be needed in March. Republicans are calling for a massive package of spending cuts in return for an increase in the federal borrowing limit. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said his committee would focus on finding savings in the energy budget to pair with an increase in the debt ceiling, though he didn’t specify which programs. "Every agency and program will be viewed with an eye toward savings — and spending cuts and significant reforms will be part and parcel of any debt ceiling extension,” Upton told The Hill in a statement. Some Democrats are hopeful that the two-month delay in sequestration will give lawmakers time to craft a package that includes not only spending reductions, but also tax increases. “I will do everything possible to end the political brinksmanship and work for bipartisan tax, budget and Medicare reforms that create good paying American jobs and protect the Medicare guarantee while holding down health care costs,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said in a statement. The 46-member House Democratic Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition said Congress should consider ending oil-and-gas tax incentives to cover some of the cost of reversing sequestration. "As members dedicated to clean energy and environmental protection, we will work to make sure that Congress develops a balanced approach that doesn't just focus on cutting these vital programs. One solution includes repealing subsidies for big oil and gas, which would raise an estimated $41 billion over 10 years,” the caucus said in a statement to The Hill. While many Republicans reject ending the oil-and-gas industry’s tax deductions — which are used by a multitude of industries — some appear willing to discuss closing a few of the industry's loopholes. Robert Dillon, spokesman with Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Lisa Murkowksi (R-Alaska), said the senator would be willing to have that discussion so long as Democrats are willing to make sacrifices. “Let’s recognize the Democrats are going after oil and gas tax credits because they think it’s a political talking point and a winner for them. We’re willing to look at them if it’s done in a rational, serious way, but that’s not been the case the past few years,” Dillon told The Hill. A “serious” approach should include eliminating subsidies that encourage deployment of clean energy technology, such as a wind power credit renewed in the “fiscal cliff” bargain, Dillon said. GOP lawmakers also would likely seek to zero out, or sharply reduce, federal stimulus-style research spending that helped firms commercialize technology. Republicans would prefer to prioritize basic research funding to help generate technological breakthroughs. Nick Loris, a policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said killing EERE would save $2.3 billion. “It’s a huge amount to spend on technologies where we already have viable companies,” Loris said. But Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy with the National Association of Manufacturers, warned against cuts to federal research and development programs. “You can’t just turn the switch back on,” Coleman said of letting research spending lapse. “You’re going to lose a lot of institutional knowledge and continuity. … There’s a real downside in the long term on innovation and R&amp;D.” Rob Mosher, legislative director with the Alliance to Save Energy said he thinks DOE’s research budget could be vulnerable in the spending talks to come. Mosher said research funding, as well as EERE programs such as building energy codes, federal energy management and the weatherization assistance program are likely to be targets. “These programs have demonstrated significant value over many years and we would like to see investment to these programs maintained. But we recognize with the ongoing push for austerity measures it will be a challenge,” Mosher told The Hill. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/275731-democrats-dig-in-against-cuts-to-clean-energy-programs</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357521043100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 20:10:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
