The U.S. Senate confirmed McCarthy as head of the Environmental Protection Agency in a 59-40 vote Thursday, ending one of the longest stalemates over an Obama Cabinet-level appointee. Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said McCarthy should consider U.S. oil and natural gas interests during her tenure. "President Obama has laid out a vision for an 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy, and we hope McCarthy's leadership will align the agency's regulations with that vision. It's critical for American jobs, revenue for our government, and our energy security," he said in a statement Thursday. API said when Obama nominated McCarthy in March it was concerned about "unnecessary" environmental regulations putting the U.S. economy at stake. The environmental group Sierra Club, meanwhile, said it was frustrated it took 137 days to approve the nomination of McCarthy, long-time assistant EPA administrator under former chief Lisa Jackson. "After dedicating her 25-year career to protecting our air and water, Gina McCarthy has a proven record of protecting American families and getting things done," Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement.

Starting July 1, 2014, every gallon of oil heat in the state will contain at least 2 percent biodiesel. The Bioheat blend is a greener heating oil gaining popularity in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. Although other New England states have passed similar bills, Rhode Island is on track to be the first to implement a statewide Bioheat requirement. The National Biodiesel Board congratulated the local government and the state's heating oil trade association for the progressive move. “I commend the Oil Heat Institute of Rhode Island for not sitting back and waiting for change to come to them,” said Paul Nazzaro, who spearheads the Bioheat education program for the NBB. “They recognized Bioheat as the future of their industry that can reverse the contraction of their market, and they took control of their own destiny.” Julie Gill, executive director and CEO of the Oil Heat Institute of Rhode Island, said getting the legislation passed took persistence and commitment. “We're proud that the Bioheat requirement has passed, because it will benefit not only our industry, but heating oil consumers in our state,” Gill said. “Oil heat systems run more effectively with a biodiesel blend, and Bioheat will help heating oil be more environmentally competitive. We will continue to work towards making our product the cleanest fuel available.” The legislation gradually increases the blend from 2 percent to 5 percent by 2017. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from agricultural byproducts and coproducts such as soybean oil and other fats and oils. It is the only domestically produced, commercially available advanced biofuel in the U.S., and supports 50,000 American jobs. biodieselmagazine</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1374346185858</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374346472441-5</Id><Title>New York Legislature Adopts Bioheat Requirement</Title><Msg>New York Legislature Adopts Bioheat Requirement State follows NYC's lead in adopting standards for biofuel in home heating oil Compiled by staff Published: Jun 25, 2013 Following New York City's lead, New York has now passed legislation requiring that all heating oil sold in the state contain at least 2% biodiesel, a product also known as bioheat. Biodiesel is the first alternative fuel designated as an advanced biofuel by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reach a billion gallons of annual production, the National Biodiesel Board said. It is domestically produced from agricultural co-products and byproducts such as soybean oil, animal fats, and recycled cooking oil. The legislation calls for all heating oil sold in the City of New York, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland counties to contain at least 2% biodiesel by Oct. 1, 2014, and all heating oil sold statewide to meet this standard by July 1, 2015. The legislation will become effective upon the governor's signature. State follows NYCs lead in adopting standards for biofuel in home heating oil State follows NYC's lead in adopting standards for biofuel in home heating oil Julia Robbins, Executive Director, New York Corn and Soybean Association, said the policy will provide farmers a new market for soybean oil. The NBB estimates that the 2% standard will replace about 30 million gallons of petroleum annually with the bioheat. In New York City, testing has shown that biodiesel blended with traditional heating oil improves fuel efficiency through cleaning and preserving equipment, John Maniscalco, CEO of the New York Oil Heating Association said. "This law extends these tremendous benefits to all New Yorkers and will provide the state with the cleanest, most sustainable heating oil in the country," he added.

But, it’s becoming increasingly clear that biodiesel is an industry that’s both rapidly growing and here to stay, especially as it moves into the heating fuel industry. In this article, we’ll take a look at what impact this move could have on the industry, where it’s headed from here, and how investors can take advantage of the movement. Biodiesel Mandates Expand to Heating In early July, the New York State Assembly and Senate passed legislation requiring that all heating oil sold in the state contain at least 2% biodiesel by 2015. The new regulation will replace about 30 million gallons of petroleum each year with cleaner burning, renewable fuel that is safe, seamless and improves fuel efficiency throughout the state. New York City had already passed and implemented similar heating fuel laws back in 2010, when the City Council passed a law requiring all home heating oil to be made with biodiesel by October 2012. The resulting “BioHeat” fuel is an ultra low sulfur heating oil combined with 2% biodiesel, with several tax incentives in place to ensure prices remain low. Interestingly, New York City regulators have also been considering broader biodiesel mandates for their municipal vehicle fleets earlier this year. While no official plans have been announced, city officials are reportedly planning a move from a B5 fleet to a B20 fleet and even considering public biodiesel requirements that could impact private companies. Extrapolating a Potential Market Size The new regulations in New York could set a precedent for similar laws in other states, if they are successful in reducing emissions without significant cost increases.
