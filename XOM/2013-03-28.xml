This hurts Jim's ego. 2) because Jim is not into long term investments with long term strategies. He also does not like the fact that Xom is stingy with their divvy. I am not a Cramer fan of his picking of stocks . He is often badly wrong.... Like AAPL is going to $1000, and gold is going to $2000. Well , I can say XOM is going to beat both of those , by going to $100 first . XOM has one of the best cultures in the business to protect shareholder value . Their return on shareholder capital employed is amount the best year after year. That takes discipline.... Something Cramer lacks.</Msg><Username>ah673000</Username><Timestamp>1364461480334</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 05:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364474700460-4</Id><Topic><Title>higher dividends?</Title><Username>hrant4005</Username><Timestamp>1364087805846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great accountant answer. This is NOT an accounting class. Divies and buybacks ARE different. Just look at the terms of executive pay and you'll get a more personally quantitative accounting!

Their force is quite modern now. German panzers are better than the American versions, so naturally they buy German. The Saudis really love American movies too, and I'm sure they are inspired by the portrayal of German panzer divisions on the warpath. They must have their own. Of course we can sell... Germany itself is cutting back on the military, with a cut of around 1 billion euros yearly over the next few years. There is a war though, the war on fossil fuels... That is escalating. So far the USA has put in a poor effort, but should change with the likely change in rule in 2015.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364478097017</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:41:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364481211025-9</Id><Title>NG 4.25-4.50</Title><Msg>April price</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1364481211025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364481220209-10</Id><Topic><Title>higher dividends?</Title><Username>hrant4005</Username><Timestamp>1364087805846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am going to make a guess that the dividend will go up to $.3.00 this June.

After Germany's nobles and the King of Poland came to the rescue of the Austrians and crushed their enemy for them they became very aggressive empire builders. Austrian society came to be comprised of nobles, university educated elites in the bureaucracy, and everyone else. The lower classes became very soft and complacent under the watchful eye of the Austrian state police and its ruling class, and reveled in their "commonness" and entertainments. The softness of the people was learned and encouraged. The Austrians did have a problem ruling a multi-cultural empire in such a way, which simply required them to be even tougher and more dictatorial in their methods. As for what went on in the Court of Vienna. The women do look very flowery and feminine, and the men are impeccably groomed and mannered. That was a show and a ritual. The women were in reality huntresses, and the men very willing to be hunted, and hunt themselves. Germany and Austria did go to war, but Germany had not intention of crushing Austria, just showing their nobles who was in charge to their north. I don't think the Austrian elites who guided the country and industry every really became soft. The lower classes probably are to this day, but then that is not really new.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364487986056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364488767929-19</Id><Topic><Title>Buyout rumor???
