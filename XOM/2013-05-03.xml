You don't like your own medicine either which I find very amusing. *The point of the article is to highlight the fact that European natural gas prices rise and fall because of the oil price. This point is sufficient for my earlier post. *The article advances a further point on punishing market manipulators which could have useful applications. *I have plenty money and income to keep me and the one I buy silk panties for comfortable forever. I did inherit a large amount of money from a source you probably would not approve of. *I did work in London banking for a few years too, which is the meaning of this ID, although the ID just refers to a defunct trading compound near to real ones. I enjoy being elitist, and arrogant, and pushing people around (although never women) and don’t really care if people object. *You are very sensitive and want to be liked. I can tell. I think you want me to like your company and this industry as well. Too bad…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367562024328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 02:20:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367576036244-2</Id><Topic><Title>Europe &amp; Russia vs. USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367505988180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wall street journal is a commie liar paper.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1367576036244</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 06:13:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367576176442-3</Id><Topic><Title>maxidopey</Title><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1367310662866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 04:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe it.

" And you do? A joke. "You don't like your own medicine either which I find very amusing." Do you read your own posts? "I have plenty money and income to keep me and the one I buy silk panties for comfortable forever. I did inherit a large amount of money". I have plenty of money as well, none of which was inherited. It was all earned through dealing with the real, not academic, world. "I enjoy being elitist, and arrogant, and pushing people around (although never women) and don’t really care if people object." Well I can certainly agree with that statement of yours, which says a lot. But being arrogant and elitist certainly doesn't make you right. Not sure how long you will stay on this board - doubtful it will be very long based on past experiences - but I will enjoy your arrogant prognostications for s long as you do. And will respond with nasty comments when the spirit so moves.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1367581700194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:48:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367582863005-5</Id><Title>Billionaire Kaiser Exploiting Charity Loophole (Bloomberg)</Title><Msg>How democrats act while lecturing the rest of us... google it or search it in Yahoo finance today</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1367582863005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 08:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367588062825-6</Id><Topic><Title>Europe &amp; Russia vs. USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367505988180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh but I do have enough to prove what I want to prove... It depends on what one is trying to achieve with language whether a tone such as you display, and I use whenever it pleases me, matters. Pointing out vileness does not mean one cares and personally objects to the vileness – just that one pointed it out. To claim that one necessarily should care about the vileness by pointing it out is a form of biased induction (spurious type logic) based on a personal belief that such a care should exist. One can advance a personal opinion such as that but it is no more than an opinion. If one believes that such a care should exist, and then engages in the vileness, one is by definition a self-righteousness hypocrite. Illuminating that is useful I think. You obviously think such a care should exist too, and, further are quite clearly are sensitive about how you are perceived, which makes it all them more entertaining. For me there is no such difficulty, as I reject the system of mores behind the caring. My code of conduct only applies to the female sex. I can tell you are not female, nor is anyone else I’ve been conversing with. I’m not going to treat you like I would a female either. I could care less what jibberish you choose to add to anything I write…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367588062825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:34:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367592478524-7</Id><Title>Northeast Gas Poised to Surge on Pipeline Limits: Energy Markets</Title><Msg>Regional costs may average $5 to $5.50 per million British thermal units, with the potential to jump to $7 to $8. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-03/northeast-gas-poised-to-surge-on-pipeline-limits-energy-markets.html</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1367592478524</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367594541517-8</Id><Title>PTR is a buy here</Title><Msg>It's one of the core Chinese state own enterprises...
