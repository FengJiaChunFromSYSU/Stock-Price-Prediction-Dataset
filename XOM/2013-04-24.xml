You ignore the royals and urban elites. *Your view on French history is wrong. You ignore the return of the émigré elites and Napoleon I/III. *You don’t understand European elitism either, which is obvious. Look into the female dynamic. Upper class women were not playthings of men and decorations but co-equal partners in running society, and the brand of elitism created by them and the state dictated intellect and ambition, not entitlement to wealth. Low achievers were rapidly drained of their wealth by the expense of keeping up appearance among superiors. Marrying middle class ambition with upper class money and stability is a powerful combination, and has invigorated the blood for a couple of centuries… Your opinion on Europe needs revising...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366778504799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:41:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366778687904-2</Id><Topic><Title>Artificial Photosynthesis, major new threat for oil &amp; gas</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366257529466</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 23:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Verbs are conjugated a certain way for a reason – to indicate whether the action referred to is in the past, present, or future.

Lawmakers unveiled the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act — spearheaded in the Senate by Sens. Chris #$%$ (D-Del.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and in the House by Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) — during a Wednesday news conference. The bill would extend master limited partnerships to renewable energy projects ranging from wind power to energy efficiency. Currently, only oil-and-gas projects can use the financing mechanism. “This market-driven solution supports the all-of-the-above energy strategy we need to power our country for generations to come. Our legislation will unleash private capital, create jobs and modernize our tax code,” #$%$ said in a statement. Master limited partnerships are investment arrangements that are taxed like a partnership, but whose interests are traded like stock. Proponents say it helps reduce the cost of capital by spreading risk among more investors. Since it’s a tax bill, the legislation will go through the Senate Finance Committee in the upper chamber, and the House Ways and Means Committee in the lower chamber. The companion bills will have supporters in those committees. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a bill co-sponsor, chairs the Finance Committee’s energy panel. And Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Finance Committee and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also backs the bill. In the House, Thompson is leading the Ways and Means energy task force. Some prominent Republicans have signed on to co-sponsor the Senate version, including Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Moran. The bill's sponsors expect to pick up more conservatives, with.. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/295843-lawmakers-float-renewable-energy-finance-bill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366827421739</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 14:17:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366828852014-19</Id><Title>Neil Young Fills ‘er Up with Cellulosic Ethanol VIDEO</Title><Msg>Neil Young Fills ‘er Up with Cellulosic Ethanol VIDEO Posted by Joanna Schroeder – April 24th, 2013 Earlier this month, Hall of Fame recording artist Neil Young stopped by Sioux Falls, South Dakota to fill up his LincVolt with POET-DSM cellulosic ethanol. LincVolt is a hybrid-electric 1959 Lincoln Continental with onboard charging powered by cellulosic ethanol. He’s on a cross-country tour to highlight renewable energy. During his visit, Young said you don’t see much about what is going on with the climate in the media. “It’s just not a fast moving subject. It’s a slow moving big story. But it’s not going to be going away unless we do something.” He supports American-made fuel and noted that when he filled up with cellulosic ethanol, his vehicle is able to get an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) over traditional gasoline. “This is just incredible for the planet,” added Young. Check out the video here and I must say his refurbished Lincoln is “DYNOMITE”. domesticfuelDOTcom/2013/04/24/neil-young-fills-er-up-with-poet-dsm-cellulosic-ethanol/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366828852014</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 14:40:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366829655187-20</Id><Title>Is there any incentive for anyone involved in oil to assassinate Obama if he stops the Keystone Pipeline?</Title><Msg>There's a lot of money at stake, and the love of money is the root of all evil.</Msg><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1366829655187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 14:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366830343195-21</Id><Topic><Title>**************** Dividend To Remain UnChanged !!!! ************************</Title><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1366813259957</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 10:20:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WE received an increase of .06 cents TODAY!!!, as my grandmother use to say, this is better then a stick in the eye.</Msg><Username>dennie_cunningham</Username><Timestamp>1366830343195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:05:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366848938933-22</Id><Title>Canadian official in D.C. to push Keystone oil sands pipeline</Title><Msg>By Zack Colman - 04/24/13 05:46 PM ET Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver is touting the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline in meetings with congressional energy leaders and the State Department this week, he told The Hill in a Wednesday interview at the Canadian Embassy. “There’s a lot of support,” Oliver said of congressional opinion on Keystone. Oliver was fresh off a meeting with Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). He kept the details of that conversation confidential. “He wasn’t viewed as being in the supporters’ camp. So we’re not staying away from people who may not be fully supportive. I think it’s important for me to hear what the issues are that are of concern,” Oliver said. The minerals chief will meet Thursday with Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Robert Hormats, the undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment with the State Department. Oliver’s visit is the latest effort in a Canadian push to secure United States support for the Canada-to-Texas pipeline, the northern leg of which requires a cross-border permit from the White House. Oliver said Keystone is vital to Canada, especially given its current economic state of affairs. While its finances are good compared to most Western nations, Canada's growth rate is slowing. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's conservative government has turned to energy exports as a way to generate revenues — and Keystone is a way to expedite that process. “For Canada, it’s also an outlet for the oil we have,” Oliver said of Keystone. “It’s really important for our country, for our economic development, for our industry.

Dlouhy in BOEM| Oil and gas companies will have a chance to buy drilling rights on more than 21 million acres in the western Gulf of Mexico during a lease sale in August. The lease sale, formally scheduled on Wednesday for Aug. 28 in New Orleans, will come one year after an auction of similar western Gulf tracts that netted nearly $134 million. Some 3,953 blocks spanning 21.2 million acres will be up for grabs in the auction, with water depths ranging from 16 to roughly 11,000 feet. For the first time in years, companies will not be able to take advantage of a federal royalty relief program aimed at gas extracted from deep-water tracts purchased in the lease sale, since that provision is set to expire on May 3. Big investments: Oil companies bid $1.6 billion for central Gulf drilling rights And while companies will have a chance to bid on acreage near the international boundary dividing the U.S. and Mexico continental shelf, those offers may never be unsealed. The area has been off limits for more than a decade. Although a Feb. 20, 2012 agreement between Mexico and the U.S. sets the framework for oil and gas development along that boundary, and the Mexican Senate ratified it last year, it has not yet been authorized by U.S. lawmakers. Instead, it has stalled on Capitol Hill. The proposed notice of sale unveiled Wednesday includes details about the possible terms that will govern five-, seven- and 10-year leases purchased in the upcoming auction, as well as the environmental mitigation that energy companies would be required to follow. Companies will be forced to pay a minimum bonus bid of $25 per acre (or fraction) for acreage in less than 400 meters of water and $100 or more per acre for blocks in deeper territory. Energy produced from the leases would be subject to an 18.75 percent royalty rate plus annual rental fees starting at $7 per acre fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/04/24/western-gulf-lease-sale-set-for-aug-28/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366849719950</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 20:28:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
