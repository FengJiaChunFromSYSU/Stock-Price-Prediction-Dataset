The laws of diminishing return and high commodity &amp; energy prices reducing return with price ensure it. They embarked on their path of resource intensive development because when they did resources were cheap. That is not longer the case. Certainly they will eliminate high cost natural gas imports first (linked to high oil prices) with wind &amp; solar to take advantage of the low marginal cost power from such sources. With their system of government they will have no difficulty copying Germany's rate structures precisely to ensure that their consumers bear the high fixed cost of alternative energy and that industry &amp; government profits from the low marginal cost power. Over time they will be able to push the high fixed costs down as technology improves. Also they will be able to boost their rate of economic growth considerably by putting high taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel which will reduce their imported oil expense. The savings they reap from the taxes will allow them to fund more electrified rail and research into electric cars, and pollution reduction programs to address their rapidly increasing healthcare costs. It will be elementary, going forward, for them to purchase European (mostly German) equipment to increase the efficiency of their power systems, factories, and lower their commodity &amp; energy inputs cost. As lower raw material demand feeds into world markets it will devastate the economies of third world countries and oil demand in those places, much of which derives from China's demand for raw materials. ........... Compound this with Germany's and the EU's effort to eliminate fossil fuels and the outlook for energy and commodities is especially poor. The German government is funding the effort to develop batteries, electric cars, and materials and energy systems technologies to make fossil fuels obsolete...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367498086351</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 08:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367498529476-5</Id><Topic><Title>Need investment advice.</Title><Username>panhandler_jim</Username><Timestamp>1367424845080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Your advice is get your money out of the bank buy a defensible farm, guns, ammo and advertise for a harem."

The first-quarter loss widened to $569 million from $304 million a year earlier, the Dallas-based company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made public today. Energy Future, formerly known as TXU, has struggled to generate profits since it was taken private six years ago in the largest leveraged buyout in history. Wholesale electricity prices have dropped on a decline in natural gas costs, which fell 86 percent from a 2008 high. Total debt rose to $43.4 billion among all the company’s units, from $43.2 billion at the end of last year. Creditors rejected a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan to restructure debt held by one of its units, the company said April 15. The company had proposed a plan in which creditors would forgive debt held by its unregulated power unit in exchange for equity in Energy Future and $5 billion in cash or new debt. KKR &amp; Co., TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaders of the $48 billion buyout, said they would support the proposed Energy Future restructuring if they can retain a 15 percent equity stake in the company. “We and the creditors have not reached agreement on the terms of any change in our capital structure and are currently not engaged in ongoing negotiations,” the company said in today’s filing. Energy Future’s units include Luminant, which owns more than 15,400 megawatts of power plant capacity in Texas; TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller; and Oncor Electric Delivery Company, a regulated power-line unit that supplies electricity to more than 3 million homes and businesses. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/02/energy-future-reports-569-million-first-quarter-loss/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367500441493</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367500765879-8</Id><Title>Statoil profit slides more than estimated as production declines</Title><Msg>May 2, 2013 at 6:46 am by Bloomberg Statoil ASA (STL), Norway’s biggest energy company, said profits fell by 29 percent in the first quarter on lower oil and gas output in Norway, Brazil and as a terrorist attack shut a facility in Algeria. Adjusted net income fell to 12 billion kroner ($2.1 billion) from 16.8 billion kroner a year earlier, the Stavanger- based company said today, missing an average estimate of 13.7 billion kroner in a Bloomberg survey of 16 analysts. Net income dropped to 6.4 billion kroner from 15.1 billion kroner in the first quarter of 2012, while sales declined to 162.2 billion kroner from 194.8 billion. “We deliver financial results impacted by lower production and reduced prices,” Chief Executive Officer Helge Lund said in a statement. “We continue to deliver good industrial progress according to plan. As previously announced, production in 2013 will be lower than in 2012.” Statoil, of which Norway’s government owns 67 percent, is expanding abroad to raise production to more than 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020 from 2 million barrels in 2012, with gains in U.S. output accounting for two thirds of that growth. The company has said production would fall in 2013 after it sold some Norwegian assets and on lower-than-expected growth of its U.S. shale gas output. First-quarter production fell to 1.998 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 2.193 million barrels a day in the same period last year, the company said. That beat the 1.985 million-barrel estimate from a survey of 9 analysts. The company took a 4.9 billion kroner writedown on a contract at its Cove Point terminal.

They sell their natural gas to Germany and other European countries at oil linked prices, which bear no resemblance to the miniscule cost of producing gas in Russia. The reason industrial power rates have not collapsed even further than they have in Germany and other countries is the high cost of natural gas driven up by the oil price; high natural gas prices offset low marginal cost power from solar &amp; wind. However oil prices will crash as global supplies increase in the face of faltering demand. When that happens European natural gas prices will plummet and the cost of industrial power will plummet as well. Then American industry will face the competition of European industry supplied with very cheap power courtesy of cheap natural gas, and cheap marginal cost solar &amp; wind deployed in increasing scale. American industrial power demand will falter in the face of such competition, especially when combined with the relentless demand from cheap Chinese industrial power and products derived therefrom. Demand for coal &amp; natural gas in the USA will be forced down, lowering prices as well as consumption levels. It will be difficult for American utilities to match power rates industry will require to compete against Europe and China, and many may well go bankrupt trying, but not before causing extreme losses for their fossil fuel suppliers. It goes without saying that the oil industry will be totally devastated by a drop in oil prices and faltering demand for natural gas as well. Places like Texas and a few other resource rich US states will suffer most. Those places have been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dismal US economy - except that is Wall Street based speculation in places like NYC.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367505988180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:46:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367507425248-11</Id><Topic><Title>Europe &amp; Russia vs. USA</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1367505988180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Complete BS as usual.

It’s natural gas, that stuff we get from “fracking.” To be fair, good things come from the fracking boom like jobs drilling wells, new industrial plants, and the hope America may be energy independent one day. But Sherry Vargson is not enthusiastic. Chesapeake Energy fracked her Pennsylvania farm and now her tapwater fizzes with twice the methane that could cause an explosion. Chesapeake gives her bottled water, though that might end soon since gas production on her farm dropped dramatically and her monthly royalty checks have fallen from $1000 to $100. If that’s just natural, as Chesapeake says, let’s examine some other facts. Energy companies get methane by drilling horizontally for a mile or more into deep shale and injecting chemicals, sand, and millions of gallons of water. That fractures the rock and releases gas, hence the name, “fracking.” One problem with this process is that fracking chemicals can enter drinking water wells. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes are already in the gas deposits and may also be in fracking chemicals. VOCs create ozone and cause headaches, loss of coordination, liver and kidney damage, respiratory and immune system damage, adrenal and pituitary tumors, and joint pain -- symptoms many have who live near gas wells in states like Colorado, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania. Then there is leakage.

In Reversal, Neighbors Squeeze Russia's Gazprom Over Natural-Gas Prices MOSCOW ----May 1, 2013 “Gazprom's practices also drew attention from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which monitors anticompetitive behavior in the 27-nation bloc. In the fall of 2011, EU authorities conducted early-morning raids at the offices of some of Gazprom's units and customers in Europe. Last September, the EU opened an antitrust investigation into whether Gazprom used its dominant position to suppress competition and set unfair prices in Central and Eastern Europe. The Kremlin denounced the investigation as political, hitting back with a decree banning state companies from cooperating with foreign regulators. The European Commission says the investigation remains active. Legal experts say the commission could fine Gazprom up to 10% of its total revenues—around $15 billion—and force it to overhaul the way it sells gas in Europe, including its practice of tying contracts to the price of oil.” Of course with Russian natural gas export prices up 500% since 1999, in mathematical lockstep with the oil price, one might get suspicious even without any basic knowledge. But then that would require knowledge, and the ability to think. ......... Why don't you just do "your" country a favor and foregone the insane asylum. Find a beach and take a walk...

The $860 million project, known as Oregon Clean Energy LLC, still needs approval from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, which will hold an informational meeting Wednesday to answer questions about the required draft air permit. But with conditional approval now given by the power siting board, the project’s developer, North American Project Development LLC, says initial construction of the plant could begin in June. The plant will consist of two natural-gas-fired turbines that are combined cycle units — that is, they generate electricity by burning natural gas but use the heat given off from the natural gas burners to create steam and generate additional watts with a steam turbine. The permit application approved Wednesday says the plant could be ready for operation as early as May 1, 2016. The plant is to be located in the Cedar Point Development Park off North Lallendorf Road just south of the BP-Husky refinery. The siting board’s staff recommended the application be approved because nearly 6 gigawatts of electric generation capacity are scheduled to go offline permanently in Ohio in 2015, including 2½ gigawatts in FirstEnergy Corp.’s territory. The Oregon Clean Energy plant could help offset a significant portion of that lost 2½ gigawatts. The Oregon facility would help ensure electric service reliability and price stability. Additionally, the application states that construction of the plant would create an estimated 532 temporary construction jobs and $225 million in direct expenditures in Lucas County during the 35-month construction phase. The facility would employ 25 full-time workers and toledobladeDOTcom/Energy/2013/05/02/Siting-board-OKs-860M-power-plant.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367520240185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:44:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367520542684-17</Id><Title>Dems call for ban on fracking waste</Title><Msg>May 2, 2013 Written by Russ Zimmer Ohio House Democrats introduced a bill Wednesday that would make it illegal to dispose of oilfield waste in deep underground injection wells. The possibilities of such a ban becoming law seem slim given other ill-fated attempts at legislation that ultimately would raise costs on the oil and gas industry. The proposal would make it illegal to dispose of brine into one of Ohio’s 179 active Class II injection wells, which shoot the liquid into a deep geologic formation sometimes more than 10,000 feet below the surface. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ definition of brine includes the salty, naturally occurring water as well as the chemical- and sand-laced water used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Under current state law, that mixture must be either reused at another well site or disposed of underground. Most of the fracking waste that is injected in Ohio comes from out of state. One of the bill’s co-sponsors, Rep. Denise Driehaus, D-Cincinnati, said she’s confident Ohioans don’t want to be Pennsylvania’s dumping ground. She unsuccessfully fought for a temporary moratorium on horizontal hydraulic fracturing in 2011 and couldn’t get any traction in the Republican-controlled legislature for another proposal on fracking rules. More recently, Gov. John Kasich watched as members of his own party stripped an incremental raise in the severance tax — the proceeds from which the governor was going to use for income tax cuts — from the state budget. Driehaus said she at least wants to talk about these concerns. “The House rules state they are obligated to give us a hearing on this bill,” she said. “Whether or not it will move beyond that I don’t know.” In addition to not shooting it underground, the use of oilfield brine on roads also would be prohibited should the bill pass.

The delivery of 100 gallons of the fuel to the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory marks another step in the Madison renewable energy firm's quest to produce renewable fuels at a commercial scale. Virent commissioned its new demonstration plant in January, under a $1.5 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation. The jet fuel must now be tested to meet standards set up by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Testing will take place at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which in 2011 had given good marks to a more limited amount of Virent test jet fuel. "This larger sample will help generate the performance data needed to advance the technology toward engine and flight testing," said Tim Edwards of the Air Force Research Lab, in a statement. "The successful operation of our new distillate demonstration plant and the validation of Virent's plant-based jet fuel will advance our efforts to achieve ASTM-certified jet fuel and to prepare for commercial scaling," said Randy Cortright, Virent co-founder and chief technology officer, in a statement. Virent, founded in 2001, is licensing technology developed in the chemistry labs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that uses a catalytic process to convert the sugars from plants into biofuels. Lourdes Maurice of the FAA Office of Environment and Energy said the fuel will be used with industry and government partners that are testing a variety of alternative jet fuels to meet FAA environmental and energy goals.
