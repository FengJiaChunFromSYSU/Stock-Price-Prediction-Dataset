One thing Germany has going for it is it has less 3 world country origin immigrants than the USA, or Spain, or France. School test results always show the truth, that European and Asian origin country students are generally much smarter than those with origins from middle to southern hemisphere 3 world countries. In fact, the origin countries economic conditions are somewhat indicative of this difference, aren't they? The truth is racist for sure! So the USA, with its wide open arms to accept all, is now a majority of 3 world country origin people who are not as smart and not as work oriented as the European origin people who founded the country. We are now capsizing because the boat is full of those who can't or won't row. As far as moving to another country, i figure the last country standing after the economic conflagration will most likely be China, and they will end up taking over Europe and then the USA, so China will come to me, if i live that long.

PAUL, Minn. — Several environmental and conservation groups are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over air pollution in Voyageurs National Park and Isle Royale. The suit filed in federal district court in St. Paul claims the pollution comes from Xcel Energy's power plant in Sherburne County. Sherco is the biggest plant in Xcel's fleet; it burns three trainloads of coal a day. Three years ago, the National Park Service determined the plant contributes to haze in Voyageurs and Isle Royale. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA can force Xcel to install pollution controls. But it has not done so. Kevin Reuther, an attorney representing the National Parks Conservation Association and other groups, said Xcel could install scrubbers, switch to natural gas, or close the plant. "We would love it if Xcel decided that they want to shut Sherco down and replace it with renewable energy sources and more efficiency," Reuther said. Reuther said it's not just the parks that are being harmed. "This is the stuff that we're breathing," Reuther said. "This causes lung disease, heart disease; there are major public health consequences from continuing to emit these pollutants." In a statement, Xcel Energy said Sherco does not cause haze in the parks, but the company is installing controls that will cut haze-causing pollution in half. minnesotaDOTpublicradioDOTorg/display/web/2012/12/05/environment/environmental-protection-agency-voyaguers-national-park-isle-royale-haze-laws/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354819233549</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 13:40:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354820898029-9</Id><Title>Report: Mass. will be hit harder than other states by Obamacare tax</Title><Msg>Massachusetts families and small businesses are scheduled to be hit with higher health insurance premiums starting in 2014 when a new federal tax on health plans kicks in, jeopardizing the state’s efforts to rein in health care spending, according to a new report and industry leaders. With the focus from politicians and government leaders on tax increases and spending cuts associated with the near-term fiscal cliff, other looming tax increases also stand to have chilling effect on business growth. Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans will be hit with a new sales tax in 2014 projected to generate $8 billion initially and up to $14.3 billion by 2018. The tax increases each year after it takes effect, and the Congressional Committee on Taxation estimates the health insurance tax will exceed $100 billion over the next decade. A new report from America’s Health Insurance Plans estimates that Massachusetts families and small businesses will be hit particularly hard. The excise tax extends to Medicaid Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care plans. The state-by-state analysis, conducted by Oliver Wyman for the payer organization, projected that Massachusetts would be the tenth hardest hit state in the country by the new tax approved by Congress to help pay for the expansion of health care coverage under ObamaCare. From 2014 through 2023, the tax will cost Massachusetts residents and businesses an estimated $3.85 billion to $3.89 billion in surcharges on health plans, according to the report. “At a time when the state is taking steps to contain cost, the health insurance tax at the federal level is going to exacerbate the challenge of getting costs under control,” said Eric Linzer, senior vice president for government relations at the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans. Families purchasing health plans through the private market would pay on average $9,937 more over the next 10 years for their plans, second only to New York, while family coverage offered through Massachusetts small business would rise by $7,895 over that period. The cost on small businesses in Massachusetts, which is typically shared with employees, ranked fifth behind West Virginia, New York, New Hampshire and Nebraska. “With full implementation of the ACA a year away, the focus needs to be on making coverage more affordable,” said AHIP President and CEO Karen Ignagni. “Taxing health insurance will have the opposite effect by making it more expensive.” Gov. Deval Patrick and the state Legislature have prioritized making health care more affordable, last summer passing a comprehensive payment reform bill that will experiment with alternative payments and caps on cost growth to reduce expenses. Health care now consumes more than 40 percent of the state budget, and leaders frequently site the high cost of insurance in Massachusetts as an impediment to business growth. The new cost control law sets the 2013 health care cost growth benchmark at 3.6 percent. The governor and many Democrats in the Bay State have also been staunch supporters of the Affordable Care Act, while some like U.S. Sen. Scott Brown (R-Wrentham) and U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-Lowell) have called for the repeal of some of the taxes in ObamaCare, particularly the tax on medical device manufacturers. The report estimates that the tax could reduce future private sector employment over the next 10 years by 159,000 jobs, and reduce sales nationwide by $18 billion. “What would have to happen at the federal level is a repeal of the insurance tax. The unfortunate thing about this tax is that it’s going to add to the cost of care which is the opposite goal of the ACA,” Linzer said.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354820898029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:08:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354821035350-10</Id><Title>Serves them right</Title><Msg>Report: Mass. will be hit harder than other states by Obamacare tax</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354821035350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:10:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354821588349-11</Id><Title>Conservative Think Tank To Become Stupid Tank.</Title><Msg>As the cry baby Jim Demint leaves the Senate to wallow in the riches of this foundation of fascism the once proud "Think Tank" will now be viewed properly as a stupid tank as Jim Demint is the ultimate right wing #$%$</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354821588349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:19:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354824526942-12</Id><Topic><Title>Conservative Think Tank To Become Stupid Tank.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354821588349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:19:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ #$%$ traitor.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1354824526942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:08:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354824683745-13</Id><Topic><Title>Conservative Think Tank To Become Stupid Tank.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354821588349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:19:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All his life, Mr Brain Dead wahleee boy has hoped he could elevate himself to stupid, but finally realizes there is no hope so he is always angry and jealous.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354824683745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:11:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354830733779-14</Id><Title>M(b) itch McConnell filibusters himself--gop at new low</Title><Msg>When Harry Reid agreed to hold a vote on M (b)itch Mccuntells proposal the joke leader of the senate gop had to filibuster himself this is a 1st for the senate after 200 years of congressional shenanigans--Mccuntell is able to out stupid every senator in history A M A Z I N G what the gop has become--so sad even jim dimwit is so ashamed he is taking a joke position to distance himself from gop nonsense</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1354830733779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:52:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354850932063-15</Id><Title>dr Demento does a Palin</Title><Msg>never mind you have commitments to the people that elected you got a chance to make more money--take it and run big mouth all talk--no action--perfect for the new gop ho' Haley will find another spineless political mouth to replace you with--easily</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1354850932063</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354852314666-16</Id><Topic><Title>dr Demento does a Palin</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1354850932063</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:28:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prediction, Haley pulls a Cheney and picks herself.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354852314666</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:51:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354852507844-17</Id><Title>Republican Party Of Stupid Brings Nothing But Destruction to USA</Title><Msg>Unnecessary wars that kill our soldiers and cost trillions, tax cuts that benefit Cayman Island banks while pushing America toward insolvency and the Congress that holds EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN HOSTAGE every chance it gets proves that these filthy rats hate everything about this nation but the capital they can stuff in their pockets.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354852507844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354854362651-18</Id><Topic><Title>Serves them right</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354821035350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 14:10:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Truth hurts doesn't it.

The report, commissioned by the Energy Department (DOE), was a win for export advocates who are urging DOE to approve a slew of application to send liquefied natural-gas abroad. Not so fast, says Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who is the incoming chairman of the Senate’s energy committee and a critic of export proposals. “My staff has already spotted some concerns [with the report],” Wyden told reporters in the Capitol on Thursday. “Particularly they are concerned that the projection that they used for purposes of saying ‘this would be the amount exported’ is significantly under what is now already evident.” The report called exports a net economic benefit for the U.S., but it would also raise prices to some extent. Export critics fear that sending lots of gas overseas could raise costs for domestic manufacturers that rely on the fuel. The Houston Chronicle, in a story Thursday, reports that manufacturing and chemical companies are “stepping up pressure on the Obama administration to limit exports” of natural gas.

He’s done more in first four years than any other administration has ever done, and I respect that and acknowledge that. But the time has long since passed for us to get moving.” The former vice president introduced New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who later spoke about Superstorm Sandy and the need for the city to prepare for future storms. Gore urged the Obama administration to show leadership on the issue. “In national government, to use a computer term, our democracy has been hacked… and when the large carbon polluters and their ideological allies tell the members of Congress to jump, they do say, ‘How high?’ And we need leadership in the executive branch as well,” Gore said. Gore said lawmakers should view Bloomberg as an example and said that Sandy was related to global warming. “What will it take for the national government to wake up as this mayor has been telling us to do?” Gore asked. “This storm was related to global warming.” He added: “Dirty energy causes dirty weather.” It’s not the first time Gore has criticized Obama’s energy policies. In June 2011, Gore criticized Obama’s environmental record in a 7,000 word article in Rolling Stone. politicoDOTcom/story/2012/12/al-gore-obama-must-get-moving-84728.html?hp=l7</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354856060996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 23:54:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354856145229-22</Id><Topic><Title>Al Gore: Obama must ‘get moving’</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354856060996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 23:54:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mayor Pledges to Rebuild and Fortify Coast By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM Published: December 6, 2012 New York City, still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Sandy, will expand its evacuation zones, tighten building codes and look for ways to fortify critical infrastructure like transportation and electrical networks from future natural disasters, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Thursday. But while the mayor said he would aggressively pursue a rebuilding of the damaged waterfront, he warned that “there are no panaceas or magic bullets” to protect the city fully. And while he did, for the first time, specifically suggest dunes or levees as protective measures worth exploring, he again dismissed the use of expensive experiments like sea gates stretching across New York Harbor. It was Mr. Bloomberg’s first major address on what the city should do in a post-hurricane world that, after the end of 2013, will also be a post-Bloomberg world. And the speech, which was televised live from a Lower Manhattan hotel that had been closed for two weeks because of the storm, had the bearing of a future-oriented State of the City event, with accompanying slides and even a surprise guest: former Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, now an environmental activist, repeatedly lavished praise on the mayor for his work on responding to climate change, saying he does not “know of anybody who has done more.” Mr. Gore, a Democrat, even gently chided the Obama administration: “We cannot have four more years of mentioning this occasionally,” he said. Mr. Bloomberg, an independent, offered a much kinder assessment, saying the federal government had been very responsive to the damage wrought by Hurricane Sandy. But he also repeatedly sought to temper expectations of a quick solution, at one point stating bluntly, “Saying we’re going to spend whatever it takes just is not realistic.” Among other ideas, Mr. Bloomberg said the city would consider the construction of dunes, jetties, levees and berms along coastal areas to help reduce damage from future storm surges. He did not specify where any such barriers would be built, much less how much these would cost. But aides to the mayor said that three deputy mayors — Howard Wolfson, Linda I. Gibbs and Robert K. Steel — had recently traveled to New Orleans and met with officials there to discuss recovery, rebuilding and flood protection measures and lessons. Height restrictions on some residential homes would be relaxed, Mr. Bloomberg said, so owners can elevate their houses above the flood plain. He also said the city would update its building code to require more stringent protection against floods. In particular, Bloomberg officials said that residential buildings — including single- and two-family homes — would need to be able to withstand waves and wind, and that new and reconstructed homes would need to be built above the current elevation levels required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reduce risks and insurance premiums. Ordinarily, if small businesses that occupy residential zones were destroyed, they would not, under zoning rules, be allowed to rebuild there. But under Mr. Bloomberg’s proposal, those businesses would be allowed to do so, so long as they met floodproofing requirements in the soon-to-be-updated building code. Mr. Bloomberg also vowed to update the city’s flood maps and said the city might extend the so-called Zone A evacuation area to include Howard Beach, Queens, and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Gerritsen Beach and East Williamsburg, communities that were heavily and unexpectedly damaged by flooding from Hurricane Sandy. Indeed, his speech — which was warmly received by a crowd dominated by environmental and urban planning groups — elicited audible gasps when two maps showed that the areas flooded by the hurricane had far exceeded FEMA’s projected 100-year and 500-year flood zones for the city. “Let me be clear,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “We are not going to abandon the waterfront. We are not going to leave the Rockaways or Coney Island or Staten Island’s South Shore.” But he added that the city “cannot just rebuild what was there and hope for the best.” “We have to build smarter and stronger and more sustainable,” he added, while conceding that the city had yet “to determine exactly what that means.” The mayor was characteristically frank in saying New York would remain vulnerable to extreme weather, particularly in an age of global warming. “No matter how much we do to make homes and businesses more resilient, the fact of the matter is, living next to the ocean comes with risks that we cannot eliminate,” he said. With those risks in mind, Mr. Bloomberg said the city would #$%$ what steps need to be taken” to ensure that infrastructure networks, like transportation, telecommunications and hospitals, could withstand the impact of a Category 2 hurricane or a significant summer heat wave. Mr. Bloomberg said he had held discussions with the chief executives of telephone and cable companies, and he announced that Consolidated Edison had pledged to spend $250 million to strengthen the defenses of its gas, steam and electric systems. He said the city would be working to determine immediate steps to strengthen its infrastructure, but he offered few specifics. One idea was to reduce the dependence of telephone networks on copper wiring and to extend the backup battery life of the city’s cellular towers. “You don’t have to be a believer in climate change to understand that the dangers from extreme weather are already here,” he said. “New Yorkers have never been shy about taking on big challenges and taking our destiny into our own hands.” nytimesDOTcom/2012/12/07/nyregion/bloomberg-announces-plans-to-protect-new-york-from-natural-disasters.html?_r=0</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354856145229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 23:55:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
