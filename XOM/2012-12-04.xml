Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse’s (D-R.I.) amendment calls for the U.S. to #$%$, plan for, and mitigate the security and strategic implications of climate change” out of concern for national security. Democrats might be looking for a vote of record by Republicans on climate change, thinking opposition to it would be cast in a negative light after Hurricane Sandy. Many scientists have avoided saying climate change caused Hurricane Sandy. Numerous scientists have said, however, that the effects of climate change — notably, rising sea levels and warmer waters — contributed to the storm’s intensity, and that those effects could increase the frequency of extreme weather events. It is unclear whether the amendment would be called on the floor. Republicans on Monday held up the defense bill, S. 3254, for three hours. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) apologized for the delay, saying it played into Democrats’ arguments for filibuster reform that Republicans oppose. He alluded to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) as the reason for the hold. Green groups, such as the Sierra Club, are pushing for those rule changes. They contend Senate Republicans have used the filibuster to impede progress on bills that would address climate change. If the amendment does get a vote, it would take the GOP head-on at the nexus of climate change and national security. At their convention in August, Republicans adopted a platform that critiized the White House National Security Strategy in 2010 for saying, “The danger from climate change is real, urgent, and severe.” The platform said that said such a position, “subordinates our national security interests to environmental, energy, and international health issues, and elevates ‘climate change’ to the level of a ‘severe threat’ equivalent to foreign aggression.’” Whitehouse’s amendment, S.A. 3181, cites the National Security Strategy’s climate change warning. It also mentions the Defense Department’s Quadrennial Defense Review, which outlined climate change as a national security threat. Seth Larson, Whitehouse’s spokesman, confirmed the amendment’s submission. “Senator Whitehouse is deeply concerned about the effects climate change is having on our world, and looks for every opportunity to raise awareness of those effects. He felt that the debate over the defense authorization bill was a good opportunity to discuss these effects within the context of our national security, and to highlight the real risks that global climate change is creating for our armed services,” Larson said in a Monday statement. The amendment’s co-sponsors — Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Frank Lautenberg (N.J.) and Bob Menendez (N.J.) — all represent coastal states. They, along with Whitehouse, have been vocal about the effects rising sea levels and warmer water temperatures associated with climate change have on their constituents. Those warnings grew more acute after Sandy, which has destroyed tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure and personal property. In a floor speech last month, Whitehouse commented that events like Sandy will become more frequent "if we do not recognize the need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and the need to prepare our infrastructure." Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), whose state was hit by Sandy, told The Hill last month that Senate Democrats would “use every opportunity we can” to secure a vote on climate change. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/270763-senate-dems-look-to-force-climate-change-vote</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354600287087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 00:51:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354600908971-2</Id><Topic><Title>RewindStevens</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354473581524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 13:39:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No I'm German, and have few Democratic tendencies.

Oil production yielded 6.5 million barrels per day in September, EIA said. Daily production increased by 900,000 barrels daily compared with last September. EIA credited horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing, popularly known as "fracking," for driving the production growth. Lawmakers have lauded fracking for ushering in an era of greater energy self-sufficiency. The method helped turn the U.S. into a net oil exporter in 2011 for the first time since 1949. Fracking involves injecting a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals into tight shale rock formations to tap hydrocarbons. The practice has fueled energy booms in states such as North Dakota and Texas, which have sizable deposits of shale oil and gas. EIA said those two states experienced the largest jumps in oil production. Oil drilling featured prominently during the 2012 campaign, with the topic occupying a significant portion of the energy debate in the White House race. President Obama has bucked Republican calls to open more federal lands to drilling while pointing to oil-production levels that exceed those during former President George W. Bush’s administration. In debates with Mitt Romney, Obama often touted oil-production figures during his first term as a way to brandish his fossil fuel credentials. But Republicans say most of that activity has come from production gains on private and...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354648385449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:13:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354648690830-16</Id><Topic><Title>Next Kyoto Protocol phase in place from start of 2013, predicts UN climate chief &amp; Obama’s climate envoy, agreed that phasing out these subsidies</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354583229605</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 20:07:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>US says climate plan on track, EU wants more Mon Dec 3, 2012 2:35pm EST * Washington says cutting emissions in line with Obama plan * Cuts by 2020 far short of scientists' advice * EU says China, U.S. should do more to fight global warming By Humeyra Pamuk and Regan Doherty DOHA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it was on track to meet its own target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, a plan many scientists say is still too weak to avert damaging global warming. U.S. envoy Todd Stern defended President Barack Obama's environmental record following renewed criticism from the European Union and other delegates at a climate conference in Doha. He said the Democratic administration was making progress, despite Republican opposition, citing a study suggesting levels were heading lower, thanks partly to tougher standards for vehicles and more use of renewable energy. "There is more that can be done but there has been a great deal already," Stern told reporters at the 200-nation summit focused on salvaging U.N.-led action to cut rising world greenhouse gas emissions. "We are making good progress and I think we are on track," he said of Obama's plan to cut U.S. emissions by at least 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 - Washington's contribution to global efforts to avert rising temperatures, floods, droughts, heat waves and mounting sea levels. Republican opposition blocked ratification of Obama's plan by the Senate in 2009. Obama's target works out as a cut of about 3-4 percent from 1990 levels by 2020. A study by the U.N. panel of climate scientists in 2007 indicated rich nations would have to cut emissions by 25-to-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avert a damaging rise in temperatures. Almost none have set such deep cuts. COAL An economic slowdown in the Unites States and a switch to natural gas from coal also have put Obama's targets more in reach. But some studies indicate that Washington is still wide of its target. Last week, a Climate Action Tracker, compiled by Europe-based research groups including Ecofys, said Washington was failing. "We based ourselves only on policies that are fully decided and implemented," Niklas Hoehne of Ecofys told Reuters. European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said most focus in Doha was on a small group, led by the European Union and Australia, that aims to stick with the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol for cutting emissions of industrialised nations beyond 2012. But those nations account for less than 15 percent of world emissions. Kyoto has been weakened by the withdrawal of Russia, Japan and Canada, who say an extension is meaningless since big emerging nations led by China and India have no goals. Washington never ratified Kyoto. "It's also very important not to forget about the remaining 85 percent of emissions," Hedegaard told a news conference. "What are they doing?" She said that China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions had risen to 7.3 tonnes per capita, almost level with those of the EU on 7.5. U.S. emissions per capita were far higher at 17.3 tonnes while those of Russia were 12.8 tonnes. The EU itself was on target, she said for a promised cut at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Experts say the EU's environmental performance was boosted by the collapse of Soviet-era smokestack industries in eastern European countries. reutersDOTcom/article/2012/12/03/climate-talks-idUSL5E8N3HAV20121203</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354648690830</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:18:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354649085642-17</Id><Title>OT:anyone invested in sasol</Title><Msg>read where sasol is going to convert natural gas into diesel.

According to EPA, ethanol produced from grain sorghum emits 32 percent less greenhouse gas than the baseline petroleum it replaces and uses one-third less water than some other biofuel feedstocks. The EPA report states: “EPA’s analysis indicates that ethanol made from grain sorghum at dry mill facilities that use natural gas for process energy meets the lifecycle GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% compared to the baseline petroleum fuel it would replace, and therefore qualifies as a renewable fuel. It also contains our regulatory determination that grain sorghum ethanol produced at dry mill facilities using specified forms of biogas for both process energy and most electricity production, has lifecycle GHG emission reductions of more than 50% compared to the baseline petroleum fuel it would replace, and that such grain sorghum ethanol qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the RFS program.” Bill Kubecka, chairman of the Sorghum Checkoff and a sorghum producer from Palacios, Texas said, “This is a significant step forward for the sorghum industry. This pathway for grain sorghum will make sorghum a more profitable biofuel feedstock for the renewables industry, thus increasing the value and demand for sorghum.” The EPA’s ruling further affirms the Sorghum Checkoff’s belief that grain sorghum is a feedstock perfectly suited for starch-based ethanol production. “We believe this new opportunity to produce advanced biofuel will increase demand for the crop and lead to greater profitability for producers across the nation,” added Sorghum Checkoff Renewables Director, John Duff. “Furthermore, it gives us great pride that these producers will play a key role in supplying homegrown advanced biofuel, and we look forward to supporting them in these efforts going forward.” domesticfuelDOTcom/2012/12/04/epa-approves-rfs-path-for-grain-sorghum/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354656244412</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:24:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354656415911-22</Id><Title>such grain sorghum ethanol qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the RFS program</Title><Msg>such grain sorghum ethanol qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the RFS program</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354656415911</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:26:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354657219844-23</Id><Title>FOX &amp; Friends blacks out citizen militias in NYC during Sandy</Title><Msg>Neighborhood watches with rifles and shotguns set up parameters around primarily white neighborhoods as the cops stood down and let thousands of looters run amok.

Quite a lot, an environmental group says in proposing a new way to cut carbon emissions from power plants. 5:37PM EST December 4. 2012 - President Obama could slash one-third of power plant emissions by 2025 without Congress' approval, a major environmental group said Tuesday. He could save at least $25 billion annually in reduced health and pollution costs by using the Clean Air Act to require that existing plants reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The group says the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to set state-specific emissions rates and give states flexibility to implement them. As nations meet this week in Doha, Qatar, to negotiate a climate change treaty and Obama prepares to begin a second term, the NRDC proposes a new U.S. approach that bypasses Capitol Hill. In 2009, the House of Representatives approved a "cap and trade" bill to limit overall emissions but allow companies to trade pollution credits. The bill died in the Senate. The group says the EPA, which has proposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants, should set rules for hundreds of existing fossil-fueled plants, which it says account for 40% of the nation's carbon pollution. "We know where the pollution is. Now we have to go after it," Peter Lehner, the group's executive director, said. The NRDC says its federal-state approach would cost $4 billion annually but would save $25 billion to $60 billion each year in reduced pollution-related illnesses such as asthma. By emphasizing energy efficiency and cleaner fuels, it says its plan would cut carbon pollution — compared with 2005 levels — 26% by 2020 and 34% by 2025. Critics say it's another version of cap-and-trade. David Kreutzer, an energy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says it would allow states to trade emission credits across a multistate region — similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a non-profit group that holds carbon auctions involving nine Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Kreutzer says natural gas production is already driving down carbon pollution and even if the NRDC's plan brought further cuts, China's emissions alone would more than offset any climate benefit. Carol Raulston, spokeswoman of the National Mining Association, said her group was reviewing the proposal but expected it would mean more coal industry layoffs. She said EPA rules affecting coal-based power generation have cost more than 4,000 U.S. mining jobs. "There is inherent flexibility in this proposal," Franz Litz, a professor of energy and climate change law at Pace Law School, said at a news conference hosted by the NRDC. He said it would allow states to propose alternatives for how they can reduce their overall power plant emissions. EPA spokeswoman Alisha Johnson said the Obama administration had not completed its review of the report, so the agency declined to comment. On Nov. 13, EPA Assistant Administrator Gina McCarthy said rules regulating the emissions from existing power plants wouldn't occur for at least a few years. usatodayDOTcom/story/news/nation/2012/12/04/obama-carbon-power-plant-emissions-congress/1745881/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354671793334</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:43:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354671906746-27</Id><Title>Obama could cut emissions without Congress, group says</Title><Msg>Obama could cut emissions without Congress, group says Wendy Koch, USA TODAYShare 1 Comments How much can President Obama tackle climate change without Congress?

Haislmaier, attacked a nonprofit employee Tuesday morning in a hotel where both men were attending an event sponsored by the Campaign to Fix the Debt. The incident, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel downtown, occurred after Burke Stansbury, of the Seattle-based nonprofit Campaign for Community Change, and about 20 other progressive activists interrupted a speech by Republican Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) to encourage the senator to protect Social Security and Medicare in fiscal cliff negotiations. Stansbury told The Huffington Post that Haislmaier followed him and his group out of the conference room, where video shows Haislmeier screaming, "No! No! No no no no! No! Nonono! No! I was invited on this panel ... No no no no! No! These people, these people are screwing things up for my kids!" Stansbury replied, "These are the real people," but Haislmaier was "livid." As Haislmaier yelled, "'And I'm not, I'm not...,'" Stansbury said, "he grabbed my wrist and then grabbed the camera and pulled the camera out of my hand and it fell to the floor." The video shows the camera hitting the floor, after which it stops filming. At this point, according to witnesses, two hotel security guards stepped in and forcibly restrained Haislmaier. Haislmaier is a Senior Research Fellow in Health Policy Studies at the conservative think tank, and a longstanding, vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act. Prior to joining Heritage, Haislmaier was an executive at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a health care industry consultant. Neither the Heritage Foundation nor Haislmaier responded to inquiries about the incident from HuffPost. A spokesman for the Campaign to Fix the Debt also did not comment. The Campaign to Fix the Debt event was billed as a two-part roundtable focused on reining in health care costs and reforming the tax code. The Campaign to Fix the Debt has emerged as a central actor in the debate over the fiscal cliff in the weeks following the election, including a massive advertising blitz and television interviews with the co-chairs of the campaign, former Clinton chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson. The group insists that it represents a bipartisan coalition of groups and individuals, but a report by The Huffington Post found that the group largely consists of Republican CEOs and groups funded by private equity billionaire and former Republican Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson. Peterson has spent the better part of 30 years creating nonprofit groups and coalitions of former senators to push for a debt reduction deal that includes large cuts to social safety net programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Over the past five years, Peterson has committed nearly half a billion dollars to push for debt reduction and cuts to safety net programs in Washington. UPDATE 5:48 p.m. -- This footage shows the confrontation from a second angle. Credit: the Washington Community Action Network (CAN). Also on HuffPost: Loading Slideshow... Prison Reform The U.S. incarcerates its citizens at a rate roughly five times higher than the global average . We have about 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its prisoners, according to The Economist,. This status quo costs our local, state and federal governments a combined $68 billion a year -- all of which becomes a federal problem during recessions, when states look to Washington for fiscal relief. Over the standard 10-year budget window used in Congress, that's a $680 billion hit to the deficit. Solving longstanding prison problems -- releasing elderly convicts unlikely to commit crimes, offering treatment or counseling as an alternative to prison for non-violent offenders, slightly shortening the sentences of well-behaved inmates, and substituting probation for more jail-time -- would do wonders for government spending. End Of The Drug War The federal government spends more than $15 billion a year investigating and prosecuting the War on Drugs. That's $150 billion in Washington budget-speak, and it doesn't include the far higher costs of incarcerating millions of people for doing drugs. This money isn't getting the government the results it wants. As drug war budgets balloon, drug use escalates. Ending the Drug War offers the government two separate budget boons. In addition to saving all the money spending investigating, prosecuting and incarcerating drug offenders, Uncle Sam could actually regulate and tax drugs like marijuana, generating new revenue. Studies by pot legalization advocates indicate that fully legalizing weed in California would yield up to $18 billion annually for that state's government alone. For the feds, the benefits are even sweeter. Let Medicare Negotiate With Big Pharma The U.S. has higher health care costs than any other country . We spend over 15 percent of our total economic output each year on health care -- roughly 50 percent more than Canada, and double what the U.K. spends. Why? The American private health care system is inefficient, and the intellectual property rules involving medication in the U.S. can make prescription drugs much more expensive than in other countries. Medicare currently spends about $50 billion a year on prescription drugs. According to economist Dean Baker, Americans spend roughly 10 times more than they need to on prescription drugs as a result of our unique intellectual property standards. These savings for the government, of course, would come from the pockets of major pharmaceutical companies, currently among the most profitable corporations the world has ever known. They also exercise tremendous clout inside the Beltway. President Barack Obama even guaranteed drug companies more restrictive -- and lucrative -- intellectual property standards in order to garner their support for the Affordable Care Act. Offshore Tax Havens The U.S. Treasury Department estimates that it loses about $100 billion a year in revenue due to offshore tax haven abuses. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) has been pushing legislation for years to rein in this absurd tax maneuvering, but corporate lobbying on Capitol Hill has prevented the bill from becoming law. Deprivatize Government Contract Work In recent years, the federal government has privatized an enormous portion of public projects to government contractors. Over the past decade, the federal government's staffing has held steady, while the number of federal contractors has increased by millions . This outsourcing has resulted in much higher costs for the government than would be incurred by simply doing the work in-house. On average, contractors are paid nearly double what a comparable federal employee would receive for the same job, according to the Project On Government Oversight. Print More Money There's an old saying in economics: You have to print money to make money. Okay, there's no such saying . Nevertheless, the great boogeyman of many conservative economic doctrines -- inflation -- isn't such a bad idea during periods where much of the citizenry is drowning in debt. Inflation is by no means a perfect remedy: it's a stealth cut to workers' wages. But it also has many benefits that are often unacknowledged by the Washington intelligentsia. Inflation makes housing debt, student loan debt and any other private-sector debt more manageable. Today, when 10.8 million homes are underwater -- meaning borrowers owe banks than their houses are worth, moderate inflation could ease that debt burden. By effectively reducing monthly bills, moderate inflation could actually put more money in the pockets of these homeowners to spend elsewhere, thus stimulating the economy. Moderate inflation -- 5 percent or so -- could also help alleviate the $1 trillion in student debt currently plaguing America's graduates. Make no mistake -- hyperinflation of 20 percent, 30 percent or more -- is bad. But the U.S. has ways to crush inflation when it gets out of hand, as proven by the Federal Reserve under then-Chairman Paul Volcker in the early-1980s. Print Less Money The government prints a lot of $1 bills. But it turns out that minting $1 coins is much, much cheaper. Over the course of 30 years, the government could save $4.4 billion by switching from dollar bills to dollar coins. Here's looking at you, Sacagawea . Immigration: Less Detention, More Ankle Bracelets The government spends $122 per person, per day detaining immigrants who are considered safe and unlikely to commit crimes. The government has plenty of other options available to monitor such people, at a cost of as little as $15 per person. For the first 205 years of America's existence, there was no federal system for detaining immigrants. The process began in 1981. Financial Speculation Tax Wall Street loves to gamble. In good times, financial speculation is the source of tremendous profits in America's banking system, but when the bets go bad, the government picks up the tab, as evidenced by the epic bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009. Unfortunately, this speculation is difficult to define in legalistic terminology and even more difficult to police. One solution? By taxing every financial trade at the ultra-low rate of 0.25 percent, the U.S. government can impose a modest incentive against gambling for the sheer sake of gambling. If there's an immediate cost to placing a bet, a lot of traders will choose not to bet. What's more, this tax could raise about $150 billion a year for the federal government. Carbon Tax Taxing greenhouse gases would generate $80 billion a year right now, and up to $310 billion a year by 2050, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution . It would also help avert catastrophic ecological and economic damage from climate change. 218 62 4 1216 Contribute to this Story: Send us a tip Send us a photo or video Suggest a correction FOLLOW POLITICS Like 193k Get Alerts Subscribe to the HuffPost Hill newsletter!</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354676202744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:56:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354680850447-32</Id><Title>Warren Buffett</Title><Msg>Warren Buffett has said one should buy stocks of companies that are idiot proof because an idiot will one day run the company.
