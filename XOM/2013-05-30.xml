Speaking to shareholders at Exxon Mobil’s annual meeting, Tillerson faced questions on the company’s growth and repeated inquiries about climate change, a subject on which Tillerson spoke at length. Tillerson said the company’s record spending on acquisitions and new developments was part of a growth strategy that has not yet delivered substantial returns — partly because of low natural gas prices. When Exxon Mobil purchased natural gas producer XTO Energy for $25 billion in 2010, “we expected natural gas prices had not yet bottomed out,” Tillerson said. “They bottomed out, but they stayed low much longer than we expected.” A poor economic climate and extensive domestic supplies of natural gas led to the sustained low U.S. prices, he said. “We weren’t a very good predictor on how quickly the U.S. economy was going to rebound and we missed slightly the industry’s pent up capacity,” Tillerson said. “For the near term, I would say maybe we were off a year or two in an acquisition merger that was undertaken because of the 30-40 year view of the value,” he added. “I’m not too concerned about that.” Still, Exxon Mobil’s 2012 profit of $44.9 billion was the second-highest in its history, even as the company has invested huge amounts of money in projects that have not yet delivered returns. Exxon Mobil, the world’s second-most valuable public company after Apple, plans to spend $38 billion a year on new projects. These include expanding Canadian oil sands efforts, starting up a massive liquefied gas effort in Papua New Guinea, and exploring in an area of Russia’s Arctic region larger than Texas.

[color=#FF0000][b]China’s carbon dioxide emissions will rise about 40 percent more by 2020[/b][/color] by burning fuel compared with levels in 2010 when it was already the biggest emitter, the Economist Intelligence Unit said today in a report. The projection came as the Economist estimated China’s consumption of coal will grow by 18 percent during 2011-15, down from 46 percent growth in 2006-10. Coal accounts for about two-thirds of China’s energy consumption and three-quarters of its power generation, it said. Measures such as a carbon tax and carbon trading, coupled with carbon capture and storage techniques, will be needed to contain emissions quickly, the Economist said. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-05-30/china-to-release-about-40-more-carbon-dioxide-by-2020-eiu-says.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369896024941</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 02:40:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369919019273-3</Id><Title>OPEC to meet amid Iran-Saudi tensions</Title><Msg>May 30, 2013 at 6:37 am by Associated Press VIENNA — Once the symbol of oil dominance, OPEC faces new challenges as its members gather for a ministerial meeting this week on how much crude to pump. For the 12 oil ministers from countries ranging from Venezuela to Nigeria and Iran, the formal focus of Friday’s get-together is to determine production levels. The consensus in the markets is that ministers will opt to maintain the status quo as prices for U.S. benchmark oil have traded in a narrow range a few dollars above $90 a barrel. Brent crude, the reference point for many international oil varieties, is just above the $100 mark some countries OPEC exporters consider the acceptable minimum. With prices largely at acceptable levels, the ministers are expected to maintain the cartel’s target at 30 million barrels a day. However, there may be an attempt to cut back on overproduction, now said to be running at nearly 500,000 barrels a day. On his arrival in Vienna on Tuesday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi described the status quo as “the best environment for the market.” For analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, that was a clear signal there would be little or no change in policy — the Saudis are the main driver of OPEC policy. As such, said a Commerzbank note, it is “unlikely that Friday’s OPEC meeting will result in any change to production policy.” Beyond prices and output, though, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries faces other more complex issues, ranging from the ramp up in shale oil production in the U.S. and a potentially destabilizing spat between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The rise in shale oil production in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, has an impact on OPEC as the country remains a main market for OPEC. Shale oil, which is extracted from rocks using heat, helped lift the U.S.’s total output up to a daily 7.4 million barrels per day this month. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/30/opec-to-meet-amid-iran-saudi-tensions/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369919019273</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:03:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369919165692-4</Id><Title>Keystone wait weighs on smaller oil producers</Title><Msg>May 30, 2013 at 6:46 am by Bloomberg Growth prospects for smaller oil-sands producers including BlackPearl Resources Inc. (PXX) and Southern Pacific Resource Corp. (STP) are fading as political wrangling over the Keystone XL pipeline and rising U.S. supply slow deals in the Canadian energy industry. The inability of firms such as Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Koch Industries Inc. to sell assets recently highlights waning investor interest in Alberta’s oil sands, dragging down shares of smaller producers, said Mike Dunn, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. Smaller companies are especially vulnerable to slowing deal-making because their valuations are based in part on the chance that they will be bought, said Mason Granger, a portfolio manager at Sentry Investments Inc. in Toronto. The Keystone XL delay makes it more difficult for them to raise money for financing to grow and maybe ultimately to survive, Granger said. “Oil sands is just such a tough space to be in — it really requires the balance sheet of the super majors to make a success,” Granger, who manages C$400 million ($386 million) in energy sector investments, said in a May 24 telephone interview. “The landscape of junior oil-sands companies is littered with spectacular failures.” John Festival, chief executive officer at BlackPearl, didn’t return messages seeking comment on funding after saying in a May 8 earnings release the company was working on a financing plan. Greg Foofat, a Southern Pacific spokesman, said the company has received a boost to its revolving credit facility to fund operations. Keystone Conduit Competition from rising U.S. energy supplies, a dearth of capacity to ship crude out of landlocked Alberta and political deliberations around pipelines have pushed oil from Canada, home to the world’s third-largest reserves, swinging to as much as $41.50 a fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/05/30/keystone-wait-weighs-on-smaller-oil-producers/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1369919165692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:06:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369919856015-5</Id><Title>Exxon rejects gay-discrimination ban</Title><Msg>Associated Press Updated May 29, 2013, 10:28 a.m. ET DALLAS — The CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. says there's no quick replacement for oil, and sharply cutting oil's use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would make it harder to lift 2 billion people out of poverty. "What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?" CEO Rex Tillerson said at the oil giant's annual meeting Wednesday. Tillerson jousted with environmental activists who proposed that the company set goals to reduce emissions from its products and operations. Shareholders sided with the company and voted nearly 3-to-1 to reject the proposal. By a 4-to-1 ratio, shareholders defeated a resolution to explicitly ban discrimination against gays. The Exxon board had argued that the company already banned discrimination of any type and didn't need to add language regarding gays. It was the 16th defeat for Exxon resolutions on discrimination against gays and the seventh on greenhouse emissions. Since Tillerson replaced Lee Raymond as CEO in 2006, Exxon has softened the tone of its public comments but not its skepticism about climate change. Tillerson said that in the past decade the average temperature "hasn't really changed," and he repeated his optimism that technology will solve the problem. The average global temperature rose one quarter of a degree Fahrenheit from the 10 years that ended in 2002 to the decade that ended in 2012, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. However, the decade of 2000-2009 was the hottest on record, and nine of the 10 hottest years have occurred since 2001. Activists argued that climate change will result in more severe weather. Patricia Daley, a member of the New Jersey-based group of Dominican nuns that proposed the climate-change resolution, cited last year's East Coast hurricane. "I had to evacuate a lot of old nuns because of Superstorm Sandy," Daley said.

It’s the start of the Atlantic hurricane season, kicking off six months of nail-biting as companies watch the weather forecasts to decide whether to shut in wells and pull their people off platforms. BP, the largest oil and gas producer in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico last year, offered a glimpse into its hurricane planning Thursday. BP operates four production platforms in the Gulf — Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog and Na Kika — and holds interest in three non-operated hubs: Mars, Ursa and Great White. “That brings challenges” during hurricane season, said Steve Benson, area operations manager for the Atlantis platform. Each platform is like a small city, and the company can’t wait until the storm’s path is obvious to decide what to do. “Our job is to anticipate … the strength of a storm and what actions we need to undertake,” Benson said. That job takes place in a third-floor conference room in a building on the BP campus in West Houston, which Benson said becomes the crisis room when a storm is brewing. He’s there, as is the company’s chief meteorologist, W. Edward Bracken, along with representatives from the different platforms and related contract operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week predicted between 13 and 20 named storms this year, seven to 11 of which will become hurricanes. Once a tropical storm is brewing, Bracken determines which model is most likely to be accurate and how strong the storm is likely to be when it reaches key sites, as well as what the company can expect when it reaches onshore assets. Predicting intensity is still difficult. “We can never be very confident in intensity forecasts, so we always assume it will be more intense than forecast,” Bracken said.

That’s a significant decision especially when seen in context of the local emissions permit trading schemes being tried out around the country. Depending on how tight the cap is, this could be a big deal in its own right: China is the world’s largest and fastest-growing emitter. Its citizens are already suffering as a consequence. But the impact of the Chinese decision could be even broader. Understanding why requires seeing climate change as an issue that’s every bit as much about the structure of international politics as it is about domestic policy or environmental science. That climate change is a principally international issue should be obvious. Though American CO2 emissions have fallen 13 percent since 2007, we’ve just hit 400 atmospheric CO2 parts per million — a level last reached several million years ago, when the Earth was about 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it is today. That’s partly because the U.S. hasn’t dropped off enough, but also in large part because the rest of the world has ramped up its carbon burning. Globally, we emit at least 48 percent more than we did in 1992. The question of how to stop this destructive trend is usually posed in reference to this-or-that meeting or specific initiative: what will be accomplished at Bonn? How can we better comply with the Kyoto framework? But whether the global climate agenda will succeed in any specific sense depends on deeper issues about what the structure of international politics permits. Are states capable of cooperating to reduce emissions given the realities of international politics? Why wouldn’t they be? What could get them on board? There’s a metric ton of research on these questions.
