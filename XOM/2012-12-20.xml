The slaughters in Germany ended (1/3 of the population was killed in 30 years before 1648), and the slaughters in England ended with the end of the English Civil War, and the economy began to rebuild itself. Eventually a broad alliance linking the Germanies, the Netherlands, and England formed to wage all-out-war against Louis XIV's France and Spain, that is the Catholic powers who confronted the Protestant German bloc in the previous wars. Economic development proceeded strongly and there were vast fortunes to be made in business. Cycle 2 is the period after the wars against Louis XIV. Depression was broad based and land values and business plummeted across the Europe. Cycle 3 marks the resumption of war and economic growth. England led the growth initially, conquering much of the world, and then Germany was united, and then there was a titanic struggle for which group of Crown heads of the Germanies would rule the world - England or Germany. France's military potential was nearly obliterated in the contest and bled white. The USA, England's former colony, decided the outcome. Economic growth was very powerful and has been widely noted as the "Industrial Revolutions I and II." Cycle 4 is the period of political and economic turmoil that followed the Great War, turmoil that was repeated again in World War II. Economic Collapse came first in Germany, then in England and the USA, and was followed by all-out-war. Cycle 5 is the period of rebuilding after World War II. Economic growth was very powerful and was energy driven throughout. Stocks, real estate, and businesses boomed. Cycle 6 is the period after the oil embargoes and includes a dubious flirtation with libertarian economic theories, theories which contradicted economic collectivism, the hallmark of German culture. Big business and Big government (both collectivist) were demonized and small businesses, free markets, and speculation was emphasized. Debt spiraled up massively, the economy decelerated, and finally collapsed in 2008, before being propped up by still more debt and spending after 2008. Environmental radicalism retarded industry. Stocks and real estate were worthless as investment vehicles: long bonds beat stocks year after year... Cycle 7 will mark the resumption of real economic growth and rising stock prices, whenever it comes. The groundwork is being laid with research in superconductors, alternative energy sources, and new methods of producing oil &amp; gas... Until it comes there is no reasonable expectation that stocks will do well either against bonds or at all... At this point the financial assets outside the Germanic cultural area is so trivial it is not even worth mentioning. Energy and economic growth trends there will not be able to offset lack of real growth in the core.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356022070489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:47:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356022630895-9</Id><Title>an article on the buyback</Title><Msg>The first company that I will look at is Exxon Mobil (XOM).

If a group of bi-partisan politicians on Capital Hill in Washington have it their way, changes to the US tax code could help to boost renewable energy projects. Image Credit: Wind Energy via Andrzej Wilusz /Shutterstock Last week, Reuters reported that 29 Democrat and Republicans are proposing changes that gives renewable energy projects (including: biofuels, wind, solar, and others) “special” tax treatment through master limited partnerships (MLP’s). Notably, these structures are already often used by various energy companies to help them raise capital: “The structures allow companies to raise money in the stock market, while having income taxed only at the unit holder level, thus avoiding corporate income taxes.” The new idea being floated around in the US capital comes at a time when Congress has until the beginning of January to straighten the financial situation or face the impending “fiscal cliff.” Meanwhile, the financial uncertainty due to the fiscal cliff is causing some problems within the wind industry, such as the potential expiration of the Production Tax Credit, which has helped boost the nation’s wind industry considerably but may expire on January 1st. Could this renewable energy MLP idea fly, considering some Democrats would like to have fossil fuel subsidies done away with, and most Republicans are weary about giving any help to renewable energy projects. Could MLP be a way to boost cleantech investment while limiting government spending? The group of 29 bi-partisan lawmakers on both sides of the spectrum thinks so. Delaware Democratic Senator Chris #$%$ said in the article that the policy would not hamper oil, gas, or pipeline investment, while helping to support cleantech projects because of the MLP tax structure. “Why not have a predictable, clear, long-term tax advantage financing vehicle for both, for a genuinely all-of-the-above energy strategy?” #$%$ said to journalists last week. #$%$, along with Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran and the leading Republican on the Senate Energy committee Lisa Murkowski, are three of the bill’s co-sponsors in the Senate. Meanwhile, a similar bill in the House of Representatives co-sponsored by Democrats Mike Thompson (California), Peter Welch (Vermont), and Republican Ted Poe (Texas) is targeting a similar tax vehicle to advance renewable energy projects. Whether these bills get through the Senate and the House of Representatives remains to be seen. However, keep your eyes peeled, as this could be one tool that could help move the investment structure of renewable energy forward in the US. sDOTtt/1xteG</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356032334181</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 14:38:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356047085332-16</Id><Topic><Title>XOM may well be finished.

In November of that year the Republican Party should be driven out of power and then the role of the government can increase in a big way... 50% of GDP flowing from government is an optimistic target. A government that big will be able to push forward education and scientific research on a broad front, launch a major infrastructure building program, and implement a national healthcare program. The Republican Party is beholden to its libertarian radicals, as it is proving now with its petulant display over taxes and the budget.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia voted 6-2 to reject a request for the full court to reconsider a June ruling that upheld EPA’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The court’s action could set up a Supreme Court challenge by industry, energy firms and the state of Alaska, which were pushing for the rehearing. The decision in June by a three-judge panel determined EPA properly evaluated the health effects of greenhouse gas emissions. That allowed the agency to continue regulating those emissions through the Clean Air Act. The Obama administration has pushed ahead with the first-ever emissions limits on new coal-fired power plants, and could do the same for existing power plants in his second term. Michael Brune, executive director with the Sierra Club, has urged Obama to do just that, and commended the court Thursday for standing by their ruling. “The Sierra Club applauds the court’s decision to deny these baseless challenges from major industrial polluters. With today’s decision, the path is clear for the EPA to continue its work implementing essential climate and public health safeguards," he said in a statement. Energy firms and industry have warned EPA regulations rolled out during Obama’s tenure are economically burdensome. They say it will force electricity rates higher and shudder enough coal-fired generation to create power shortages in some parts of the country. Jay Timmons, chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers — one of the groups to petition the June court decision — said his organization is "carefully considering" a Supreme Court challenge. "The debate over how to address climate change should take place in the halls of Congress and should foster economic growth and job creation, not impose additional costs on businesses," Timmons said in a Thursday statement. The groups seeking a rehearing contended the EPA relied on faulty scientific data to draw its conclusions. Circuit Judge David Sentelle, writing an opinion for the court, disagreed. “Of course, we agree that the statute requires EPA to find a particular causal nexus between the pollutant and the harm in order to regulate. … But that is exactly what EPA did: it found that ‘greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare,’” Sentelle wrote. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Brett Kavanaugh argued the Clean Air Act should only govern the six pollutants listed under national ambient air quality standards. He said regulating greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, went too far. Sentelle disagreed, saying that with the Clean Air Act, “Congress did not say ‘certain ‘air pollutants.’ … It said ‘any air pollutant,’ and it meant it.” thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/274057-court-rejects-rehearing-on-epa-greenhouse-gas-emissions</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356050483620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:41:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356052883834-20</Id><Title>Socialists have the Christmas Spirit All Year Round</Title><Msg>If the wealthy are the group that benefited most from the Gov. bailouts to rescue the economy, they should be the group expected to replenish the Gov.'s (our) coffers.
