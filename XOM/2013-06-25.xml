The investigation, now in a preliminary stage, will probably broaden into a multi-jurisdictional affair like the inquiry into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the people said. FTC investigators are reviewing the progress made by their European counterparts, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The FTC, which routinely monitors wholesale and retail gasoline prices in the U.S. to look for anticompetitive behavior, agreed with the Justice Department’s antitrust division to handle the probe, said the people. The assignment of the matter to the FTC instead of the Justice Department is an indication that U.S. regulators don’t suspect the conduct they’re scrutinizing is criminal, the people said. The opening of the oil-price investigation in the U.S. is the latest in a growing number of simultaneous EU-U.S. inquiries into areas including Libor, standard essential patents and Internet search manipulation, as well as merger reviews in the music and airline industries. The extent to which regulators in each jurisdiction can collaborate with one another depends on whether the companies under review sign waivers allowing data about them to be shared. Price Reporting The probe will probably include agency-issued civil investigative demands, which are similar to subpoenas, as the FTC scrutinizes how price-reporting companies such as Platts, the energy news and data provider owned by McGraw Hill Financial Inc (MHFI)., help determine the cost of raw materials, the people said.

June 25, 2013 Mridul Chadha European legislators have been urged to set a 100% renewable energy target for 2050 by the Global Alliance for 100% Renewable Energy. The Alliance, launched in Europe recently, criticised the EU legislators for not setting aggressive long-term renewable energy targets. Alliance members, which include World Future Council, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, and the World Wind Energy Association, noted that the EU legislators lack the political will to set aggressive, yet achievable and highly beneficial long-term renewable energy targets. The continent currently has set a renewable energy target of 20% by 2020 and is contemplating a medium-term target of 30-35% by 2030. A number of member states have set renewable energy targets of more than 20%. Scandinavian and Baltic member states have among the highest renewable energy targets. Norway, Sweden, and Latvia have set targets of 67.5%, 49%, and 40% respectively. Need For Long-term Renewable Energy Target EU legislators are believed to been having discussions to set renewable energy targets for 2030 as one of the ways to continue the low-carbon development which seems to have been stalled due to the poor state of the continent’s carbon market. European carbon prices have fallen to record lows as emissions across member states have fallen due to the economic slowdown. Industrial units are sitting with surplus emissions rights of about two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. The EU legislators have thus been urged to take initiatives to make investment in low-carbon development attractive. In addition to renewable energy targets, the Members of European Parliament are also considering a regulatory fix for the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).

By John H. Cushman Jr., InsideClimate News Jun 24, 2013 WASHINGTON—A new report from the U.S. Center for Naval Analyses and the London-based Royal United Services Institute, two of the NATO alliance's front-line strategy centers, recommends putting more effort into fighting global warming than securing reliable supplies of fossil fuels. The authors call the habitual American fixation on winning energy independence through expanded North American production of oil and natural gas "misguided." They say the "only sustainable solution" to the problem of energy insecurity is not through more drilling, but through energy efficiency and renewable fuels, like biofuels to replace oil. Despite the steady supplies provided by the current U.S. drilling boom, "the increased domestic production of oil and natural gas is not a panacea for the country's energy security dilemma," they say. And in blunt language, they criticize American policymakers and legislators for refusing to accept the "robust" scientific evidence that emissions of carbon dioxide are already causing harmful global warming, and for refusing to take actions that, if taken swiftly, could ward off its worst effects. "Political leaders, including many in the United States, refuse to accept short-term costs to address long-term dangers even though the future costs of responding to disasters after they occur will be far greater," said their report, published this month. The report, in the works for a year, was released as President Obama prepared to ramp up the administration's efforts on climate change, and while the State Department was immersed in its review of whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries in the United States.

Other applications include even cheaper and more powerful supercomputers. German science, pushed to a higher level of potentiality by supercomputers, is now at the point where we can actually measure ripples in space time by means of quantum entangled lasers, defying the limits of older technology. This advance has relevance for anti-gravity technologies such as have been contemplated in the US at places such as FERMILAB, but have gone nowhere because of a lack of tools to observe and manipulate the phenomena, phenomena that are mathematical facts flowing from Einstein’s theory of general relativity. 24 June 2013 “Light can now be used to achieve ever better control of microparticles and nanoparticles. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen are now able to use a laser to cause tiny particles to rotate around an axis perpendicular to the light beam – a particle thus rotates like the wheel of a bicycle in its direction of motion. The researchers achieved this by creating a photonic wheel: light with purely transverse angular momentum. This state of light was previously unknown. Physicists assumed that all light had propeller-shaped, longitudinal angular momentum. The new way of controlling light waves makes optical tweezers, which can be used to grip and manoeuvre cells and other micro-objects and nano-objects, more versatile.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372169510720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 10:11:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372169551492-11</Id><Topic><Title>Quantum Optics and Nanophotonics are much more powerful now</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372169510720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 10:11:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>23 June 2013 “Laser interferometers detect tiny distance changes with high precision. Stray light reduces and limits the measurement accuracy of these instruments. Researchers at the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover have now shown for the first time how to discriminate between measurement signal and stray light using lasers with tailored quantum properties. The novel measurement concept circumvents the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and could enhance the precision of gravitational-wave detectors like GEO600 or the closely cooperating Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detectors in the USA…By superimposing two squeezed laser beams, they created two new laser beams which are quantum mechanically entangled. One of the beams is used to perform the precision measurement, the other one is used as a reference beam. By comparing measurement and reference beam, the scientists can now determine both phase and amplitude with decreased uncertainty. This allows them to detect tiny changes in both variables. “We can now for the first time outsmart Heisenberg's uncertainty principle because we're measuring all variables relative to an entangled reference system,” explains Sebastian Steinlechner, lead author of the study published in Nature Photonics.”</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372169551492</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 10:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372169756018-12</Id><Title>cant believe I just made 457%</Title><Msg>These tips are really good.

His comments come after U.S. President Barack Obama said the pipeline must not “significantly exacerbate” greenhouse gas emissions if it’s to win his approval. Obama addressed the TransCanada project as he unveiled a national plan to combat climate change at D.C.’s Georgetown University on Tuesday. Obama said assurance that building the northern portion of Keystone XL will not result in greater greenhouse gas emissions "is absolutely critical in determining whether this project will be allowed to go forward." Oliver responded to Obama’s comments later Tuesday, saying: “On a net basis, I don’t see any increase on emissions.” The minister said 20 per cent of the crude transported by Keystone would come from North Dakota, Montana and Saskatchewan. “That’s lighter crude, which has significantly lower emissions,” Oliver said. He added that the remaining crude coming from the Alberta oilsands has the same or lower emissions than the heavy crude that the U.S. imports from Venezuela. “I just think if you look at the facts and the science we’re comfortable the project will be approved,” he said during a news conference in Toronto. Oliver said $7.6-billion pipeline, which would transport millions of barrels of oilsands bitumen a week from Alberta to Texas refineries, would be in the national interest of both the U.S. and Canada. “The economic advantages are obvious and overwhelming,” Oliver said, pointing to economic growth and increased government revenue. He added that the pipeline’s approval would be beneficial for national security “because the oil from Canada would be displacing oil from a les</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372201300839</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 19:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372204265876-26</Id><Topic><Title>EXOM- Cramers new Gold eom.</Title><Username>hedgecutter10</Username><Timestamp>1372178160571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:36:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does eom mean, you`re so cool.</Msg><Username>gasspump</Username><Timestamp>1372204265876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 19:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372217794106-27</Id><Topic><Title>Quantum Optics and Nanophotonics are much more powerful now</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372169510720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 10:11:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the first flag on Mars planted by a human will be by a German woman.
