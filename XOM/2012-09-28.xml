WALD September 26, 2012, 12:00 pm 15 Comments Making electricity from natural gas is cleaner than making it from coal or oil, but as gas gains a bigger market share in the business in the United States and elsewhere, the idea of what constitutes a good generator is shifting. General Electric announced a line of new models on Wednesday, with two interesting environmental twists. One is efficiency. New natural gas plants burn the fuel in something that resembles a jet engine that is chained to the ground and turning a generator. Over the years, as the technology of such models has improved, they have been converted a given quantity of gas to larger and larger amounts of electricity. Modern plants are often “combined cycle” generators, meaning that the exhaust of one engine is used as the heat source for another. The hot exhaust from the jet is used to boil water into steam, and the steam is used to turn a second turbine; if the jet engine extracts 40 percent of the energy in the gas and the steam turbine extracts 40 percent of the remainder, the combination is about 60 percent efficient. In 2000, G.E. introduced a new model that reached that 60 percent level. At the time, the Energy Department likened that milestone to running a four-minute mile. The new models it is introducing now are a little over 61 percent efficient. Boosting efficiency in a jet engine is tricky. The amount of work that the machine can get out of a fossil fuel depends on the temperature of combustion, but if the designer pushes the temperature too high, the metal components could melt. The solution is to hollow out the blades that extract energy from the passing hot gas and to circulate cool air inside them. “Cool” is relative here; G.E. is using air at 1,000 degrees to cool blades whose exterior is heated to 2,800 degrees. The metal blades are coated with a ceramic that acts as an insulator, helping keep the metal temperature down. A key trick in raising efficiency, said Paul F. Browning, the president of the company’s thermal products division, is using technology borrowed from G.E.’s aircraft engine business to prevent the 1,000-degree air from leaking into the 2,800-degree gas path, which would cool and it thus reduce efficiency. But in the years since G.E. introduced the 2000 model, new players have entered the grid: wind and solar plants that produce energy with a much smaller environmental footprint yet are highly variable in their output. A system that can integrate a large amount of renewable energy can far more significantly reduce the average amount of carbon dioxide produced per kilowatt-hour than one that relies on natural gas alone. Still, relying on renewable energy requires other generators on the grid to rapidly adjust their production, up and down, to compensate. Some grid operators will therefore pay the owners of generators not only for how much energy they produce but for how quickly they can change their output to help balance the supply as demand shifts. So G.E. has introduced a product line called FlexEfficiency that allows operators to adjust quickly as renewable energy comes on on and off the grid, including a 750-megawatt combined-cycle plant that can vary its output by 100 megawatts in one minute. The model introduced in 2000 could only change its output by 50 megawatts in one minute. The company says it has $1.2 billion advance orders, including one from the Japanese utility Chubu Electric Power, which, as Mr. Browning delicately put it, would help the company “respond to events of March 11.’’ He was referring to last year’s quake and tsunami in Japan, which caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and led to the shutdown of all of the country’s nuclear reactors. The combined-cycle gas plants are likely to replace the output of some G.E.-designed nuclear reactors. A Saudi electric company also placed a big order to replace generators that run on oil so it could use the oil for export, G.E. said. And Xcel Energy has ordered one to replace a coal-burning power plant in Denver, the company added. nytimes</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348805904233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 00:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348806507966-2</Id><Title>Minnesota scientists develop bacteria to clean up fracking water</Title><Msg>Minnesota scientists develop bacteria to clean up fracking water Posted on 09/24/2012 by Dan Ferber Photo University of Minnesota researchers say bacteria trapped inside these microbeads can break down harmful chemicals in fracking wastewater. (Photo courtesy University of Minnesota) A new biotechnology developed by a team of University of Minnesota scientists could help clean up wastewater from hydraulic fracturing, preventing contamination of rivers, streams, lakes, and even drinking water with toxic chemicals from coal and shale beds. The new method employs chemical-eating bacteria encased in a silica gel. The contaminants from the fracking wastewater slip inside the gel, where they are destroyed by enzymes in the bacteria. The bacteria remain encapsulated and do not contaminate the wastewater themselves, said Larry Wackett, a professor of biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics at the University of Minnesota who led the effort. The research has attracted a $600,000 grant from a National Science Foundation program that pairs academic researchers developing innovative technologies with companies that can commercialize them. When their technology is ready to be scaled up, the University of Minnesota team plans to license it to Tundra Companies of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, which would manufacture it. The same biotechnology could also be used to encapsulate other types of bacteria that help recover natural gas from depleted coal beds. Luca Technologies of Boulder, Colorado, would license it for that purpose. For the NSF grant, “we were supposed to make partnerships with small companies whereby if we developed technology platform, the company could scale this up and make it a business,” Wackett said. The frack water challenge To pry open cracks in shale and obtain oil or natural gas, frackers force millions of gallons of water mixed with sand and chemicals into cracks in underground coal or shale beds. Up to 40 percent of what goes down then comes up, and the contaminated water, which contains high levels of salts and potentially dangerous chemicals, must be disposed of. The fracking industry has maintained that they dispose of fracking water safely and according to state and federal regulations. But recent investigations by journalists and scientists suggest that the hazards may be underestimated, and that polluted fracking water is making its way into the nation’s waterways, jeopardizing health and the environment. Today fracking wastewater is often disposed of by injecting it back deep into the ground, but an investigation by ProPublica revealed evidence of lax regulation of this practice and frequent attempts by industry to circumvent the disposal rules that do exist. In the heavily fracked Marcellus Shale region, which includes upstate New York and Pennsylvania, it’s often sent for treatment to sewage treatments plants that were not designed for the task, according to an in-depth 2011 investigation by the New York Times. More than a few of those sewage treatment plants are upstream of drinking water plants, the Times found. Similarly, an EPA investigation [PDF] of a Wyoming gas field documented contamination of nearby drinking groundwater aquifer by hydrocarbons, and health authorities warned against drinking the water. And in August, scientists at the Stony Brook University in New York reported in the journal Risk Analysis [PDF] that the disposal of wastewater from fracking poses a large risk of water pollution and drinking water contamination. The authors, Daniel Rozell and Sheldon Reaven, focused on fracking in the Marcellus Shale. In their report, they concluded that “future research efforts should be focused primarily on wastewater disposal and specifically on the efficacy of contaminant removal by industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities.” As it turned out, Wackett’s team was already doing this research. “We think we can help the situation by having a treatment that does the job and is less expensive,” he said. Detoxing the frack water Wackett has spent years investigating how microbes break down various toxic chemicals in the environment. Over the last several years a graduate student in his laboratory, Eduardo Reategui, had come up with a way to encapsulate live bacteria that break down the herbicide atrazine. They melted silicon oxide and created what in essence was a sand shell around the bacteria. “The results were remarkable,” Wackett said. “Normally if you have bacteria that eat pollutants, they [eventually] die out and you have to replenish them. But inside the silica they stayed active.” Wackett, Reategui, and two other University of Minnesota biotechnologists, Michael Sadowsky and Alptekin Aksan, published the results in January in the journal Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology. As they were wrapping up that study, there was a lot of press about hydraulic fracturing and the hazards posed by its contaminated wastewater. “We saw that and thought this might be a good application of these organisms,” Wackett said. When drilling companies do treat fracking waste water, they use separators to let bits and pieces of shale settle out, then heat that water to make the water evaporate, leaving all the chemicals behind as a sludge, which is then disposed of in a landfill, Wackett explained. But that method has two problems. It requires a lot of energy to boil off the water to make the sludge, which tends to make the process expensive. And it only transfers the chemicals to a landfill rather than breaking them down. Soon after their paper on caged herbicide-eating bacteria was published, Wackett got a grant from the University of Minnesota to explore ways to mitigate the environmental impacts of fracking. He knew that many species of bacteria are known that break down chemicals that are toxic to humans, so they began encapsulating some of them in sand shells and seeing how well they could break down chemicals. To test this approach, two researchers on Wackett’s team, Lisa Kasinkas and Lisa Strong, created microcapsules packed with a bacterium called Pseudomonas to break down ring-shaped chemicals that are known to cause cancer: benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene. They tested a bacterium called Marinobacter to break down other chemicals common in diesel fuel, and another bacterium, Sphingomonas, to break down a third class of cancer-causing chemicals. In all cases, the bacteria gobbled up the chemicals while trapped in the sand shell. In the meantime, the researchers got the National Science Foundation funding, which gave them two years to get this technology ready for prime time. Wackett, Sadowsky and Aksan are assembling more than a dozen researchers to study how to put the bacteria in, and what makes them stay active, inside the sand shells. By doing this legwork, they hope to create a platform technology to create a mix of products, each of which use caged bacteria to break down fracking waste water, factory runoff, polluted farm runoff, and more. Robert Elde, a dean at the university, is working to make connections with businesses that might license the technology and scale it up. An engineering company hired to clean up wastewater might buy it, as might a subcontractor hired by the engineering company, Wackett said. Wackett and his university are remaining neutral in the fracking debate. “Our view is if we’re going to do it, let’s find the best way,” Wackett said. midwestenergynews</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348806507966</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 00:28:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348807012857-3</Id><Title>Jerry Brown OKs bills to expand renewable energy in California</Title><Msg>Jerry Brown OKs bills to expand renewable energy in California September 27, 2012 | 11:53am Gov. Jerry Brown signed 19 bills Thursday aimed at making it easier to provide renewable energy and conserve power in California. The bills include a measure by Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) that directs the state to coordinate implementation of policies advancing energy security with the Department of Defense. “The health of the environment, job creation and indeed, the security of the nation, depend on how we end America’s dangerous addiction to foreign oil,” Brown said after signing SB 1409. “California and the U.S. military are working together to build a clean energy future and this bill helps make sure it happens.” Brown also signed SB 1222 by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), which seeks to encourage the installation of rooftop solar energy systems on homes by limiting residential permit fees charged by cities and counties to the cost of providing the permits. He also approved a measure that clarifies that facilities that generate electricity using biomethane delivered from other locations qualify as a renewable energy source under the state’s mandate to increase those sources. AB 2196 is by Assemblyman Wesley Chesbro (D-Eureka). The governor vetoed a few energy-related bills, including a measure by Assemblyman Robert Blumenfield (D-Woodland Hills) that would create a new Clean Energy Economy and Jobs Incentive Program to provide financial help for the manufacturing of clean-energy technology. "Though well intended, there is no funding source currently available for this program,’’ Brown wrote in his veto message on AB 796.

Governor Brown Signs the Energy Security Coordination Act of 2012 Edited by Valerie Gotten published Thu, 27 Sep 2012 – 12:52:12 -0700 PDT No Comment. SACRAMENTO, Calif. /California Newswire/ — Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed the Energy Security Coordination Act of 2012 (SB 1409), authored by Senator Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), which strengthens the clean energy partnership between California and the U.S. military. “The health of the environment, job creation and indeed, the security of the nation, depend on how we end America’s dangerous addiction to foreign oil,” said Governor Brown. “California and the U.S. military are working together to build a clean energy future and this bill helps make sure it happens.” “I am grateful to Governor Brown for strengthening public-private partnerships with the U.S. military, the state and private sector R&amp;D firms who are working to achieve energy security and create new jobs,” said Senator Pavley. Under SB 1409, the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) will serve as a liaison between the state and the U.S. Department of Defense to coordinate and collaborate on clean energy policy. OPR will work directly with state energy agencies, including the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission, to ensure the military is included in the development and implementation of state energy and environmental policy. “SB 1409 recognizes the existing partnership between the military and California in the development of renewable energy technology, resources and the large potential for future enhancement of this partnership,” said Deputy Department of Defense Regional Environmental Coordinator Christopher L. Stathos in a letter supporting SB 1409. “With the military’s aggressive renewable energy goals, and California’s leadership and innovation, SB 1409 provides the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research additional tools that will enable further success.” The Governor also announced today that he has signed the following bills: • AB 693 by Assemblymember Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) – Local government: Sonoma County Regional Climate Protection Authority. • AB 1124 by Assemblymember Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) – Landlord and tenant. • AB 1255 by Assemblymember Manuel Pérez (D-Coachella) – Energy: renewable energy resources. • AB 1900 by Assemblymember Mike Gatto (D-Burbank) – Renewable energy resources: biomethane. • AB 2165 by Assemblymember Jerry Hill (D-South San Francisco) – Net energy metering: eligible fuel cell customer-generators. • AB 2187 by Assemblymember Steven Bradford (D-Inglewood) – Renewable energy resources. • AB 2196 by Assemblymember Wesley Chesbro (D-Eureka) – Renewable energy resources. • AB 2227 by Assemblymember Steven Bradford (D-Inglewood) – Local publicly owned electric utilities: State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission: reporting. • AB 2249 by Assemblymember Joan Buchanan (D-San Ramon) – Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007. • AB 2339 by Assemblymember Das Williams (D-Santa Barbara) – Energy: geothermal technologies. • AB 2514 by Assemblymember Steven Bradford (D-Inglewood) – Net energy metering. • SB 594 by Senator Lois Wolk (D-Davis) – Energy: net energy metering. • SB 1066 by Senator Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) – Coastal resources: climate change. • SB 1122 by Senator Michael Rubio (D-Bakersfield) – Energy: renewable bioenergy projects.

But even though some beneficiaries may credit President Obama for providing the phones, Lifeline is an extension of a program that has existed since 1985. Still, critics including Rep.

It was the first time in 22 years that a U.S. president has blocked such a foreign business deal, The Associated Press reported. The Treasury Department said in a statement that Obama’s order was a matter of national security, citing the wind farms’ location “within or in the vicinity of restricted air space at Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman in Oregon.” That base is a site where the U.S. military flies unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions, the AP said. The action does not set any precedent for future investments “from China or any other country,” the department added. The department said Obama acted on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The same committee has clashed with Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, which is fighting perceptions that it's an arm of the Chinese government. Obama’s order says he has “credible evidence” that Ralls Corp. — a Delaware-incorporated company owned by Chinese nationals — and the Sany Group, a Chinese company, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States” through their stakes in the wind projects. It orders the companies and their owners to divest any stake in the projects. While the order doesn’t go into details of the alleged security threat, the AP says the military has acknowledged that it used the Oregon base to test drones and the EA-18G "Growler." The news service says the planes fly as low as 200 feet at nearly 300 mph. The last time a president used the law to block a transaction was 1990, when President George H.W. Bush voided the sale of Mamco Manufacturing to a Chinese agency, the AP said. The Republican National Committee declined to comment to POLITICO about the action. politico</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348868081702</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 17:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348870784942-34</Id><Title>West-To-East Pipeline: Mulcair Backs Plans To Send Alberta Oil To Eastern Canada</Title><Msg>West-To-East Pipeline: Mulcair Backs Plans To Send Alberta Oil To Eastern Canada The Huffington Post Canada | By Daniel Tencer Posted: 09/28/2012 3:28 pm EDT Updated: 09/28/2012 3:44 pm EDT NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has thrown his party’s support behind a proposal to ship oil from Alberta to eastern Canada, saying it would lower energy costs for Canadians and increase energy independence. “New Democrats support recent proposals to increase west-east pipeline capacity,” Mulcair told an audience at the Canadian Club of Toronto on Friday. He pointed out that eastern Canada imports oil from the Middle East and elsewhere at prices that are some $40 per barrel higher than the oil Alberta sells to the U.S., and called a west-to-east pipeline a “common sense solution that not only creates jobs, it strengthens Canada’s energy security.” Faced with a deep “discount” on their oil sands product — due to a boom in U.S. oil production and lack of access to global markets — Alberta producers have been considering reworking Canada’s oil and gas infrastructure to ship oil to eastern Canada. TransCanada CEO Russ Girling confirmed in April his company is considering doing exactly that, and the plan has garnered support from New Brunswick Premier David Alward and P.E.I. Premier Robert Ghiz, among others. Enbrigde recently got the go-ahead to reverse an Ontario pipeline between Hamilton and Sarnia as part of a plan to ship more oil eastwards. Mulcair’s comments were part of an effort by the NDP leader to paint a business-friendly image in front of the crowd of business leaders. “I see that Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs spoke here just last week. So I have to apologize to those of you who will have to sit through what is essentially the same speech twice,” Mulcair joked. And in an unusual reversal of roles, Mulcair even criticized Finance Minister Jim Flaherty — for criticizing businesses. “Conservative Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has been blaming Bay Street for the half a trillion dollars in dead money held by Canadian businesses,” Mulcair said. “I share Mr. Flaherty’s concern about large Canadian corporations hoarding cash and cash-like assets, but unlike Mr. Flaherty I have no interest in lecturing business. We are here to support businesses.” But Mulcair seemed to hold his ground on the “Dutch disease” controversy. Without using the term, he repeated the assertion that rising commodity prices have caused the dollar to appreciate to the point where it has hollowed out Canada’s export-reliant manufacturing base. But he added a new twist to the debate, arguing the Conservative government itself may be to blame for some of the phenomenon “Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government has poured billions of dollars in direct and indirect subsidies into some of our worst polluting industries,” he said. “Those subsidies, in combination with rising commodity prices, have led to an artificial rise in the value of Canadian dollar — and that’s hobbling our export industries.” huffingtonpost</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348870784942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:19:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348871603352-35</Id><Topic><Title>Chicken Draft Dodger Romney Afraid To Talk About Afganistan</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1348800953975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 22:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi!

Based on the European Union method of calculation, Denmark saw renewable energy account for 23.6% of energy consumption in 2011, at the same time that electricity production based on renewable energy accounted for 40.7% of domestic electricity produced in the country. Wind power accounted for 28.1% of electricity produced in 2011. Observed energy consumption actually dropped in 2011 by 6.4%, bringing it back almost to the levels it had been at back in 1990. Considering that the 2008 energy agreement Denmark signed called for a drop in adjusted gross energy consumption of just 2% from 2006 to 2011, the full 6.6% drop is truly marvellous. Another interesting fact to pull out of the numbers is that, while the national GDP grew by 0.8% in 2011, energy efficiency improved by 1.7% over the same period. Subsequently, energy efficiency improvements over the past two decades have allowed for each unit of GDP to require 28.5% less energy in 2011 than in 1990. The amount of observed CO2 emissions caused by energy consumption in the country fell in 2011 by 10.6% to just 44.3 million tonnes. This is a great improvement, with a fall of 19.5% based off the baseline year of 1990/95. Finally, Denmark proved itself to be the only EU member state to be energy self-sufficient in 2011. Denmark was able to produce 110% of its energy needs in 2011, compared with 121% in the previous year.

Nothing less than the future of democracy is at risk. Donate now—before it’s too late. Recently, though, the emails have been less apocalyptic. And this is why: The Democrats’ hysterical solicitations have worked. Not only did Obama outraise Romney in the month of August, he has outraised and out-spent Romney altogether. Listen to Ken Vogel and Dave Levinthal of Politico: “Through the end of August, Romney’s campaign and the party committees and Super PAC supporting it had raised $736 million, compared to $774 million raised by Obama’s campaign and its party and Super PAC allies.” So forget about the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson. If you want to know how to buy an election, ask the Democrats. The saga of Obama and campaign finance is a case study in cynicism. Throughout his career, Obama has portrayed himself as an opponent of money in politics, even as he has exploited the system at every turn. He said in 2008 that he would take public financing, but then became the first nominee in history to opt out. He said in this cycle that he would not allow his associates to fundraise for a Super PAC, but then changed his mind. He has attacked anonymous political giving, but dispatched Joe Biden to appeal to the shadowy Democracy Alliance last November. He pays no price when he makes such reversals. He and his supporters meekly lament that he is a victim of circumstance. The press nods. As dusk settles on the campaign, the Obama team’s fundraising strategy comes into focus. On the one hand, they bullied conservative donors. The administration drafted an executive order, never signed, that would have required firms seeking government contracts to disclose their political giving. Campaign manager Jim Messina singled out the Koch-supported Americans for Prosperity for attack. Senior adviser David Axelrod went after Adelson. It just so happened that the IRS and the SEC, respectively, opened investigations into Romney supporters Frank Vandersloot and Adelson (the administration says this is all a coincidence). These efforts may not have stopped wealthy Republicans and conservatives from donating to Romney and outside groups, but who would argue that they have had no affect on the margins?</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348889367331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:29:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348889437857-48</Id><Topic><Title>How to Buy an Election : Just ask the Democrats</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348889367331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:29:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile Obama pandered and shamed apathetic liberal donors into writing checks. Contributions were off at the beginning of the year. Greens were upset that Obama had not been radical enough on the environment. Gay donors were angry that the president had not done enough to support same-sex marriage. Many progressive millionaires and billionaires simply assumed Obama would win in November. So the Keystone pipeline was put on hold, the president reversed himself on same-sex marriage, and a steady barrage of alarming emails was aimed at Democratic in-boxes. Sympathetic articles in the New York Times Magazine and the New Yorker alerted liberal audiences to the fact that the Obama Super PAC was having trouble raising money. Campaign surrogates fostered the misleading impression that Obama was somehow the underdog in the money race. And it paid off. Last month the pro-Obama Super PAC Priorities USA, the group behind the ad that linked Mitt Romney to a woman’s death by cancer, outraised the Romney-affiliated Super PAC Restore Our Future. Rahm Emanuel is back fundraising for Priorities, and will bring in more cash. On Thursday, Bill Clinton headlined a fundraiser for outside progressive groups. Present at the Clinton speech were members of the Democracy Alliance, who will direct $100 million in pledges this cycle to progressive groups, including Super PACs and campaigns. Late yesterday, progressive moneybags George Soros announced he would pitch in. The money is not being wasted. Obama is winning the television ad wars. “Mr. Obama and his allies are handily outspending Mr. Romney and the conservative Super PACs working on his behalf in Colorado, Ohio, and New Hampshire,” the New York Times reports. Obama outspent Romney two to one in June, in a barrage of negative advertising that defined the challenger as an out-of-touch plutocrat. Obama’s ads, which show up regularly on YouTube and on niche cable channels such as HGTV, are well targeted to his base of young people and single women. These ads are complemented by outside spending from outfits such as Planned Parenthood, which is spending more than $3 million in swing states on ads suggesting Romney wants to repeal the twentieth century. Who knows how much the unions will spend to elect Democrats in 2012: A July Wall Street Journal analysis based on Labor Department reports concluded that the unions spent more than $4 billion on political activity between 2005 and 2011. The press is so invested in the mirage of Republican financial dominance that it has barely examined the material interests of Obama’s donors. Thursday’s New York Times piece on the pro-Obama Super PAC notes that “the Democratic groups are raising heavily from the party’s traditional, pre-Obama sources of campaign cash: trial lawyers, unions, and Hollywood.” All these traditional, pre-Obama groups would benefit financially from a second Obama administration. Trial lawyers benefit from convoluted laws that provide additional opportunities for lawsuits—laws such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Trial lawyers benefit from Democratic administrations (such as Obama’s) and congresses (such as Harry Reid’s Senate and Nancy Pelosi’s House) that prevent meaningful tort reform. The unions benefit from a pliant Labor Department, an open White House, an administration that sandbagged creditors in the auto bailout in order to reward the UAW, Democrats who are eager to cater to public sector workers’ needs, and perhaps, one-day, card-check legislation that would make it easier for them to expand membership and rake in more dues.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348889437857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:30:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348889773722-49</Id><Title>Phantom Savings Obama’s debt-reduction plan is filled with gimmicks</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama is repeating a debunked claim regarding his commitment to deficit reduction, one of the highest priority issues for voters this election cycle. In a campaign video unveiled Wednesday, the president called for a “new economic patriotism” and touted his “balanced plan to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.” The claim that Obama has a plan—in the form of his most recent budget proposal—to reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years has been a constant refrain from the president on the campaign trail, and has been echoed by his Democratic allies. Former President Bill Clinton, for example, praised Obama’s “reasonable plan of $4 trillion in debt reduction over a decade” during his primetime speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. However, as Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s in-house fact-checker, has made clear: “The repeated claim that Obama’s budget reduces the deficit by $4 trillion is simply not accurate.” “Virtually no serious budget analyst agreed” with the Obama administration’s accounting with respect to the $4 trillion figure, Kessler found. Independent experts panned the president’s budget for its “troubling” reliance on gimmicks and accounting tricks to inflate the magnitude of the savings being proposed. Keith Hennessey, a former director of the National Economic Council, estimated the true value of Obama’s deficit reduction—minus these gimmicks—to be about $2.8 trillion, and called even that reduced figure a “generous” assessment. The president’s budget, for instance, takes credit for about $1 trillion in spending cuts that were already signed into law in 2011, and should already be incorporated given that they fall outside the 10-year budget window. The budget also includes another $800 billion in phantom savings related to the military drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan—money that would never have been spent to begin with—and another $800 billion in projected savings due to reduced interest payments on the debt, something not traditionally cited in federal budget documents as a form of government “spending” that can be “cut.” “Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement criticizing Obama’s use of accounting gimmicks. “When you finish college, you don’t suddenly have thousands of dollars a year to spend elsewhere—in fact, you have to find a way to pay back your loans.” These imaginary “savings” are then used to finance new federal spending, as Obama acknowledges in the campaign video. “As we end the war in Afghanistan, let’s apply half the savings to pay down our debt and use the rest for some nation-building right here at home,” he says. “Fake money is being used to pay for real spending projects,” Kessler explains. Furthermore, the idea that savings from the drawdown in Afghanistan—even if those savings were real—could “pay down our debt,” as Obama suggests, is simply not credible. The federal debt, which recently hit $16 trillion, is projected to grow to $25.4 trillion by the year 2022 under Obama’s budget. Obama’s proposals, activist MacGuineas noted, would “barely stabilize the debt—and at too high a level,” much less pay it down. Even the liberal Ezra Klein has acknowledged that “there’s a good case to be made that Obama’s budget doesn’t actually hit the deficit-reduction target it’s implying that it hits.” Obama and his allies also routinely insist that his plan is “balanced,” meaning it includes both spending cuts and tax increases. The Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, which Obama did not endorse, advocated such an approach. Some Democrats have tried to equate Obama’s plan with that of Bowles-Simpson but, as Kessler points out, the Bowles-Simpson plan “is actually quite different, calling for tough spending cuts and substantial tax reforms—not the faux proposals contained in the president’s budget.” The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)’s own figures reveal that Obama’s budget would net just $14 billion in reduced federal spending over the next decade, compared to its baseline projections, which effectively represents the status quo. Total federal spending would rise from $3.8 trillion this year to $5.8 trillion in 2022, an increase of 53 percent. The president’s extreme reluctance to rein in federal spending is captured in Bob Woodward’s latest book, The Price of Politics. Obama, Woodward writes, wanted to put forward a $4 trillion deficit reduction plan, but felt the spending cuts necessary to achieve that goal “were too severe. The progressive and liberal base would be deeply distressed.” The result was a plan full of gimmicks, and imaginary savings, that is not “balanced” at all. Ultimately, Kessler notes, “most of Obama’s claimed deficit reduction comes from his proposed tax increases.” The new taxes proposed in Obama’s budget total $1.8 trillion, according to the OMB. National media outlets, meanwhile, continue to report Obama’s $4 trillion claim as established fact. The New York Times published an article Tuesday alleging that the president’s budget “called for $5.3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade,” even higher than what the president’s says in his most recent campaign ad. The higher figure is culled from the tables accompanying the budget and refers to projected deficit reduction between 2013 and 2022 that also incorporates the same gimmicks and other savings enacted “since January 2011.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348889773722</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:36:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348889974784-50</Id><Topic><Title>Chicken Draft Dodger Romney Afraid To Talk About Afganistan</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1348800953975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 22:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Again and as always, you are lying wallboard.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1348889974784</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348890115907-51</Id><Title>Obama Supporters' Dirty Tricks to Win the Catholic Vote</Title><Msg>More Chicago politics and lies Catholics are a key demographic in the upcoming election. In fact, they may be the key demographic. In most every presidential contest since the end of World War II, the candidate who carried the Catholic vote won the election. Over time they have, as a bloc, become more conservative and more Republican in their voting patterns (they were once a major component of the Democrats' presidential coalition) as concerns over settled issues like the morality of abortion overtook in importance concerns about unsettled issues like the best way to secure social justice for the poor and the downtrodden. Much has been made of the fact that both candidates for vice president—Paul Ryan and Joe Biden—are practicing Catholics, though they come at almost every issue from diametrically opposite positions: As one example, Ryan opposes abortion while Biden supports keeping it legal. With most of the national polls showing the race to be one or two points either way, the fight over the Catholic vote is heating up. In Cleveland, Ohio, the local chapter of Right to Life has issued a formal letter to Bishop Richard Lennon asking him to suspend the Diocese's "Faithful Citizenship" meetings because of their disregard for pro-life issues. "As a pro-life woman and a Catholic, I am appalled," Cleveland Right to Life President Molly Smith said in a release. "Our Church is under attack by the most liberal, pro-abortion leadership in history. The Cleveland Catholic Diocese is missing a great teaching and unifying opportunity by responding in this manner." According to Smith's group, "Faithful Citizenship meetings were organized by the Diocese of Cleveland with the goal of aiding Catholics in preparing themselves to vote this November. The forums, led in part by open Obama-supporter Karen Leith, downplay abortion and religious freedom, issues of irreducible importance to Catholic voters." The push back in Ohio is only part of what is going on nationally said Deal Hudson, the president of the Pennsylvania Catholics Network and an expert on Catholic outreach. "Lay Catholics who are committed to life, marriage, and religious liberty are not going to allow a repeat of the 2008 campaign, when the bishops' document 'Faithful Citizenship' was cherry-picked and spun into a garland of blessing for Barack Obama," Hudson said. "The purpose of the new introduction to the document, published this past November, was to discourage this type of irresponsible partisanship that ignores the Church's teaching on fundamental social issues." Here is what the administrative committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' wrote: Although it has at times been misused to present an incomplete or distorted view of the demands of faith in politics, this statement remains a faithful and challenging call to discipleship in the world of politics. It does not offer a voter's guide, scorecard of issues, or direction on how to vote. It applies Catholic moral principles to a range of important issues and warns against misguided appeals to 'conscience' to ignore fundamental moral claims, to reduce Catholic moral concerns to one or two matters, or to justify choices simply to advance partisan, ideological, or personal interests. "It's the last line from the paragraph above that most directly warns those who twisted the meaning of the bishops' 2007 document," Hudson said. The "Faithful Citizenship" document "outlines and makes important distinctions among moral issues acknowledging that some involve the clear obligation to oppose intrinsic evils which can never be justified and that others require action to pursue justice and promote the common good," rather than simply providing a quantitative listing of issues for equal consideration. "What Ohio Right to Life has done is precisely what the U.S. bishops have called upon all Catholics to do—be vigilant in defense of the faith and its fundamental moral teachings," Hudson said. But that's only part of the story. On Wednesday Hudson also revealed that a group calling itself Catholics for Obama had been making push poll phone calls in support of the president's re-election bid. Among the questions being asked, he said, was "How can you support a 'Mormon' who does not believe in Jesus Christ?" The phone banker making the call, which in this case went to a woman Hudson identifies as "the head of a pro-life committee at a parish I know" reportedly also asserted that "President Obama did not support abortion" and that Planned Parenthood "helps children get healthcare and prenatal care and does not promote abortion." In fact, the group is one of the nation's largest abortion providers. All this amounts to a whispering campaign that is both dishonest about the president's record on abortion and deviously attempts to divide the Catholic electorate on the issue of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's religion—something the Obama campaign has repeatedly promised it would not do. With the election getting closer, the comments and attacks are getting nastier. Some people, apparently, will do anything to hold on to power.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348890115907</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
