(Cody Duty / Houston Chronicle) WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Senate has endorsed construction of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is to carry oil from Canada to Texas oil refineries. Senators voted 62-37 on Friday for the nonbinding measure. Seventeen Democrats and all 45 Republicans voted yes. For four years, environmentalists and others have tried to derail the project, saying extracting the oil from Alberta tar sands would increase global warming. President Barack Obama has thwarted it twice, and Nebraska officials objected initially that the route would jeopardize ecologically sensitive lands. But the Nebraska route has been changed, and project supporters have won more backing by arguing it would create thousands of jobs. A recent State Department report raised no major objections to the project. North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven sponsored the measure. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/03/22/senate-endorses-keystone-xl-pipeline-construction/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1364012679361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 00:24:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364032605848-2</Id><Topic><Title>maxidope=stupid</Title><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1363938661737</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 03:51:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey stupid understand.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1364032605848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 05:56:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364032672591-3</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a typical teabagger</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340514110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>commie rat POS</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1364032672591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 05:57:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364034790056-4</Id><Topic><Title>maxidope=stupid</Title><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1363938661737</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 03:51:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was to poor to get an education, thats why he sounds so stupid.

The list is endless. The result is societal failure, the collapse of female culture especially, the production of endless swarms of idle and useless youths, rapidly rising crime rates, and the creation of fiscal black holes that suck money in from stronger outside communities dragging them down too.... The entire system of capitalism is built on projecting forward the prospects for a society's potential, and assigning a risk premium on its prospects, and the prospects of its corporations, banks, and governmental infrastructure. The system can only be tricked so long into assigning an incorrect risk premium, interest rate, and price on the assets of the society. How you fix the mess above is very simple. The method is the method used by Europe to lift itself out of the middle ages: taxes, government regulation, and the subsidization of culture, education, and technology on a massive scale by redistributing income from the poor and culturally useless to the superior classes in society. There is a problem, however, when you introduce the element of democracy. People are not likely to vote for such iron discipline, especially when they will be on the receiving end of it.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364042899597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 08:48:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364050288467-9</Id><Topic><Title>The most undisciplined big society on the planet</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364042899597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 08:48:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The government is preparing for the end game with bullets, FEMA camps, drones, black helicopters, etc. The food lines (food stamps) are masked as a " look what your country is doing for you" prop.

German defense and industrial labs are working to improve the drones, develop better power cells, and laser applications using quantum physics.

His XTO deal has sapped shareholder gains over the last 6 years. In 2006 when he became CEO, XOM was far more valuable than CVX on a per share basis. Now CVX has grown significantly and XOM has remained flat, the Tillerson slump. Tillerson has held back dividend growth so he could feed huge share buybacks to prop up the slumping per-share results of his malfeasance. Meanwhile, he has paid himself $20+ mil a year. He paid top dollar for XTO and it will take decades to recover from that miscalculation. Throw the bum out. Pay him off and lets get a new CEO who respects shareholder value and payout. In this week's Barron's, Tillerson was dropped from the "Best CEOs in the World" List. How embarrassing. Wall Street knows that he is no bright light, no Lee Raymond. He is no visionary leader, and he is even a bad caretaker. And he has run XOM into a wall. In late April XOM SHOULD announce a big catch-up dividend hike of 50% or greater to get the stuck shares back on a growth track. The share buyback program should be drastically reduced - it doesn't help shareholders; it only helps make subpar per-share earnings results look better, to make ineffective management look good. We need a div yield at 3.5% to move this stock over 100 finally. But this may not happen until Tillerson is thrown out. WRITE A LETTER TO XOM BOARD MEMBERS TO GET SOME ACTION GOING.</Msg><Username>perho</Username><Timestamp>1364064632594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 14:50:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364076842402-13</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>sanromanwiliam</Username><Timestamp>1361547275275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:34:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>345vy345</Msg><Username>joethomas873</Username><Timestamp>1364076842402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 18:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364087805846-14</Id><Title>higher dividends?</Title><Msg>I am expecting an increase in the DIVIDEND.</Msg><Username>hrant4005</Username><Timestamp>1364087805846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
