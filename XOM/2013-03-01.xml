The sums are substantial: As of the latest Federal Reserve release US foreign income amounted to $1.105 trillion yearly, only $329 billion of which was undistributed and invested outside the US. Foreign payments on US assets owed by foreigners came in at $526 billion, leaving $579 billion in net profits to Americans from foreign investments and foreign trade. $579 billion yearly is more than sufficient to cover the entire US trade "deficit." Indeed, excluding oil, the US actually is running a significant trade surplus when profits from trade and foreign investments are included. In other words profits accruing from trade and investment with places like China are helping to finance US oil imports, an area of incredible waste. That waste will be temporary as technology improves and US energy and environmental policy is reformed as the GOP is driven from power.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1362148038535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:27:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362148111213-10</Id><Title>ENVS HUGE ALERT GOING TO BE TODAYS NUMBER 1 GAINER</Title><Msg>ENVS BREAKING OUT GOING TO BE A HUGE WINNER</Msg><Username>expert_facts_god</Username><Timestamp>1362148111213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:28:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362148660452-11</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>ashley_littell</Username><Timestamp>1362148660452</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:37:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362149234670-12</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice work! thanks a lot!</Msg><Username>troylee677</Username><Timestamp>1362149234670</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:47:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362149421038-13</Id><Topic><Title>The dollar the best store of value now...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1362063514889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:58:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We will see how much your strong dollar and low inflation will buy you in the future.

The Deutsche Bank team said key markets such as India, China and the US are experiencing strong demand and solar projects are now being developed with minimal or no incentives. “While some risks around subsidy cuts in Japan and the UK market remain, we expect a more constructive outlook in most other emerging markets,” Deutsche Bank writes. “We see the sector transitioning from subsidised to sustainable markets in 2014.” ...

While reports from UBS and Macquarie focused on the impacts of solar on fossil fuel incumbents and prevailing business models – read UBS says boom in unsubsidised solar PV heralds energy revolution and Macquarie says rooftop solar juggernaut is unstoppable - the Deutsche Bank report focuses more on the upside for the solar manufacturing sector, which has been bleeding from oversupply, a price war and plunging share prices. Deutsche predicts margins will rebound, and suggests that several leading manufacturers will actually start producing, or at least talking about, profits in the second half of the year. The key for Deutsche is the emergence of unsubsidised markets in many key countries. It points, for instance, to India, where despite delays in the national solar program, huge demand for state based schemes has produced very competitive tenders, in the 12c/kWh range. Given the country’s high solar radiation profile and high electricity prices paid by industrial customers, it says several conglomerates are considering large scale implementation of solar for self consumption. “Grid parity has been reached in India even despite the high cost of capital of around 10-12 per cent,” Deutsche Bank notes, and also despite a slight rise in module prices of 3c-5c/kW in recent months(good for manufacturers). Italy is another country that appears to be at grid parity, where several developers are under advanced discussions to develop unsubsidized projects in Southern Italy. Deutsche Bank says that for small commercial enterprises that can achieve 50 per cent or more self consumption, solar is competitive with grid electricity in most parts of Italy, and commercial businesses in Germany that have the load profile to achieve up to 90 per cent self consumption are also finding solar as an attractive source of power generation.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362155058402</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:24:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362155104465-25</Id><Topic><Title>Deutsche sees “sustainable” global solar market in 2014</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362154975774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:22:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Deutsche bank says demand expected in subsidised markets such as Japan and the UK, including Northern Ireland, is expected to be strong, the US is likely to introduce favourable legislation, including giving solar installations the same status as real estate investment trusts, strong pipelines in Africa and the Middle east, and unexpectedly strong demand in countries such as Mexico and Caribbean nations means that its forecasts for the year are likely to rise. Supply outlook is also improving, which would keep polysilicon prices under control (below the key $25/kg levels) and major suppliers such as Wacker and Hemlock are likely to increase utilization rates in order to meet the strong demand from module customers. The major solar manufacturers are due to report their latest results this week, and Deutsche expects a more positive narrative of stabilize pricing, increasing demand, and improving margins. “Profitability as a module supplier remains challenging, but project pipelines could enable margin recovery,” it says. It cited the case of Yingli, which released “pre-results’ data late last week, indicating higher than expected demand and shipments. Deutsche took this to mean that China will, in fact, deliver on its ambitious 10GW target in 2013. “We expect Yingli to suggest stable pricing trends and improving profitability in the second half of 2013,” it wrote. Combined with control over operational expenditure and reduced cash burn, this would be a positive for its shares So much so, that Deutsche is now reviewing its model for the company.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362155104465</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:25:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362155186353-26</Id><Topic><Title>Deutsche sees “sustainable” global solar market in 2014</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362154975774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:22:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>reneweconomyDOTcomDOTau/2013/deutsche-sees-sustainable-global-solar-market-in-2014-2014</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362155186353</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:26:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362156966332-27</Id><Title>DuPont's Female Don Quixote Tilts At Oil &amp; Gas Windmills!</Title><Msg>Ms. Kullman Pontificates on Petroleum At Energy Summit in Washington, D. C. Good Morning, Bonjour, Guten Tag, Readers, one of the more comical sideshows at the big energy pow-wow on Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2013 in the nation's capital was DuPont Chieftess, Ellen Kullman saddled up and tilting at windmills. DuPont's own distaff version of Don Quixote somehow believes she can compete in the energy industry against the likes of Exxon and Chevron and Conoco. Ms. Quixote proclaimed before 2,700 gathered "leaders" in Washington: "Because of our long-term reliance on petroleum, there is no other challenge in greater need of innovation than our modern energy needs." Perhaps behind the thick walls of insular Fortress Wilmington in the dwarf state of Delaware, Ms. Kullman has not noticed that the United States has a super-abundance of gas and oil, produced efficiently and prolifically. It's cheap energy for consumers and industrial producers. And she believes her costly commercially unproven DuPont corn cob "gasoline", bad mileage ethanol, is going to replace a huge chunk of petroleum? What a joke from someone who hauls down $15 million a year to tilt at windmills.

In the chemical business, BASF is the largest and leading global enterprise. The number one position was held for most of the last century by DuPont before it was dramatically shrunk and crushed by the weight of an incompetent and unethical "leadership". BASF is circa three times the size of the diminished DuPont by a number of metrics. Moreover, ExxonMobil Chemicals as the third largest global chemical enterprise by revenue towers over DuPont, which had fallen to number 10 by 2008. Unlike the big bosses of DuPont who sneer and degrade chemicals in favour of food additives, seeds and bio-foolish "Sustainability stunts", executive leaders of BASF are proud to be making chemicals, basic, intermediate and specialty, along with related materials and superior GM seed traits. ...funfun..</Msg><Username>funfundvierzig</Username><Timestamp>1362162573519</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:29:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362162846159-36</Id><Topic><Title>XOM may be ended.

We are still in the winter,” Wyden said Friday. He spoke during a taping of the C-SPAN program “Newsmakers” that will be broadcast Sunday. “There is no reasonable explanation for this right now. The Iranians are not rattling around this week in the Straits of Hormuz, we have not see any kind of unusual developments, that is why I want to look at a whole host of issues, and one that hasn’t been on the table at all has been the question of refineries,” Wyden said. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital Middle East shipping lane for crude oil that Iran has threatened to block in the past. Pump prices have been rising at a historic clip, according to AAA. “The national average price of gasoline has increased 49 cents per gallon since the beginning of the year, which is the highest price increase through the end of February on record,” the travel services organization said in a report Thursday. Average prices began 2013 at $3.29 per gallon and were $3.78 on Thursday, according to AAA. “Gas prices increased at a dramatically faster pace than expected in February,” said AAA spokesman Avery Ash in a statement. “Motorists unfortunately are paying more for gasoline than ever at this time of year, and it is primarily because of a decline in refinery production and higher wholesale futures prices.” thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/285729-senate-to-hold-hearing</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362173266293</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 16:27:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362175389176-46</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good work!</Msg><Username>fishj15</Username><Timestamp>1362175389176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:03:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362175872174-47</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

SOPER OCEAN CITY -- A future offshore wind energy farm, proposed as close as 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City, inched closer to reality this week with the anticipated passage by the entire state Senate now the only stumbling block from a legislative standpoint. Gov. Martin O’Malley’s Maryland Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013 was passed last Friday by the House by a vote of 86-48. The Senate Finance Committee passed the legislation by a vote of 7-4 on Tuesday, setting up a final vote before the entire Senate, which is expected to approve the offshore wind bill. In each of the last two years, the House has approved the governor’s offshore wind initiative, but the stumbling block has been the Senate committee vote. The bill has stalled in the Senate Finance Committee the last two years and the session has expired before a vote could be taken on the Senate floor. However, Senate President Thomas V. “Mike” Miller this year swapped out members of the Finance Committee to ensure the bill’s passage. Senator Jim Mathias (D-38) said this week he voted for the bill in committee after a couple of amendments he deemed critical to his district were approved. One of the amendments would offer protections to the businesses that use the most energy and would be forced to pay the highest fees. “We were able to get a couple of good local amendments on the bill before it came out,” he said. “For one, to the extent possible, the Public Service Commission will be required to afford protections to businesses in the state.” Mathias said another amendment attached to the bill by the Senate Finance Committee would clearly identify where the transmission line would connect the offshore wind field to the mainland. Early recommendations suggested the main transmission line cross over or... mdcoastdispatchDOTcom/articles/2013/03/01/Top-Stories/Offshore-Wind-Bill-Expected-To-Pass-Soon</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362191967324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 21:39:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
