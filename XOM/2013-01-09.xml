The latest evidence comes from Oakland, California’s Solar Mosaic, developer of an online crowdfunding platform that enables small individuals to invest in high-quality solar photovoltaic (PV) projects (which debuted yesterday). The first four solar power projects listed on Mosaic’s online marketplace, sold out in less than 24 hours. More than 400 investors put up amounts ranging from $25 to $30,000 (the average was nearly $700) for a total investment of more than $313,000, Mosaic announced on its blog. Massive Clean Energy Transition in Sight More than 700 investors have plowed $1.1 million into Mosaic to finance 12 rooftop solar power arrays in Arizona, California, and New Jersey. This latest batch of four projects were opened to residents of California and New York, as well as accredited investors nationwide. “We see a massive transition coming from fossil fuels to clean energy, and we think people should be able to profit from that transition,” Mosaic’s President, Billy Parish, commented. “Mosaic is creating the architecture for mass participation in the clean energy economy.” Among those investing in Mosaic’s earliest projects were Roland Regos and Rosana Francescato. “A crucial step toward an authentic democracy is to put clean energy in the hands of the public,” Regos asserted. Mosaic is a true champion of the people.” “Mosaic is lowering the barrier for regular people like me — not just rich investors or big companies — to benefit from solar power while providing a good return on investment. I invested in several projects, the process was easy and it only took a few minutes,” Francescato added. Mosaic has one more project open to “accredited investors who meet certain financial suitability requirements.” The requirements include investors with income of more than $200,000 in each of the previous two years, $300,000 in joint income with a spouse with “a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level this year,” or those with a net worth, excluding equity in a primary residence, of more than $1 million either individually or jointly with a spouse. “We are thrilled at how the public showed up yesterday,” said Mosaic’s CEO, Dan Rosen. “It’s indicative of a pent-up demand that we are working to meet. People want strong returns and want to know what their money is invested in. Our marketplace allows people to sidestep Wall Street by investing in Main Street.” That’s a message that shouldn’t be lost on the American public in a period of high economic and job insecurity and a decades-long trend of worsening income, wealth, and social and political inequality. sDOTtt/1yaSj</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357742639176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:43:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357744206614-7</Id><Title>Obama environmental picks seen focusing on oil boom</Title><Msg>Obama environmental picks seen focusing on oil boom Posted on January 9, 2013 at 7:15 am by Bloomberg President Barack Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

The projected discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil to Brent, which averaged $18 per barrel in 2012, falls to an average of $16 per barrel in 2013 and $8 per barrel in 2014, as planned new pipeline capacity lowers the cost of moving Mid-continent crude oil to the Gulf Coast refining centers. •EIA expects that falling crude prices will help national average regular gasoline retail prices fall from an average $3.63 per gallon in 2012 to annual averages of $3.44 per gallon and $3.34 per gallon in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Diesel fuel retail prices averaged $3.97 per gallon during 2012 and are forecasted to fall to an average of $3.87 per gallon in 2013 and $3.78 per gallon in 2014. •EIA estimates U.S. total crude oil production averaged 6.4 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2012, an increase of 0.8 million bbl/d from the previous year. Projected domestic crude oil production continues to increase to 7.3 million bbl/d in 2013 and 7.9 million bbl/d in 2014, which would mark the highest annual average level of production since 1988. •Total U.S. liquid fuels consumption fell from an average 20.8 million bbl/d in 2005 to 18.6 million bbl/d in 2012. EIA expects total consumption to rise slowly over the next two years to an average 18.8 million bbl/d in 2014, driven by increases in distillate and liquefied petroleum gas consumption, with flat gasoline and jet fuel consumption. •Natural gas working inventories, which a record-high level in early November, ended 2012 at an estimated 3.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), slightly above the level at the same time the previous year. EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2011 and $2.75 per million MMBtu in 2012, will average $3.74 per MMBtu in 2013 and $3.90 per MMBtu in 2014. •EIA expects the coal share of total electricity generation to rise from 37.6 percent in 2012 to 39.0 percent in 2013 and 39.6 percent in 2014, as natural gas prices rise relative to coal prices. Lower-than-projected natural gas prices along with the industry's response to future environmental regulations could cause the coal share of total generation to fall below this forecast. eia -------------------------------- DOLLAR INDEX SPOT bloombergDOTcom/quote/DXY:IND --------------------------------- Monthly Biodiesel Production Report With Data for October 2012 | Release Date: December 28, 2012 | Next Release Date: January 30, 2013 | full report Previous Issues Month: October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 December 2011 December 2009 State Producers Annual capacity (million gallons) Alabama 2 49 Arizona 1 2 Arkansas 3 87 California 7 91 Connecticut 3 5 Georgia 3 30 Illinois 6 278 Indiana 3 134 Iowa 8 250 Kansas 1 1 Kentucky 5 74 Louisiana 1 12 Maine 1 0 Maryland 1 3 Massachussetts 1 0 Michigan 2 18 Minnesota 4 107 Mississippi 2 85 Missouri 6 110 Nevada 1 1 New York 2 20 North Carolina 4 39 Ohio 3 66 Oklahoma 1 15 Oregon 1 1 Pennsylvania 6 91 Rhode island 2 1 South Carolina 2 41 South Dakota 1 2 Tennessee 1 2 Texas 8 328 Virginia 3 9 Washington 3 104 West Virginia 1 3 Wisconsin 4 31 Highlights Production - U.S. production of biodiesel was 75 million gallons in October 2012.

The grain-based additive discount to gasoline narrowed to 54.89 cents a gallon, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities, from 57.44 cents yesterday, the biggest contraction since Dec. 21 and the narrowest since Dec. 25. “The corn market recovered slightly today,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “That is driving most of the strength in ethanol, despite weakness in gasoline.” Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $2.23 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest since Dec. 18. Prices have fallen 1.2 percent in the past year. In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 1.25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.20 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel increased 0.75 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.25, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Ethanol in New York slipped 0.5 cent to $2.285 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive was unchanged at $2.335. Corn for March delivery advanced 5.5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $6.9425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 26 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock. Motor Fuel Gasoline for February delivery fell 1.55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.7789 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Prices for the motor fuel declined after the Energy Department reported that stockpiles rose 7.41 million barrels to 233.1 million in the week ended Jan. 4, the highest level since Feb. 25, 2011. Ethanol also gained after the report showed inventories fell 1.8 percent to 19.9 million barrels, a five-week low and the third straight stocks drop, the longest streak since the period ended July 6. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-09/ethanol-jumps-most-in-two-weeks-versus-gasoline-on-corn-price.html ----------- ------------ ------------- ----------- Ethanol Output in U.S. Rises 2.4% to 826,000 Barrels per Day By Mario Parker - Jan 9, 2013 9:23 AM MT. 1 Comment U.S. ethanol production advanced 2.4 percent last week to 826,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department said. Output jumped the most since Nov. 30 and climbed to the highest level in two weeks while stockpiles declined 1.8 percent to 19.9 million barrels, a five-week low, according to a department report today. It was the third straight inventory drop, the longest streak since the period ended July 6. Imports sank 40 percent to 52,000 barrels a day from 87,000 the previous week, the department said. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 84 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, the smallest share since June 3, 2011. Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.5 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.225 a gallon at 10 a.m. local time on the Chicago Board of Trade. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-09/ethanol-output-in-u-s-rises-2-4-to-826-000-barrels-per-day.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357793703440</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 23:55:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
