Renewable Energy Group, the largest U.S. producer of biodiesel, argues that any easing of the corn-ethanol requirement would create uncertainty for all biofuels, raising concerns in the industry about the sustainability of market demand. Although REG does not produce ethanol, it fears that a waiver of even part of the Renewable Fuel Standard could have effects that go beyond the demand for corn at a time when drought has sharply reduced production. REG argues that a waiver on ethanol could open up RFS2, the revised five-year-old standard that sets minimum levels for the use of renewable fuels as a partial substitute for gasoline or diesel, for suspension or waivers on those sections of the federal mandate that cover biodiesel or other renewable fuels. In an interview with AOL Energy, REG chief executive David Oh argued that reducing the requirement for ethanol production could undermine confidence among producers of other biofuels that the government will underpin demand for their products which are linked to food output. "Food is more available because biofuels have increased overall agricultural production," Oh said. Farmers who produce beef, poultry, eggs, dairy and other products that depend on corn for livestock feed are calling for a cut in the ethanol mandate that takes up some 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop. They argue that such a cut would help offset the sharply higher corn prices that have resulted from crop yields at their lowest since 1995 and production that has dropped to its lowest for six years in response to sustained high temperatures and low rainfall in many grain-producing states. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast in August that the average corn price in the current crop year would surge to $7.50-$8.90 a bushel from $5.40-$6.40 predicted only a month earlier. We're paying a high price for something that historically didn't have a great purpose," - Oh, REG With the biodiesel industry paying more for the greases, oils and fats that come from crops and livestock, farmers will be more likely to raise those animals or crops because of the extra income they generate, Oh argues. The sustained agricultural output boosts supply and helps to keep down food prices for consumers, he said. But a cut in the government-led demand for corn – and by extension other biofuels – could lead to a simultaneous cut in the farm products associated with them, he added. A recent study by economists at Purdue University found that corn prices would fall the more the EPA reduced its requirement for ethanol production but would remain above those expected before the drought even under the biggest projected cut in the ethanol mandate. If EPA cut the mandate to 7.75 billion gallons from the 13.8 billion gallons it currently requires for next year, the price of corn would fall to $5.80 a bushel, compared with the $7.81 that Purdue expects with an unchanged mandate. The price projections vary with stronger and less-severe drought assumptions, and are part of a scenario that is "highly uncertain," the paper said. "In making its waiver decision, EPA will have to weigh the economic harm of higher corn prices to livestock producers and to food and fuel consumers, against the interests of crop producers and ethanol producers," the study said. In 2011, about 80 percent of REG's biodiesel was sourced from animal fats, as well as used cooking oil and inedible corn oil. Among its feedstock is white grease, whose price has doubled to about 45 cents a pound in recent years because of rising demand from biodiesel producers like REG, Oh said. "We're paying a high price for something that historically didn't have a great purpose," he said. Oh argued that a cut in the corn-ethanol mandate would also set back progress towards national goals for biofuels production, which are already behind official targets. The RFS2 standard calls for the production of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel a year by 2022, or around three times current output. "We are lagging, and this cut in the waiver would not be helpful," he said. aol</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349070525148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 01:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349071105504-6</Id><Title>Energy Policy Debate: Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables</Title><Msg>Energy Policy Debate: Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables By Margaret Ryan Published: September 28, 2012 Energy tax policy and regulation – what they are and what they should be – are the critical issues for the Presidential candidates, diverse energy experts agreed. As with the candidates themselves, that was pretty much the end of the agreement in a Washington debate hosted by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Vote4Energy campaign. The experts split, politely, over what's happening now and what that portends for the future, 40 years after the first oil embargo shocked Americans into paying attention to energy. API President/CEO Jack Gerard argued that the federal government should "not pick winners and losers" but should let market forces decide what technologies and energies to use. Gerard rejected Obama administration claims that some tax benefits available to oil and natural gas producers amount to subsidies. The tax provisions involved are normal business deductions, he said. Kevin Smith, CEO of SolarReserve, said – hold on, there. When an oil pipeline is built, the owner gets to depreciate 50% of its cost in the first year. When SolarReserve builds a solar facility, it gets to depreciate only 30%. Moreover, Smith said, there are no expiration dates on long-standing tax code provisions benefitting the oil and gas industries, while renewables are given subsidies with expiration dates every few years. Level Playing Field? "The crux is, we did pick winners and losers," Smith said, but the US made choices 75 years ago to benefit coal and 50 years ago for oil. Now, new cleaner industries are being told "you have to compete," he said. Frank Verrastro, Senior Vice President, Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, said, "There was a good reason" years ago to craft the tax and other laws involved, but now it is difficult to change anything when so much competitive infrastructure is built based on those laws. Speakers agreed enormous private investment will be needed in the near future for energy infrastructure and innovation, but Verrastro cautioned that private investment occurs only in a high-market-price environment. API Vice President Kyle Isakower said private investment is held back by uncertainty over taxes and regulation. He said the industry is not looking to "relax" regulation, as other speakers suggested, but thinks drilling should continue to be regulated only by the states. Isakower said the industry concern is "additional, duplicative regulation." The crux is, we did pick winners and losers," - Smith Verrastro said he endorsed state regulation, "but we see communities struggling" with the impacts of hydraulic fracturing. He suggested there may be a role for federal "performance-based" regulation. Gerard called existing state regulation "robust," while Smith said he had worked on nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar generating facilities and couldn't believe how relatively undemanding some drilling regulation is. Gerard said oil prices are high in part due to the Obama administration's environmental rules and limiting access to federal lands for energy companies, whether oil, gas or coal. Presidents can't change world energy demand, but they can affect supply, he said. Smith said expanding demand from emerging economies like China and India "will dwarf whatever we do." Moreover, he said, "If gas were $10, there would be a big rush to drill no matter what the regulatory hurdles." Gerard said the coal industry is suffering due to the Obama administration's opposition to some coal mines and new environmental limits. Smith said it's the low price of natural gas, not government regulation, that's undermining the economics of coal. aol</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349071105504</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 01:58:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349073383846-7</Id><Topic><Title>European Union Wind Power Capacity Reaches 100 GW - equivalent of the electricity generated by a train of coal stretching from Buenos Aires to Brussels</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348986243508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 02:24:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world's longest coal train sinks in the Atlantic and the Republicans blame Obama for a war on coal.

Boyle | October 1, 2012 Typhoon Jelawat remains a powerful storm, even if its wind speed has decreased from around from 155 mph, 250km/h, it passed over Okinawa on Saturday with wind speeds over 90 mph, 144 km/h, causing extensive damage, and injuring more than 50 people. It was the third typhoon to strike the island during the current tropical cyclone season AIR Worldwide reported that the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), said Jelawat made landfall on Sunday in southern Wagayama prefecture with a minimum central pressure of 965 mb and ten-minute sustained wind speeds estimated at 70 knots – 80.55 mph, app. 129 km/h - making it a category one cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. According to AIR, “over the previous 12 to 24 hours, as Jelawat approached mainland Japan, it encountered cooler ocean temperatures and substantially higher vertical wind shear in response to a mid-latitude trough over the northern Sea of Japan. As a result, Jelawat was weakening and undergoing extra tropical transitioning at the time of landfall, with most of the convection located north of the storm center. Observations in southern Wagayama and Aichi prefectures support the JMA central pressure estimates of 965 to 970 mbs. “Peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 20.3 m/s (52 mph, 83km/h, 1-minute sustained) with gusts as high as 36.4 m/s (81 mph, 130 km/h) were observed in Shionomisaki, in southern Wagayama prefecture while peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 21.0 (53 mph, 85 km/h, 1-minute sustained) with gusts to 36.1 m/s (81 mph, 130 km/h) were observed in Omaezaki, in southern Shizuoka prefecture. These types of wind speeds were restricted to the coast, however. As Jelawat moved inland, interaction with mountainous terrain has weakened the storm’s winds still further. AIR also explained that “flooding is always a concern with land falling tropical cyclones and this is certainly true of Jelawat. However, due to the storm’s forward speed (31 mph, 55 km/h) precipitation amounts have been limited to 100 to 200 mm [app. 4 to 8 inches], and similar amounts are expected in regions further to the north. As a result, widespread flooding is not expected, but some localized flooding is likely. “Jelawat is forecast to continue to weaken and should complete extra tropical transitioning as it emerges back over the northwest Pacific Ocean.” AIR noted that “three tropical cyclones have made landfall in Okinawa only twice since 1951, but never three typhoons. Furthermore, these three typhoons were successive, impacted the island within 5 weeks of each other, and are amongst the five most intense to make landfall (based on central pressure). Thus, this is a very rare occurrence. “Naha, the capital of Okinawa prefecture, observed a minimum sea level pressure of 947.7 mb while Nago, a few dozen kilometers to the north, observed a minimum pressure of 948.6 mb; these support JMA central pressure estimates of 935 mb. “Unlike Typhoon Bolaven, which made landfall on Okinawa on August 26, and to a lesser extent Sanba, which crossed the island three weeks later, observed wind speeds from Jelawat were in line with the JMA estimates (115-120 mph, 184 to 192 km/h, 1-minute sustained). Peak 10-minute winds were as high as 40 m/s (103 mph, 165 km/h, 1-minute sustained) with a wind gust of 61.2 m/s (137 mph, 220 km/h,) observed at Naha. Nearly every observing station in Okinawa, and the surrounding islands, experienced peak 10-minite winds exceeding 30 m/s (77 mph, 123 km/h) and wind gusts exceeding 50 m/s (112 mph, 179 km/h).” AIR indicated that due to the force of the wind speeds recorded on Okinawa, “some damage can be expected. Local officials report that 600 buildings have sustained damage or are flooded. Okinawa’s building stock is predominantly concrete, so significant structural damage from wind should be limited. “Although wind speeds were significantly lower on Japan’s main island, the building stock is more vulnerable. Some damage to roof coverings can be expected (roofs on Okinawa are generally concrete slab) in addition to damage to signage, awnings and other non-structural elements. insurancejournal --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hurricane NADINE Tropical Storm 20W (Maliksi) Warning Tropical Depression 21W (Twentyone) Warning (Vietnam) URLs available at talkstock</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349099651834</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349099835114-13</Id><Topic><Title>Typhoon Jelawat Hits Okinawa; Moves on Tokyo: AIR Analysis</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349099651834</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:54:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tokyo typhoon: Storm speeds out of Japan after injuring dozens VIDEO 7:19 AM, Oct 1, 2012 Written by Associated Press TOKYO -- A weakening tropical storm was speeding out of Japan on Monday after bringing gale-strength winds to Tokyo and injuring dozens of people, causing blackouts and paralyzing traffic to the south and west of the capital. Japan's Meteorological Agency had warned Tokyo residents to stay indoors while Typhoon Jelawat passed Sunday night. The storm then had winds of up to 126 kilometers (78 miles) an hour but weakened to a tropical storm with 108 kph (67 mph) in the morning. On Sunday, Nagoya city issued an evacuation advisory to more than 50,000 residents because of fear of flooding from a swollen river. A similar advisory was issued for more than 10,000 people in the northern city of Ishinomaki that was hit by last year's tsunami. The typhoon left 145 people with minor injuries in southern and western Japan, about half of them on the southern island of Okinawa, public broadcaster NHK said. Tens of thousands of homes were without electricity. Kyodo news agency reported one fatality, a man who was swept away by seawater while fishing in Okinawa. Dozens of trains were halted in coastal areas around Tokyo and many stores inside the capital closed early Sunday as the storm approached. It is expected to move into the Pacific Ocean early Monday. indystar</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349099835114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349101346794-14</Id><Title>Warren Buffett to snap up US wind farms</Title><Msg>Warren Buffett to snap up US wind farms MidAmerican agrees to buy two Californian wind energy projects, as Sage of Omaha extends renewable power portfolio By BusinessGreen staff 01 Oct 2012 Warren Buffett has beefed up his presence in the US renewable energy market, confirming plans to purchase two giant Californian wind farms through his MidAmerican Energy utility.

The new £1 billion wind farm is an investment and 50:50 joint venture between two of Norway’s largest companies, Statoil and Statkraft. The wind farm covers an area of approximately 35 square kilometres (13.51 square miles) and comprises 88 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 317MW. It will generate 1.1TWh of green energy every year, enough to power almost 220,000 British homes. Prince Haakon of Norway conducted the official opening ceremony with the Energy Secretary, Ed Davey. The Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Ola Borten Moe also attended along with the Norwegian Minister of Trade and Industry, Trond Giske, and Helge Lund of Statoil and Christian Rynning-Tønnesen of Statkraft. Sheringham Shoal is owned equally by Statoil and Statkraft through the joint-venture company Scira Offshore Energy Limited. The opening takes place four years after Scira was granted consent by the UK government, and three years after the initial construction works began. According to Statoil’s president and CEO Helge Lund, the company has drawn on experience acquired from 40 years of offshore oil and gas activities in order to complete the project alongside support from British authorities, local communities and suppliers. “We need to get the economy moving again and a massive expansion in home grown, clean, renewable energy capacity is central to this” said the UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey. “Sheringham Shoal will play an important part, supplying power to 220 000 homes, and providing jobs in the local community. Investment in the UK’s energy mix needs to come from increasingly new and diverse sources, and this project is an excellent example of that.” At least 60 local people are employed full-time to operate and maintain the wind farm which has now helped to push UK operational offshore wind energy capacity to over 2.5GW. Statoil and Statkraft, together with RWE and SSE, are also partners in the Forewind consortium which is working on the Dogger Bank project 120 kilometres off the UK coast, potentially the world’s largest offshore wind development. renewableenergymagazine</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349101536474</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:25:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349103730334-16</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan on tax plan: ‘It would take me too long to go through all the math’</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1349097644263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:20:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am the Great and Powerful RYAN !

Hundreds of megawatts of energy at its test location could be tapped, if the estimates are correct. (This is a conservative estimate.) Utah’s Black Rock Desert basin was the site of nine drilling experiments by US geologists to determine if it is a suitable site for geothermal energy development. They found sufficient differences in temperatures in the rock at various depths to rate it a potential geothermal energy discovery. Temperatures could be 500 degrees Fahrenheit at 13,000 feet. With the type of geothermal plant that could be used there, all water would be sent back into the reservoir once it cooled down, so there would be no water consumption. It has been described as a favorable site for geothermal because it is near an electricity transmission line to California, where power costs twice as much as in Utah. A large wind farm and a coal power plant are also nearby, so infrastructure that could accommodate a new geothermal plant already exists to an encouraging extent. The flat, very open land there is filled with cheatgrass and sagebrush. This recent bit of clean energy news is not just about Utah though. The particular type of terrain exists elsewhere in the West, and these other locations might have geothermal potential as well. “There are other potentially hot basins across the Basin and Range province that need to be investigated using this exploration model.

Now, a new poll finds that a majority of Michiganders support increasing renewable energy in the state. According to a survey of likely voters conducted by a variety of news outlets in the state, 55 percent would vote “yes” for more clean energy. Adam Browning, Executive Director of the Vote Solar Initiative, explains the significance of the Michigan ballot initiative: A good win here can have a civilizing effect on the national dialogue. Over the past year, renewable energy has been politicized to an extent never before seen. In Michigan, renewables have bi-partisan support. Saul Anuzis, former chair of the Michigan GOP, wrote an extraordinary letter of support, making the conservative case for the cause (it’s a must-read). A good showing will help demonstrate that polarization is bad politics. Finally, success begets success, and this can help pave the way for wins elsewhere. Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of Americans want to see a transition to renewable energy. Indeed, a good clean energy ballot initiative has never lost — voters in Colorado, Washington, and Missiouri all passed state renewable standards, despite being outspent by opponents. When the people lead, politicians will eventually follow. A number of groups, including Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, and the American Legislative Exchange Council, have vowed to weaken or repeal state-level renewable energy targets. However, this is inconsistent with what people actually want. According to a poll from the nonpartisan Civil Society Institute, 76 percent of Americans say they support “a reduction in our reliance on nuclear power, natural gas and coal, and instead, launch a national initiative to boost renewable energy and energy efficiency.” In addition, 77 percent of Americans agree with this statement: “The energy industry’s extensive and well-financed public relations, campaign contributions and lobbying machine is a major barrier to moving beyond business as usual when it comes to America’s energy policy.” thinkprogress</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349114982103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349115711046-22</Id><Title>46 Republicans Claim Wind Credits Are Too ‘Costly’ After Voting To Retain Billions In Big Oil Subsidies</Title><Msg>46 Republicans Claim Wind Credits Are Too ‘Costly’ After Voting To Retain Billions In Big Oil Subsidies By Rebecca Leber on Sep 26, 2012 at 2:00 pm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349115711046</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:21:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349119286469-23</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Set Up To Reward Investors</Title><Username>galenellis447</Username><Timestamp>1349095049265</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:37:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can count on your money by investing in the stock market for better future returns.</Msg><Username>dickersonh73</Username><Timestamp>1349119286469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:21:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349119707995-24</Id><Title>Geeeeeez, This should be over 93!</Title><Msg>Fundamentals are strong</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1349119707995</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:28:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349122038181-25</Id><Topic><Title>European Union Wind Power Capacity Reaches 100 GW - equivalent of the electricity generated by a train of coal stretching from Buenos Aires to Brussels</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348986243508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 02:24:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed, I'm voting Tea Party.</Msg><Username>onions2089</Username><Timestamp>1349122038181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:07:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349123050516-26</Id><Topic><Title>ROBME'S PLAN IS CALLED "Upward Redistribution" Tax the Middle Class and give Tax Cuts to the Rich!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1349098441096</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:34:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your standard tripe of lies.

Clark is in Calgary this week and spoke with Redford about the five conditions B.C. says needs to be met before the province will support Enbridge's bid to build the pipeline, which would run from the Alberta oilsands across B.C. to the port of Kitimat. “We’re about the environment and there is no price that can be put on protecting our environment in British Columbia — there is none,” said Clark on Monday. “We’ve set out the conditions. We’ve said that we have to have the world’s best spill response on land and on the ocean. If we can get those — and if this passes the environmental review — then we can talk about the last one, the fifth. But, until we get those first three settled and done, this project can’t go ahead.” The fifth condition is royalties. Clark said Monday that that is the last and least important of all the conditions. Redford, however, said that she agrees with Clark on the first four conditions, saying the project must lead on environment. Redford says she won't budge on royalties The Alberta premier then reiterated that she would not budge on the issue of royalties. Redford said it’s now up to Clark on how the project could generate revenue, and said she is open to hearing new ideas. For her part, Clark said the meeting with Redford was “frosty." Clark also said that while the project is important for Canada, it’s not a big deal for B.C. because the province has other booming industries, like natural gas. Redford is expected to speak to reporters at 7 p.m. MT. Clark is scheduled to speak to public policy students at the University of Calgary on Tuesday. cbc</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1349136879785</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 20:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349142686108-38</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Set Up To Reward Investors</Title><Username>galenellis447</Username><Timestamp>1349095049265</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:37:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the info..very useful.
