Wayne Lapierre has spent 40 years as a lobbyist for murder and today is the number one lobbyist for the murder of Americans. His answer to Sandy Hook? Armed guards at every school. Would his fellow NRA board member Grover(draft Dodger) Norquist allow tax money to be raised to pay for it? You know the answer. Lappierre says not one more law regulating guns is a possibility. Not one! He pushed for 100round drums of ammunition to be provided to every mass murderer nationwide with no questions asked at the point of sale. And no, he does not want this practice stopped. Wayne Lapierre is the chief lobbyist for mass murderer..</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356274690598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:58:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356280309954-6</Id><Title>America's Political Future: Democrats and ???? Party.</Title><Msg>In Europe the Socialists call themselves the Party of European Socialists and take names such as the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (Social Democratic Party of Germany)... The right calls itself all sorts of things, and important distinction is in the uses of government not the value or efficacy of it. At one time the Republican Party would have been considered in the mainstream, that is before it veered off onto its libertarian anti-government tangent since 1994. Except for 2009-2010, it has been ruling America since it won control of the Congress in 1994. The Congressional Republicans were inspired by Reagan's reckless rhetoric and carried the torch for him after he left office in 1989. Obama is President but without control of the House there is not much he can do - except go off the fiscal cliff which would give him more taxes, but even then the deficit is so out of control they are already consumed, plus the GOP will certainly block any spending plans... America will need a new right wing party. The Republican brand is too soiled to be of value... The left can keep calling itself Democrats if it likes, and no doubt will...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356280309954</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:31:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356285269133-7</Id><Topic><Title>Mas Murderer Wayne Lapierre Avoided Vietnem Service!</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356274690598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:58:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know that its a waste of time to ask a gutter-trash liberal democrat to show a little class, but I'll make the attempt in this instance.

Exxon ranks #20 with a 2.9% return year to date compared with 8.9% for the Dow and 13.7% for the S&amp;P. This is the fourth straight year of significant underperformance. Company stock did well for decades until Rex Tillerson became CEO. With colossal mistakes like betting the farm on NG (the XTO debacle) its hard to be optimistic as long as he is CEO and that looks like it will be for a while.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1356302540316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:42:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356303356208-11</Id><Topic><Title>Mas Murderer Wayne Lapierre Avoided Vietnem Service!</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356274690598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:58:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jacobin8, In the name of simple decency realize twenty children were murdered in cold blood because of the efforts of the NRA to make the ammunition and rifle legal.

Not an expert but thinking if the true honest profile of some of these insane killers were exposed more could be done at prevention. For some reason the government and media omits details on profiles when the public is looking for answers. This policy of dont ask dont tell, leaves the public in the dark or blind to the risks and dangers among us.</Msg><Username>upsidetonograph</Username><Timestamp>1356305008182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:23:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
