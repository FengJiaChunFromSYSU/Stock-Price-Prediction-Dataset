(AP Photo/Al Grillo, File) JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The companies pursuing a major natural gas project in Alaska released new details of the effort Friday, satisfying the first in a series of benchmarks laid out by Gov. Sean Parnell. “So the good news today, and it’s very good news, it’s the first time in our state’s natural gas history that the companies who can build, fill and operate a large diameter pipeline have together selected a pipeline concept,” he told a group in Fairbanks. Parnell, in his State of the State address last month, said he wanted to know by Friday details including the size of the pipe, daily volume of gas, updates on the gas treatment and liquefaction plants and the number of off-take points to allow for gas to be used in-state, for Alaskans energy needs. Exxon Mobil Production Co., BP Alaska, ConocoPhillips Alaska and TransCanada Corp., responded to each request in a letter to Parnell. They said they were looking at a 42-inch diameter pipeline that would carry up to 3½ billion cubic feet of gas a day and would have five off-takes along the route. The gas treatment plant would be on the North Slope, and the footprint of the liquefaction plant would be 400 to 600 acres. There was no word on where the terminus might be. Parnell last year set a series of benchmarks aimed at jolting alive the seemingly stalled project. The North Slope’s three major players — Exxon Mobil, BP and ConocoPhillips — and TransCanada agreed to pursue a liquefied natural gas project that would be capable of overseas exports, and in October released some details along with a timeline for work and decision-making on what a project that could cost more than $65 billion. In their letter, the companies reiterated their desire for a “competitive, predictable and durable oil and gas fiscal environment.” They said that “will be required for a project of this unprecedented scale, complexity and cost, to compete in global energy markets.” That is one of the issues the companies have said they want addressed by the end of the next phase, which would include preliminary engineering and a financing plan. Parnell’s next benchmark is for the companies to finalize an agreement to move into that next stage by spring, and to have a full summer of field work. Alaskans have long hoped for a gas line as a way to create jobs, provide more reliable energy and shore up revenues as oil production declines. Given the history, Parnell said in an interview that he understands people might “cast a bit of a skeptical eye” when hearing about progress on a line that has yet to transpire. “But at this point, they (the companies) have done everything I’ve asked when it comes to moving the project forward, meeting the benchmarks. I think Alaskans should be encouraged in that,” he said. Larry Persily, federal coordinator for Alaska gas pipeline projects, said the companies probably aren’t moving fast enough for the public. “Alaskans are frustrated and eagerly looking for more specifics. I know I sound like a politician when I say it’s going to take time, but it’s going to take time,” he said. Persily said he doesn’t think the companies will fully commit to the project until there is a tax structure in place for natural gas in the state that works for a project of this size. Parnell has proposed an overhaul of the Alaska’s oil tax structure, as a way of making Alaska more competitive and encouraging new production. The plan has gotten a lukewarm response from some lawmakers, but legislative leaders share his goal of boosting oil production and are studying changes to the system. Given that it is a shared priority, “I don’t expect legislators will go home (this session) without doing something to increase production of Alaskans’ oil for Alaskans,” he said. Last year, Parnell said that if the companies met his first round of benchmarks, the 2013 Legislature could take up gas tax legislation designed to move the project forward. Those benchmarks were met. Parnell said he doesn’t think an overall fiscal package will be worked out this year unless the companies are ready to make a final investment decision on the project. But he said there are things that might be addressed short of that, and that he has told the companies that Alaska is willing to take “commensurate, proportionate” steps with them to get a gas line done. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/15/companies-release-new-details-on-alaska-pipeline/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361115132072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 10:32:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361116371291-9</Id><Title>Deutschland über alles - real estate</Title><Msg>Target allocation: 61.5% UK target 5% cash euro funds target: 35% .....

CBC News of Canada was the first to pick up on this story on the 3rd of December 2012, and began their own investigation into the possible explanations behind this odd behaviour. CN Rail, the operator of the train, stated their innocence in the matter as they had only “received shipping directions from the customer, which, under law, it has an obligation to meet. CN discharged its obligations with respect to those movements in strict compliance with its obligations as a common carrier, and was compensated accordingly.” Even so, they still managed to earn C$2.6 million in shipping fees. During their investigation CBC managed to obtain an internal email which stated that the cars of the train were all reconfigured between each trip but that the cargo was never actually unloaded, because “each move per car across the border is revenue generated”, the sale of the cargo itself was inconsequential. The cargo of the train was owned by Bioversal Trading Inc., or its US partner Verdero, depending on what stage of the trip it was at. The companies “made several million dollars importing and exporting the fuel to exploit a loophole in a U.S. green energy program.” Each time the loaded train crossed the border the cargo earned its owner a certain amount of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), which were awarded by the US EPA to “promote and track production and importation of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.” The RINs were supposed to be retired each time the shipment passed the border, but due to a glitch not all of them were. This enabled Bioversal to accumulate over 12 million RINs from the 24 trips, worth between 50 cents and $1 each, which they can then sell on to oil companies that haven’t met the EPA’s renewable fuel requirements. Both the Canada Border Services Agency and the US EPA have launched investigations into the possibility of fraud, although the companies claim that the practice was totally legal.</Msg><Username>basherbuste_r</Username><Timestamp>1361143311158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 18:21:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361143392815-20</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is an obscene jerk</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340399751</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:19:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well how bout CCC would u like a meal at BK.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1361143392815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 18:23:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361149967022-21</Id><Title>Green groups rally on climate, urge Obama to reject Keystone project</Title><Msg>Green groups rally on climate, urge Obama to reject Keystone project By Zack Colman - 02/17/13 03:20 PM ET Environmental groups gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Sunday and marched on the White House for a climate change rally largely aimed at pressuring President Obama to reject the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline. Organizers said 35,000 activists attended the rally, where speakers portrayed the battle over the pipeline as a struggle between grassroots green groups and deep-pocketed special interests. “They’ve got the lobbyists. They’ve got the super-PACs. They made the campaign contributions. They’ve got this town in their pockets — they have got the situation under control. And then you show up. And then we show up. And we change the game,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told the crowd not long before it marched on the White House. Obama will decide whether the project goes forward because it crosses national boundaries. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More from The Hill: • States join battle over drone flights • Privacy advocates: Cybersecurity bill faces tough odds • Press corps: 'Frustration' over lack of access to Obama • Graham: Hagel disavowed remark on Israel, State Dept. • Defense industry focuses on minimizing sequester damage • Dems hold fire on climate change votes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The pipeline would bring fossil fuels from Canadian tar sands fields to the Gulf Coast. Environmentalists are painting Obama’s upcoming decision as the litmus test for whether he plans to make good on recent comments about tackling climate change. Activists at Sunday’s rally said approving the pipeline would taint Obama’s record on climate change. They said they hoped the demonstration would give the president the will to nix Keystone, even when a majority of both the House and the Senate want it built. “His heart is there. The question is can we change the politics enough so he can do what he knows is right. And I believe that he will,” Van Jones, a former Obama adviser, told The Hill. The politics surrounding the project are formidable. Blocking Keystone would play into Republican assertions that the president is scuttling a project that could enhance energy security and create thousands of jobs to appease environmental supporters. They have pressed the White House to green-light the pipeline. Oil-and-gas groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute, have helped lead a lobbying effort to get Keystone built. Canada also has tried to sway the administration into approving the pipeline, as it would benefit that nation's oil sands industry. Obama also has his own base to consider, as several union groups are eager for the jobs Keystone would bring to their members. The AFL-CIO’s building and construction trades division has endorsed the pipeline, and that department’s leader expects the full labor federation to lend its support. But there is no time to delay when it comes to climate change, Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s (NRDC) international program, told The Hill. “There is no deal to be done,” she said. “We need to do everything we can on every front.” That is why NRDC and other green groups also want Obama to pursue more stringent carbon emissions standards. The environmental community is pushing the White House to set emissions standards for existing power plants to build on proposed rules in Obama's first term that effectively barred construction of new coal-fired power plants. Greens also want Obama to forge ahead with clean-energy research and deployment on federal lands, measures to boost energy efficiency in homes, buildings and manufacturing and efforts to make coastal towns and cities more storm resilient. The green groups are focusing their pressure on Obama because of gloomy prospects for passing climate bills this Congress. Republicans will not accept fees on carbon emissions — the same goes for some conservative Democrats. In an interview with The Hill, Whitehouse said killing Keystone and pushing ahead with stronger regulations could jolt polluting industries into working on climate legislation. “That’s what’s going to bring them to the table very quickly,” Whitehouse said. “And as soon as the polluters want it, then obviously the Republicans are right there with them.” thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/283643-rally-of-35000-demands-obama-to-scrap-keystone-xl</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361149967022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 20:12:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361150028552-22</Id><Topic><Title>America's Healthcare Catastrophe</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1360940528349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:02:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we need Canadian style national health care.

It was primarily an update from the previous year with some direct and implied speculation about the future. Certainly nothing to cause for an 800% increase 2 days later. Looks a little suspicious for a pump and dump. Another thought is that there were a lot of large investment groups that were making large buys/sells on Friday; perhaps an accidental buy from a large investment group has occurred. I see some posts here that reference an "analyst" who has projected the price to go up. One post states a projected price of $1.25, and another indicates a price "projected to hit $2-3 range". Can't seem to find any recent analyst report online. No recent reports on a projected price. None of the posts reference where to find the analyst report and none of them reference who the analyst is.
