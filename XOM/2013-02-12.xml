Hydrous ethanol, used in flex fuel cars in Latin America’s largest economy, is trading at about 19 cents a pound, according to Lausanne, Switzerland-based Kingsman SA, which has provided sugar and biofuels research for more than 20 years. The price is 3 percent higher than raw sugar futures, which closed at 18.46 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York yesterday. Ethanol surpassed sugar for the first time since April 2011 on Feb. 7, said Beatriz Pupo, a Kingsman analyst. “If ethanol prices continue rising, millers may well prefer to produce ethanol and sell it in the domestic market, which will provide them with cash quicker,” Pupo said by phone from Montreal yesterday. The global sugar surplus that sent prices down the past two years may be eliminated within 18 months depending on the amount of cane that is used in Brazil for ethanol, Jonathan Drake, chief operating officer at RCMA Commodities Asia Ltd. and former head of sugar trading at Cargill Inc., said in an interview in Dubai on Feb. 4. Sugar futures climbed 1.8 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since Jan. 30. Currency Gains Millers in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer of sugar, convert cane into ethanol to sell mostly on the domestic market for reais or into the sweetener, which is largely sold overseas for dollars. The strengthening local currency, which has gained 4 percent against the greenback this year, the most among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, also diminishes the allure of exporting sugar. Brazil’s currency had fallen 22 percent between June 2011 and the end of last year. “The strengthening real is also making sugar exports less attractive in relation to ethanol as sugar is sold in dollars,” Pupo said. That would be another incentive for millers to make more ethanol, she said. Brazil Finance Minister Guido Mantega signaled a new ceiling for the real last week, saying in an interview with Reuters that the government will curb gains in the currency should it strengthen to 1.85 per dollar. Exchange-rate policy hasn’t changed and Brazil won’t allow speculative appreciation of the currency, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg on Feb. 8. Carnaval Holiday The real strengthened beyond 2 per dollar for the first time since July last month as Brazil exempted foreigners from a tax on real-estate funds traded on the stock exchange, encouraging speculation that inflows would sustain the currency. Trading in the real, which closed last week at 1.9727 per dollar, resumes tomorrow after the two-day Carnaval holiday. Should sugar prices remain below ethanol, millers in Brazil’s center south, the country’s main growing region, may direct 44 percent to 45 percent of their cane crop in the 2013- 14 season to making sugar, London-based futures and options broker Marex Spectron Group said in a report e-mailed yesterday. That’s down from 49.6 percent in the current season, data from Sao Paulo-based industry group Unica showed. “If prices remain below the parity during the peak of the center south Brazil harvest period (say June to September), then the mix could fall to about 44 percent to 45 percent and thus ‘lose’ some 4 million tons of sugar production,” Paul Bannister, the head of sugar brokerage at Marex Spectron, wrote in the report. Ethanol Tax Sugar may need to climb to 19.75 cents a pound to make it attractive enough for millers to favor the sweetener over ethanol should the government eliminate taxes on the biofuel, Marex Spectron estimates. Brazil is planning to reduce taxes on ethanol to stimulate domestic production and consumption of the biofuel, Trade and Development Minister Fernando Pimentel said in an interview with Valor Economico newspaper last week. “If there was to be a change in the taxes then, definitely, there is a substantial change in the outlook for sugar,” Tom McNeill, a director at Brisbane, Australia-based researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty., said by phone yesterday. Sugar is down 5.4 percent this year after falling 39 percent in 2011 and 2012 as supplies are set to outpace demand by 11.5 million tons in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, Kingsman estimates. The Standard &amp; Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities has climbed 4.8 percent this year and the S&amp;P index of 500 stocks is up 6.4 percent. Denatured fuel ethanol futures in Chicago, where corn is chief feedstock, has climbed 7.7 percent this year. The U.S. predominately makes ethanol from corn. Brazil’s center south sugar production may total 4 million tons to 7 million tons less than currently forecast should millers switch more production to ethanol, according to Green Pool. Sugar output in the region will be 36 million tons, according to a Feb. 4 estimate from Copersucar SA. A 20 percent increase in Brazil’s ethanol consumption would eliminate the sugar surplus, Ben Pearcy, chief development officer and managing director of sugar and bioenergy at White Plains, New York-based Bunge Ltd., said in an interview in London on Nov. 28. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-11/brazil-ethanol-topping-sugar-signals-millers-may-favor-biofuel.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360651954181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 01:52:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360658891321-2</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is the ultimate jerk !</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340612898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:23:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how does it feel to get #$%$ slapped commie runt?</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360658891321</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:48:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360658940074-3</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cause of nut job commies like u.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360658940074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:49:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360659043879-4</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a sniveling weasel</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340708573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:25:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do u know who your mother is, forget about your father.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360659043879</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:50:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360659116750-5</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is an obscene jerk</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340399751</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:19:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sucks to be u and be poor.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360659116750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:51:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360659192718-6</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a bonafide COWARD</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340542136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:22:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why cant u get a thumbs up cause u r to F up.

Posted on 02/12/2013 by Dan Haugen (Photo by Phil Roeder via Creative Commons) The prospect for bipartisan energy policy was on the agenda last week in Washington. Former members of Congress spoke last Wednesday about restoring the “legacy of bipartisan support for renewable energy” at a policy forum organized by the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). The next day, the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank separately released a set of recommendations (pdf) endorsed by a task force of Republicans and Democrats for improving the nation’s electricity grid. The conversations around both events offer a few rays of hope that the heightened level of partisanship that’s bogged down the discussion of clean energy in recent years may be starting to fade. “I think there are some positive signs,” said Joe Kruger, energy and environment director for the Bipartisan Policy Center. Solyndra narrative fading The election is over, the economy is improving, and mainstream support for clean energy continues to grow. That said, any legislation faces a major hurdle in the House, where some conservative Republicans will still try to invoke Solyndra to slander any efforts to support renewables. Some conservative Republicans, but not all. That nuance was on display at the ACORE forum. Iowa Rep. Steve King, for example, receives consistently high marks from conservative groups, yet he broke with his party last year in the debate over extending the wind energy production tax credits. He explained his support for renewables at the ACORE event, as reported by Stephen Lacey for Greentech Media: “We’ve got to be a more reliable partner,” King said. “We do all of this [wind, solar, biofuels] and our country becomes more energy secure. … It’s the right thing to do.” Modest expectations In December, a Colorado Republican, Rep. Cory Gardner, and a Vermont Democrat, Rep. Peter Welch, announced a bipartisan energy efficiency caucus in the House. Another promising partnership has emerged in the Senate between Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican. Wyden chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Murkowski is the ranking Republican member. The senators in November announced their intentions to “set the tone” for collaboration and seek to address “pent-up demand” for energy legislation. Congress hasn’t passed a major energy bill since 2007. “Sen. Wyden and Sen. Murkowski are clearly looking for ways to work together,” said Richard Caperton, director of the clean energy investment program at the Center for American Progress. Caperton doesn’t expect “revolutionary concepts” to emerge from this Congress, but there could be progress on more familiar topics such as nuclear waste storage, hydropower siting, and natural gas exports. Phyllis Cuttino, director of the clean energy program at Pew Environment Group, has a similar forecast. Don’t expect an all-encompassing national energy bill, but there’s hope for some “smaller, common-sense bills,” she said. One example is the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act, which would extend a key fossil-fuel tax benefit to renewable energy projects. Murkowski is a co-sponsor of the bill, whose lead author is Democratic Sen. Chris #$%$ of Delaware. ‘A lot at stake here’ One possible explanation for this new cooperation is the growing competition U.S. cleantech companies face from abroad. The Pew Environment Group’s latest clean energy report frames the issue as a matter of American competitiveness. “I think people are coming to realize that there’s a lot at stake here,” Cuttino said. Shanelle Evens Montana, a legislative and regulatory affairs associate for EDF Renewable Energy, has noticed that change trickle up from the local and county level to the statehouse level. “I do think that [economic] message is starting to get out there, I would say in the last two years a lot more than it was before,” Evens Montana said. It’s a message that’s been embraced more quickly in some states — Iowa, for example — than others. And that should be expected, said Hank Habicht, a cleantech investor who co-moderated last week’s ACORE session on bipartisanship. Habicht is a managing partner at Sail Venture Capital, a cleantech finance and investment group with offices in Irvine, California; New Orleans; Washington, D.C. and Toronto. He said in an interview that many energy issues are more regional than partisan. “When you potentially have winners and losers, you need to understand that,” Habicht said. “If there is a geographic area that’s maybe losing jobs by virtue of a certain energy policy, the energy policy needs to, as much as possible, be mindful of that.” ‘Culture war’ over energy Mindfulness on its own, though, is unlikely to un-do the “Solyndra-fication” of the energy debate–conservative Republicans’ use of the company’s collapse as an indictment of all clean energy policies, especially those supported by President Obama. Cuttino said it’s possible a new energy secretary will reset the debate, if the new appointee is someone who wasn’t at the Energy Department during the time the Solydra loans were made. Grist’s David Roberts was less optimistic last May when he wrote that evidence, reason and “common-sense solutions” can’t help clean energy avoid being sucked into a partisan “culture war” over The American Way. “For the conservative base … the issue of energy is wrapped up in a way of life that they view as under threat from multiple directions,” Roberts wrote. Kruger of the Bipartisan Policy Center said he thinks there’s enough “convergence of interests” behind its electric grid recommendations that they could find traction. The report endorses a range of transmission reforms that would make it easier to integrate renewable power onto the grid. But they would also reduce power outages, which cost the U.S. economy $79 billion a year, according to a 2006 study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Rick Boucher, a former Democratic Congressman from Virginia who co-chaired the Bipartisan Policy Center electric grid project, was asked to comment on the prospects for transmission siting reform in Congress. “I’ve learned from long years of experience that that is a hazardous exercise,” he said. “I think members of Congress who I know well and who are very thoughtful and farsighted in the way they evaluate the national interests, are going to listen to the arguments. “I would say the prospects in Congress are good, and I’m sort of going to leave it at one word. I’m not going to put a percentage on it. It is going to be heavily debated, and this recommendation will not come without opposition.” midwestenergynewsDOTcom/2013/02/12/analysis-can-congress-compromise-on-clean-energy/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360693626150</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:27:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360694491873-23</Id><Title>Midwest grid operator expanding south, to ‘last frontier’ for renewables</Title><Msg>Midwest grid operator expanding south, to ‘last frontier’ for renewables Posted on 02/05/2013 by Dan Haugen MISO’s current territory is shown in green on this map, with Entergy in blue. (Image via MISO) The Midwest’s electricity grid operator later this year is expected to add more than 15,000 miles of transmission and 30,000 megawatts of generation to its system overnight — at midnight, to be precise, on Dec. 18. That’s the date MISO, pending a few remaining regulatory hurdles, will assume responsibility for operating the electric grid in much of Arkansas and Louisiana and parts of Texas and Mississippi. The area’s transmission has been run since the 1950s by Entergy, a group of southern utilities that was recently pressured by regulators to give up grid management and focus on power generation. MISO says its new scale and “footprint diversity” will help improve reliability and efficiency and save money, with annual benefits to existing member utilities exceeding $1.2 billion. Wind energy advocates are also hopeful the integration could pave the way for grid and policy changes to help clean energy reach one of the “last frontiers” for renewables: the Southeast. Cost disputes Entergy’s integration into MISO follows decades of lawsuits over how each state’s ratepayers should share the cost of transmission and generation projects. Arkansas utility regulators, who thought their state’s residents were unfairly subsidizing costs for Louisiana ratepayers, threatened to prevent Entergy Arkansas from recovering certain costs if it didn’t study options for changing its relationship with the other Entergy companies. Cost-benefit studies showed that having all of Entergy join MISO would be preferable to Entergy Arkansas managing its own transmission, or to joining the Southwestern Power Pool, another regional transmission organization like MISO. Utility regulators in Arkansas and Mississippi have signed off on the transfer, as has the New Orleans City Council. Louisiana and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission still need to approve the arrangement. If all goes as planned, by the end of the year generators will be bidding daily on MISO’s market to sell Entergy customers the lowest-cost electricity, a change that’s expected to save Entergy customers $1.4 billion in the first decade. ‘Advantages to both sides’ MISO’s existing utilities expect to see savings as well. MISO will have some new costs associated with the expansion, but operating costs will be spread out among more utilities after the Entergy companies join. Meanwhile, seasonal differences between the two sections will give MISO new options for meeting peak demand and balancing the grid, said Todd Hillman, MISO’s vice president of customer and stakeholder relations. For example, in early summer when the windows are open in Minnesota but air conditioners are already running in Louisiana, there will be potential to use excess generation capacity in the Midwest to meet cooling demand in the south. “The ability to have some diversity there and flow megawatts between the two regions will be an advantage to both sides,” Hillman said. The two regions have different generation mixes, too. Coal makes up the largest share in the current Midwest footprint, while oil and gas are dominant in the Entergy region. Opportunity for renewables? The Entergy footprint currently has no significant renewable power on its grid. Sixty-nine percent of its power comes from oil and gas, 20 percent from nuclear, and 11 percent from coal. The MISO integration improves the prospects for being able to export Great Plains wind to the region, but not until new transmission lines and new policies are place, according to Beth Soholt, executive director of Wind on the Wires, a nonprofit that works on wind and transmission issues (and a member of RE-AMP, which publishes Midwest Energy News). “We have a number of years of groundwork to do before we can probably see something significant happen,” Soholt said. The main interconnection between the MISO and Entergy areas is a 1,000 megawatt transmission line in New Madrid, Missouri. Other routes exist that would require paying fees to other utilities or grid operators. There also aren’t renewable portfolio standards to drive demand for clean energy in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, or any of their neighbors to the east, making the Southeast one the “last frontiers” for renewables, Soholt said. Other priorities Soholt said MISO’s market tools have been a game-changer for renewables in the Midwest, allowing wind farms to bid against fossil fuel power plants to provide utilities with the lowest cost electricity to meet the next day’s forecasted demand. While much of MISO’s planning work in recent years has focused on finding ways to move more wind power from the western plains to cities in the east, the organization is mostly agnostic about electricity sources. “For us, it’s not so much that it’s wind but that it’s low-cost generation,” Hillman said. “[Wind] will have equal opportunity to compete, based on the market rules and the transmission system.” Planning is already underway on how to improve the transmission infrastructure in the Midwest, in the Entergy area, and combined, he said. MISO will be proposing projects aimed at mitigating congestion and improving reliability and efficiency. Through discussions on those proposals and other issues, the MISO expansion might also lead to more cross-pollination of policy ideas between the northern and southern areas, Hillman said. “It opens up a lot of new possibilities,” Soholt said. “There’s just a lot of work to be done.” This entry was posted in News and tagged MISO, transmission, wind by Dan Haugen.

An Energy Department (DOE)-commissioned study released in December occupies center stage in the export discussion. The study concluded that the U.S. economy stood to gain from sending more liquefied natural gas (LNG) abroad, though it would raise domestic prices minimally. Both Republicans and Democrats agreed Tuesday that enhanced exports invited economic opportunity, adding how to reach the right amount required further investigation. Some of the most vocal cheerleaders of expanding exports — largely Republicans and some business groups — say shipping more LNG overseas would create jobs, encourage more natural-gas drilling and bring revenues to the federal government. They also say the application process and energy markets will naturally restrain exports by filtering out less serious developers, keeping domestic price jumps modest. “I think we also need to include within this discussion an understanding of the role the market forces will play not only on domestic prices but on the number of projects that may actually be built,” committee ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Tuesday. Still, some Democrats — including committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) — were more skeptical. They instead hoped of finding a middle ground between a major increase and current export activity. "Let's look before we leap," Wyden told reporters after the hearing. He was noncommittal on whether hitting that "sweet spot" would require legislation. Those Democrats, along with some manufacturers, contend exporting too much LNG would raise domestic natural gas prices. They say that would undercut a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. “Instead of a manufacturing renaissance, major gas consumers could find themselves hit hard with energy price hikes and forced to sideline job-creating efforts,” Wyden said in his opening remarks. Currently, DOE reviews all LNG export applications to ensure they are within the public interest. Deals with nations that have a free-trade agreement with the United States get approval more easily than those that don’t. Those pushing for a lighter touch on exports want to ease restrictions for countries that lack a free-trade agreement with the U.S. Some of those nations, such as Japan, are seeking U.S. natural gas. A bipartisan group of senators has backed legislation that would permit LNG exports to NATO allies and Japan, even if they don’t have a free-trade pact with the U.S. Republicans and industry groups said Tuesday that several factors would check an unfettered expansion of exports, helping to keep price hikes small. Oil-and-gas firms say processing costs from converting natural gas into its transportable, liquefied form would eat at profit margins. That will likely subdue much of the initial export interest, they say. Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), noted Tuesday that while DOE is weighing 16 export applications, the next step — going through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — is more costly for prospective exporters. Eisenberg, whose group supports boosting exports, said few applicants would go through that process. That second stage would require developers to strike a contract with a buyer and conduct an environmental impact statement, among other measures. The natural-gas price gap between the U.S. and Asia also is likely to close in the long term, which should temper some of the export frenzy, Kenneth Medlock, a professor at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said in testimony. Still, Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical, urged a “cautious approach” on expanding exports. He, like Wyden said and as Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) — who opposes exporting more natural gas — hinted Tuesday, argued the DOE-commissioned study used outdated information that understated domestic natural-gas demand. Liveris’ firm has been at the forefront of advocating export restraint out of concern for price increases. He said Tuesday that lawmakers should be mindful of speculators looking to bank on LNG. “We should not let the market … set the price domestically,” Liveris said Tuesday. Wyden said he was looking for an environmental and economic “sweet spot” on exports. Wyden noted the need to balance the jobs potential of LNG exports with possible domestic price increases and concerns about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the drilling method credited with driving the U.S. energy boom. Fracking involves injecting a high-pressure combination of water, sand and chemicals into shale rock to tap natural gas and oil. Environmentalists and some Democrats worry about the amount of heat-trapping methane the drilling method releases into the air, and also fear the process contaminates drinking water. Meeting new natural-gas demand from boosting exports would largely be met by ramping up fracking, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That has alarmed green groups and some Democrats. Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Tuesday that the U.S. “lacks those safeguards” necessary to protect the public from fracking. Industry and many lawmakers contend fracking is safe. They also point to the effect inexpensive natural gas has had on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as power plants have turned to that energy source rather than coal. The abundant supplies of natural gas would not be possible without fracking, its backers note. And while many Democrats have pushed for federal rules governing the practice, industry and Republicans want the states to control fracking. “NAM believes states should continue to be the main regulators of this industry and is concerned that reactive federal regulation could harm any potential gains resulting from increased exploration of shale oil and gas,” Eisenberg said in written testimony. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/282523-senate-energy-committee-lawmakers-search-for-sweet-spot-on-natural-gas-exports</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360696688699</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:18:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360697208218-25</Id><Title>CNOOC-Nexen deal wins key U.S. regulatory approval</Title><Msg>CNOOC-Nexen deal wins key U.S. regulatory approval Tue Feb 12, 2013 10:24am EST CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - U.S. regulators approved the $15.1 billion takeover of Canadian oil and gas company Nexen Inc by China's state-owned CNOOC, removing the final hurdle to the Asian country's largest-ever foreign takeover. Calgary, Alberta-based Nexen said on Tuesday the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had given the final green light needed for the acquisition. It expects the deal to close in the week of February 25, seven months after China's top offshore oil and gas producer made its bid of $27.50 per share. Nexen shares climbed to just below the bid price soon after North American markets opened, rising 2.1 percent to $27.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the highest level for the shares since CNOOC bid for Nexen on July 23 last year. The acquisition gives CNOOC new offshore production in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and off western Africa and producing properties in the Middle East, as well as in Canada. CNOOC gains control of Nexen's Long Lake oil sands project in Canada's oil-rich province of Alberta and billions of barrels of reserves in the world's third-largest crude storehouse. Canada approved the contentious takeover late last year despite misgivings from members of the ruling Conservative Party concerned about China's human rights record. But Canada also insisted this was the last deal of its kind that it would approve, drawing a line in the sand against state-controlled companies taking majority stakes in the strategic oil sands. U.S. approvals, needed because of Nexen's Gulf of Mexico holdings, were slower as legislators examined whether the deal would threaten U.S. national security. The United States has traditionally been more wary than Canada of Chinese investment, prompting some speculation that Washington might want Nexen to dispose of the U.S. assets. Nexen did not indicate in its release whether CFIUS had imposed conditions on the approval and the company was not immediately available for comment. In 2005, the United States blocked CNOOC's bid for Unocal Corp because of national-security concerns. An influential House committee last year urged U.S. companies not to do business with Chinese telecommunications firms such as Huawei and ZTE for fears that China could use equipment made by the two to spy. caDOTreutersDOTcom/article/businessNews/idCABRE91B0SU20130212?sp=true</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360697208218</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:26:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360697705811-26</Id><Title>Big Reasons to Increase Ethanol Blends: Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM)</Title><Msg>Big Reasons to Increase Ethanol Blends: Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) By The Motley Fool in News Published: February 12, 2013 at 11:17 am The United States produced more than 13 billion gallons of corn ethanol in 2012 and is expected to produce a similar total in 2013. Where does it all go? Some is exported to Brazil and the European Union, but most goes into our fuel tanks. According to the Energy Information Administration, Americans burned 134 billion gallons of gasoline that contained 12.87 billion gallons of ethanol in 2011. Those figures would place the average ethanol content (by volume) of a gallon of gasoline sold in the United States at about 9.6%. The good news is that the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, has successfully met its goal of displacing 10% of gasoline consumption. The bad news is that the country has bumped up against the dreaded Blend Wall, or a saturated market for ethanol. It is bluntly obvious that the current RFS cannot provide the help domestic producers urgently need. Luckily, one quick fix is at the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) disposal: a simple increase in ethanol blends from 10% to 15%. In 2011 the EPA even approved E15 for use in car models from 2001 onward but failed to enact proper labeling requirements for blenders -- effectively dismissing the idea. Here are four reasons action is desperately needed. 1. Economic catalyst When the RFS became law in 2005, it was easy for critics to muffle the optimism for a future ethanol industry. Some critics viewed government involvement in biofuels as a death sentence, not to mention the "outrageous" goals of replacing any sizable amount of the country's oil imports, which were then at an all-time high. By the end of 2012 -- a mere seven full years later -- the ethanol industry evolved from a marketplace dependent on government policies into one being held back by them. Irony kills. Renewable Fuels Association CEO Bob Dinneen spoke sharply to critics of the industry in his annual address at the National Ethanol Conference last week. According to the RFA, the ethanol industry supported more than 382,000 total jobs, contributed $43 billion to GDP, and saved American consumers $30 billion in income in 2012. 2. Capacity trumps production Domestic producers are operating at less than 88% capacity, with few destinations -- or incentives -- for extra production. Given current market conditions, the operational capacity is expected to fall further, as facilities react to corn inventories decimated by last year's drought. Leading producers such as POET and Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are just two companies raising prices or idling capacity. At last count the number of idled facilities stood at 34, up from just 26 in September. Thanks to the lack of sugar feedstock, last August was the first month since December 2009 in which the country experienced a net import of ethanol. Although net imports are expected to continue until corn production rallies this summer, the idling acts as a positive feedback that will compound the overcapacity problem. Archer Daniels Midland, POET, and BioFuel energy are all taking advantage of slower production to upgrade several facilities. The enhancements will not only allow sorghum to be used in lieu of corn but will also increase efficiency and therefore capacity. 3. Predatory overseas markets In 2011, export revenues hovered near $1 billion -- an explosive turnaround from the nearly $1.6 billion in imports in 2006. Higher sugar prices in Brazil served as a major driving force in domestic ethanol's attractiveness, which quickly became the world's lowest-cost biofuel in 2011. Now the American ethanol industry is in danger of losing international competitiveness that took years to build. Brazil and Europe haven't exactly been shy about kicking Uncle Sam while he's down, either. Several European countries have proposed tariffs on American ethanol imports, while Brazil has fought back into the Lower 48 supply chain. In a strange reversal of fortunes, overpriced Brazilian ethanol is now more competitive than its cheaper domestic rival. What gives? Rather than institute a temporary mandate protecting domestic producers, the EPA has sat idly by, all the while qualifying Brazilian ethanol imports as advanced fuel. Leaders at the National Ethanol Conference voiced their concerns that domestic corn ethanol wouldn't be able to make up lost ground even when the market improves. Share prices of sugar behemoths Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) and Cosan Limited (NYSE:CZZ) seem to agree, as each has soared in the past year on higher demand for sugar sweeteners and an improving outlook for Brazilian ethanol. If the world closes its doors to American ethanol, then producers are likely to suffer further in an even more saturated market. 4. Cellulosic capacity poised to soar Corn ethanol production is capped at 15 billion gallons per year under the current RFS, which, given land and irrigation constraints, is a good ceiling. A problem arises when you consider that the same mandate calls for 16 billion gallons per year of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. Increasing fuel economy and engine constraints will make it impossible for the United States to consume all of the proposed 31 billion gallons of ethanol each year. That would represent 23% of 2011 gasoline volumes, which will only increase with the new CAFE standards as American automobiles use decreasing amounts of gasoline. This, of course, means that American ethanol exports will be a major factor in international markets and serves as yet another reason for the United States to stand up to Brazil and Europe. KiOR Inc (NASDAQ:KIOR) is just one company changing the ethanol landscape. To be fair, the company produces drop-in cellulosic gasoline and diesel -- not ethanol. However, the company's fuels will be blended with traditional petroleum fuels until guidelines for novel fuels are hammered out. KiOR's first facility will reach full capacity of 11 million gallons per year in 2013, with another 35 million gallon facility scheduled for completion in 2014. Through catalyst upgrades, the two facilities could reach annual capacities of 18 million gallons and 55 million gallons, respectively. It may not seem like much, but the company estimates that it could realize a profit of nearly $2 per gallon of fuel within a few years. How? Renewable identification numbers, or RINs, are bought and sold with renewable fuels, so the EPA can ensure that refiners are meeting their blending requirements. As long as market demand exists, RINs add value for producers such as KiOR. In total, the company estimates that the top 10 oil refiners will be required to buy $74.1 billion of renewable fuels under the current RFS. Foolish bottom line The industry has fallen on hard times, but it's poised for at least another decade of tremendous growth. Since most cars in the United States can run on E15 blends, there is no excuse for inaction. Not enough to convince you? Consider: If displaced barrels of oil are taken into account, then ethanol exports provided the United States with a $54.3 billion trading surplus in 2011. Tough to ignore when you put it like that. insidermonkeyDOTcom/blog/4-big-reasons-to-increase-ethanol-blends-archer-daniels-midland-company-adm-61243/?singlepage=1</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360697705811</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:35:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360707918097-27</Id><Topic><Title>The left on the run in Europe....</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1360504839690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 09:00:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is wrong with you and your tired ".........you're a racist......" name calling?

The spread expanded 3.91 cents to 66.33 cents a gallon, the widest since Sept. 28, on concern that ethanol’s 9 percent jump so far this year will open a spigot of Brazilian imports, displacing supply of the corn-derived domestic variety. “It does encourage the import side of things,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines, Iowa. “That’s the negative part of the market.” Denatured ethanol for March delivery decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.387 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The fuel’s surge to start 2013 is the biggest for this time of year since 2006, when the additive jumped 31 percent from the end of 2005 to Feb. 13, 2006. Gasoline for March delivery climbed 2.91 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.0503 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is blended with ethanol. Ethanol prices have risen as the industry has shut at least 19 plants to help drain a glut of the fuel and combat higher production costs, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group. The U.S. didn’t import any of the fuel in the week ended Feb. 1, the first such instance since Sept. 28, data from the Energy Information Administration show. Ethanol Imports In November, the most recent month available, the country imported 33,000 barrels of ethanol a day, the highest amount since September 2008, according to data from the Energy Department’s statistical agency. Brazil, where sugarcane is used to make the biofuel, is the biggest supplier of ethanol to the U.S., EIA data show. Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo cost $2.29 a gallon in the week ended today, up from $2.21 the previous week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and 3.8 percent cheaper than the current futures price. Ethanol industry advocates have criticized U.S. regulations that consider the Brazilian sugarcane-based variety superior to the domestic corn-made grade. The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as RINs, for advanced forms of ethanol, which includes Brazilian grade, rose to 56.5 cents yesterday, or more than double the worth of the conventional sort, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Crush Spread Ethanol companies have battled more expensive production costs in the face of higher corn prices in the wake of a drought in the Midwest that battered crops. Corn for March delivery dropped 6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $6.9625 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 14 cents a gallon, up from minus 16 cents yesterday, the highest level since June. “Margins have improved dramatically,” Blackford said. “They’re showing the weakness in production and they’re trying to respond to the plant closings.” Poet LLC, the second-biggest U.S. ethanol producer, Valero Energy Corp., the third-largest, and Abengoa SA, are among companies that have idled operations. Production in the week ended Feb. 1 rose 0.5 percent to 774,000 barrels a day from the previous week, the lowest level since the EIA began tracking weekly data for the biofuel in June 2010. Spot prices for ethanol fell in most regional hubs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol slipped 4 cents to $2.56 a gallon on the West Coast, the highest price in the nation. It fell 3 cents to $2.50 in New York, 1.13 cents to $2.40 in Chicago, and 1.5 cent to $2.445 on the Gulf Coast. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-12/ethanol-s-discount-to-gasoline-widens-as-gains-to-spur-imports.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360718104699</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 20:15:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360718184681-31</Id><Topic><Title>English real estate...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1359986412884</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:00:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>England is a cesspool of diversity, not unlike NYC</Msg><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1360718184681</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 20:16:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360727157131-32</Id><Title>Marco Rubio sweating like a pig</Title><Msg>because he lies like a dog make a deal with the devil and you will burn so let the sweat run while the flames nip</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1360727157131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 22:45:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360729992186-33</Id><Title>A pledge to fight global warming through executive action</Title><Msg>A pledge to fight global warming through executive action By Ben Geman - 02/12/13 09:21 PM ET President Obama used his State of the Union speech to offer a full-throated pledge to use executive actions to battle global warming if Congress won’t pass a major climate bill. His remarks at the Capitol Tuesday night commit Obama to a major second-term push on global warming using his administrative powers. “If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy,” Obama’s prepared remarks state. Obama, before vowing to use executive powers, clears his throat by urging lawmakers to act. He calls on Congress to create a “market-based solution” akin to the cap-and-trade that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) floated years ago. But such plans have essentially no chance of advancing in Congress. Obama, in the speech and a White House summary of his plans, is also floating some new energy proposals. One urges Congress to create a new “Energy Security Trust” to steer federal revenues from oil-and-gas development toward research into technologies to wean cars and trucks off oil, such as electric and natural gas-powered vehicles. A second urges creation of an “Energy Efficiency Race to the Top” for states, which would provide financial support for states that implement effective conservation policies. The speech touts Obama’s first-term actions, such as boosting auto mileage standards, but adds, “for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.” “Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense,” the speech states. “We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science – and act before it’s too late,” it states. But while spelling out some new energy plans, the speech does not describe other executive-level climate policies that the Environmental Protection Agency and other branches might undertake. The speech arrives as environmentalists are pushing Obama to use an array of executive actions to curb heat-trapping emissions and help the nation better prepare for climate change. Atop their list – but not mentioned in the speech – would be the EPA setting carbon emissions rules for existing power plants, which account for over a third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is moving ahead with setting standards for new power plants, regulations that would effectively be a nail in the coffin for efforts to build new coal-fired plants. But the agency has not yet acted to set carbon rules for existing plants, despite committing to crafting them in a 2010 settlement with a number of states and environmental groups. While carbon rules for existing plants are the biggest goal for green groups, advocates have also identified other steps the administration can take. They include more action to curb emissions of methane (a potent greenhouse gas) from natural gas development; continued programs to boost green power development on federal lands and through the Defense Department; Energy Department programs to improve energy efficiency in buildings and industrial plants, and others. The U.S., in international climate talks, has pledged to lower national greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. A February report by the World Resources Institute, a respected environmental think tank, found that the U.S. is lagging but can achieve the goal without new congressional action. “[I]t is clear the U.S. is not currently on track to meet its 2020 reduction pledge, however, this target is achievable through implementation of strong new federal measures to reduce emissions using existing legal authorities,” the report states, noting steps such as standards for existing plants and phasing out the use of certain hydrofluorocarbons. But the mid-century goal of an 83 percent emissions cut “appears unattainable” with existing federal authorities, and new legislation would eventually be needed, according to the report. Obama’s pledge to use executive action follows a first term that saw new climate policies and several stumbles. The administration greatly toughened auto mileage standards and steered tens of billions of dollars into green energy through the 2009 stimulus law, helping to drive growth in renewable power in recent years. But there were major setbacks, particularly on Capitol Hill. Cap-and-trade legislation collapsed in Congress in 2010, at a time when the White House had invested far more political muscle into healthcare reform and other priorities. In 2011, Obama used his State of the Union to propose a national “clean energy standard” that would force utilities to substantially increase power supplied from low-emissions sources. But that plan went nowhere on Capitol Hill and faded from the agenda. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/282697-obama-vows-executive-climate-push-but-many-specifics-remain-absent</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360729992186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 23:33:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
