She was arrested along with her son, Wes. Workers and their supporters have protested for months in an effort to save 170 jobs set to be lost to China by the end of the year. Last week, three were arrested for refusing to move out of the way of a truck leaving the Sensata plant. Sensata worker Mark Schreck, who wasn’t among those arrested, said his last day of work at the plant is scheduled to be Friday. He expects all employees to be finished working before Christmas. While Sensata workers in Freeport were holding their sit-in, a dual rally was being held at Sensata Technology Headquarters in Attleboro, Mass. Freeport Sensata workers Dot Turner, Cheryl Randecker and Kerr were on hand to request a meeting with company CEO Thomas Wroe, also asking for full severance packages for employees. According to Sensata worker and spokesperson Tom Gaulrapp, Turner was allowed to present a letter of workers’ requests at the plant in Massachusetts without incident but was unsure of the result.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350667008844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 13:16:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350669399712-10</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Chart Evaluation &amp; Sell Mention</Title><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1350302108811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 07:55:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>XOM made a new 53-month high this week at 93.67 but did not hit my stop loss at 93.79 and is now having a reversal.

Overall, GE’s quarterly earnings rose 8 percent. And excluding wind and the impact of foreign-currency exchange, infrastructure orders would have increased 4 percent, GE CEO Jeff Immelt said during the firm’s quarterly earnings call. The 2.2-cent per kilowatt-hour credit for wind power production that Immelt referenced in the call is scheduled to expire Dec. 31. GE’s performance reflected the wind industry’s concerns that letting the credit expire could reverse recent progress. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) said the credit drove much of the industry’s third-quarter growth. Installations of new wind electricity capacity rose by 1,833 megawatts during the quarter, the industry group announced Thursday. Installed capacity has increased 40 percent through the quarter compared with 2011, it said. Analysts predict a drop in wind installations for 2013 as private investors remain skittish about opening their pocketbooks, given the credit’s cloudy future. A $205 billion tax extenders package that awaits a Senate vote includes a one-year extension for the credit. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he is “very confident” the credit will pass the Senate. The House has yet to seriously discuss the credit. Military veterans who work in the wind industry pleaded their case for an extension with House Ways and Means Committee Republicans in a series of meetings on Thursday. For the most part, resistance to extending the credit rests with Republicans. They have called the credit unwise, saying it permits government intervention in energy markets. Many also want to hold out for a broader revision of the federal tax code. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said he opposes extending the credit, while President Obama supports it. Obama has tried to turn Romney’s position on the issue into a political liability in wind-heavy swing states such as Iowa and Colorado. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350672433255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 14:47:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350673284495-15</Id><Topic><Title>R money--Ryan home states</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1350666463031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 13:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"prez candidate did NOT carry his own state AFTER being its governor??" if you could read a lil better perhaps you could comprehend better?? just because McGOVERN was his name--he was not a governor poor sarah</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1350673284495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 15:01:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350673891868-16</Id><Topic><Title>Another Glen Beck Fan Off The Streets...

The “perspective” piece notes that while the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is likely to address the third major challenge facing healthcare — expanding coverage to uninsured Americans — the goals of addressing costs and quality “remain aspirations and promises” without much else in the way of detailed provisions or proposals. “Although the ACA expands coverage, it ignores the structural problems in the organization and reimbursement of care — a limitation that is disappointing but not surprising,” said the editorial’s author Gail R. Wilensky, an economist and a senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international health education foundation. “Adding more people to the insurance rolls is politically and technically easier than finding a way to ensure that care is effective, high-quality, and affordable for both the recipients and taxpayers.” Wilensky said Obamacare’s primary accomplishment is likely to be that some 30 million previously uninsured people may end up with coverage — about half through new state insurance exchanges and the other half through Medicaid expansions.” But she argues the law's controversial individual mandate — requiring all Americans to have insurance coverage or to pay a penalty tax of several hundred dollars — may instead encourage people to postpone buying insurance until they need it. That’s because insurers will not be able to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or charge them higher rates. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has projected about 11-12 million Americans will be subject to the individual mandate’s penalties — and half will simply opt to pay the tax. “The penalty for not having insurance is very small, particularly for younger people with modest incomes,” Wilensky noted. “Given the choice, many people may put off buying insurance to save thousands of dollars in premium payments” The NEJM editorial also criticize other aspects of Obamacare and suggests more market-based approaches, such as those proposed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. (and vice-presidential candidate) Paul Ryan (R-WI), would more effectively reform the nation’s healthcare system. Among the other KEY points of the editorial: FEE-FOR-SERVICE: Despite widespread recognition that fee-for-service reimbursement rewards doctors and providers for the quantity of healthcare services delivered and not high quality, Obamacare does little to change reimbursement strategies now used in Medicare. “Much of the coverage expansion is financed through Medicare budget savings, which are produced by reducing the fees paid by Medicare to institutional providers such as hospitals, home care agencies, and nursing homes,” Wilensky noted, “but using the same perverse reimbursement system currently in place.” PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS: Obamacare contains no reform of the way physicians are paid for some 800 specific services, which is “the most dysfunctional part of the Medicare program,” she argued. “This system rewards the provision of highly reimbursed services without consideration of whether clinicians are providing low-cost, high-value care for patients.” MEDICARE CUTS: Obamacare provides Medicare “productivity adjustments,” but unless these institutions find ways to reduce costs, lower Medicare reimbursements will force providers to bargain for higher payments from private insurers. “Eventually, seniors' access to services will be threatened,” she said. “The Medicare actuary expects that 15 percent of institutional providers will lose money on their Medicare business by 2019, and the proportion will increase to 25 percent by 2030.” FEW QUALITY PROVISIONS: Although some reforms are included in the law, such as value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations (ACOs), that could drive up quality while holding down costs, she said the amount providers will be paid are small and not likely to lead to many changes. NO MARKET-BASED REFORMS: Like Medicare, Obamacare relies on regulatory methods, instead of harnessing market forces, to promote spending reductions and improve quality of care. If that approach fails, the law authorizes an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce payments to clinicians and institutions. Although Congress can override the IPAB's recommendations, it can do so only by a three-fifth’s “super majority,” and only if it acts within a limited time and comes up with comparable savings. “What is needed are reforms that create clear financial incentives that promote value over volume, with active engagement by both consumers and the healthcare sector,” she added. “Market-friendly reforms require empowering individuals, armed with good information and non-distorting subsidies, to choose the type of Medicare delivery system they want.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350675869414</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 15:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350677742523-20</Id><Title>Any Market Players Here?</Title><Msg>Are there any market players here?

Venture capitalist firms exist for this very reason, and they choose what to invest in by looking at companies’ business models and deciding if they are worthy. When the government plays venture capitalist, it tends to reward companies that are connected to the policymakers themselves or because it sounds nice to “invest” in green energy. The 2009 stimulus set aside $80 billion to subsidize politically preferred energy projects. Since that time, 1,900 investigations have been opened to look into stimulus waste, fraud, and abuse (although not all are linked to the green-energy funds), and nearly 600 convictions have been made."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350680368714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 16:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350681599174-22</Id><Topic><Title>Demoncrap Green Energy Scams Costing Taxpayers Billions</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350680368714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 16:59:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are right--I liked it a lot better when the "w" made the US postal service sponsor lance armstrong bicycle team--that was millions of tax dollars WELL spent--what a return on that investment</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1350681599174</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:19:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350683189058-23</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Receives Endorsement of Orlando Sentinel</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350617661523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:34:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I find it sorta strange how you pick/choose "newspapers" and whom they ENDORSE I wonder WHY did you NOT point out the "SALT LAKE TRIBUNE"--you know Utah and all the Mormon stuff--why did you NOT point out the Salt Lake Tribune ENDORSES Obama?? you know the olympics and adopted son stuff--I womder why--read and weep</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1350683189058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350683300110-24</Id><Title>Allen West</Title><Msg>unlike Obama, is a true black man, has slave blood, is a war hero, and should be THE first true black President of the USA someday.

The EPA’s limits on mercury, sulfur dioxide and other emissions will be “difficult to roll back,” said William Spence, chief executive officer of Allentown, Pennsylvania-based PPL Corp. He cited years of court cases over those regulations as one of the reasons. Among the rules that would be “on the fence” if Romney takes over the White House, Spence mentioned greenhouse-gas emission limits for new plants and coal-ash rules. PPL, which owns power plants in Kentucky, Montana and Pennsylvania, is “well equipped” to meet the EPA restrictions after spending $2.6 billion in Pennsylvania and $2.3 billion in Kentucky, Spence told reporters in Washington today. In the campaign, Romney has said he would eliminate regulations that stifle business growth and job creation. Donations from energy and natural-resource interests to Romney are four times higher than those to President Barack Obama’s campaign, according to opensecrets #, a Washington-based campaign finance watchdog group. “As an industry, I mean, if you look at how we’ve improved the air quality over the last decade or two, I don’t know the exact number, but it’s 60 to 70 percent improvement,” Spence said today. “I think it’s pretty darn good.” bloomberg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350689434821</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:30:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350691224406-30</Id><Topic><Title>The People Republicans Support Are Anything But Patriots</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350171682940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 19:41:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When Bush left the country was on the brink of depression.

The Post, which also backed Obama in 2008, wrote Friday: Romney notes correctly that North America is poised to become an energy exporter. But the drill-at-all-costs mantra he is pushing runs counter to the predominant view in Colorado, which is one that balances energy and environment — particularly when it comes to public land. And, unlike the Republican nominee, we believe our nation's energy portfolio must include government investment in renewable sources such as wind and solar — both of which can become sources of more power and more jobs in the future. The candidates are running a tight race for Colorado’s nine electoral votes. RealClearPolitics, a website that aggregates polling data, shows Romney with a 0.2-percentage-point lead. The wind industry employs between 4,000 and 5,000 people in Colorado, according to industry group the American Wind Energy Association. The group said losing the credit would kill 37,000 jobs nationwide, while extending it would preserve 75,000 jobs. Obama has sought to turn Romney’s opposition to that 2.2 cent per kilowatt-hour credit for wind power production into an albatross for the GOP challenger in Colorado. Colorado's Democratic Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet have urged Congress to extend the credit to preserve jobs, calling Vestas Wind Systems a cautionary example of what might happen without the incentive. The major wind turbine maker has pegged recent layoffs at a handful of its Colorado facilities on the uncertainty surrounding the expiring credit. Both candidates also have tried to portray themselves as friends of the natural-gas industry, which is thriving in Colorado. Obama often notes oil-and-gas production increased during his term, and has praised natural gas for providing a lower carbon-emitting energy alternative to coal. But Romney is quick to point out a bulk of the production increase has occurred on private and state lands. He wants to open drilling on federal lands that Obama has kept off-limits to further increase oil-and-gas development. Though Romney failed to grab the Post’s backing, he did pick one up in another battleground state, winning the endorsement of Florida’s Orlando Sentinel. That paper had backed Obama in 2008. RealClearPolitics shows Romney with a 2.6 percentage point lead in the race for Florida’s 29 electoral votes. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350697230305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 21:40:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350701385686-33</Id><Topic><Title>Sensata Technologies, A US Company, Profitable, Yet Bain Closing, Moving Jobs to CHINA</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350667008844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 13:16:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney's legacy is the actions Bain takes by taking over American Companies built by American Labor and outsourcing the operation overseas..
