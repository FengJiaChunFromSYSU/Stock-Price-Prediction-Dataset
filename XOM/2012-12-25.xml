(CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in the proposed Kitimat liquefied natural gas terminal from Encana Corp. (ECA) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG), joining the competition to ship the fuel from North America to Asian markets. Chevron will also acquire 50 percent of a pipeline serving the Canadian project and drilling rights for 644,000 acres in British Columbia’s Horn River and Liard basins, according to a statement from the San Ramon, California-based company today. It will operate the LNG terminal and pipeline, and project partner Apache Corp. (APA) will handle the acreage. Chevron joins Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd in pursuing gas exports from western Canada to Asian markets, where the heating and power plant fuel sells at a premium to North American prices. The Kitimat project has a license from Canadian regulators to export 10 million metric tons a year of the liquefied fuel. The involvement by Chevron in Kitimat LNG “elevates the probability of this project going ahead and expedites the timeframe,” said Daniel Cheng, a portfolio manager who helps oversee C$375 million ($378 million) at Matco Financial Inc. in Calgary, including Encana and EOG shares. “The partners in that project were stalling because they were having a hard time securing long-term, oil-linked price customers.” Chevron will probably pay a total of $1.3 billion, William Featherston, an analyst for UBS AG in New York, wrote in a note today. All of the companies involved declined to provide terms of the deal. LNG Costs Apache Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steven Farris estimated in March the Kitimat project would cost $15 billion, including the terminal, pipeline and investment in related drilling wells. The cost of building LNG terminals, which chill gas to -260 degrees Fahrenheit (-160 Celsius) to make it a liquid that can be shipped on tankers, has surged in recent years as competition for materials and workers has increased, James T. Jensen, president of Jensen Associates, said in a phone interview today. Apache is still completing the design process that will help develop cost estimates, Paul Wyke, a spokesman for the Houston-based company, said in an e-mail today. Chevron hasn’t set a schedule for a final investment decision on the projects or for when exports will begin, Gareth Johnstone, a company spokesman, said in a phone interview. Chevron and Apache are already partners in the Wheatstone LNG export project in Australia. Chevron also is developing the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, an effort that may cost as much as A$52 billion ($54 billion) and begin first shipments in 2015. Australian Competition “The British Columbia projects are trying very hard to compete with Australia,” Jensen said. “The fact that Chevron is getting in suggests that they’ve found it interesting compared to what else they have.” The Kitimat project is 400 miles (650 kilometers) north of Vancouver. The Pacific Trail pipeline would stretch 290 miles, connecting the terminal to a pipeline system owned by Spectra Energy Corp. (SE) The project “is ideally situated to meet rapidly growing demand for reliable, secure and cleaner-burning fuels in Asia, which are projected to approximately double from current levels by 2025,” Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in the statement. The transaction, subject to approval from Canadian regulators, is expected to close by the end of March. Apache Net The Horn River and Liard shale basins hold an estimated 50 trillion cubic feet of potential gas, Farris said in a separate statement today. Apache expects to net about $400 million on the transaction, according to the statement. It will sell a 50 percent stake in the Liard acreage to Chevron for $500 million and pay Chevron to raise its stake in the terminal, the pipeline and the other producing areas to 50 percent from 40 percent. “Chevron is the premier LNG developer with longstanding relationships in key Asian markets,”Farris said. Both EOG and Encana held 30 percent stakes in the Kitimat project. Apache said it and Chevron will explore sales of stakes in the terminal and acreage to customers. EOG, based in Houston, is selling to focus on onshore crude oil production, “which is generating more immediate reinvestment opportunities,” Chairman and CEO Mark Papa said in a separate release. K Leonard, a spokeswoman for the company, didn’t immediately return voicemail messages seeking comment. ‘Global Player’ For Encana, Canada’s largest gas producer, “we do not have former experience in LNG projects and Chevron does,” Jay Averill, a spokesman for the Calgary-based company, said by phone today. “Bringing in a global player like Chevron, which does have the experience and the financial ability to bring this to fruition, takes the project to the next step.” Chevron fell 1 percent to close at $108.63 in New York. Apache dropped 1.7 percent to $78.68 and EOG dropped 0.7 percent to $122.77. Encana declined 2.3 percent to C$19.66 in Toronto. Chevron was “one of a fairly short list of natural buyers,” Menno Hulshof, an analyst at TD Securities in Calgary, said in a note to clients today. RBC Capital Markets acted as financial adviser for Apache, Encana and EOG on the Horn River acreage sale. Exxon Mobil Corp.

Farms are growing willow shrubs and selling them to a utility, a nursery sells them commercially and plans are being made for refineries. "The industry has a lot of potential," said Robert McDonagh, owner of Celtic Energy Farm in Cape Vincent on Lake Ontario, which was formed by a group of investors a few years ago to grow shrub willow in northern New York as a renewable energy source. The farm owns or rent 1,100 acres where it grows willow to supply ReEnergy, a renewable energy producer with power plants in northern New York and several other states. "The biofuel industry is in its infancy; we're in on the ground floor," McDonagh said. A 2007 federal law established the National Renewable Fuel Standard with a production target of 36 billion gallons of biofuel per year by 2022. It also requires that biofuels reduce greenhouse gases 50 to 60 percent compared with petroleum-based fuel. With a typical yield of five dry tons per acre per year, 800 acres of willow could produce one megawatt of electricity, enough for 750 homes for one year, said Timothy Volk, a researcher at SUNY's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. Economic models predict willow cultivation would create 4.5 to eight jobs per thousand acres, he said. Because of its rapid growth, willow produces eight times as much yield per acre as a typical Northeastern forest, said Larry Smart, an associate professor of horticulture at Cornell University. "One of the really important factors with these energy crops is finding the right place on the landscape to use them," said Tom Richard, a biofuels researcher at Penn State. "Willow is very well adapted to our region. We're looking to place energy crops where they can provide maximum environmental benefits and minimal effect on food crops." Willow grows well on land that's not suitable for other crops. Because it has deep roots and is perennial, it's more tolerant of flooding and drought than annual crops are, Richard said. To promote planting of fuel crops to meet the 2022 target, a group of universities, businesses and government agencies formed a group that's working on two commercial-scale refineries that will produce gasoline and diesel fuel from willow and other biomass. This year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture invested $4.3 million to encourage the growth of shrub willow as a renewable energy fuel in central and northern New York. Landowners must have at least 100 acres available and have a contract to sell the harvested and chipped willow wood to ReEnergy. Development of shrub willow for bioenergy began in Sweden in the mid-'70s. New York researchers started breeding it as a fuel crop suitable for the Northeast and Midwest in the mid-'90s but before it could become a viable crop for large-scale production, researchers had to breed varieties that were resistant to beetles and diseases and provided a high yield per acre. Smart has developed varieties that are now commercially available through Double A Willow, a plant nursery in Fredonia in western New York. The 20-foot-tall, multi-stemmed willow bushes are ready to harvest in about three years and provide repeated harvests over 25 years. Willow is also being grown on a smaller scale to heat institutional buildings at Colgate University in central New York, Cornell's Finger Lakes campus and Middlebury College in Vermont. Several companies have built plants to process different types of liquid biofuel from woody plant material, including willow. "The price is going to drop as more commercial plants are built," Richard said. Innovative willow-to-fuel technologies will develop faster when the supply of willow increases, McDonagh and fellow investors in the Celtic Energy Farm believe. "If there's a crop in the ground and available, the projects will come," McDonagh said. "We won't really know for 10 to 15 years." New York state could dedicate up to 1.7 million acres of non-forest land to growing bioenergy crops such as willow, estimated Volk. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 190 million acres of land in the United States could be used to produce energy crops. auburnpubDOTcom/willow-energy-comes-of-age/article_ebcdfb82-99dd-518a-b0f9-a0fa24a1d8f9.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356447701624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 10:01:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356448565094-15</Id><Topic><Title>Should you keep from XOM ?

The oil &amp; gas and the renewable fuels industries find themselves in unfamiliar waters, as it happens. For years, renewable fuels developers have spoken in terms of the long-term promise, while the petroleum industry points to actual refining projects and steel in the ground. Today, it is the oil &amp; gas industry talking in terms of huge promise from new feedstocks, and new refineries that would require massive investment in capacity building and quite possibly a wholesale rethinking of fuel infrastructure. Take for example Sasol’s staggering new $19B GTL project in Louisiana, expected to be ready by 2017. Today, it is the renewable fuels movement that wigwagging furiously, pointing to project developers, a splash of new refining projects, and steel in the ground. Take today as a case in point. It’s supposed to be a dead time for commercial news, as attention turns towards the holiday season. But no less than four major announcements regarding advanced projects in renewable fuels and feedstocks came out. It’s been a year of dire headlines in government spending, renewable fuel mandates and so on, but maybe we’re seeing the old switcheroo — no mere candle at the end of the tunnel, but a bank of kleig lights normally reserved for splashy Hollywood premieres. Four new projects in aviation fuels, road transport, and low-cost enzymes Renewable diesel in the EU. The EU awarded UPM a grant of €170 million for a solid wood-based biorefinery (BTL) project in Strasbourg, France, out NER300 funds – using the same technology that will be used at the Lappeenranta biorefinery, a wood-based renewable diesel, constructed without any public funding, that will produce renewable diesel out of crude tall oil, a residue of pulp production. The process is based on hydrotreatment and production will start in summer 2014. The grant follows on from a €199M grant to a Dutch biorefinery project from BioMCN and its collaborators, announced late last week. Neste to produce aviation biofuels. Also in the EU, Neste Oil has joined the Initiative Towards Sustainable Kerosene for Aviation (ITAKA) project, which is being funded by the EU to support the commercialization and use of renewable aviation fuel in Europe. Neste Oil’s role in the consortium will be to produce the renewable fuel used in the project. Neste Oil will produce a total of 4,000 tons of NExBTL renewable aviation fuel as part of the project, primarily from sustainably produced Spanish camelina oil, and possibly also used cooking oil. New plant-based enzyme from Infinite. In the US, in Arkansas, Infinite Enzymes announced that its IE-CBHI single activity, plant-based cellulase enzyme, is now available for R&amp;D projects. The Infinite Enzymes’ technology produces enzymes in a lower value part of the corn kernel thereby creating a new sustainable market for corn processing by-products. The technology lowers the cost of sugar production needed for developing low-cost biobased plastics and advanced biofuels. New aviation biofuels project in Illinois. Meanwhile, Paradigm BioAviation announced that it plans to build a $120 Million facility in Bloomington-Normal designed to transform municipal solid waste into green electrical power and alternative liquid fuels for the transportation and aviation industries. Construction is slated to begin in 2014, after completing the zoning and EPA permitting process in 2013. Production of green power is scheduled to start in 2015. Not enough? 16 more cellulosic biofuels projects happening in there here and now If that news is not enough to fill the space beneath your biobased Christmas tree — consider taking a look at the Advanced Ethanol Council’s: Cellulosic Biofuels: Industry Progress Report 2012-2013. It provides one of the most attractively-designed, concise guides to progress on 16 projects around the world. Projects include Abengoa, American Process, Beta Renewables, BlueFire, Clariant, Enerkem, Fiberight, Fulcrum, Inbicon, INEOS Bio, Iogen, KiOR, LanzaTech, Mascoma, POET-DSM, and ZeaChem. Unfortunatelly the report doesn’t cover projects outside of the SEC’s membership roster – so there’s no report on COFCO, DuPont, BP, BlueSugars/Petrobras, Solena, LS9, Amyris, Joule, Solazyme, or Sapphire Energy — to cite a few. But why quibble? It’s a valuable document well worth a read. biofuelsdigestDOTcom/bdigest/2012/12/20/the-old-switcheroo-the-now-of-cellulosic-biofuels-vs-five-years-away-in-oil-gas/ ---------------------------------------- Neste Oil joins European Union-backed aviation bio-fuel initiative EBR Staff Writer Published 20 December 2012 Finnish renewable fuel developer Neste Oil will join hands with the European Union (EU)-backed Initiative Towards Sustainable Kerosene for Aviation (ITAKA) project to promote the use of sustainable bio-fuels in aviation. A consortium of companies are currently taking part in the 36-month ITAKA project, funded through an EU grant of €10m under the EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (2007-2013). Companies that are part of the consortium include Neste Oil, Airbus, BIOTEHGEN, Camelina Company Espanã, CLH, EADS IW, Embraer, EPFL, MMU, SENASA, RE-CORD, and SkyNRG. Neste Oil will produce 4,000 tons of NExBTL renewable aviation fuel, produced from Spanish camelina oil and used cooking oil, for the project. Biofuel from the company will be blended 50:50 with conventional fuel and then supplied to European airlines for use on their commercial flights. The consortium will compile the necessary data on the use of renewable aviation fuel in areas including logistics and fueling. The project is aimed at commercializing renewable aviation fuel in Europe, in addition to advancing the goal of the European Aviation Biofuels Flightpath initiative to annually generate 2 million tons of the fuel by 2020. biofuelsandbiomassDOTenergy-business-reviewDOTcom/news/neste-oil-joins-european-union-backed-aviation-bio-fuel-initiative-201212</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356464087359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:34:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356464912408-29</Id><Title>Seattle Mayor Calls 4 Divesting City Pension Funds From Fossil Fuels</Title><Msg>Seattle Mayor Calls 4 Divesting City Pension Funds From Fossil Fuels By Stephen Lacey on Dec 23, 2012 at 9:23 am</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356464912408</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:48:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356465511169-30</Id><Title>The Great Purification</Title><Msg>"liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate… it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people." -Sec. of Treasury Andrew Mellon after 1929 crash. That was accomplished by raising taxes, the speculators were annihilated, and a firm basis was put in for economic growth. In Germany Heinrich Brüning's government did the same as was done in America. Taxes were increased massively, the rottenness was purged, and the economy turned on a dime. By the second half of 1932 the economy was growing rapidly, pulling up out of the hole caused by the speculators. The Nazis then came to power - on the back of the women's vote and the Catholic vote mostly - and just took credit for the economic boom that followed. High taxes were retained, and the government leveraged the taxes into new government spending. Germany was at full employment by 1935-1936... Conservative economic policies do work. What does not work is liberal policies such cutting taxes to fight recessions, borrowing money to fuel the flames of speculation caused by lower taxes, and monetary "easing" to try to foster growth. The rotteness still remains to be purged. The trillions in bad loans made to housing speculators still remain. The enormous commodity bubble driven up by the latest bout of monetary easing induced speculation still remains to be purged and flushed. The purification promises to be most severe.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356465511169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:58:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356470489575-31</Id><Topic><Title>The Great Purification</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356465511169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:58:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and the nazi bast---s were hung.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1356470489575</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 16:21:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356470961393-32</Id><Topic><Title>The Great Purification</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356465511169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:58:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"and the nazi bast---s were hung."

According to IRS data, the “richest 1% paid $84 billion more in taxes in 2007 than they had in 2000,” a 23% increase. In addition, their “share of the overall income tax burden grew, climbing from 37% in 2000 to 40% in 2007.” All this occurred even though their rates went down. The IRS numbers also found the bottom half of taxpayers “paid $6 billion less in income taxes in 2007 than they had seven years earlier,” which is a 16% decrease, and “their share of the total income tax burden actually went from 3.9% to 2.9%.” Further, as Investors Business Daily noted, the Bush tax cuts also pushed millions of people off of the tax rolls entirely because Bush “doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and lowered the bottom rate to 10%.”</Msg><Username>willstand99</Username><Timestamp>1356486325281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 20:45:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356489621302-38</Id><Topic><Title>we want reparations from the whites!</Title><Username>demsenate4obama</Username><Timestamp>1356410342375</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 23:39:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, there are more poor white folks than black.
