German bio-refining technology will allow the region’s forests to be harnessed to the production of liquid fuels and plastics. Places such as Charleston, Savannah, and Wilmington will benefit from that. Places such as Houston, Texas will be devastated as the petrochemical and oil refining industry is driven into bankruptcy by competition and unfavorable carbon taxes. Industry in Northern US states will flee the high crime, high tax urban areas, and move south. The situation is similar to Southern Europe where dysfunctional political systems have rendered much of the region’s human capital useless. Indeed human "capital" it is less than useless because it votes and collects welfare, and other services. As the economies of those places rot out young people will flee, and the regions will become massive retirement homes with falling oil and commodity demand. The industrialization of the US South will profit German enterprises. The US North could theoretically develop and produce the systems but it won’t, at least not on a cost competitive basis. The US government is incapable of managing such an effort and without its support there is no way industry in those areas will be able to compete with Germany. California industry will far no better. If manufacturing facilities are constructed in the US to produce solar power components, the facilities will certainly be in the South where the business regime is more favorable, and the crime problem is less.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373602512854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 00:15:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373636356835-2</Id><Topic><Title>Time To SELL Anything Oil</Title><Username>morebeer4mee</Username><Timestamp>1373589539174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:38:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think both high and stupid.

AEP said in a release it reached an agreement with other parties in February to modify a 2007 deal to give AEP the option to retire Muskingum 5 or refuel it with natural gas. But due to the cost of compliance with environmental regulations and current market conditions, AEP said it is now unlikely to make the capital investment to refuel the unit. AEP said it will record a non-operating, pre-tax impairment charge for Muskingum 5 of about $150 million to $170 million in the second quarter of 2013. The company said this charge will not impact its 2013 operating earnings guidance range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share, and AEP said it continues to expect to deliver an earnings growth rate of 4 to 6 percent based on 2013 operating earnings guidance. The company previously announced its intent to retire Muskingum Units 1-4 (840 MW) in 2015. AEP said about 95 employees working at Muskingum will be affected. AEP said it will work to provide displaced employees with opportunities at other AEP facilities. AEP previously announced the planned retirement of 2,538 MW of coal-fueled generation owned by AEP Ohio in Ohio and West Virginia by the end of 2015. Since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, about 15,000 MW of coal-fired power plants have closed as low electricity and natural gas prices have made it uneconomical for generating companies to upgrade those facilities to keep up with the government's stricter environmental rules. Those generating companies have also announced plans to shut more than 37,000 MW of coal-fired units over the next 10 years or so.

(AP) -- New York regulators have scheduled a series of hearing on a proposal to reduce the volume of carbon dioxide emissions allowed in a nine-state region. The state is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which announced in February plans to cap emissions at 91 million tons each year starting in 2014, down about 45 percent from the current 165 million-ton cap. The proposal would also set a $2 per ton minimum auction price on allowances power plants can trade. The price would increase 2.5 percent each year after that. That's intended as an incentive for plants to operate efficiently and helps states pay for energy efficiency programs. The Department of Environmental Conservation hearings will be in late August in Albany, Avon and Long Island City. manufacturing</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373654997826</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373661364914-11</Id><Topic><Title>Stock</Title><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1373651644639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 13:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please sell your 2 shares and go somewhere else.</Msg><Username>therealitycheck38</Username><Timestamp>1373661364914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 16:36:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373670366276-12</Id><Topic><Title>The collapse of New York City’s economy &amp; oil impact.</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373638751805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:19:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your self centered delusions provide continuing amusement to all.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1373670366276</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:06:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373670514417-13</Id><Topic><Title>Has "molded bluecheese" ever gotten a thumbs up ????</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1373579593170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 17:53:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever ?

The decision struck down an exemption for “biogenic carbon dioxide” issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2011. The case, Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA, considered whether EPA’s exemption from otherwise applicable permitting and control requirements for newly constructed industrial facilities burning biomass was legally permissible. Statement of NRCM Clean Energy Director Dylan Voorhees: “We are very pleased that the court agreed with us today that the EPA must require power plants burning biomass to control their global warming pollution. This is good news for addressing climate change and good news for relying on science in our nation's clean air policies. The decision will help ensure that investments in clean energy go to clean energy sources, while protecting the forests we love and depend on. “NRCM opposed the EPA’s decision to simply ignore climate emissions from biomass because the simple fact is, burning biomass emits a significant amount of carbon pollution. It’s true that some of it may ultimately be re-absorbed by trees in future years, but determining how much is complex. That’s why we need the EPA to set forth rules to evaluate biomass emissions, not ignore them. “The problem of climate change is too serious to ignore, and it is essential that our policies be based on sound science. Climate scientists around the world have expressed significant concern about this “biomass loophole” and we hope the EPA will now get to work on a solution. “We also continue to strongly support the work of th</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373673382404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373674041811-16</Id><Title>ANALYSIS-New EPA rules could cripple Brazil-U.S. ethanol trading</Title><Msg>ANALYSIS-New EPA rules could cripple Brazil-U.S. ethanol trading By Cezary Podkul NEW YORK, July 12 | Fri Jul 12, 2013 10:13pm BST (Reuters) - Importing cheap Brazilian ethanol into the United States could become much less profitable next year if a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to expand tough documentation and transportation rules to non-U.S. producers takes effect. The proposal, made on June 14, could seriously disrupt a signature Latin American energy trade, triggering auditing, documentation and transportation requirements, including physically separating U.S. ethanol imports from each other until those requirements are met. Foreign producers and importers would also have to post a higher bond with the EPA to offset any potential penalties for violating the rules. The EPA insists the additional safeguards were needed to prevent fraudulent ethanol production. "You've got here an expansion of regulated parties and higher compliance costs associated with it," said Graham Noyes, an energy lawyer at law firm Stoel Rives in California. If enacted this year, the rules would probably not have an immediate impact. But they would raise the costs of next year's ethanol shipments, making the EPA's 2014 fuel targets for blending renewables into the national fuel supply tougher to meet. The EPA estimated in February that 666 million gallons of Brazilian ethanol would be needed to meet its 2013 goal. The rules could also squeeze next year's prices for renewable fuel credits tied to ethanol if enough importers and producers decide compliance costs are too high for them. "The proposed rules would drive up the transactional cost of shipping sugarcane ethanol to the U.S. to a point that it won't make any sense to send ethanol from Brazil to the U.S.," Joel Velasco, who advises Unica - the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association - said in an email to Reuters. According to Velasco, the bond requirement would cost about $1 million for every 5 million gall</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373674041811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 20:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373678805645-17</Id><Topic><Title>Has "molded bluecheese" ever gotten a thumbs up ????</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1373579593170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 17:53:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still NOT ONE !
