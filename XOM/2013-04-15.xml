Bicycle? Wind Farms........another $$$$$$$$$$$$ Boondoggle. Wind turbines 'less efficient than claimed' Wind turbines are 25 per cent less effective than the renewable energy industry claims, according to research. The John Muir Trust (JMT), one of Scotland's leading conservation bodies, has challenged the common assertion that wind farms run at an average of 30 per cent capacity over a year. A study carried out for the Trust into the energy generated by dozens of wind farms, the majority of which are in Scotland, between November 2009 and last month, found they actually ran at 22 per cent of capacity. Campaigners insist the figures, drawn from data provided by the National Grid, challenge the role of wind farms as an efficient source of renewable energy. They said hundreds of wind farms had secured planning permission across Scotland based on inaccurate assumptions of their output. "This analysis shows that over the course of a year, the average load factor fell well short of what the industry claims, yet the 30 per cent figure is peddled at every public inquiry into a proposed wind farm," said Helen McDade, head of policy at the JMT. "This data is needed to counter that hype."</Msg><Username>basherbuste_r</Username><Timestamp>1366007055988</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 02:24:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366026026411-3</Id><Topic><Title>Gas is not clean energy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365985863510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 20:31:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A point well said.

Balancing dependence on Middle East oil against increasing fuel demand continues to challenge China in its ongoing urbanization and industrialization. In an effort to adapt to such limitations, China has increased production capacity and consumption of methanol. In less than a decade, methanol use in China’s transportation sector grew from virtually zero to replacing nearly 8% of the country’s gasoline requirement. China’s approach may prove to be profitable and strategic. Research suggests that methanol fits within existing energy infrastructure, offers a convenient solution for efficient energy storage and most importantly, certain methanol fuel blends can be used in today’s internal-combustion engines. Demand in Asia is rising as methanol is increasingly used as more than a chemical feedstock. “Methanol is seen as a strategic fuel by the rapidly growing nation due to its clean fuel benefits, favorable economics, the ease of adopting methanol in current fueling infrastructure and the advantage of being able to use alternative feedstocks in a nation that is lacking in domestic oil reserves,” said former Deputy Governor of Shanxi Province, Peng Zhi Gui. In 1995, the ﬁrst methanol pilot project in China was initiated by Sino-American Scientific Collaboration. Ford Motor Co. donated a methanol engine and assisted in developing the ﬁrst methanol automobile in China. Direct blending with gasoline drives the recent growth in methanol demand. In 2009, national fuel blending standards for M85 and M100 went into effect across China, and a national M15 standard is currently in the final stages of adoption. These standards, along with the domestic availability of methanol and its lower cost compared to gasoline, will increase methanol’s fuel market share.

It takes stock of various green energy incentives and programs, such as federal tax incentives and state-based green energy standards, in a wider look at U.S. climate policy. The U.S. is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, which raced past the U.S. roughly six years ago, but U.S. carbon emissions have been falling in recent years. The report notes that this stems from the reduced demand during the recession, the growth of natural gas as a power source at coal’s expense, and various green energy programs. Looking forward, U.S. officials are also planning new Environmental Protection Agency regulations to curb emissions. From the report: Lack of U.S. legislative action on climate—while a continuing challenge—does not mean that the U.S. is not doing anything. The U.S. must strive to learn from its own varied experience with emissions-reducing policies, as well as those of other countries, as it builds toward a more coherent, effective climate policy regime—both upward from the state and local levels, and downward from the federal level. The analysis of U.S. policy is part of the much broader report unveiled Monday that assesses climate policies in China, India, the U.S., Brazil and the European Union.

Martin LaMonica April 12, 2013 The conventional wisdom is that batteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries, are way too expensive to be used on the electricity grid in a financially viable way. Chris Shelton begs to differ and he has two years of data to make his case. Shelton is the president of AES Energy Storage, which has developed 150 megawatts worth of energy storage projects in four locations using giant lithium-ion batteries. The trick to making them economic is using them for what they’re good at and in this case, that’s speed. The company earlier this week said it has provided 400,000 megawatt-hours worth of frequency regulation services to the electricity grid in the mid-Atlantic states, a portion run by grid operator PJM. The battery–actually 16 connected batteries packaged in shipping containers–draws its energy from 61 mountaintop wind turbines in West Virginia with a capacity of 98 MW. That configuration consistently outperforms natural gas and coal power plants in providing the service, says Shelton. “It’s competing every day in getting selected and winning. It’s a commercial, scalable proof point that storage is economic,” he says. Frequency regulation is one of those essential but invisible grid services that few people outside the utility industry are aware of. Electric current needs to be sent at a consistent frequency and when the amount of power that’s being pumped into the grid is out of sync with the amount of power that’s being consumed–essentially a supply demand imbalance–then service can be interrupted. Right now, fossil fuel power plants provide bursts of power into the grid to maintain that stability. Energy storage can perform the same task either by quickly absorbing or delivering power... technologyreviewDOTcom/view/513651/batteries-cheapest-form-of-grid-power/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366050611043</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 14:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366051272977-16</Id><Title>green energy is for the emasculated, oil/gas is for men...</Title><Msg>fyi</Msg><Username>obummerbgone</Username><Timestamp>1366051272977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 14:41:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366058028715-17</Id><Title>after hours millions of shares</Title><Msg>anyone see this and what do you think?</Msg><Username>no1matemary</Username><Timestamp>1366058028715</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 16:33:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366059986933-18</Id><Title>★★★★BUY GOLD Boys....the NEW GOLD RUSH is ON ★★★★</Title><Msg>it's time !</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1366059986933</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366069810743-19</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>For anybody who may think that Exxon's drastic weakness in up markets means any protection in falling markets, today is your answer.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced the agreement at a conference outside Washington, D.C. "By continuing to work together to produce American made 'drop-in' aviation fuels from renewable feedstocks, we will create jobs and economic opportunity in rural America, lessen America's reliance on foreign oil and develop a thriving biofuels industry that will benefit commercial and military enterprises," Vilsack said in a statement. The initiative, which started in 2010, is part of a broader federal effort to bring domestic production of those drop-in aviation biofuels to 1 billion gallons per year by 2018. Known as “Farm to Fly,” the effort also involves private airline firms — who cite making the fuel supply chain more efficient as a key benefit — and the Federal Aviation Administration. The White House has promoted the aviation and other biofuel programs as a way to lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign oil and grow domestic biofuel companies. LaHood said aviation biofuels would help President Obama maintain commitments to address climate change in his second term. "In his State of the Union Address, President Obama called on us to work together to reduce carbon emissions - developing these alternative jet fuels will do just that, while creating jobs and helping airlines save money on fuel,” LaHood said in a Monday statement. Obama has advocated growing the domestic biofuel industry through increased federal research, which the fiscal 2014 budget plan he proposed last week would do.
