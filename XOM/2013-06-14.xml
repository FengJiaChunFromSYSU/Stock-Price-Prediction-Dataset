The princess of fairies and things green has never seen Hamburg. Target allocation 6% once we find suitable properties to profit from the war on fossil fuels there. Hamburg is a model German green city with many wind and solar enterprises and it is very rich, one of the richest cities in the world. Large scale bio-refining of cellulose is not far off now that the marine worm enzyme is in the works, and Hamburg will profit much from that while Big Oil loses much.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371196149007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 03:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371196204898-2</Id><Topic><Title>Arkansas and Our money</Title><Username>1molly2</Username><Timestamp>1371162549697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:29:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound pathetic.

However I apparently put more value on human lives than you do. How about the lingering effects on the families that lost loved ones? As I suggested earlier, all this can be avoided by shutting down the pipelines that transport the oil. The potentional for an accident then disappears. Maybe we can ship the oil by railcar. But wait, wasn't there a far larger oil spill recently as a result of a train derailment. I didn't hear about the railroad being sued by the government. Better yet lets just shut the refineries down and remove any chance of an oil related industrial accident. We wouldn't need to ship oil at all; of course we wouldn't be able to manufacture any gasoline for our cars, but that would eliminate any hydrocarbon pollution for the internal combustion engines. See, there is a solution which would eliminate the governments concerns, and yours too.</Msg><Username>beameup_999</Username><Timestamp>1371228361904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:46:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371232914664-10</Id><Title>Study: Exports will have significant impact on US natural gas price</Title><Msg>Study: Exports will have significant impact on US natural gas price</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371232914664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371233148427-11</Id><Title>Hydrogen plant starts storing wind energy in Germany</Title><Msg>Hydrogen plant starts storing wind energy in Germany</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371233148427</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371234797496-12</Id><Title>How Green Groups Make the EPA Issue New Rules</Title><Msg>How Green Groups Make the EPA Issue New Rules National Journal By Coral Davenport | National Journal – 5 hrs ago Environmental groups have a tough time getting Congress to do what they want. Case in point: In the early months of 2010, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund waged an all-out campaign urging the Senate to pass a sweeping climate-change bill backed by President Obama and leaders in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The measure crashed and burned that summer. But the green groups—and Obama’s top environmental officials—knew they could resort to a different tactic: lawsuits to compel executive action. Toward the end of George W. Bush’s administration, the three big environmental organizations and 11 states sued to force the Environmental Protection Agency to issue new regulations reining in carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and oil refineries. The Bush EPA fought the suit, but the Obama EPA, full of top officials who had worked in these very nonprofits, took a different tack. By December 2010, after the failure of the climate-change legislation, Obama’s first-term EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, settled the lawsuit—on the advocates’ terms. The settlement obliged the agency to begin regulating carbon pollution from coal plants and oil refineries, an outcome with profound environmental and economic implications. And in April 2012, EPA proposed a historic new rule to regulate global-warming pollution from coal plants. As Obama’s second term unfolds, the agency is expected to finalize more rules that, thanks to lawsuits, will give the green groups what they want. The climate-change settlement is just one in a series of recent so-called sue-and-settle agreements since Obama took office. Between 2009 and 2012, EPA has settled at least 60 lawsuits from outside groups, leading to dozens of new environmental regulations. A 2010 deal in another Sierra Club lawsuit led to a 2012 regulation on mercu</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371234797496</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371242354856-13</Id><Topic><Title>I never did like blue cheese</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371162087936</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:21:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really irritating !

In an exchange with former committee chair Henry Waxman (D-CA) reported by E&amp;E Daily, Moniz was blunt: “It’s indisputable that we are experiencing warming, and that the pattern of consequences that has long been expected, in fact, are appearing around us, unfortunately — typically at the higher end of the predicted ranges,” Moniz said, pointing to melting ice caps, intensified storms, droughts and wildfires. In recent years, the subcommittee has been used to push false talking points about the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and to hold hearings just to throw climate denier talking points at real climate scientists. Last year, Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) sponsored a raft of bills that would dismantle key public health and clean air provisions and undermine landmark environmental legislation. Last week, the committee marked up Rep. McKinley’s bill that would prevent the EPA from regulating toxic coal ash. Unsurprisingly, McKinley’s asked Secretary Moniz if global warming was “primarly man-made, or natural and cyclical.” The conversation that followed was educational, hopefully for all parties. Watch the exchange here, courtesy of Forecast the Facts: VIDEO Here’s the transcript: MONIZ: I believe, in my view, there is no question that a major component is anthropogenic. And that comes from– MCKINLEY: Interesting. Is that from a consensus? MONIZ: It is practically, I would say 98 percent of scientists involved in this area– MCKINLEY: But you’re well aware the petition project has 32,000 scientists and physicists who’ve disagreed!
