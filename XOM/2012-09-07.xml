They're a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it,” he said to loud applause near the beginning of his speech in Charlotte, N.C., accepting his party’s presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention. “My plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet. Because climate change is not a hoax,” Obama said. Obama’s comments are likely to thrill environmentalists who have sought more emphasis on the topic from the campaign. One week earlier, Mitt Romney, in his GOP nomination acceptance speech, mocked Obama's call four years ago that 2008 could begin a time when the rise of the oceans began to slow. The president touted the carbon emission reductions as a result of his policies that are boosting auto efficiency, expanding green energy and using less energy in buildings. He noted that the country has substantially reduced its oil import reliance, pointing out it’s at the lowest point in almost two decades. Obama touted his support for continued expansion of domestic oil drilling as part of a wider energy strategy. He endorsed continued natural gas development that he said can support hundreds of thousands of new...</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346998918678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 02:21:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347000063832-4</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: Climate change is not a hoax</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346998918678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 02:21:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Obama: We Can Control More Of Our Own Energy And Reduce Carbon Pollution DNCConvention2012 Published on Sep 6, 2012 by DNCConvention2012 youtube VIDEO Transcript OBAMA: You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy. After thirty years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We've doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day - more than any administration in recent history. And today, the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades. Now you have a choice - between a strategy that reverses this progress, or one that builds on it. We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan, or endanger our coastlines, or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. We're offering a better path - a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal; where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks; where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy; where we develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet. If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. And yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet - because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They're a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it.

Newly elected Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, charting a fresh course for the country both at home and abroad, chose Beijing for his first official visit outside the Middle East and Africa last week. He traveled with a battalion of businessmen and shored up unprecedented financial and political support from Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, including large-scale investments in infrastructure. Following the high-profile, three-day visit, the Obama administration intensified efforts to relieve Egypt’s debt, including throwing its weight behind a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As Morsi recalibrates Egypt’s foreign policy — seeking “balance,” his advisers have said, and reaching out to US foes — he is attempting to relieve Egypt’s crippled economy, which has failed to rebound from its post-uprising slump. China is now in a unique position to usurp the United States in the role of Egypt’s benefactor. “Our relations with China will increase, because our new government has some doubts about the West,” said Mohamed Kadry Said, military analyst at the Cairo-based Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. Indeed, for 30 years the U.S. openly supported the dictatorial regime of former President Hosni Mubarak, which for decades persecuted the Muslim Brotherhood group to which Morsi belongs. In November 2010, an opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center showed 52 percent of Egyptians held a favorable view of China, while just 17 percent of Egyptians held a favorable view of the United States. Unfazed by political instability or concerns for human rights — unlike the United States, which still holds some reservations of the Morsi government — China has the money, the power, the will and the weaponry to rival American influence in Egypt. “We are looking to China as a strong power not only in Asia, but also in Africa,” Said said, referring to China’s billions in trade and investment on the continent. “And this relationship will force the U.S. to focus more carefully on what is happening in Egypt.” The U.S. remains Egypt’s largest donor, with both economic and military aid topping $1.3 billion. But China, long a bystander in the Middle East, is making inroads into both the economic and security sectors at a rapid pace. In addition to signing on to build a power station, a water desalination plant and a high-speed train line between Cairo and Egypt’s second city, Alexandria — all last week — China has roughly $500 million in previous investments in Egypt. Those investments were made during the Mubarak era, which embarked on trade ties with China but kept relations to a minimum under US financial and military patronage. When Egypt’s popular revolt in 2011 and subsequent political turmoil spooked other investors, Chinese companies stayed behind, investing in affordable goods like clothes and cheap electronics. With nearly 85 million people, Egypt is a lucrative consumer market for cheap Chinese goods. And in 2011, Chinese commodities exports to Egypt hit $7.28 billion, beating out US exports to Egypt at $6.18 billion, according to United Nations trade data. As the US economy struggles to recover, and Europe — Egypt’s premier trading partner — faces its own economic crisis, China is flush with cash and a resilient export sector. Egypt lacks the vast energy resources that have spurred mammoth Chinese investment elsewhere in the continent, including in Libya and Angola. But analysts say in addition to its profitable consumption market, Egypt offers China access — and leverage — to other nearby countries. Fresh Chinese contributions to Egypt’s economy, which sits at the heart of the Arab world, will likely buy political goodwill in the region, where support for China is waning for its backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. China can also use Egypt’s Suez Canal to sail warships in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, where it also holds investments, challenging the preferential, expedited treatment US warships now receive when traversing the channel. According to a study by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, China sold more weapons to Egypt than Sudan and Zimbabwe — its traditional clients — combined, from 1989 to 2008, making Egypt China’s biggest weapons market in Africa. According to a 2009 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, US officials were already concerned about Egypt’s Arms Export Control Act violations, stating they had “more violations than any country in the world.” The cable said a Chinese military official visited an Egyptian aircraft base in 2009, where F-16 fighter jets provided by the United States are held. “The military aspect of our relationship [with China] is very strong,” said Said, the military analyst. “Egypt is a key for any country who wants to reach Africa, or the Middle East or Europe,” he said. “A country like China can depend on a country like Egypt.”</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347023574286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:12:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347023975193-12</Id><Title>Natural Gas Weekly Update for Week Ending September 5, 2012</Title><Msg>Natural Gas Weekly Update for Week Ending September 5, 2012 Release Date: September 6, 2012 Shut-In Natural Gas Production from Isaac Represents Decreasing Share of Historical U.S. ProductionPeak shut-in natural gas production in the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico (GOM) during Hurricane Isaac was about 3.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. Isaac was sufficiently powerful to force evacuation of 85% of production platforms and shut-in 73% of GOM natural gas production (at peak). However, Isaac’s impact on overall U.S. natural gas production was relatively modest, representing only 4.7% of average daily natural gas production in 2012. While the shut-ins associated with Isaac represented a significant portion of GOM production, the impact on the domestic market was less severe than it might have been in the past because GOM production represents a smaller portion of total U.S. production today than 5 to 10 years ago due to the dual effect of waning GOM production and increasing onshore production. The graph to the left shows Isaac’s peak shut-in volume as a share of total average daily U.S. natural gas production from 2000 to present. The declining share after 2006 underscores the diminishing contribution of the GOM to overall U.S. natural gas production. Overview: (For the Week Ending Wednesday, September 5, 2012)•Natural gas prices posted increases for the report week (Wednesday to Wednesday) across most trading locations. Algonquin Citygate, which serves Boston, posted one of the largest increases beginning the week at $2.99 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and rising to $3.55 per MMBtu yesterday. The Henry Hub closed at $2.87 per MMBtu yesterday, up 24 cents for the week. •The natural gas futures market rose more modestly than spot prices. At the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the October 2012 natural gas contract rose 11 cents per MMBtu to close at $2.795 per MMBtu yesterday. •Working natural gas in storage rose last week to 3,402 Bcf as of Friday, August 31, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR). An implied storage build of 28 Bcf for the week moved storage levels 395 Bcf above year-ago levels. •The Baker Hughes Incorporated natural gas rotary rig count fell by 13 to 473 active units on the week ending August 31. The oil-directed rig count increased by 11 to 1419 units. more summary data Prices: Natural gas prices rose across most spot market locations, most notably at Algonquin Citygate. Algonquin Citygate, which delivers natural gas to Boston, saw price gains well above other trading points due to unseasonably warm weather. Algonquin began the week at $2.99 per MMBtu, and ended at $3.55 per MMBtu, a gain of 56 cents, or 18.7 percent. The Henry Hub showed comparatively modest gains, more in line with other trading points. The Henry Hub price rose from $2.63 per MMBtu last Wednesday to $2.87 yesterday, an increase of 24 cents, or 9.1 percent. Although many Hurricane Isaac-related production outages in the Gulf of Mexico were restored this week, both Texas and the Southeast experienced above-normal temperatures, offsetting restored Gulf production with additional demand for natural gas for power generation. The NYMEX October 2012 futures contract increased from $2.685 per MMBtu last Wednesday to $2.795 per MMBtu yesterday, an increase of 11 cents, or 4.1 percent. The October settlement price rose week-on-week after falling through much of September. The 12-Month Strip (average of October 2012 to September 2013 contracts) similarly gained 13 cents, starting at $3.163 per MMBtu last Wednesday and settling at $3.290 per MMBtu yesterday. Both the NYMEX futures price and the 12-Month Strip fell a few cents yesterday, a phenomenon that did not occur in spot markets. Total consumption across the report week showed an increase, driven by power generation. According to BENTEK Energy LLC (Bentek) estimates, consumption in the industrial and residential/commercial sectors fell by 1.6 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, but was more than offset by a jump in consumption for power generation, which increased by 7.2 percent. The top three regions that consume natural gas for electricity all increased their consumption week-on-week. The Southeast (the largest consumer) burned 8.3 percent more natural gas for electric generation, and the Northeast and Texas consumed 3.6 percent and 16.7 percent more natural gas, respectively, in this sector. Overall natural gas consumption for power was up 24.5 percent compared to the corresponding week last year. Supply for the week fell by 1.6 percent week-on-week, driven by lower dry gas production. Bentek estimates a 1.8 percent drop in dry production, although still 0.8 percent above this week last year. While imports from Canada increased by 1.2 percent, they had little impact on overall supply. As of Wednesday, September 5, about 1.2 Bcf per day of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was still shut-in, accounting for approximately 26 percent of total Gulf natural gas production, down from 72 percent the previous Wednesday. more price data Storage Working natural gas in storage increased to 3,402 Bcf as of Friday, August 31, according to EIA’s WNGSR. This represents an implied net injection of 28 Bcf from the previous week. This week’s injection was 32 Bcf below the 5-year (2007-2011) average injection of 60 Bcf, and 34 Bcf below last year’s injection of 62 Bcf. Inventories are currently 395 Bcf (13.1 percent) greater than last year at this time and 329 Bcf (10.7 percent) greater than the 5-year average. Two of the three storage regions posted increases this week. Inventories in the East and West regions increased by 34 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 50 Bcf) and 1 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 3 Bcf), respectively. The Producing region posted a decrease of 7 Bcf (the 5-year average net injection is 8 Bcf). In the Producing Region, working natural gas inventories decreased 6 Bcf (2.6 percent) in salt cavern facilities and remained at the previous week’s level in nonsalt cavern facilities. Temperatures during the storage report week were 2.7 degrees warmer than the 30-year normal temperature and 0.1 degrees cooler than the same period last year. Temperatures in the lower 48 States averaged 74.9 degrees, compared to 75.0 last year and the 30-year normal of 72.1. During the week all regions were warmer than normal, particularly the West North Central and the East North Central Census divisions in the Midwest, which, respectively, averaged 5.3 and 4.7 degrees warmer than the 30-year normal.

C. government's cross-examination of Enbridge at the Northern Gateway Pipeline review got off to a rough start in Edmonton yesterday when the province's lawyer got shut down moments into her questioning. On Thursday, lawyer Elisabeth Graff was asking Northern Gateway president John Carruthers about the insurance for oil spill disasters when panel chair Sheila Leggett intervened. Leggett reminded Graff that the Edmonton hearings are to focus on the economic impacts of the project and that disaster preparedness is being dealt with at upcoming hearings in B.C. Graff said there had been consultation with Enbridge on the topics to be covered and that any overlap with other hearings would be minimal. But Leggett said that wasn't good enough and shut her down. "I'm wondering if it would maybe be appropriate for us to close for today," said Leggett. Former AG gets late start The rebuff came just hours after Premier Christy Clark announced former attorney general Geoff Plant was flying out to Edmonton to take charge of what she called B.C.'s legal "A team." Plant outlined his strategy for the hearings as he boarded a plane for Alberta. "The question [is] whether Enbridge is actually capable of getting the kind of insurance to ensure against the risk of liability," said Plant. But back in B.C., NDP Environment Critic Rob Fleming said he is concerned the government isn't prepared for the final hearings of the federal review panel, which began on Tuesday without Plant. "For Premier Christy Clark, who's trying to assure British Columbians that she has a handle on this file, this is more evidence that in fact she doesn't," said Fleming. But Environment Minister Terry Lake maintains nothing unusual happened at yesterday's hearing and the panel adjourned because it was short on time and will hear all of B.C.'s questions. Graff is expected to resume her questioning today and focus on the corporate structure of the project. Final hearings underway According to the schedule issued by the review panel, the final hearings underway in Edmonton are focusing on the economic, financial and tolling issues linked to the project. The final hearings move to Prince George in October, where they will focus on environmental and socio-economic effects, impacts on landowners and land use, routing, design and construction, and operation safety. In November, the hearings in Prince Rupert will deal with aboriginal rights and interests, environmental and socio-economic effects from the marine terminal and shipping, marine safety and accident response, and public and community consultation. Final arguments will be presented to the panel next spring, which must make a recommendation by the end of 2013. Ottawa is expected to make a decision within six months of the panel's review.
