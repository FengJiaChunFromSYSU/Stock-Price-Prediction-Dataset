After an initial period of recrimination and lashing out at the media, Romney and his allies are insisting that he was absolutely correct all along. It is a remarkable testament to the Republican Party’s ability not just to engage in spin but create and sustain an alternate reality. On Monday night, Romney issued this condemnation of Obama: “It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.” The falsities here are several: The statement was issued by an embassy staffer, not by Obama; It did not express sympathy with attackers; and it was not a “response” to the attacks but in fact preceded them. Even if you strip out all the falsities, the broader argument that Romney is now trying to wage is so completely silly he doesn’t believe it himself. The general thrust of Romney’s attack is that President Obama has taken some unusual step by condemning the inflammatory anti-Muslim movie that sparked the protests in the Middle East, and that he, Romney, would refuse to acknowledge any of the protestors' legitimate grievances. In fact, even under the Bush administration it was completely standard diplomatic practice to combine defenses of free speech with condemnations of provocative attacks on the Muslim religion.</Msg><Username>notarethug</Username><Timestamp>1347643970463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:32:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347644579065-16</Id><Topic><Title>so when is split?</Title><Username>sps14626</Username><Timestamp>1347562839120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 15:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Splits have always been an option to management if they want to send a message of confidence on the future of business growth.

The Environmental Protection Agency said gasoline refiners must use 1.28 billion gallons of biodiesel next year, under a program that has been wracked with allegations of fraud in recent months. The mandate under the program, which is meant to boost production of renewable fuels, is a 28 percent increase from a 1 billion gallon requirement this year. The action “is another step that strengthens America’s energy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil,” EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said today in a statement. Under federal law, refiners such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) must produce biodiesel each year, with their contribution determined by their share of the fuel market. Under rules set by the EPA, instead of producing fuel themselves, those refiners can buy credits from other producers to fulfill their obligations. That market in credits for the cleaner fuel seized up after federal prosecutors accused two companies, Clean Green Fuels and Absolute Fuels LLC, of selling fraudulent credit certificates. The 2007 law requires refiners to produce a total of at least 1 billion gallons a year of biodiesel, which can be made from soybean oil or leftover restaurant grease. As a result of the fraud investigations, refiners are leery about buying credits from smaller producers, according to congressional testimony in July. bloomberg</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347653876942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 16:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347654282597-20</Id><Title>Lifted Restrictions May Support E15 Adoption</Title><Msg>Lifted Restrictions May Support E15 Adoption RFA says E15 will now be easier to find. Compiled by staff Published: Sep 14, 2012 The last day for the Environmental Protection Agency's summer volatility restriction on gasolines is Sept. 15, and the Renewable Fuels Association says without this restriction, E15 will be more readily available. The EPA's prior E15 approval included a summer vapor pressure restriction to 9 psi, creating the need for a specialty blendstock to create E15. This blendstock, RFA says, was more expensive and only available in limited areas. During EPA's E15 vapor pressure restriction, which is in effect from June 1 to Sept. 15, only one Kansas retailer was able to secure this low Reid Vapor Pressure gasoline. Zarco 66, with locations in Lawrence, Kan., and Ottawa, Kan., opened in July, and offered E15 during the summer. Robert White, RFA director of market development said eliminating the restriction will diversify consumer offerings. "This should speed the rollout of E15 in states like Kansas, Illinois, Iowa and others because the final barrier in many states will disappear," White says. "Retailers now have the opportunity to bring yet another choice to all drivers of 2001 and newer light duty cars, trucks and SUVs, along with all flex-fuel vehicles." Bob Dinneen, RFA's President and CEO said the first two stations in Kansas to offer E15 have shown that consumers quickly embrace this new choice. "Overnight sales of E15 at these stations constituted more than 20% of all unleaded sales, proving that consumers are looking for options beyond fossil fuels alone," he said. Earlier this year, E15 was approved for use in model year 2001 and newer vehicles after concerns about residual fuel left in single hose pumps were addressed. Now, retailers wishing to sell E-15 must follow approved misfueling mitigation plans to avoid issues with residual fuel. RFA says that retailers interested in offering E15 should review retail fueling equipment standards and fuel supply for E15 sustainability. farmfutures</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347654282597</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 16:24:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347655653952-21</Id><Title>Affirmative Action Program</Title><Msg>has produced a failure as President.

And now parts of the freed societies are turning against the country which helped bring them into being. Anti-Americanism in the Arab world has even increased to levels greater than in the Bush era. It's a bitter outcome for Obama." "Obama was naive to believe that one only needed to adopt a new tone and show more respect in order to dispel deep-seated reservations about the free world. In practice, the policies of the Obama administration in the region were not as naive as they may have seemed at times, and the Americans have always been much more involved in the Middle East than the passive Europeans. But Washington has provided the image of a distracted superpower in the process of decline to the societies there. This image of weakness is being exploited by Salafists and al-Qaida, who are active in North Africa from Somalia to Mali." "One thing is clear: If jihadists believe they can attack American installations and kill an ambassador on the anniversary of Sept. 11, then America's deterrent power has declined considerably.

As predicted by National Grid, wind turbines last night passed the current UK record of 3.8GW, which was set three months ago. FURTHER READING The UK's top six offshore wind farms Scotland proposes higher subsidies for floating wind farms Generation first went through the 4GW mark just before 11pm last night and the record was again broken this morning. Just before 10am today, wind turbines generated 4.131GW, accounting for 10.8 per cent of the UK electricity supply. A spokesman for National Grid said wind power records have been "tumbling overnight and this morning", and predicted the record could be surpassed again today if winds stay strong, especially in Scotland. He added that a new record is likely to be set each autumn in future as increasing amounts of capacity from renewable sources is added to the grid to help meet the government's carbon reduction targets. According to National Grid, just over 5GW of wind energy capacity is connected to the grid. An additional 2.2GW of turbine capacity is connected directly to local electricity networks, and not to the grid, increasing the wind power supply by up to a third. Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, welcomed the news as a sign that the UK was boosting its energy security through investment in wind power. "This record high shows that wind energy is providing a reliable, secure supply of clean electricity to an ever-greater number of British homes and businesses," she said. "As our wind energy capacity increases, the need to import expensive fossil fuels starts to diminish. The transition to a low-carbon economy is well underway and harnessing this bountiful, free resource will help us to drive down energy bills for all users in the long term." In related news, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and Technology Strategy Board (TSB) are set to launch a series of competitions to boost the UK offshore wind and marine energy supply chains. UK companies have been invited to bid for up to £3m funding for feasibility studies to generate new ideas for the offshore wind sector. Another £7m will be available for developing and demonstrating components for next-generation offshore wind farms. A further £1.2m pot from the TSB and the Natural Environment Research Council is aimed at helping to build "knowledge transfer partnerships", such as linking UK business with academics working in the fields of offshore wind, wave, tidal stream and tidal range energy. The competitions will open at the start of November and close on 16 January 2013. businessgreen</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347657430982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347658239511-23</Id><Title>Commission wants to limit use of conventional biofuels</Title><Msg>Commission wants to limit use of conventional biofuels By Marie-Martine Buckens | Friday 14 September 2012 In draft legislation to be discussed on 17 September by the member states’ ministers for energy, who meet for an informal Council in Nicosia, the European Commission proposes limiting to 5% the proportion of so-called first-generation biofuels in transports. The remaining 5%, which are necessary to meet the EU’s binding objective – to include 10% of biofuels in transports by 2020 – should be fulfilled thanks to production – which is still hypothetical – of so-called second and third-generation biofuels. The plan, which has been broadly leaked, has been relatively well received by environmental and development NGOs. For European producers of biodiesel, this plan, if it went ahead, would quite simply mean the death of a sector weighing over several billion euro in investment, 50,000 direct jobs and 400,000 indirect jobs. With this draft, the EU executive is trying to address NGOs’ accusations that current legislation does not take into account the harmful indirect effects of the development of biofuels on indirect land use change (ILUC). These effects can be classed into two types: economic and social – by aggravating the soaring prices of food and by being part of the extension of land grabbing, in particular in developing countries; and climate-related in the case where biofuels are cultivated on lands which have been previously deforested or which shelter a rich biodiversity. After two years of going back and forth with ideas, and of tensions between the services of the commissioners in charge, respectively, of climate and energy, the EU executive seems to have given in to the arguments of the environmentalists. The draft, which should be formally adopted by the Commission in October, essentially proposes capping at 5% the share in transports of conventional biofuels (so-called ‘first-generation’ biofuels) produced from crops, such as canola or cereals. This effectively means freezing the current share of biofuels in transport (just over 4.5% in 2011). For the rest, the draft says that the energy ‘mix’ of biofuels needs to move on to biofuels that perform better, and that are more neutral in terms of impact on the lands. CLIMATE VALUES The aim is to gradually introduce second-generation biofuels (agricultural residues, such as straw) and third-generation biofuels (such as seaweed). While the document does state that production of the latter still remains very small, it generally blames this on the fact that third-generation biofuels do not benefit from any subsidies, as opposed to the conventional biofuels sector. In its draft, the Commission aims to propose limiting, after 2020, subsidies to biofuels that allow substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. With this in mind, the Commission proposes attributing a scale of ‘climate values’ to biofuels: it would be double for second-generation biofuels, compared to current biofuels, and four times more for third-generation biofuels. NGOS DELIGHTED, PRODUCERS APPALLED Robbie Blake, of the NGO Friends of the Earth, welcomes the conclusions the Commission has drawn, but says it needs to go further still. He says biofuels made from food crops must be withdrawn, rather than just capped at 5%. Oxfam agrees, and says that all the plan will achieve is to put a brake on the increase of food products. The development NGO Action Aid is on the same page, and adds that through this document the Commission admits that the objective of introducing biofuels in transport is completely wrong. As for the European Biodiesel Board (EBB), it denounces the Commission’s use of estimates that are not founded on ILUC to operate a complete change of policy, which calls for a complete review of the massive investments in this sector in Europe. The EBB calls for the Commission to establish a democratic panel of international experts on ILUC and agricultural economy. europolitics</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347658239511</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347661767352-24</Id><Title>maxipad</Title><Msg>Where is that loser commie POS hiding?

Democracy only works if freedom is valued over subjective religious beliefs. Right now we have islamist mobs over there holding the majority of muslims and other groups hostage... these fanatics are grossly offending the rest of the world and basically hurting all muslims in the process. But unfortunately, so far it seems there is not enough unity among the non-fanatics to neutralize the crazies... it would be nice to see reasonable muslims putting more priority on wiping out murderous islamists instead of complaining about cartoons and terrible movies.</Msg><Username>i.alaric</Username><Timestamp>1347662035084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 18:33:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347665062918-26</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans always want war</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1347568019150</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 16:26:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Having lne's religion insulted and degraded would be a legitimate grievance.

That's a new concept that I guess libs are about to adopt. Since the Christian religion is insulted by Muslims multiple times every month in lots of countries, I guess the appropriate response would be for Christians in the US and Europe to burn the embassies of the offending nations and to kill their ambassadors. Wouldn't you agree? That would certainly go a long way toward a solution. And, have you ever heard the Obamao government complain about the insults to Christianity that occur in the US on a regular basis? No - I'm not surprised, especially since they are one of the perpetrators.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347678812799</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 23:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347680807749-39</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE DID THE ARAB SPRING COME FROM?</Title><Username>i.alaric</Username><Timestamp>1347662035084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 18:33:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I assume you're referring to his "stabilizing" influence on Kuwait,correct?
