Jerry Brown calls for greener world, jabs at GOP 'declinists' By Josh Richman jrichman bayareanewsgroup mercurynews Posted: 11/16/2012 01:10:47 PM PST SAN FRANCISCO -- Riding the green wave of a newly implemented cap-and-trade carbon emissions system and a half-billion dollars per year for green jobs, Gov. Jerry Brown exhorted green builders Friday to urge the rest of the nation to "get with it." "I want to reinforce everything you're doing and tell you that in California, we take it seriously -- we've been doing it for a long time," Brown told a few thousand attendees at the closing session of the Greenbuild Conference and Expo at the Moscone Center. And, perhaps feeling his oats following his electoral victory with Proposition 30, his tax-hike ballot measure to fund education, Brown jabbed at those who say California is a failed state. He said he wouldn't say what party such "declinists" tend to associate with, but "I can tell you they're losing power from coast to coast," he said, earning applause from the audience. And those who hung the nickname "Governor Moonbeam" -- "not a term of endearment" -- on him during his earlier gubernatorial terms "aren't around anymore, but I am." California on Wednesday launched its new system for limiting greenhouse gas emissions by putting a price on carbon, as the state's Air Resources Board began auctioning permits to create a marketplace for such emissions. Businesses must either cut their emissions or buy permits from other companies for each extra ton of pollution discharged each year. And California voters last week approved Proposition 39, which closed a corporate tax loophole to bring the state an estimated $1 billion per year. Half of that will fund energy-efficiency and clean-energy projects at public buildings and schools for the first five years, creating 40,000 jobs, according to the state Legislative Analyst's Office. Brown on Friday noted the common Greek root of the words "ecology" and "economy," but said ecology is about "deep principles, deep patterns, the structure of reality itself" -- the economy exists within ecology, not vice versa. "There is no ability to repeal the laws of nature," he said, and mankind must stop its polluting and wasteful ways or else suffer "irreversible, catastrophic consequences." The state and nation must be aggressive about setting goals, such as having zero-net-energy residential buildings by 2020 and commercial buildings by 2030. "California can only go so far -- we can be a little bit in front," he said, but it's up to forward-thinkers like those at the conference to push the rest of the nation toward a sustainable future. "Time is not on our side" as greenhouse gasses keep amassing in the atmosphere, he said, adding that if the world doesn't clean up its act, it could reach a point where humans have to be "living on some other planet that's more hospitable." santacruzsentinelDOTcom/nationalbreaking/ci_22011869/gov-jerry-brown-calls-greener-world-jabs-at</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353221680687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 01:54:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353224812802-2</Id><Topic><Title>A Question for Greedful</Title><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1353199785936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:49:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for your thoughtful reply. It is indeed a grim picture with much uncertainty. I wish I had moved to Canada or Australia back in 2000 when the dollar still had healthy purchasing power. I feel that we Americans are "stuck" here - marooned if you will - due to our weak currency. I think every American who chooses to remain - must choose to live in a place that is not saddled with high taxes or the prospects for high taxes due to fiscal irresponsibility. Case in point, my former home state of California. High income individuals are leaving in droves. Capital flight. For passive investments I believe equities have peaked. Too much risk to be long for the next 4 years. I am not sold on the safety of Treasuries and the yield is so low how can one live on Treasuries unless one has millions invested. For me the prudent investment is a small portfolio of rental properties smartly managed, although this is a "hands-on" investment. No one who chooses to invest in real estate should be over-extended. As with all investments some common sense and luck goes a long way - pick the right property in the right location and be smart about remodeling it or making it suitable for rental and then choose a worthy tenant. I love to rent to upper middle class pre-med majors in a college town.... that formula has worked for me.</Msg><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1353224812802</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 02:46:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353225194613-3</Id><Topic><Title>XOM updated valuation</Title><Username>tomsongarry</Username><Timestamp>1352799843088</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 04:44:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exxon Mobil geographic diversification and significant proved reserve base allows the company to operate strongly for the relevant future.</Msg><Username>tomsongarry</Username><Timestamp>1353225194613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 02:53:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353252773024-4</Id><Topic><Title>Gov.

When stocks, gold, and other assets are taxed down in value it will increase the purchasing power of government debt. T-bills pay almost no interest anyway so they can tax me at 90% on the income from those, for all I care. When stocks do decline enough to factor in the taxes requisite to balance the budget you will be able to buy them cheap and collect as good, or better, after-tax return as you could under W and Reagan - the difference is they will be much safer to own thanks to the low P/E.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353253619672</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 10:46:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353253946208-7</Id><Title>Green Lunacy</Title><Msg>They do no understand the fire they are playing with. Energy if fundamental to economic growth, and every single time energy prices have spiked in the past the economy has gone into a depression. These depressions occur irrespective of whether there is a debt bubble or not. If there is a debt bubble and an energy price spike the outcome is worse. Examples: 1873, 1920, 1973-1974, 1979-1980, 2000, 2008, 2012... Before 1873 you are basically dealing with an agricultural economy and you will notice a depression whenever food prices spike up - such events caused famines and revolutions, and collapse of industrial/commercial demand in towns.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353253946208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 10:52:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353254970947-8</Id><Topic><Title>Wage Earners Suffer Badly Since Reagan But Especially Since Bush</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353121451388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 22:04:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Between the borrow-and-spend Reaganites &amp; Speculators crashing the economy whenever they get in charge, and the anti-energy greenies making it so it can't grow at all you, just can't win wahleee boy.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353254970947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 11:09:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353279378203-9</Id><Topic><Title>Wage Earners Suffer Badly Since Reagan But Especially Since Bush</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353121451388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 22:04:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wahlee is sick</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1353279378203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 17:56:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353279485862-10</Id><Topic><Title>God Bless The Socialist States of America</Title><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1353095215196</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:46:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxidopey a #$%$ POS traitor.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1353279485862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 17:58:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353285482557-11</Id><Title>Green groups slam Keystone pipeline, march around White House</Title><Msg>Green groups slam Keystone pipeline, march around White House Sun Nov 18, 2012 7:01pm EST * Activists want Obama to reject pipeline for Canadian crude oil * Demonstration was smaller than rallies last year * Organizers promise big protest on Feb. 18 By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people who say they worry oil that would be carried the Keystone XL pipeline will accelerate climate change marched around the White House on Sunday, hoping to revive a movement credited with slowing down the permit process for the crude oil project. The protesters changed "Hey, Obama! We don't want no climate drama" and said they hope President Barack Obama's election-night promise to address climate change means he will reject the pipeline. It needs a presidential permit to cross into the United States from Canada. "We're interested in sending a clear message to Obama," said Molly Pugh from nearby Alexandria, Virginia, marching with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, who rode in a stroller. Pugh said she was deeply disappointed that Obama failed to talk about climate change during the recent presidential election campaign, addressing it only in his acceptance speech. Sunday's protest drew far fewer people than a rally a year ago against TransCanada Corp's project, when thousands linked arms and encircled the White House. Keith Bockus was at that protest, and hopes that Obama will block the pipeline in his second term now that he no longer faces the pressures of another election. "I have five grandkids. I used to worry just about them. Now, I worry about my son and daughter too," Bockus said, explaining why took a red-eye bus from Hubbardston, Massachusetts, to get to Sunday's event. NO LONGER "RAG-TAG BUNCH OF KIDS" Organizers said they were pleased by the crowds, which they estimated at 3,000 people, particularly since they arranged the protest only 10 days ago. They said they are working on a larger protest set for President's Day on Feb. 18. "It's no longer sort of a rag-tag bunch of kids - it's the very heart of the environmental movement," said Bill McKibben, president of 350.org, who helped lead the protest. McKibben and other environmentalists argue crude extracted from the Canadian oil sands sends too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Pipeline proponents argue the project will create thousands of jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on oil imports from the Middle East. The pipeline was designed to extend 1,661 miles (2,673 km) from Hardisty, Alberta, to the Port Arthur, Texas, picking up oil from the booming Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana along the way. Obama put the pipeline on hold in January, citing the need to review environmental concerns with a portion of the route in Nebraska. TransCanada changed its route and reapplied for the permit. Nebraska's state government is expected to approve the new route by the end of the year, and Keystone proponents have urged the Obama administration to grant the permit soon afterward. The State Department has said it does not anticipate concluding its review of the project before the first quarter of 2013. Analysts have said they think Obama eventually will approve the pipeline but the timing of the decision is in question. "I think if we can keep the pressure on, we have a chance," said Aimee Crane of Springfield, Virginia, helping carry a 500-foot inflatable replica of an oil pipeline down Pennsylvania Avenue. "It is David versus Goliath," she said, arms stretched high above her head. reutersDOTcom/article/2012/11/19/keystone-protest-idUSL1E8MI3VP20121119</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353285482557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 19:38:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353287366936-12</Id><Title>After Sandy, EPA extends clean fuel waivers for N.J., New York City</Title><Msg>After Sandy, EPA extends clean fuel waivers for N.J., New York City Reuters 6:37 p.m. CST, November 18, 2012 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has extended its emergency waivers for clean fuel rules for New Jersey and the New York City area as damage from Superstorm Sandy continues to prevent fuel distribution in the hard-hit region. The waivers had been set to expire on November 20, but Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew Cuomo of New York asked the EPA to extend them because of continued fuel supply shortages. The EPA said it will continue to waive clean gasoline and diesel requirements for the area until December 7. Conventional gasoline still in the distribution system after that time can be sold until the supply is depleted, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wrote in a letter sent to the governors on Friday. Low-sulfur requirements will also be waived for emergency response vehicles and equipment used for disaster recovery, Jackson's letter said. chicagotribuneDOTcom/news/sns-rt-us-storm-sandy-epabre8ai012-20121118,0,3820576.story</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353287366936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:09:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
