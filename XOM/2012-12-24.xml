Annual average temperatures at the Byrd research station in West Antarctica had risen 2.4 degrees Celsius (4.3F) since the 1950s, one of the fastest gains on the planet and three times the global average in a changing climate, it said. The unexpectedly big increase adds to fears the ice sheet is vulnerable to thawing. West Antarctica holds enough ice to raise world sea levels by at least 3.3 metres (11 feet) if it ever all melted, a process that would take centuries. "The western part of the ice sheet is experiencing nearly twice as much warming as previously thought," Ohio State University said in a statement of the study led by its geography professor David Bromwich.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356354882772</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 08:14:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356355013614-6</Id><Topic><Title>Mas Murderer Wayne Lapierre Avoided Vietnem Service!</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1356274690598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:58:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prove that what I said is untrue?

New wind capacity reached 6,519 megawatts by Nov. 30, beating the 6,335 megawatts of gas additions and more than double those of coal, according to data from Ventyx Inc., which is owned by the Swiss power transmission equipment maker ABB Ltd. (ABBN) The company plans to release final tallies in January. “Wind will very likely beat gas, but it may be close,” said Amy Grace, who leads North American wind industry analysis for Bloomberg New Energy Finance in New York. “It’s very likely that we get over 8 gigawatts for 2012.” Congress has yet to renew the production tax credit, which provides incentives for wind farms completed before Dec. 31. Efforts to take advantage of the subsidy trumped interest in gas-fired stations, which are supported by a plunge in prices for the commodity resulting from added production through hydraulic fracturing. A surge of wind-farm connections in November and December may double the amount of wind capacity added this year to as much as 12 gigawatts, outpacing the additional gas turbines, according to New Energy Finance. ‘Valuable Energy’ “It shows that wind has firmly planted its foothold as a valuable energy source,” Jacob Susman, chief executive officer of New York wind developer OwnEnergy Inc., said in an interview. “Five years ago we had to drag utilities in kicking and screaming. Now they’ve got teams of experts who understand its value.” To qualify for the tax credit, which pays wind farm owners 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of power they produce over 10 years, projects must be online and producing power by Jan. 1. Unless Congress extends the incentive, wind turbine installations may fall 88 percent next year to as low as 1.5 gigawatts, New Energy Finance forecasts. A bill to extend the wind production tax credit was approved by the Senate Finance Committee in August and promoted by Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who sponsored the first wind energy tax credit in 1992. In an effort to head off opposition to an extension, the American Wind Energy Association this month proposed a six-year phase-out of the credit, ending the subsidy at the start of 2019. The Washington-based industry group says 37,000 jobs will be lost if the credit lapses now. ‘Historic Year’ “The reason we’re having an historic year is because the incentives are in place,” said Elizabeth Salerno, chief economist at AWEA. “There’s more at stake now than there ever has been.” Some utilities oppose the plan, noting that the strength of installations shows wind can survive without subsidy, according to Joseph Dominguez, a senior vice president of Exelon Corp. (EXC), the largest owner of U.S. nuclear power plants. “The wind energy industry has matured and is thriving today; the PTC is no longer needed,” Dominguez said in a Dec. 13 statement criticizing the group’s proposal. “Rather than a reasonable phase-out, AWEA is essentially asking for a six-year extension of the now 20-year-old” tax credit. An increase in gas prices may make wind more competitive. Gas futures have risen almost 15 percent this year, which would be their first annual increase since 2007. Utilities in 29 states are required to get an increasing amount of their supplies from renewable resources such as wind and solar, whether or not Congress renews the tax credits. General Electric Co. (GE), the largest supplier of wind turbines to the U.S., has benefited from the surge in orders, said Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt. “We’ll probably make more money this year than the rest of the industry combined in renewables,” Immelt said on a Dec. 17 conference call with analysts. “We can’t control how the PTC works or doesn’t work, but we have a very strong competitive wind business that basically has done the job.” bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-21/wind-power-generation-beating-natural-gas-in-u-s-in-2012.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356362025690</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 10:13:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356362082048-9</Id><Title>Wind Power Generation Beating Natural Gas in U.S. in 2012</Title><Msg>Wind Power Generation Beating Natural Gas in U.S. in 2012 By Ehren Goossens &amp; Christopher Martin - Dec 21, 2012 10:01 PM MT Wind-turbine installations are poised to exceed natural gas-fueled power plants in the U.S. for the first time this year as developers race to complete projects before a renewable energy tax credit expires.

And now we can report a record slightly more subtle but every bit as important: the state got pretty close to that record-setting August mark on the week of the Winter Solstice, the least-sunny time of year. On Wednesday, December 19, the CaISO's preliminary figures for renewable energy output, which are displayed in the chart at the top of this post, indicated that for Wednesday's solar output reached a peak somewhere between 950 and 1,000 megawatts at around 10:30 a.m., and held there until just after 1:00 p.m. In terms of actual power delivered, that's not a huge amount. What makes Wednesday's figures notable is that they happened the week of the Winter Solstice, when the sun is lower in the sky than at any other time of the year. The sun being lower in the sky means less solar energy hitting California, meaning less output from solar panels. At the latitude of Los Angeles, sunshine hitting solar panels on the winter solstice can deliver something like half the energy it does during summer, and less sunlight hitting solar panels means less electrical power generated. And the seasonal drop-off is even starker north of Los Angeles. Which means that California's solar power generating capacity is growing by leaps and bounds even since that August record. Compare that near-gigawatt of winter solar with the figures from this time last year: We had a maximum of 200 megawatts or so of solar output in December 2011. That record winter output is pretty much all photovoltaic power, by the way. CaISO has recently started listing PV and solar thermal's contributions to the grid separately, and solar thermal's contribution is about a hundredth that of PV at the moment. The upshot is that 2013 is bound to be a year in which California's solar capacity sets one record after another. Good news. ReWire is dedicated to covering renewable energy in California.

The ranks of the professionals will grow massively as NASA, DARPA, US Department of Energy, CDC, and other government agencies expand. A powerful national police force and FBI to deal with gun control and gun crime, and urban disorders would be staffed by professionals too, as would a national health system. A modern transportation system would require many professionals to plan, build, and run it. Universities will need to be expanded substantially and that would generate hundreds of thousands of high paying professional jobs. The money will come from some place - small businesses, speculators, football stars, corporate executives, actors, and wealthy retirees who have already collected windfall gains from manipulating the system in the past. Those loses will probably be quite severe to those groups but the impact on national productivity would be nill and offset by the gains from the investments...These improvements presuppose the defeat of the GOP. The federal government would be able to make scant impact at the local level of a public school, and even if it gave money to states to spend on high schools etc it is highly unlikely much would make it to the hypothetical troublemakers and other forms of deadbeat. The teachers and administrators might pocket whatever made it there, with the aid of unions, thereby attracting higher caliber people to those jobs, but that is not big problem...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356378879914</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 14:54:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356379036645-27</Id><Topic><Title>Redneck Zeitgeist</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356371578820</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 12:52:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFY redneck</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356379036645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 14:57:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356379606614-28</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon Mobil's humble beginnings....</Title><Username>fattymcbutterpants2001</Username><Timestamp>1356366467223</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:27:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately, you are neither entertaining or worth studying.

Stock is nearly 10 points below its 2007 price and barely above its level of early 2009 though the Dow is nearly 6000 points higher. Over this period it has been the worst stock in the Dow. Easily the worst big cap oil. Few people (other than shareholders during the Tillerson years) realize what a truly awful performer this stock has been over the last 5 years. With all due respect, the management since Lee Raymond left has been a disaster for stockholders. Rex Tillerson's betting the farm on natural gas has been one of the biggest miscalculations ever. As a long term shareholder I don' expect to get rich quick. I DO expect prudent management and that the stock should roughly perform in line with the major averages and its peers such as CVX. I DIDN'T expect the stock to be the worst Dow performer of the year and the worst Dow performer over the last 4 years. I also didn't expect this conservative company make such a rash ill timed bet on natural gas. Everyone with any knowledge of the oil business knew it was a terrible gamble at the time ( except Rex Tillerson unfortunely.) The poor stock performance over the years represents the justifiable loss of confidence in Exxon management by investors such as Warren Buffett (who is not perfect but is right more often than not.). I have little confidence in the future as long as Rex Tillerson is CEO. Even if new management took over ( which won't happen) it would be difficult to dig out from the hole Rex Tillerson has put Exxon in.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1356379733279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:08:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356381074548-30</Id><Topic><Title>****** Split Announcement ******</Title><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1356057886699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 21:44:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a company and management that truly gives its shareholders nothing : not income (yield much less than its peers CVX and COP), not growth, not price appreciation, and worst of all not even capital preservation ( stock in another downtrend and stock nearly 10 points lower than it was 6 years ago.)

You presume quite a bit too for someone who is not supposed to be studying too. You are a poor student, though, infernal. I've extracted money from your ridiculous stock shorting it repeatedly which is the main reason I say on on here. I short it whenever I feel the time is right, and listening to the howling of fools and the various idiotic reasons people have to buy it helps to judge the mood of the market. In the meantime prodding and getting people to defend their views gets them to tell all they know, or think they know, which for some is not very much at all. I do hope you survive to see the end of your beloved company. I can't promise technology will make that possible soon enough, but, in any event, it will be entertaining just to watch it slowly die.

Futures have fallen 7.5 percent this month, poised for the worst monthly performance since September, as inventories in the week ended Dec. 14 were 20.8 million barrels, up 18 percent from a year earlier. The discount to gasoline makes ethanol more attractive to blenders who stand to pocket the difference between the two fuels. “You’re at a pretty attractive price point relative to gasoline,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “You’ve really improved your competitiveness to gasoline.” Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 52.26 cents a gallon New York time based on settlement prices. It was 50.97 cents Dec. 21 and 18.79 cents on Dec. 6. The differential has averaged about 61 cents this year. Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.3 cent to settle at $2.228 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York at $2.32 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.21, in the U.S. Gulf at $2.265 and on the West Coast at $2.355 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Gasoline for January delivery advanced 1.59 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.7506 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Corn for March delivery added 2.25 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $7.0425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 29 cents Dec. 21, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to data collected by Bloomberg. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-24/ethanol-weakens-against-gasoline-on-above-average-stockpiles.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356397068549</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 19:57:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356397241662-35</Id><Title>Ethanol Weakens Against Gasoline on Above-Average Stockpiles</Title><Msg>Ethanol Weakens Against Gasoline on Above-Average Stockpiles By Mario Parker - Dec 24, 2012 12:43 PM MT. 0 Comments Ethanol weakened against gasoline with stockpiles of the biofuel at a six-month high.
