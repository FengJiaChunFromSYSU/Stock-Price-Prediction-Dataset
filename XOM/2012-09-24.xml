The inclusions list has taken on more of a luxurious look but price is probably the most significant change with our test car, the LX seven-seater $2000 cheaper. The Captiva now also has E85 bio-ethanol fuel capability which Holden says improves performance and reduces emissions by as much as 40%. Opinion is divided on this latest endeavour with the general feeling that while the Captiva is more competitive in terms of value add-ons, it has lost some of its driver satisfaction. Comfort The interior of the Captiva is roomy with plenty in it for even those passengers in the third row. Seats are a bit too straight to allow for cushiony comfort with limited support across the width. The controls are easy to use with obvious thought given to placement and while everything looks pretty run-of-the-mill except for electronic parking brake, the Captiva delivers on overall appearance. The steering wheel is uncluttered but allows for the basics like cruise control, Bluetooth and volume control that most people actually use. There are plenty of storage solutions around the cabin for both large and small items while the boot is a respectable 465 litres with the last row folded flat. On the road Let's say from the onset that the V6 engine didn't seem the best fit for the six-speed auto transmission with performance acceptable but not very inspiring. It is easy to manoeuvre, has minimal body roll and attacks the task at hand in a robust fashion. You do feel every bump however, even the small ones, and there is a general feeling of a lack of power as it strains quite audibly trying to deliver even when unladen. The 2.2 litre diesel engine priced just $1000 higher and delivering 400Nm of torque would seem the more practical option. The Captiva's all-wheel-drive capabilities are a boon on slippery or dirt roads but we wouldn't put it through a rigorous off-road adventure. What do you get? This mid-year update has included the addition of extras across the range with our LX variant sporting 19-inch alloys, heated leather seats, eight-way power adjustment to driver's seat, reverse camera, front and rear parking sensors, seven-inch touch screen with integrated sat-nav, Bluetooth connectivity and USB and SD card audio inputs. In terms of safety the Captiva is equipped with dual front, side and full-length curtain airbags, hill descent, traction control, stability control, electronic brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution. Other contenders The Captiva is a good seller for Holden, the 7 more so than the 5, but still faces increasing competition from the Mazda CX7 (from $33,990), Toyota Kluger (from $44,490), Mitsubishi Pajero (from $60,590) and even the Land Rover Evoque (from $53,390). Practicality Space is a major advantage of the Captiva. Seven seats that can be configured in 32 different ways offer a range of options whether you need to transport extra kids, are going for a surf or using the car to transport bulky items. The back seat is slightly raised, allowing passengers a good view while the reverse camera and sensors are important parking and safety aids. The touch-screen sat-nav has good graphics and is really easy to use. The controls on the steering don't light up at night - a difficult inconvenience. Running costs This update gains E85 bio-ethanol capability and apparently improved fuel consumption figures. Our test struggled to stay anywhere near the official 10.1l/100km figures which was rather disappointing. Holden also offers only a three-year warranty unlike other South Korean-built SUVs that offer a five-year deal as standard. Funky factor Holden has sharpened up the Captiva's look with a more sculpted snout and additional intake grilles. A new bonnet and stylish headlights combine well with chrome door handles and skid plates for a modern look. The low-down These mid-year updates to keep the Captiva current add to the edge afforded by the low price. The Captiva has space, is practical but the drive is a tad less endearing. It does, however, wear the Holden badge which is still a plus for many buyers. VITAL STATISTICS Model: Holden Captiva 7. Details: Five-door all wheel drive SUV.

Even as corn prices shot to record highs above $8 a bushel while sugar futures languished at near two-year lows of 19 cents per lb, Brazil's sugar-based ethanol production was still more costly than U.S. corn-based domestic supply, traders say. Brazilian ethanol is competitive in the U.S. market, thanks only to credits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which requires that fuel companies use 500 million gallons (1.9 billion liters) of so-called advanced biofuels to blend into gasoline this year. The EPA recognized Brazilian ethanol as advanced in February 2010. Brazil has the only ethanol industry with the scale to meet the current U.S. advanced fuel mandate. The question is whether it can ramp up capacity for next year, when the EPA is expected to triple the requirement to 1.75 billion gallons. "Brazil will not likely be able to meet that kind of increase in one year," Plinio Nastari, president of the Brazil-based sugar and ethanol consulting firm Datagro, said. "But this holds huge potential for mills here." Brazil's main center-south cane region is half done harvesting a 510 million metric ton crop, up from 494 million last year. Nastari said Brazil would need an extra 60 million metric tons of cane to export an additional 1.25 million gallons of ethanol to the Unite States. Martinho Seiiti Ono, director of SCA - one of Brazil's biggest ethanol brokers, however, said Brazil has the potential to meet a more than threefold increase in U.S. demand. "If the U.S. offers mills better returns than they get on sugar, it's possible to ship three times as much," Ono said. Brazilian sugarcane industry association Unica on Thursday raised its estimate for ethanol exports this season by 38 percent to 2.55 billion liters (675 million gallons). Ono said 500 million gallons of those exports would reach the U.S.. Even if Brazil cannot fully fill the tripling of mandate, the increased demand from North America could push sugar prices higher, given that corn stocks won't recover soon to ease the cost of U.S. ethanol production. While Brazilian ethanol is doing little to ease the burden on U.S. fuel companies to meet much larger EPA mandates for standard renewable fuels -- separate from the targets for "undifferentiated advanced biofuel", which only includes fuels with a low environmental impact -- they may herald the rebirth of an industry in deep distress. Brazilian ethanol exports -- up 41 percent so far this year -- spiked in July and were on course in September to register an all time record month, Brazilian trade ministry data showed. U.S. data show ethanol imports, almost all of which come from Brazil, have averaged 63,000 barrels per day (bpd) over the past seven weeks, the second-highest rate since 2006. "Exports have been very strong," said Julio Maria Borges, the head of local ethanol consultancy Job Economia. "Returns from ethanol exports to the United States are good -- they are on par with sugar." CORN VS SUGAR The complex economics of global ethanol markets opened a new chapter this summer. The price of corn surged on the worst U.S. drought in half a century, which in turn pushed up ethanol by 15 percent. U.S. ethanol plants consume 40 percent of corn. Meanwhile, sugar prices have slumped 20 percent since August due to a glut in the sweetener. But ethanol prices have still not dropped sufficiently in tandem to make the biofuel competitive on the U.S. market without the EPA credit to advanced biofuel imports. Unlike in 2008, when Brazilian ethanol exports reached a record nearly 5 billion liters, this year's shipments required an extra incentive to make the cane-based fuel competitive: RINs, the renewable identification numbers that the EPA gives to ethanol producers and importers to make sure mandates are met. RINs on Brazilian ethanol are worth 37 cents a gallon, down from 80 cents in June and $1.20 a year ago, traders say, providing the financial incentive for fuel firms to import. Without that subsidy, Brazilian ethanol now arriving in New York Harbor at $2.98 per gallon would not compete with U.S. corn-based ethanol at $2.60 per gallon, traders say. The cost of U.S. corn-based ethanol will need to rise further to make Brazilian ethanol competitive if RINs weaken. Many of the production cost increases in the past few years for Brazilian ethanol and sugar are structural. The industry has seen taxes and labor costs rise and getting product from the mill to the port remains the Achilles' heel of the country. STRUCTURAL COSTS The EPA is due in November to decide whether to go through with raising the renewable fuels mandate for this category of advanced ethanol to 1.75 billion gallons next year. Traders say it is still unclear whether it will go ahead with the full increase given the supply limitations in Brazil, the only supplier of consequence of advanced ethanol. If the EPA carries through, the increase would help revive Brazil's once booming ethanol industry, which has seen investments in new capacity fall from as much as $15 billion a year to hardly anything since the financial crisis caught the sector over leveraged in unbridled expansion. More than 10 percent of Brazil's roughly 400 mills have shuttered in the past few years, which has further limited the sector's capacity to produce ethanol and sugar. It remains to be seen whether local mills can maintain this level of ethanol exports through the rest of the year, especially with spring rains around the corner that will slow ports, cane crushing and eventually lead to the shutdown of mills for the interharvest period. Mills are investing in expanding their cane output, but it is not clear if they can keep pace with the EPA's schedule for boosting advanced biofuels use in the coming years. Brazil cannot fully meet its domestic demand at present due to drought and poor investment in its cane belt. The government reduced the blend of anhydrous ethanol in gasoline almost a year ago from 25 percent to the current 20 percent. And officials are keen to raise the blend again as soon as they deem supplies sufficient to support local demand without stoking inflation. Moreover, the country imported 1.2 billion liters (320,000 gallons) of U.S. corn-based ethanol in 2011 to supplement domestic demand for the fuel, but that trade dried up after the drought ravaged the North American corn crop. "If Brazil could occupy more of the gaps in the U.S. ethanol market, it would, but we've got our own problems," said Arnaldo Correa, the president of commodities risk analyst Archer Consulting. chicagotribune</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348467493721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:18:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348492899063-3</Id><Title>Federal NDP leader Thomas Mulcair spoke in Edmonton to express concerns about the loss of jobs over the Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines</Title><Msg>Federal NDP leader Thomas Mulcair spoke in Edmonton to express concerns about the loss of jobs over the Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines VIDEO By Kevin Maimann,Edmonton Sun First posted: Sunday, September 23, 2012 09:50 AM MDT | Updated: Sunday, September 23, 2012 11:25 AM MDT Canada needs to boost its manufacturing sector to make up for jobs that will be lost in oil refining, federal NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said Saturday during the Alberta NDP’s annual convention at Crowne Plaza Chateau Lacombe. Mulcair expressed concerns over the loss of potential manufacturing jobs in the proposed Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipeline deals. He said the Keystone pipeline, which would ship raw bitumen to the U.S. Gulf Coast, would represent the export of 40,000 well-paying jobs in upgrading, refining and transformation. “We should be looking at our own energy security in Canada,” Mulcair said. “We should be looking to create jobs in Canada before we ship it out in its raw form at the lowest price.” Mulcair said the loss of manufacturing jobs is not only happening in Alberta’s oil industry but also on the Atlantic Coast, where fish are being fast-frozen and shipped to China for processing. He said Canadians have lost 500,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs in the past decade. “There does seem to be a consistent pattern of behaviour in Canada where we let foreign countries, in this case, actually take over our resource.” Mulcair said he has “grave” environmental concerns with the pipelines, citing the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska as a warning of the devastation a spill could cause. He also knocked the federal Tories, saying they don’t enforce Canada’s environmental laws and change laws to correspond to industry practices. “What we’ve been talking about since the beginning is the need to enforce existing federal environmental laws. Whether it’s the Fisheries Act, Species at Risk Act or the Navigable Waters (Protection) Act, those laws are not being enforced right now,” Mulcair said. Mulcair and Alberta NDP Leader Brian Mason both stressed that Alberta does need pipelines, but that the province shouldn’t be shipping unprocessed bitumen to foreign markets. Mason said Enbridge’s Northern Gateway pipeline to the West Coast being “entirely owned” by Chinese state oil companies is not in Canada’s best interest. The Northern Gateway is a hot-button issue in Edmonton, where federal hearings on the pipeline are underway. Mulcair said the NDP party wants fair and reciprocal trade deals that take into account human rights, workers’ rights and environmental records of Canada’s trading partners. “There’s really little difference between a state-controlled company and the state itself, and I think that’s something that should be on the table,” he said. Mulcair also touched on health care Saturday, saying the Conservatives are leading the country into a two-tiered system to the detriment of poor Canadians. He asserted confidence that the NDP will win more seats in the prairie provinces in the next federal election, and said the party needs to reach out to young voters and progressives of all stripes, even suggesting putting ballot boxes in universities. “We understand that between the Ontario border and British Columbia, we have only three seats. That will change in the next election,” he said. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Alberta NDP. edmontonsun</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348492899063</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:21:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348509438454-4</Id><Title>Cheapest oil stock on NYSE, TXS is ....</Title><Msg>CHEAPEST OIL STOCK, highest risk reward is LPR..... currently 1.63, NAV of more then $9 risk reward of 500% Evi Resource Opportunity Overlooked: We feel the focus on Q1 operational issues and near term guidance changes has masked progress on drilling density at Evi. Operated activity was focused on the northern block of Evi during Q1, where LPR drilled eight wells in a single section. All eight wells are now on stream and initial rates indicate no signs of interference between wells. LPR has regulatory approval for up to 16 wells per section in certain sections at Evi and has plans to initiate a pilot of up to 12 wells per section in H2. Notwithstanding certain step-out wells that did not perform as expected, we believe LPR ultimately has the opportunity to double its current 500 well location inventory and surface up to ~$9/share.

And the Romney opponants on this board are typical of this one-eye-closed approach to this election.It's all about opposing Romney.As with the rest of the electorate,there's nobody here who thinks Obama is a great or even good President.In fact.I'm waiting for someone to step and say he's even competant.Given his record it's no wonder. Obama's weak support means there's likely more undecided voters than the polls are letting on.In the end only a small minority will vote based on "hating Romney". This remains Romney's election to lose.That's what Obama is counting on.In fact the SNL skit with Obama and Romney did an excellent job of framing the campaign.Obama is doing a lousy job but as long as Romney looks clumsy he can get re-elected.But if Romney finally gets his act together at all and simply holds his own in the debates the conditions are ripe for an upset. I'd put my money on "upset".</Msg><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1348532680926</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 20:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348532761093-23</Id><Title>Housing market recovery pace picked up in August</Title><Msg>Housing market recovery pace picked up in August By Vicki Needham - 09/24/12 03:59 PM ET The housing market continued to make progress in August, showing the third straight month of improvement and hitting its highest level since the recovery began. With construction starts remaining steady, existing home sales hitting their highest level in two years and foreclosures dropping, the housing sector is 42 percent of the way back to normal, up from 34 percent in July, according to Trulia’s monthly housing barometer, released Monday. "Remember, the past year has shown that most steps forward in the housing recovery are followed by some steps back, so the recovery from here on out won’t be fast or smooth," said Jed Kolko, chief economist for Trulia. Construction starts were at a 750,000 annual rate in August, up 2.3 percent over July and 29.1 percent higher over the same period a year ago. Activity reached its second-highest level since October 2008 but is only 27 percent of the way back to a normal level of 1.5 million. Existing home sales, which jumped 7.8 percent to their highest level in more than two years, are showing the greatest improvement and are 61 percent back to normal levels. Sales in August were 4.82 million, a 9.3 percent increase from one year ago, and still below the 5.5 million that is considered healthy. In the West region, sales were flat compared with last year's levels because of sharp drops in inventory. The combined delinquency and foreclosure rate hit a post-recession low last month, falling to 10.91 percent of mortgages — the lowest level since March 2009 and 38 percent of the way back to the 5.25 percent that is considered normal. That was down from 11.11 percent in July. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348532761093</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 20:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348533432790-24</Id><Topic><Title>Texas Exxon</Title><Username>reconstitute09</Username><Timestamp>1348523630820</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 17:53:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably all doing better than you are.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348533432790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 20:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348534287732-25</Id><Topic><Title>This Board Shows Why Obama's In Trouble</Title><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1348532680926</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 20:24:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The idiotic coward returns.
