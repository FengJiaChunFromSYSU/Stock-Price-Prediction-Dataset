Brian Schatz’s (D) reelection bid, citing his work on clean energy and climate issues. Gore said Schatz’s support for Hawaii’s Clean Energy Initiative had helped the state triple its renewable energy production. “We’re going to need Brian’s strong, outspoken leadership in Congress for many more years to get the job done,” said Gore in a statement, praising Schatz’s commitment to climate concerns, reports said. Schatz was appointed by Gov. Neil Abercrombie (D) to fill the seat of the late-Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) after his death in December 2012. Inouye, though, penned a letter shortly before his death asking that Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii) be tapped as his successor. Hanabusa is challenging Schatz in the Democratic primary, leaving the freshman senator facing a tough fight. A poll for EMILY’s List, which has endorsed Hanabusa, showed her with an 11-point lead in a poll of likely Democratic voters conducted in early June. A poll for the Schatz campaign though found the two candidates each with 37 percent support in early July. Schatz has also picked up the endorsement of key labor unions in Hawaii, a critical edge in the Democratic state. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1374469809984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 01:10:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374474014619-2</Id><Title>IMO -XOM of Canada</Title><Msg>A very good company but why doesn't XOM let IMO pay a comparable dividend yield to XOM when it has the cash to do so?</Msg><Username>upward2000</Username><Timestamp>1374474014619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 02:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374487022971-3</Id><Title>Real bad times ahead here.

Besides Cable TV operators being buyout candidates, Cable TV tech vendors will likely be the hottest takeover targets of all this summer, and could fetch the largest premiums! The big technology to revolutionize cable TV this past decade was video on demand (VOD). An analyst at Brean Capital issued a note in December about VOD tech vendor Seachange (SEAC) saying, "because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." The industry consolidation scenario is now here! SEAC rose past its previous 52-week high of $12.10 on Monday and hit a new 52-week high on Wednesday of $12.72. SEAC is currently $12.32 and trading with a market cap of $403.43mm, with $114.23mm in cash, and an enterprise value of $289.2 million or 1.85X revenues of $156.11mm. During the last consolidation wave in 2006, analysts proclaimed SEAC's #1 rival Concurrent (CCUR) to also be a takeover target. CCUR at $7.78 has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.72 and needs to rise to $15.92 to match SEAC's ratio of 1.85! CCUR's gross margins of 58.2% exceed SEAC's margins of 51.6%. CCUR has grown its operating margin from 1.3% in 4Q2012, to 2.7% in 1Q2013, to 5.3% in 2Q2013, and to 7.3% in 3Q2013. CCUR's 3Q GAAP EPS of $0.11 was up 175% YOY and if CCUR earns the same in the 4Q, they will report YOY EPS growth of 450%! CCUR is about to rally by a much larger percentage than SEAC! CCUR recently surpassed SEAC to capture the #1 VOD market share. CCUR also has the largest market shares of start-over/look-back and Big Data Analytics. Plus, CCUR is rapidly growing a huge share of the multi-screen CDN market! CCUR recently signed HUGE new CDN deals with Virgin Media (the #1 U.K. cable TV operator) and Time Warner Cable (the #2 U.S. cable TV operator)!</Msg><Username>reldng458</Username><Timestamp>1374487242975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 06:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
