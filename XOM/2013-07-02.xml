The White House is currently reviewing a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that could require companies to publicly release the information they use to calculate the emissions, like the volume of production or raw materials that are used. Companies and market regulators worry that that data can be "reverse-engineered and reverse-calculated to basically give away trade secrets," according to Lorraine Gershman, director of the environmental, regulatory and technical affairs office of the American Chemistry Council. "We pretty much are reiterating our concern that the data be protected and not divulged," she said. "Our members' concerns are release of information, both domestically and internationally as well." Usually, the EPA decides what business information should be kept confidential on a case-by-case basis. A 2009 rule requiring greenhouse gas emissions reporting resulted in too much information for those decisions to be carried out in a timely manner. Since then, the agency has been working to set standards on what information should be kept confidential and what should be made public. The EPA's rule has not yet been proposed, so it's impossible to tell what is in it. However the agency has previously asserted that data used in emissions equations are "emission data," which the Clean Air Act specifically prevents from being kept confidential. Chemical and oil companies disagree. They already report information about greenhouse gas emissions, but since 2010 they have opposed efforts to require the disclosure of data used to calculate those emissions.

With the help of thin-film technologies, researchers have now been able to turn solar cells into colorful creations. Covering a roof or a façade with standard solar cells to generate electricity will change a building’s original appearance – and not always for the better. At present only dark solar panels are widely available on the market. “Not enough work has been done so far on combining photovoltaics and design elements to really do the term ‘customized photovoltaics’ justice,” says Kevin Füchsel, project manager at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering IOF in Jena. But things are changing. The IOF physicist has been focusing for the last four years on nanostructured solar cells suitable for mass production as part of a junior research group funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). Together with a Fraunhofer team and scientists from the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, the group of optics specialists is looking for cost-effective techniques and manufacturing processes to increase both the efficiency of solar panels and the design flexibility they give architects and designers.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372769185790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:46:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372769261776-5</Id><Topic><Title>What Germany does with its resources while the NSA squanders money reading 500 million German emails…</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372769185790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:46:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paper-thin silicon wafers give color to solar cells Füchsel is currently working with his “efficient design” team on the fundamentals of how to make colored solar cells from paper-thin silicon wafers. These will be particularly suited to designs for decorative façades and domestic roofs. The silicon semiconductor material, just a few micrometers thick, absorbs light and turns it into electricity. To enable lots of light to reach the silicon substrate, the semiconductor layer is given an optically neutral protective barrier (insulator), onto which a hundred-nanometer-thick oxide layer is applied. This transparent conductive oxide (TCO) conducts electricity, and is there primarily to guide as many light particles as possible to the semiconductor layer below. “TCO has a lower refractive index than silicon, so it works as an anti-reflective coating,” Füchsel says. The simple construction of this SIS (semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor) solar cell, with its transparent outer layer, has a further advantage: Not only does it capture more light, it means solar panels can be made in different colors and shapes. “The color comes from changing the physical thickness of the transparent conductive oxide layer, or modifying its refractive index,” Füchsel says. The Jena-based researchers have thus managed to combine wafer-based silicon with processes borrowed from thin-film photovoltaics. They are also pioneering the use of innovative coating materials. Indium tin oxide is the most common material used today, but it is expensive. The IOF laboratory is working on how to use cheaper zinc oxide with added aluminum. New opportunities in façade design are being opened up not just by SIS solar cells, however, but also by dye solar modules and flexible organic solar cells.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372769261776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:47:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372769282292-6</Id><Topic><Title>What Germany does with its resources while the NSA squanders money reading 500 million German emails…</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372769185790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:46:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But how does color affect the efficiency of these new SIS modules? “Giving solar cells color doesn’t really affect their efficiency. The additional transparent TCO layer has barely any impact on the current yield,” Füchsel says. Simulations showed that SIS cells could be up to 20 percent efficient. In practice, the efficiency depends on the design of the solar panels and the direction the building faces. But not every color allows you to generate the same amount of electricity. There are restrictions for example with certain blends of red, blue and green. The possibility of multicolored cells To connect several solar cells to create a single module the IOF scientist will use laser-based optical welding processes. They enable accurate work at a micrometer scale and do not damage the surrounding material. Researchers are also developing an inkjet printing process to contact the conductive TCO later on the silicon wafer. This will make manufacturing faster and allow additional degrees of flexibility in design. SIS solar cells could even be used to make large billboards that produce their own electricity. Patents already cover the production of colored cells, as well as the ability to integrate design elements into solar panels and whole modules. “This opens up numerous possibilities to use a building to communicate information, displaying the name of a company or even artistic pictures,” Füchsel says.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1372769282292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:48:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372770697130-7</Id><Topic><Title>Bluecheese: All his posts are "absolutely worthless" !</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371752941651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 14:29:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey joblooo, are you wahlee's cousin?

Dlouhy A federal judge handed the oil industry a big win on Tuesday, when he tossed out a new financial disclosure rule that would require companies to reveal what they pay foreign governments in exchange for mineral rights. In vacating the disclosure rule and sending it back to the Securities and Exchange Commission, District Judge John Bates said the regulation spurred by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law had “serious” problems. “The commission misread the statute to mandate public disclosure of the reports,” Bates said, adding that the SEC also acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it opted against providing any exemption for cases where foreign governments bar the disclosures. Forcing companies to reveal foreign payments in other countries, even when those nations bar such disclosure, “drastically increased the rule’s burden on competition and cost to investors,” Bates found. The SEC’s transparency rule, adopted last August, required some 1,100 publicly traded oil, gas and mining companies to report payments exceeding $100,000 made to other countries “to further the commercial development” of the host nations’ resources. Related story: House passes Gulf drilling bill — with SEC rule changes Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and former Sen. #$%$ Lugar, R-Ind., led the charge to get the requirement added to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Human rights groups, led by Oxfam America, say such disclosures are essential to discourage graft, expose bribes and deter corruption in resource-rich nations where oil and mineral wealth isn’t trickling down. But the oil industry, led by the American Petroleum Institute, has argued the requirement to provide financial details for specific projects rather than whole countries at a time would give their rivals a competitive advantage, since similar disclosure isn’t required for foreign state-owned oil companies or privately held U.S. firms.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372791206989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372791414812-11</Id><Title>Obama administration boosts oil industry with $8B in loan guarantees</Title><Msg>Obama administration boosts oil industry with $8B in loan guarantees Posted on July 2, 2013 at 1:03 pm by Jennifer A. Dlouhy When President Barack Obama unveiled a broad plan for combating climate change last week, few observers would have predicted one of his administration’s first steps would be aimed at giving a boost to fossil fuels. But on Tuesday, the Obama administration launched a process to award $8 billion in loan guarantees for cleaning up the extraction and burning of coal, oil and natural gas. In issuing a draft solicitation for the fossil fuel loan guarantees, the Energy Department essentially revived a long-stalled program that hasn’t been tapped since it was first authorized eight years ago. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz stressed that the plan this time is to broadly open the program up to a wide range of fossil fuels and technologies — with the goal of paring heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from the oil, gas and coal that power the U.S. today. Fossil fuels: The word you didn’t hear in Obama’s climate change speech “As we develop the transformational technologies of the very low-carbon future of tomorrow, we also have to innovate around today’s energy,” Moniz told reporters on a conference call outlining the plan. “We are trying to prepare the way for all these different technologies to be market competitors as we go to a low-carbon economy.” The Energy Department’s proposal would include not just downstream carbon capture initiatives that could separate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, but also upstream projects for extracting natural gas and oil. For instance, the Energy Department is proposing to make loan guarantees available for projects involving “novel oil and gas drilling, stimulation and completion technologies…that avoid, reduce or sequester air pollutants.” That could include so-called “dry fracking” technology which eliminates the use of liquids in well stimulation processes now being used to pull natu</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372791414812</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372792351184-12</Id><Title>PM 87.49 high divy,, looks iffy at best</Title><Msg>while ws is at myrtle beach,, leaving only the rookies to set stops on stocks.

The two companies said Tuesday they plan to develop new hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies by 2020. They will also push for more hydrogen fueling stations. Fuel cell vehicles have electric motors that are powered by a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The only byproducts are water vapor and heat, so there’s no pollution. But the lack of infrastructure to transport and store liquid hydrogen has been a barrier to the cars’ development. GM and Honda already have more than 1,200 fuel cell patents between them, and both companies have experimental vehicle fleets. Ford, Daimler and Renault-Nissan announced a similar plan to collaborate on hydrogen vehicles earlier this year. fuelfix</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372805230080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 18:47:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372806840883-16</Id><Topic><Title>Obama administration boosts oil industry with $8B in loan guarantees</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1372791414812</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:56:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a warning for big oil and investors that EPA rules will be forthcoming shortly ...
