He said all three patients are currently in critical condition. Lowery said due to patient privacy laws, no other information about the patients will be released at this time. UPDATE: 10:07 p.m. - Mobile Mayor Sam Jones said Mobile Fire-Rescue will let the fire burn out on its own to prevent further injuries. 9:50 p.m. - A fourth explosion just occurred around 9:50 p.m. in a fuel barge fire on the east side of the Mobile River. The Mobile Fire and Rescue Department said three were injured when two barges previously loaded with liquid natural gas exploded and caught fire. Officials said units are on the scene on the east side of Mobile River. Lt. Mike Clawson said two natural gas barges exploded, the first occurring around 8:30 p.m. at 200 Dunlap Drive, near Austal. It happened between the Bankhead Tunnel and the waterways - not near the Carnival Triumph. The general manager of Ft. Conde Inn, Alan Waugh, saw and heard the explosion when it happened. "We were up on a second floor balcony and the sky lit up in orange and yellow. My partner was on one end of the balcony and I was on the other. And you thought it was the Carnival cruise ship first, but then you realized it was a little further from the ship. It sounded like planes above you dropping bombs when it first went off." He said they could feel the rumble, as well as the heat, from the explosion. Another group was checking out the scene behind a concrete wall when the second explosion happened. They said they could feel the heat coming from the area. City Council Member William Carroll said about 30 seconds after the first explosion, his phone started ringing off the hook. He said he had been told the explosion was sparked by static charges. He said he hopes everyone involved is okay. During FOX10's live interview with Carroll, another explosion occurred. "It's always frightening to have something like that happens to you or around you," Carroll said just seconds later. The conditions of those injured are unknown at this time. Members of the Coast Guard are on the scene investigation the cause, which is unknown at this time.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1366862727961</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 00:05:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366868088695-2</Id><Title>Federal court backs EPA regulation of mountaintop removal</Title><Msg>Neela Banerjee April 23, 2013, 2:28 p.m. WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court unanimously backed the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate a controversial form of coal mining called mountaintop removal, overturning a lower court decision that barred the agency from stopping a large coal mine in West Virginia. The ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is likely to set off considerable political backlash from industry, some utilities and their congressional allies who have long contended that the EPA’s regulatory efforts are killing the coal sector. In the opinion, Judge Karen Henderson wrote that the Clean Water Act “does indeed clearly and unambiguously give EPA the power to act” to halt the West Virginia Spruce Mine No. 1 project, the biggest mountaintop removal mine ever planned in the state. However, the appeals court did not rule on another key question, whether the EPA’s action was “arbitrary and capricious.” It instructed the district court to consider the second question, meaning that the lawsuit could continue indefinitely. Mountaintop mining involves slicing away a mountain through controlled explosions in order to expose coal seams. The dispute before the federal appeals court centered on the EPA’s decision to rescind a permit that Arch Coal needed to build Spruce Mine No. 1. Under the Clean Water Act, the Army Corps of Engineers issues permits to mining companies so that they can dispose of millions of tons of rubble left over from blasting mountaintops by depositing it in nearby ravines, in the process burying streams. Already, mountaintop mining has buried thousands of miles of streams in Appalachia. In 2011, the EPA revoked the Clean Water Act permit the Corps of Engineers had issued to the Spruce Mine, after determining that the proposed dumping of mine waste “would have unacceptable adverse environmental effects and latimesDOTcom/news/politics/la-pn-court-epa-mountaintop-removal-regulation-20130423,0,5501419DOTstory</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366868088695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 01:34:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366878486852-3</Id><Title>Where is maxidopey</Title><Msg>Hinding that ugly mug under a rock.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1366878486852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 04:28:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366887975669-4</Id><Title>negative absolute temperature reported in Munich this winter…</Title><Msg>“The inverted Boltzmann distribution is the hallmark of negative absolute temperature; and this is what we have achieved,” says Ulrich Schneider. “Yet the gas is not colder than zero kelvin, but hotter,” as the physicist explains: “It is even hotter than at any positive temperature – the temperature scale simply does not end at infinity, but jumps to negative values instead.” “Matter at negative absolute temperature has a whole range of astounding consequences: with its help, one could create heat engines such as combustion engines with an efficiency of more than 100%. This does not mean, however, that the law of energy conservation is violated. Instead, the engine could not only absorb energy from the hotter medium, and thus do work, but, in contrast to the usual case, from the colder medium as well." "At purely positive temperatures, the colder medium inevitably heats up in contrast, therefore absorbing a portion of the energy of the hot medium and thereby limits the efficiency. If the hot medium has a negative temperature, it is possible to absorb energy from both media simultaneously. The work performed by the engine is therefore greater than the energy taken from the hotter medium alone – the efficiency is over 100 percent." "The achievement of the Munich physicists could additionally be interesting for cosmology, since the thermodynamic behaviour of negative temperature exhibits parallels to so-called dark energy...." ----Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, 2013</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366887975669</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 07:06:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366889335934-5</Id><Title>Green Party growing and merging with right...</Title><Msg>A majority of Germany's Green Party members support an alliance with the right.

The measure would provide a sales tax exemption for the purchase of turbines, towers and other wind-farm components — a tax break that nearby states Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma have parlayed into a wind-energy boom. Meanwhile, Nebraska has lagged behind, ranking 26th of the 39 states that generate wind energy, despite having the fourth-best wind resources in the country. Iowa generates more than 13 times as much wind power as Nebraska — 4,536 megawatts to 337. And Nebraska ranks last among its neighboring states. Proponents of Legislative Bill 104 said the state needs to act now if it wants to develop its abundant wind resources, because a major wind-energy incentive — a federal production tax credit — is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. “This discussion is extremely important and time-sensitive. It's as important as any decision being made this year,” said State Sen. Galen Hadley of Kearney. He said Nebraska just lost a major company, Facebook, to Iowa in part because the tech giant wanted access to wind energy to power a proposed data center. Facebook has a corporate goal of utilizing 25 percent renewable energy. Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha, who made LB 104 his priority bill, said wind farms provide a needed boost for rural areas. Lathrop said a 200-megawatt wind farm planned near Allen in northeast Nebraska would provide lease payments to local landowners of $10,000 to $15,000 per turbine, create 200 construction jobs and 12 to 16 permanent jobs, and pay $700,000 a year in local taxes. TradeWind Energy will decide soon whether it will build in Nebraska or elsewhere, Lathrop said, so the Legislature cannot wait. But critics, including Gov.

The paper offered the carbon tax with a range of other policy options to help chip away at a Congressional Budget Office-estimated $16 billion of foregone energy-related tax expenditures in fiscal 2013. The paper, released Thursday, came with the disclaimer that the policy suggestions “do not necessarily have the endorsement” of committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) or ranking member Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Baucus said he would pour his efforts into overhauling the federal tax code when he announced Tuesday that he wasn’t seeking reelection in 2014. That, combined with Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) wanting to leave his mark on the House Ways and Means Committee during his last term as chairman, has breathed life into such a possibility. But a carbon tax is still likely dead on arrival. Most of the Senate voiced opposition to a carbon tax in a March vote on the nonbinding Senate Democratic budget. The GOP-controlled House won’t back it either. On top of that, the White House has said flat out that it’s not pursuing a carbon tax. Still, its inclusion in the Senate Finance Committee paper gives climate activists and clean-energy wonks pushing the concept something to chew on. On a carbon tax, the paper said policymakers would need to decide whether to impose fees on fossil fuel producers or on emitters. Cost issues — such as how to price the fee, how progressive it should be and how to phase it — also requires addressing. The paper identified legislation co-sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) as a possible model. That bill would impose a fee on large fossil fuel producers, 60 percent of which would be returned to... thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/296191-senate-finance-committee-paper-carbon-tax-an-option</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366913757862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 14:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366914125660-17</Id><Title>Organizing for Action attacks GOP on climate change VIDEO</Title><Msg>Organizing for Action attacks GOP on climate change VIDEO By Zack Colman - 04/25/13 10:42 AM ET The liberal political group formed from President Obama’s reelection campaign sent an email to supporters on Thursday urging them to “call these climate deniers out.” Organizing for Action (OFA) pilloried House Republicans for questioning whether climate change is occurring and refusing Democrats’ requests to debate climate science. “If we ever want to see real progress on climate change, we need to change the conversation in Washington — right now. We need every member of Congress to be part of the solution,” OFA Executive Director Jon Carson said in the email. “OFA is going to hold these climate deniers accountable — even if we have to go one by one.” OFA asked supporters to sign a petition advocating action on climate change. It also shared a video that included clips of congressional Republicans expressing skepticism about or denying climate change. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/296119-obama-aligned-group-goes-after-gop-on-climate-change VIDEO youtubeDOTcom/watch?v=biUc0D6_UPA&amp;feature=youtuDOTbe</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366914125660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 14:22:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366916869230-18</Id><Topic><Title>Tax break for wind energy sweeps forward in Nebraska Legislature</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366895859609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 09:17:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wind turbines 'less efficient than claimed' Wind turbines are 25 per cent less effective than the renewable energy industry claims, according to research. The John Muir Trust (JMT), one of Scotland's leading conservation bodies, has challenged the common assertion that wind farms run at an average of 30 per cent capacity over a year. A study carried out for the Trust into the energy generated by dozens of wind farms, the majority of which are in Scotland, between November 2009 and last month, found they actually ran at 22 per cent of capacity. Campaigners insist the figures, drawn from data provided by the National Grid, challenge the role of wind farms as an efficient source of renewable energy. They said hundreds of wind farms had secured planning permission across Scotland based on inaccurate assumptions of their output. "This analysis shows that over the course of a year, the average load factor fell well short of what the industry claims, yet the 30 per cent figure is peddled at every public inquiry into a proposed wind farm," said Helen McDade, head of policy at the JMT.
