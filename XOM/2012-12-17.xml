Officially launched in July, 2011, the United Arab Emirates’ biodiesel program – the first of its kind in the region – appears to be a soaring success. The McDonald’s fleet has traveled a combined 808,411 miles on the biofuel processed by Nuetral Fuels, diverting roughly 80% of its carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere . Dubai FDI, the foreign investment promotion arm of the Department of Economic Development, helped to support this groundbreaking recycling project. Already 100% of the oil collected from McDonalds locations throughout the emirate locations is filtered and converted by Neutral Foods into 100% biodiesel; not a drop is wasted. “This milestone marks a proud moment in the history of McDonald’s UAE,” said Mr. Rafik Fakih, Managing Director and Partner of McDonald’s UAE. “In just 17 months, we’ve achieved incredible results which have made a significant contribution to the reduction of our carbon emissions in the Emirates. We hope to take this sustainable initiative a step further by increasing our usage of biodiesel in the years to come.” “We operate a closed loop system for McDonald’s UAE where every drop of biodiesel is converted from their own used vegetable oil and is used in 100% of their logistics fleet 100% of the time in an ongoing recycling process,” said Karl Feilder, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Neutral Fuels – McDonald’s clean tech partner. “Every day McDonald’s proves that biodiesel is a viable long-term sustainable alternative for the environment.” greenprophetDOTcom/2012/12/mcdonalds-biodiesel-uae/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355728995469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 02:23:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355729124774-6</Id><Topic><Title>McDonalds Fleet Traveled 800,000 Miles With Recycled Biofuel</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355728995469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 02:23:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Move over big oil, McDonalds will steal your lunch!

By 2020, ninety-nine percent of U.S. counties are projected to meet revised health standard without any additional actions Today’s announcement has no effect on the existing daily standard for fine particles or the existing daily standard for coarse particles (PM10), which includes dust from farms and other sources), both of which remain unchanged. “These standards are fulfilling the promise of the Clean Air Act. We will save lives and reduce the burden of illness in our communities, and families across the country will benefit from the simple fact of being able to breathe cleaner air,” said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. Fine particle pollution can penetrate deep into the lungs and has been linked to a wide range of serious health effects, including premature death, heart attacks, and strokes, as well as acute bronchitis and aggravated asthma among children. A federal court ruling required EPA to update the standard based on best available science. Today’s announcement, which meets that requirement, builds on smart steps already taken by EPA to slash dangerous pollution in communities across the country. Thanks to these steps, 99 percent of U.S. counties are projected to meet the standard without any additional action. It is expected that fewer than 10 counties, out of the more than 3,000 counties in the United States, will need to consider any local actions to reduce fine particle pollution in order to meet the new standard by 2020, as required by the Clean Air Act. The rest can rely on air quality improvements from federal rules already on the books to meet this new standard. More on the 2020 Map: epaDOTgov/pm/2012/2020map.pdf The standard, which was proposed in June and is consistent with the advice from the agency’s independent science advisors, is based on an extensive body of scientific evidence that includes thousands of studies – including many large studies which show negative health impacts at lower levels than previously understood. It also follows extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the public, health organizations, and industry, and after considering more than 230,000 public comments. By 2030, it is expected that all standards that cut PM2.5 from diesel vehicles and equipment alone will prevent up to 40,000 premature deaths, 32,000 hospital admissions and 4.7 million days of work lost due to illness. Because reductions in fine particle pollution have direct health benefits including decreased mortality rates, fewer incidents of heart attacks, strokes, and childhood asthma, the PM2.5 standards announced today have major economic benefits with comparatively low costs. EPA estimates health benefits of the revised standard to range from $4 billion to over $9 billion per year, with estimated costs of implementation ranging from $53 million to $350 million. While EPA cannot consider costs in selecting a standard under the Clean Air Act, those costs are estimated as part of the careful analysis undertaken for all significant regulations, as required by Executive Order 13563 issued by President Obama in January 2011. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to review its air quality standards every five years to determine whether the standards should be revised. The law requires the agency to ensure the standards are “requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety” and “requisite to protect the public welfare.” A federal court required EPA to issue final standard by December 14, because the agency did not meet its five-year legal deadline for reviewing the standards. EPA carefully considered extensive public input as it determined the appropriate final standard to protect public health. The agency held two public hearings and received more than 230,000 written comments before finalizing today’s updated air quality standards. centralkitsapreporterDOTcom/news/183728261.html More information: epaDOTgov/pm Administrator’s video: dvidshubDOTnet/unit/usepa#DOTUMtrHeQ8155</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355750167937</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:16:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355750384742-13</Id><Title>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announces next round of Clean Air Standards</Title><Msg>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announces next round of Clean Air Standards December 16, 2012 · 6:13 PM In response to a court order, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today finalized an update to its national air quality standards for harmful fine particle pollution (PM2.5), including soot, setting the annual health standard at 12 micrograms per cubic meter.

He alleged the Obama administration is “rushing headlong” into a leasing schedule that creates environmental risks without boosting energy security. Michael Livermore of the Center for Policy Integrity, which is helping to represent CSE, said the plan should be re-done because Interior failed to consider the economic value of not going ahead with leasing in some cases. He noted that when leasing for development of publicly-owned resources is delayed, there is more time to learn about environmental sensitivities and development technology improves, among other considerations. “When you don’t take into account the value of delay, you end up subjecting too much of the outer continental shelf to leasing,” Livermore told The Hill. “That option value is owned by the American public and ought to be considered by the agency,” said Livermore, the executive director of the Institute, which is based at New York University's law school. CSE, which is based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, initially petitioned the appeals court for review of the plan in late October and is detailing the basis for its lawsuit in a court filing Monday. In late August Interior finalized plans for up to 15 total lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s coast between 2012-2017. The first sale of drilling rights to oil-and-gas companies under the 2012-2017 program, for tracts in the western Gulf, took place in late November. Interior officials have touted the plan as a way to enable development of large volumes of oil and natural gas while protecting the environment. The agency has toughened drilling safety standards in the wake of the 2010 BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. “[W]ith comprehensive safety standards in place, this plan will help us to continue to grow America’s energy economy and further reduce our dependence on foreign oil, while protecting marine, costal and human health,” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said last summer. Interior is offering leases in offshore areas that, overall, contain an estimated 68 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 307 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the department. The plan could ultimately lead to development of over eight billion barrels of oil, according to Interior estimates. A “statement of issues” CSE is filing with the court Monday charges that the plan runs afoul of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The filing alleges that Interior’s plan does not “properly balance the potential for environmental damage, the potential for the discovery of oil and gas, and the potential for adverse impacts on the coastal zone.” The lawsuit also claims that Interior’s plan violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which is the statute that mandates environmental analyses ahead of many federal actions. Interior did not “rigorously explore” and “objectively” weigh alternatives to the plan, and relied on analyses that are “critically flawed, biased, and incomplete,” the court filing states. Steven Sugarman, an attorney representing CSE, said analysis by Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) omitted factors that created a bias in favor of new leasing. “Key factors were ignored by BOEM including the massive uncertainty associated with the potential for deepwater drilling disasters, the current glut in gas production, record U.S. fuel exports and the fact that millions of acres of existing leases are idle,” he said. Oil-and-gas industry groups and Capitol Hill Republicans have also criticized Interior’s plan, but they allege it is too modest and should have made more areas available for drilling. But a number of industry groups – including the American Petroleum Institute and the International Association of Drilling Contractors – have also petitioned the appeals court to intervene in the case on Interior’s side, noting their interests are at stake in the case. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/273153-green-group-sues-interior-over-critically-flawed-offshore-oil-plan</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355753286812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:08:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355753396287-15</Id><Title>Green group sues Interior over ‘critically flawed’ offshore oil plan</Title><Msg>Green group sues Interior over ‘critically flawed’ offshore oil plan By Ben Geman - 12/17/12 08:04 AM ET An environmental group is challenging the Interior Department’s plan to conduct new offshore oil-and-gas lease sales over the next five years, alleging that the economic analysis underlying the plan is “critically flawed, biased, and incomplete.” The Center for Sustainable Economy (CSE) lays out its case against selling drilling blocs in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s coast in documents being filed Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. “Oil and gas on the outer continental shelf is a</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355753396287</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:09:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355753453447-16</Id><Title>Green group sues Interior over ‘critically flawed’ offshore oil plan</Title><Msg>Green group sues Interior over ‘critically flawed’ offshore oil plan By Ben Geman - 12/17/12 08:04 AM ET An environmental group is challenging the Interior Department’s plan to conduct new offshore oil-and-gas lease sales over the next five years, alleging that the economic analysis underlying the plan is “critically flawed, biased, and</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355753453447</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:10:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355753688293-17</Id><Topic><Title>Obama panic Attack</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1355666029062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 08:53:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right stench.

They're manufacturing what will be the first ever floating wind turbine in the country. They're trying to harness a huge energy resource that already exists just off of Maine's coastline. Director of UMaine's Advanced Structures and Composites Center Habib Dagher said, "We have the equivalent of 150 nuclear power plants worth of wind blowing off the coast of Maine. It only takes two nuclear power plants to power the whole state, that's how big that resource is." Which is why students and faculty have been busy trying to test their designs and ideas to reign that power in. "We're making history here and it's all been started out by a few of us here and it's grown to include over 50 students and numerous faculty," said Anthony Viselli, a UMaine engineer working on the turbine system. This summer, they'll release the first ever turbine, which is really just another test. The actual deep shore floating wind turbines they're designing will be eight times the size of the test turbine, with blades the height of the Washington Monument. These giant turbines are designed to be placed at least 20 miles offshore, beyond the horizon line. "You will not be able to see them, you will not be able to hear them, so nobody will know they're there essentially, but they're out there creating clean, renewable energy to power our state," said Dagher. Their goal is to have the technology ready so a commercial scale wind park, made up of more than 80 turbines, can be floating by 2030. Graduate student Racheal Joyce said, "There's a lot of work that's ahead, but it's exciting work and I think the progress that we've seen so far is really what's keeping us going and excited for the next step and the next step." Because they know someday their hard work will mean big things for the future of how we create and use energy. wabiDOTtv/news/35962/umaine-engineers-testing-first-ever-floating-wind-turbine</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355755145848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:39:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355755713867-21</Id><Title>Midwest Generation parent files for Chapter 11</Title><Msg>Midwest Generation parent files for Chapter 11 Reuters 8:19 a.m. CST, December 17, 2012 Edison Mission Energy, a power company that operates in Illinois and several other U.S. states, has filed for Chapter 11 banktruptcy protection as it tries to restructure about $5 billion in debt. Edison Mission, the Santa-Ana Calif.-based unregulated power generation business of Edison International, owns and operates coal, natural gas and renewable power plants totaling more than 10,000 megawatts in states including California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It is the parent of Midwest Generation, which manages several coal-fired plants in Illinois. In its bankruptcy petition, the company listed assets of $5.1 billion and liabilities of $5 billion. Edison Mission Energy's 17 affiliated entities also sought bankruptcy protection, and the company seeks to have all the cases administered jointly. Headquartered in Chicago and Santa Ana, Calif., the companies have 950 employees. A list of the top 30 unsecured creditors includes Commonwealth Edison, with a claim of almost $19.2 million and People's Gas, with a claim of almost $243,100. Several other Illinois companies are also among the largest unsecured creditors. The largest unsecured creditor is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Edison Mission Energy' has suffered as the 2008 recession cut power demand. Wholesale power prices have also fallen with cheaper natural gas, making it harder for Edison's coal-fired plants to remain competitive. Edison Mission faced the expiration on Monday of a 30-day grace period for a $97 million interest payment that was due last month on unsecured bonds. In mid-November, the company said it would likely file for Chapter 11 protection if it could not make the payment. Edison is hoping to secure some creditor support for its plans ahead of a bankruptcy, the source said. But the person added that the filing is not expected to be a "prepackaged" bankruptcy, in which the terms of the reorganization are largely prearranged with most of the creditors. Edison Mission owes roughly $3.7 billion in unsecured bonds. A large portion of that is held by a group of hedge funds including York Capital Management, which invests heavily in distressed debt. Edison's subsidiaries hold roughly $1.5 billion in other debt, the source said. The company has hired restructuring lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis and financial advisers from Moelis. Its bondholders have tapped law firm Ropes &amp; Gray and financial adviser Houlihan Lokey. Like many other owners of older coal plants, Edison faces costly upgrades to meet stricter state and federal emission standards to keep its coal plants running. It has already announced plans to shut some coal-fired plants in Illinois rather than invest to clean them up. As part of a restructuring, Edison International Chief Executive Ted Craver has told investors that Edison Mission may also have to refinance leveraged leases at two coal plants leased by Edison Mission's Midwest Generation unit. The bondholders who financed those leases have hired restructuring lawyers from Cadwalader Wickersham &amp; Taft. It is unclear how Edison Mission's unsecured debt would be restructured if the company filed for bankruptcy. Bondholders traditionally demand equity in a reorganized company, but for Edison International, giving up equity in Edison Mission could mean losing certain tax breaks related to operating losses, said the person familiar with the matter. Federal tax laws allow companies to offset taxable income with operating losses at their subsidiaries, but only if they retain at least 80 percent of the unit's equity. chicagotribuneDOTcom/business/breaking/chi-midwest-generation-parent-files-for-chapter-11-20121217,0,1400830DOTstory</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355755713867</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:48:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355755791146-22</Id><Title>Midwest Generation parent files for Chapter 11</Title><Msg>Midwest Generation parent files for Chapter 11 Reuters 8:19 a.m. CST, December 17, 2012 Edison Mission Energy, a power company that operates in Illinois and several other U.S. states, has filed for Chapter 11 banktruptcy protection as it tries to restructure about $5 billion in debt.

However the distinction boils down to Right vs. Left collectivism. The Frankfurt "School" refers to is a collection of leftist malcontents who failed to form a socialist government in 1848 based in Frankfurt, Germany. The Frankfurt Parliament of 1848-1849 was the representative body that they hoped to use for this purpose. It did not represent Germany, but rather was heavily represented radical Jewish thinkers of the time, Marxists, frustrated unemployed university students, etc. This group was soundly defeated by the Right in Germany, using the power of the military, and the law, and its influence was stamped out. It eventually fled to America, and some of its "brightest" lights settled in Manhattan. The Progressives, on the other hand, were American college students educated in German Universities, at least their intellectual pioneers were. They got heavy doses of Hegelian thought and learned from the Masters of Right Wing governance first hand. Such figures as John Dewey, who was integral to the Progressive Agenda and trained thousands of Progressives in America, studied in Germany and was a disciple of Hegel. Other Americans such as Horace Mann visited Germany as well and introduced Prussian education to the Northern United States. Much of the cream of Northern American society studied in Germany during the 19th and early 20th centuries and transplanted the right wing Prussian collectivist ideology to America. The radical elements in the Frankfurt School could not find a home in any Progressive Party educated in such a way. Indeed, the Progressives actively hounded the Frankfurters and their American ilk and some were imprisoned during the Wilson administration. At first the Republican Party was the vehicle for Progressive thought in America, and then it shifted to both the Republican and Democratic Party, and then to the Democratic Party mostly. The reactionary libertarian attitude eventually settled into the Republican neo-conservative agenda. Neo-conservative has many meanings, but basically it boils down to a non-Progressive version of Republican... Basically it picked up the failed teachings of the Civil War Era Democrats, and mixed them with some radical 18th century libertarian teachings which they felt represented the "Founders," but more importantly matched was useful to various corporate groups and business lobbyists. Barack Obama is no Frankfurt School collectivist. He's a Progressive. The easiest way to tell the difference is his attitude toward Israel. Indeed the Democratic Party became so hostile to it interests, probably because of its intellectual provenance, that the neo-Cons became a better vehicle for pro-Israeli views...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355760936166</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:15:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355762124884-25</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives vs. Frankfurt School</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355760936166</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:15:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*John Dewey did not receive a degree in Germany of course...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355762124884</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:35:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355769685330-26</Id><Topic><Title>4skinner v. wahleee boy</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355423100457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:25:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting position considering how you are still pushing the left's agenda yourself.

Part of USDA’s mission is to help the agriculture industry develop new markets, and a recent USDA study confirms what we’ve been noticing, which is that auto manufacturers are using more bioplastics and other biobased materials. We’re not exactly looking to a future where cars grow on trees, but at least there will be more sustainable car parts made from sources other than petrochemicals. Rural Economies Get a Bioproduct Lift At the very least, bioplastic, biofuel, and other crop-based products provide a long-term incentive for farmland and water supply preservation. In the context of the natural gas fracking “gold rush” that is pouring money into rural communities while putting water resources at risk and creating earthquakes, among other hazards, bioproduct crops present a more sustainable path to local job creation. To cite just one example of the potential scale of the economic impact, DuPont’s new biorefinery in Iowa alone will recruit 500 local farmers to keep it supplied with corn stover, the leaves and stems left over from harvest. USDA Gives $10 Million for Sustainable Car Parts The new grants were awarded by USDA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which was established under the 2008 Farm Bill. The funds will be spread among more than two dozen research institutions across the country, primarily in public universities. The goal is to develop regional systems for producing sustainable biofuels and biobased products. Unlike the fracking boom, USDA’s bioproduct grant initiative is pre-planned for sustainable growth. Job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil are only two challenges in the competitively awarded grants. Awardees must also develop systems that fit within existing agricultural frameworks, and achieve net positives for community and environmental health. Car Parts and products The automotive bioproduct boomlet is being spurred along partly by the emergence of electric vehicles and tighter energy efficiency standards, in which weight is a critical factor. Bioproducts not only offer a chance to reduce weight, there is also some potential for them to achieve greater strength and durability than their petrochemical counterparts. Ford has been particularly active in the trend away from petrochemicals, which includes recycling, along with the development of new bioproducts. Ford’s recent endeavors include soy foam seat cushions, recycled denim and carpeting, wheat straw filler for storage bins, and a collaboration with Weyerhaeuser to develop a tree cellulose substitute for fiberglass. Ford is also developing a dandelion-based rubber substitute that could be used for other interior parts like floor mats and cup holders. Other areas of investigation in the automotive industry have ranged into some pretty strange territory, including coconut husks, cow bones, and chicken feathers. sDOTtt/1x8pm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355769854944</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:44:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355770152234-28</Id><Topic><Title>4skinner v. wahleee boy</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355423100457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:25:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read Treitschke and Hegel 4skinner.

The Land Board chaired by Gov. Brian Schweitzer on Monday sold a package of 50-year easements to TransCanada for $741,000. Critics argued the board isn't doing enough to make sure the pipeline will be safe for the environment, pointing to last year's oil spill on the Yellowstone when a pipeline ruptured. Opponents also argued it shouldn't be built at all due to global warming concerns from oil production. TransCanada told the board that it has agreed to bury the pipeline 40 feet under the major rivers. The board also gave the backers of the Montana-Alberta Tie Line easements across state land in north-central Montana to complete its project early next year. missoulianDOTcom/news/state-and-regional/montana-approves-keystone-pipeline-easements/article_1cd3874a-4876-11e2-b60b-0019bb2963f4.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355770207976</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:50:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355771017814-30</Id><Topic><Title>4skinner v. wahleee boy</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355423100457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:25:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, the fued is over and Bohner will cry and say this was the best he could do.

The Republican Governors Association and the Republican Attorneys General Association, in a letter to Monday to President Obama, allege that the planned Interior Department rules will stymie oil-and-gas production on federal and Indian lands. “The states, not the federal government, are best positioned to appropriately regulate hydraulic fracturing operations. Current state regulations already provide effective and efficient oversight that is specific to the needs of the states,” the letter states, alleging the planned rules will be economically harmful. In May, Interior floated draft rules that would, among other requirements, force drillers operating on federal and Indian lands to disclose chemicals used when employing the method dubbed “fracking.” Fracking involves high-pressure injections of water, chemicals and sand into shale formations to open seams that enable hydrocarbons to flow. The method is enabling a boom in energy production from shale rock formations in several regions, which has largely occurred on state and private lands. But the boom is bringing fears of water pollution and other environmental damage with it. Interior had earlier planned to finalize the rules by the end of 2012, but announced last week that the timeline has been pushed back. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/273229-gop-govs-urge-obama-to-nix-fracking-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355790508199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 19:28:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355791057321-47</Id><Topic><Title>Boehner looks like a whipped pup.</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355783533344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 17:32:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its funny the whitetrash on this board laughs at Nancy Pelosi yet she has more balls than boehner ever dreamed of.

On behalf of the wind industry, we plead guilty as charged. As Zehner knows, there is a large body of evidence indicating that increasing our use of wind energy drives electricity prices down. A May 2012 study by Synapse Energy Economics found that adding wind energy in the U.S. Midwest would save consumers between $65 and $200 per year. Adding wind energy to the grid displaces the output of the most expensive and least efficient power plants first, so even relatively small additions of wind energy can cause major declines in the price of electricity. In addition, wind energy has no fuel cost, which protects consumers from fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels, much like a fixed-rate mortgage protects homeowners from volatility in interest rates. While most American households would gladly see a significant reduction in the more than $1,000 per year that they spend on electricity, some wind energy competitors who want to keep their profit margins high view that as a bad thing. Zehner’s argument is not as blatantly self-interested, but is a bit more circuitous: wind energy drives electricity prices down, which encourages people to use more electricity, which in turn erases the environmental benefits of using wind energy. That argument should make an economist’s head explode, as it assumes that consumers’ response to reduced electricity prices is so strong that they overcompensate by using so much more electricity that they actually end up spending more on electricity. In fact, economists’ data confirm that consumers’ “price elasticity of demand” for electricity is nowhere near strong enough to make Zehner’s argument valid. While a consumer might switch from one soft drink brand to another if the price of one went down, Zehner is unlikely to see many consumers switching from hauling blocks of ice to using electric refrigerators and air conditioning if the price of electricity comes down. As a result, Zehner fails in his argument that wind will not produce the expected reductions in pollution, though he is correct that wind will drive down prices for consumers. Zehner similarly fails in his unsupported attacks on the lifecycle environmental impacts of renewable energy. Every one out of dozens of peer-reviewed studies have found that the lifecycle environmental impact of renewable sources is at most a few percent of that of fossil fuels, as documented in a recent literature survey conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Finally, Zehner fails to understand that wind energy is being reliably integrated onto the power system today without a need for additional “backup.” Power grid operators have always held significant generation in reserve to accommodate unexpected swings in electricity demand as well as instantaneous failures at fossil and nuclear power plants. In contrast, changes in wind output occur far more gradually and are predictable, which makes it easy for grid operators to accommodate wind energy with these existing sources of flexibility.   All data and analyses by independent grid operators, government entities, and utilities confirm that wind energy causes pollution reductions that are as large or larger than expected. As states like Texas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Colorado, and Minnesota have ramped up their use of wind energy in recent years, all have seen drastic declines in pollution from their electric sectors, as documented by U.S. Energy Information Administratioin data that tracks power plant fossil fuel use and emissions. The data is clear that wind is a win-win for America’s consumers and environment. It is a clear sign of desperation when the best argument that wind energy’s opponents have left is that wind energy is too effective at reducing electricity prices for homeowners and businesses.

On behalf of the wind industry, we plead guilty as charged. As Zehner knows, there is a large body of evidence indicating that increasing our use of wind energy drives electricity prices down. A May 2012 study by Synapse Energy Economics found that adding wind energy in the U.S. Midwest would save consumers between $65 and $200 per year. Adding wind energy to the grid displaces the output of the most expensive and least efficient power plants first, so even relatively small additions of wind energy can cause major declines in the price of electricity.

Of course the planters needed the 2nd amendment to defend their right to own slaves. They no longer have the right to own slaves and no private citizen requires an armory either. They should have no right to bear arms either if they are found to be mentally defective, unreliable, and just which types of guns they can own should be regulated too...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355802575531</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 22:49:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355802643349-55</Id><Topic><Title>Possession of a handgun protects us</Title><Username>mainst9</Username><Timestamp>1355774366162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:59:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sarah Brady, if she knew you, would call you a #$%$ - or worse.
