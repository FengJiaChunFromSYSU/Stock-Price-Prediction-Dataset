That's some real balance there. The House Republicans are quite angry, too, especially at Obama's news conference where he declared victory and tried to impose a fait accompli on them. Things appear "quite difficult" the prospect of a vote on the Senate bill today. Things look much more promising for a vote on an amended version that has more spending cuts and fewer taxes in it - one that the Senate Democrats and Obama will not accept. Obama accomplished absolutely nothing by refusing to negotiate with the House Republicans, except to dramatically increase the odds of there being no deal at all to resolve the "fiscal cliff," something which at this point is a fait accompli anyway... Wall Street will not be pleased with such raised expectations and then the harsh reality.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357051864083</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 09:51:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357055462756-4</Id><Topic><Title>It's a New Year in Germany and Much of the World</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1356997312558</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 18:41:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We are talking about someone named "Pelosi " that flew back home each Thursday and back to work on Sunday at tax payer expense.

If they could identify him as a Tea Party member - that would be the headline and the topic of the first two paragraphs. A woman who gave birth under arrest and her boyfriend were facing weapons charges Monday after authorities said they found a substance used to make bombs and papers titled "The Terrorist Encyclopedia" in their apartment in a picturesque Manhattan neighborhood. Morgan Gliedman, the 27-year-old daughter of a prominent New York City physician, and Aaron Greene, 31, were arrested Saturday after officers with a search warrant discovered a plastic container with 7 grams of HMTD, a highly explosive white powder used in bomb making, police and prosecutors said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Monday the substance was powerful, but it was difficult to speculate how much damage it would do in that amount. Also found in the living room were numerous written items containing instructions on the manufacture of explosive materials and bombs, including a collection of pages that had a cover page entitled "The Terrorist Encyclopedia" and a booklet entitled "Deadly Homemade Weapons," court papers said. No political writings were discovered, and Kelly said the investigation was continuing into whether the couple had any larger plans or ties to any radical groups. They didn't show up on any watch lists. Investigators also recovered a sawed-off shotgun, a commercial replica of a grenade launcher and ammunition, and chemical precursors to HMTD also were found in the living room, according to police and court papers. Greene was held without bail after he appeared in state court in Manhattan on Sunday. Gliedman, who was nine months pregnant when she was arrested, went into labor and gave birth to a baby girl named Melanie, police said. She was hospitalized and had not yet appeared in court. It was not clear who will represent her. A call to her family was not immediately returned Monday. Authorities said both defendants had drug problems. "The whole situation's sad," said attorney Lisa Pelosi, who represented Greene. She declined further comment. Greene is due back in court Friday. Greene claimed he was a Harvard graduate, but the university was closed Monday and it was not immediately possible to determine whether he actually attended the school. Police went to the apartment in Manhattan's Greenwich Village on Saturday morning with a search warrant stemming from a possible credit card fraud by Gliedman, after a tip warning authorities of explosives inside the home. The tip came from a couple who had met Greene and Gliedman in Washington Square Park recently, and said they noticed the cache when they went to their apartment a few weeks ago, Kelly said. The picturesque street was blocked off Saturday as officers searched the home.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1357056248343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 11:04:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357058522912-6</Id><Topic><Title>All Markets are FROZEN!!

The correct thing to do would be to not vote on the bill at all and pass the issue to the next Congress to deal with. Then it could be carefully debated, and a comprehensive solution covering taxes and spending arrived at, something that should have been done years ago anyway. Insulting the House leadership by not including them in the negotiations, and then expecting them to rubber stamp a bill they had no part in writing, maximizes the chances of them do just that. Obama said some time ago he wanted a comprehensive solution these problems anyway. Handing him a crushing defeat on his bill, and one he worked hard to get passed, will help speed him to the better outcome. On the other hand, if the Republicans lack the will to test him they might as well just proclaim him Emperor.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357072533351</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 15:35:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357073326365-10</Id><Title>Exxon Building 800 Bell Houston FILLED with ASBESTOS!!!</Title><Msg>Yep.
