What most people don't realize is, Denmark has not reduced their dependency on fossil fuels at all, with all the wind energy, due to the fact that wind energy requires a backup system (oil or natural gas). When we're sitting on some of the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, why would we want to waste our time with wind? Have you ever looked at the energy density output of wind? Or the horsepower generated per-acre from wind? It's insane to even consider it. Environmentalists are attracted to wind energy because it's "stylish".

Propel Clean Mobility Centers offer biodiesel and FlexFuel E85, an ethanol-gasoline blend, at 33 locations in California and Washington State. The most recently opened stations, which also sell regular gasoline and diesel, are at 3291 W. Florida Ave. in Hemet and 1850 E. Holt Blvd. in Ontario. E85 is a blend of 85 percent denatured ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. E85 cannot be used in a conventional, gasoline-only engine In general, E85 reduces fuel economy and range by about 20 to 30 percent, because ethanol contains less energy than gasoline. But the pump price for E85 is often lower than regular gasoline. Biodiesel is derived from plant and animal fats, such as recycled cooking oil, and soybean oil. Both of the alternative fuels reduce reliance on imported oil. They also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particulate matter and toxins such as benzene, according to the EPA. blogDOTpeDOTcom/environment/2013/02/01/alternative-fuels-two-inland-stations-open/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359787111972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 01:38:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359787800360-5</Id><Title>Ag Processing Idles Ethanol Mill in Nebraska on High Corn Prices</Title><Msg>Ag Processing Idles Ethanol Mill in Nebraska on High Corn Prices By Mario Parker - Feb 1, 2013 4:35 PM MT 0 Comments Ag Processing Inc., a grains processor, said it shut operations at its ethanol plant in Hastings, Nebraska, because of high corn prices. The plant was idled today, and the company will evaluate market conditions to determine when it will restart, Omaha, Nebraska-based Ag Processing said in a statement on its website. Before Ag Processing’s announcement, 18 ethanol plants had been idled since June as drought in the Midwest scorched and shrank corn crops and raised costs to make the grain into ethanol, according to data from the Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group. “Our facility, like other corn processing plans in the Midwest, continues to experience negative margins due to higher corn prices driven by ongoing drought conditions and lower ethanol prices,” Ag Processing Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Keith Spackler said in the statement. Denatured ethanol for February delivery has risen 14 percent in the past year to $2.469 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. That compares to a 15 percent jump in corn to $7.36 a bushel. The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, is minus 20 cents a gallon, down from minus 22 cents yesterday, assuming one bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel, data compiled by Bloomberg show. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-01/ag-processing-idles-ethanol-mill-in-nebraska-on-high-corn-prices.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359787800360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 01:50:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359788081389-6</Id><Title>Ethanol Weakens Against Gasoline on Ample Supply, Lower Demand</Title><Msg>Ethanol Weakens Against Gasoline on Ample Supply, Lower Demand By Mario Parker - Feb 1, 2013 2:22 PM MT 0 Comments Ethanol weakened against gasoline on concern demand isn’t strong enough to cut a glut of the biofuel. The spread widened 1.68 cents a gallon to 58.46 cents after a Jan. 25 Energy Information Administration report showed stockpiles climbed to a six-week high even as production plunged to the lowest level since the Energy Department’s statistical arm began tracking weekly data in June 2010. “It’s too much ethanol chasing too little demand,” said Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. “Ethanol has decoupled from gasoline.” Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.469 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest since Sept. 10. Prices advanced 12 percent in January, the first monthly gain since October, and are up 13 percent this year. Gasoline for March delivery increased 2.19 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.0536 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol. Based on March contracts for ethanol and gasoline the additive traded at a 57.76-cent discount to the motor fuel. The February ethanol contract expires Feb. 5. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 87 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Jan. 25, down from 90 percent a year earlier, Energy Information Administration data showed in a Jan. 30 report. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-01/ethanol-strengthens-against-gasoline-as-discount-spurs-blending.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359788081389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 01:54:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359791053718-7</Id><Topic><Title>WAHLEE WAS DEPORTED!</Title><Username>wahleee_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1359766723167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:58:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hope they took that POS #$%$ slob maxipad with him. 2 of the lowest human beings I have ever seen.

The oil-sands industry, Canada’s fastest growing CO2 polluter, says he’s out of step. The contradiction of an industry seeking a new tax on itself has emerged in energy-rich Canada because producers are concerned the crude they process from tar-like sands will be barred from foreign markets for releasing more carbon in its production than competing fossil fuels. Oil companies operating in Canada such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Total SA (FP) of France and Canada’s Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) plan to convert billions of barrels of the sticky bitumen into diesel and gasoline. Under foreign and domestic pressure, they now see a greenhouse-gas levy helping to provide access to markets and more predictable costs for Canada’s biggest export industry, which shipped C$68 billion ($68 billion) of oil in 2011. A carbon tax “is one of the ways to promote better performance of the industry,” Andre Goffart, president of Total’s Canadian unit, said in an interview in Calgary. “The principles are probably agreed upon by the players. The question is, where do you put the level to incentivize the industry to go in a more efficient way?” Europe’s third-largest oil company joins a group of competitors around the world calling for a price on carbon. Many favor taxes over a cap-and-trade system to encourage cuts. After European Union emissions credits plummeted in price, securitizing CO2 has lost favor among jurisdictions considering pollution limits, said Guy Turner, director of commodities and energy economics at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London. ‘What You’re Getting’ “At least with a tax, you know what you’re getting,” Turner said in an interview from London. “The cost is in effect fixed. Industry will be able to lobby for a rate of tax that it feels it can wear.” European Union carbon permits have sunk 88 percent from a 2008 intraday high of 29.69 euros ($40.30) a metric ton. Permits for December dropped 10 percent yesterday to close at 3.42 euros, data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London show. “A carbon tax maximizes the use of markets and minimizes complexity,” Pius Rolheiser, an Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) spokesman, said in a phone interview. “On that basis, a carbon tax is a better approach.” Imperial, Canada’s second-largest oil producer by market value, is 70 percent-owned by Exxon. Brian Ferguson, chief executive officer of Calgary-based oil-sands producer Cenovus, said last year that a carbon tax is “probably the most effective means of regulating and addressing the cost of carbon.” Emissions Debate The debate in Canada over how to slow the pace of emissions from the nation’s fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases echoes choices being considered around the world. Conservative Prime Minister Harper, who said in remarks during a 2008 election campaign that a carbon tax would “screw everybody” in Canada, favors other ways to curb greenhouse gases. “Our government is committed to reduce GHG emissions at the industrial source rather than through an economy-distorting carbon tax regime,” Rob Taylor, a spokesman for Environment Minister Peter Kent, said in an e-mail. The country needs to meet a 2020 commitment to lower emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels under the Copenhagen Accord. Nations such as Australia and subnational governments have already chosen taxes to cut pollution. Pricing ‘Intuition’ Australia, the world’s largest per-capita emitter of greenhouse gases, in July set a fixed carbon price that works much like a tax of A$23 ($24) a ton for the country’s largest 500 emitters, including miner BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) The Canadian province of British Columbia enacted a carbon tax in 2008 that covers about 70 percent of fossil-fuel consumption, making its gasoline among the most expensive in the country. “The intuition behind carbon pricing is straightforward: we should tax things that we do not want, and making it more expensive will reduce pollution,” Marc Lee, senior economist at the Ottawa-based Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives in Vancouver, said in a Jan. 13 report. “A carbon tax provides greater certainty around the price of GHG emissions, but poses a great deal of uncertainty around actual emission reductions.” British Columbia’s carbon tax is currently pegged at C$30 a ton and adds about 6.7 cents to a liter of gasoline. The tax has helped the province’s per-capita emissions decline almost 10 percent from 2008 to 2010, with families paying an average of C$386 per household, the report said. Hydropower Reliance Neighboring Alberta, home to the oil-sands industry, has a carbon levy of C$15 a ton for industrial emitters that exceed limits. Finland was the first country to enact a carbon tax, followed by Sweden in 1991 and a handful of other jurisdictions including the U.S. city of Boulder, Colorado. Per-capita emissions in Canada, which relies on low-carbon hydropower for almost 60 percent of its electricity generation, are only exceeded by Australia, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia among large polluters. “The world is monetizing carbon,” said Daniel Gagnier, president of the Energy Policy Institute of Canada, an advocacy group funded by business. “If a country looks at Canada and says your energy exports are too carbon-intensive, then it becomes an economic competitiveness issue.” A case in point is TransCanada Corp. (TRP)’s Keystone XL pipeline. The project would bring Canadian heavy crude to the Gulf Coast, helping companies earn world prices for their commodity, which currently trades at a $31.75 discount to benchmark U.S. crude because of scant capacity to move oil from Alberta. Lobbying Efforts After two years of lobbying U.S. officials to approve the pipeline, the Canadian government is now watching as environmental groups, emboldened by Canada’s 2011 annulment of the Kyoto Protocol, push to derail the $5.3 billion project. At the same time, Canadian politicians are trying to thwart EU plans to implement a carbon-reduction directive that would penalize Canadian crude. Still, global efforts to tax carbon emissions have slowed following the 2008 recession and the failure of negotiators at United Nations-sponsored talks to create a replacement for the Kyoto climate agreement that would include China and the U.S., the world’s largest emitters. Canada, the seventh-largest emitter, was the first of 191 signatories to withdraw from Kyoto. For oil-sands producers, carbon pricing may be the answer to reduce risk associated with carbon regulation and access to markets, said John Stephenson, a Toronto-based fund manager. “What business hates is a lack of clarity,” Stephenson, who helps manage C$2.7 billion at First Asset Investment Management Inc., said by phone. “Even a bad tax would be better than discussions that are endless.” fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/01/why-canada-oil-sands-industry-wants-co2-tax-harper-hates/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359809305213</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 07:48:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359810183537-13</Id><Topic><Title>bad unemployment number is GOOD in the Bernanke Superdebt Superbubble New</Title><Username>jjjinglehimersmith</Username><Timestamp>1359797458848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 04:30:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Debt is an obligation and the bubble generates nothing to repay it...

"We're talking the beginning of summer at the earliest," said the source, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the TransCanada Corp project, which has been pending for more than four and a half years. "It's not weeks until the final decision. It's months." A series of steps still have to be taken by the State Department, where the decision will be made because the 830,000 barrels per day crude oil pipeline crosses the national border. The pipeline will link Alberta's oil sands and North Dakota's Bakken shale fields to refineries and ports in Texas. The State Department did not comment for this story, but last week a spokeswoman said it did not anticipate making the decision before the end of March. Previously, the department had hinted the decision could come in the middle of the first quarter. The administration may be delaying because the pipeline has become a symbol for both opponents and supporters of development of Canada's vast oil sands. Environmentalists concerned about the carbon footprint of the oil sands have seen the decision as the most important President Barack Obama will make on climate change. Proponents say the $5.3 billion project would pour capital into the dismal economy, provide thousands of jobs, and hasten North American energy independence. "The fact the administration is taking its time suggests ... that it wants to succeed with an airtight story that pleases the primary concerns of both sides," said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington. The administration could be figuring out how to balance environmental actions, such as getting tough on coal plant and vehicle emissions, with the impact of pipeline, if it ultimately approves Keystone. Book estimated a final decision would not come till the end of June. The delay is painful in Canada which is suffering persistent, discounted prices for its oil because tight pipeline capacity. The premier of the Western Canadian province of Alberta warned last week that it faced a $6 billion revenue shortfall due to current pipeline constraints. NEXT STEPS AND LEGAL OPTIONS Pipeline watchers have been waiting since mid-December for the State Department to take the next step, issuing a supplemental environmental impact statement, or SEIS, on the project. The State Department, has only said the assessment is expected "in the near future." Once the SEIS is issued, a public comment period of at least 45 days would ensue. The State Department would then consider the comments before finalizing the assessment which could also take time if agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or Army Corps of Engineers express any concerns. Then the State Department will determine whether the project is in the national interest, a decision it makes in consultation with other agencies considering issues such as jobs and economic impacts. The department has not yet decided when it would carry out the determination or about how long it would take, an official there said. Even if the State Department's environmental review gives the go ahead, the project could still be delayed by lawsuits. The department would issue a "record of decision," and once that happens, legal challenges to the process may begin. Danielle Droitsch, director of the Canada Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said her group was focused on trying to push the administration to deny the pipeline. But if it moves forward with the project, her group and others would consider all legal options at that point, she said. Robert Johnston, the director of energy at risk management firm the Eurasia Group, said he believes Keystone will ultimately be approved, even as Obama has pledged to move ahead with climate initiatives. "We still think it's a 65 percent chance it gets approved, and a 35 percent scenario that you get, essentially, another extended climate study," Johnston said. The United States would be denied a reliable source of oil its currently in a position to get if it rejected the line, he said. Any delay past April 1 could set Congress in action. Last week a majority of the U.S. senators urged Obama to approve the project. Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, said he would introduce legislation enabling Congress to approve the pipeline if the late March date comes and goes. The pipeline would take also drain oil from his state, which is undergoing a drilling boom.

According to the report, U.S. renewable energy consumption - including from wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - jumped from 6.4% in 2007 to 9.4% in 2012. In comparison, natural gas rose from 23.4% to 27.2% during that time period. Meanwhile, U.S. consumption of coal declined from 22.5% in 2007 to 18.1% in 2012, and oil consumption fell from 39.3% to 36.7%. Renewable energy sources are being built quickly, and renewable energy production costs are plummeting. The cost of power from a typical large wind farm has decreased from $0.09/kWh in 2009 to $0.08/kWh in 2012, the report notes. Meanwhile, the cost of electricity generated by average large solar power plants has fallen from $0.31/kWh in 2009 to $0.14/kWh in 2012 (excluding the effect of tax credits and other incentives, which would bring those costs down even more). Thanks to these developments, the U.S.’ total installed renewable energy capacity has more than doubled in the five years between 2008 and 2012. In addition, energy efficiency is increasingly becoming a priority, particularly among large power consumers. U.S. utility budgets for efficiency expenditures reached $7 billion in 2011 (the latest available date for which data exists), and financing for energy efficiency retrofits has become increasingly sophisticated, propelling the further greening of U.S. buildings, the report notes. Overall, energy demand decreased by 6.4% from 2007 to 2012, largely due to efficiency gains. As a result of all of these factors, combined with more fuel-efficient vehicles, U.S. energy-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions dropped 13% during that time period and now stand at their lowest levels since 1994, the report says.

Imperial said Kearl’s first development phase will cost $12.9-billion, up from $10.9-billion estimated previously. And the latest estimate is 61-per-cent higher than the original calculation of $8-billion. The energy company’s latest financial setback is tied to delays in transporting equipment for the project, and the harsh winter in northern Alberta further slowed development. Now some analysts are concerned Kearl could miss its expected production start this quarter. Kearl’s escalating budget is another indication of the difficulties facing the oil sands sector, which is grappling with higher costs for materials and labour, as well as discounted prices for heavy crude due to an oversupply caused by transportation bottlenecks – mainly pipelines – for exported oil. Companies are reconsidering planned projects, as the industry re-calibrates spending to boost results that have often failed to impress investors. Suncor Energy Inc., for example, is weighing how and when to proceed with three undeveloped projects. It also withdrew its goal of hitting production of 1 million barrels of oil per day by 2020. Imperial Oil, controlled by Exxon Mobil Corp., expects Kearl to produce its first drops of bitumen this quarter. This timeline has been pushed back before, and doubts remain about the current target. “We would not be surprised to see production not starting up until May,” said Andrew Potter, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Inc. “The bigger impact will likely be to the [Imperial/Exxon] reputation as a ‘premium’ operator,” Mr. Potter said in a research note. The delay in transporting equipment resulted from a battle Imperial Oil lost in Idaho and Montana, where residents urged local officials to reject the company’s plans to move enormous, South Korean-made pieces of the Kearl project on their highways. Critics focused on traffic delays, as well as environmental concerns. Imperial had to take more than 200 of the modules apart so they could be moved on an alternate route. They were later reassembled, a process which required hundreds of people. This pushed up costs and delayed the project, even though the company was previously adamant the damage would not be severe. Imperial on Friday said it will now cost $6.80 per barrel to develop the first and second phase of the project. That is a 10-per-cent increase from its last estimate of $6.20 per barrel. The company originally predicted it would cost $5 per barrel. Imperial still expects a second phase of Kearl to ring in at $8.9-billion, despite revisions to the first phase of the project. It has not released a cost estimate for the final phase of the project, known as “de-bottlenecking,” but it expects the development costs per barrel to be the same as the during first two phases. This means the cost of the entire project will reach about $31.2-billion, the company confirmed. The Kearl mine is expected to produce 345,000 barrels of bitumen per day by 2020, when it is running at full speed. Imperial reported a profit of $1.07-billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.26 per share, compared to $1-billion or $1.18 per share in the final quarter of 2011. The company’s downstream businesses, such as refining, were the brightest spot, posting a profit of $549-million, a record quarterly showing, Imperial said. theglobeandmailDOTcom/globe-investor/first-phase-of-imperial-oils-kearl-project-to-cost-2-billion-more-than-forecast/article8102965/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359812785720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 08:46:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359812972742-18</Id><Topic><Title>XOM ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED 4Q2012 RESULTS</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359727154639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 08:59:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've posted Imperial Oil's estimated 4Q results on yahoo's IMO message board.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359812972742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 08:49:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359814143783-19</Id><Topic><Title>Follow the stock market</Title><Username>amyfajtova849</Username><Timestamp>1301581770000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-03-31 10:29:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great move</Msg><Username>henryjoshep</Username><Timestamp>1359814143783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 09:09:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359832267790-20</Id><Title>Manmade Carbon Pollution Has Already Put Us On Track For 69 Feet Of Sea Level Rise</Title><Msg>Manmade Carbon Pollution Has Already Put Us On Track For 69 Feet Of Sea Level Rise By Joe Romm on Feb 1, 2013 at 12:27 pm The bad news is that we’re all but certain to end up with a coastline at least this flooded (20 meters or 69 feet): IMAGE The “good” news is that this might take 1000 to 2000 years (or longer), and the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and whether we blow past 69 feet to beyond 200 feet. Glaciologist Jason Box makes this point in a Climate Desk interview with Chris Mooney, “Humans Have Already Set in Motion 69 Feet of Sea Level Rise“: So what can we do? For Box, any bit of policy helps. “The more we can cool climate, the slower Greenland’s loss will be,” he explained. Cutting greenhouse gases slows the planet’s heating, and with it, the pace of ice sheet losses. This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who follows the scientific literature. Just last year the National Science Foundation (NSF) reported on paleoclimate research that examined “rock and soil cores taken in Virginia, New Zealand and the Eniwetok Atoll in the north Pacific Ocean.” Lead author Kenneth Miller of Rutgers University said: “The natural state of the Earth with present carbon dioxide levels is one with sea levels about 70 feet higher than now.” And that was only slightly less worrisome than a 2009 paper in Science that found the last time CO2 levels were this high, it was 5° to 10°F warmer and seas were 75 to 120 feet higher. Now I tend to think that if the multiple, simultaneous devastating impacts we are headed toward by century’s end – from widespread Dust-Bowlification to 3 to 6 feet of sea level rise to 10°F warming (20°F in the Arctic) – isn’t enough to motivate action, then just how much we are going to screw up the planet after 2100 won’t do the trick. But there are some people who understand the staggering immorality of handing over to future generations seas rising as fast as 6 to 12 inches a decade for centuries on end. How precisely would people adapt to that? As one thoughtful person recently said, failure to act on climate change “would betray our children and future generations.” Here is a short video of the Box interview: VIDEO If we were truly doubly wise, #$%$ sapiens sapiens, as we cleverly named ourselves, the nation would join with the world in a WWII-scale effort to actually reduce the atmospheric CO2 level from its current 394 parts per million. That would not only lower the ultimate sea level rise, but would slow down the rate of change. Tragically, we are headed for more than a doubling of CO2 concentrations from current levels. For those truly concerned about future generations, consider that on our current emissions path, CO2 levels in 2100 will hit levels last seen when the Earth was 29°F (16°C) hotter. So that not only means an ice-free planet with sea levels more than 200 feet higher than today, but a rate of sea level rise that is beyond imagining. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/02/01/1527551/manmade-carbon-pollution-has-already-put-us-on-track-for-69-feet-of-sea-level-rise/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359832267790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:11:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359835096629-21</Id><Topic><Title>Manmade Carbon Pollution Has Already Put Us On Track For 69 Feet Of Sea Level Rise</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359832267790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:11:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like everything else, carbon emissions are bigger in Texas Posted on February 2, 2013 at 6:00 am by Matthew Tresaugue in Climate, Environment Comments(6) (Photo: Mobility, Flickr) Texas remains America’s undisputed capital of carbon dioxide, a title the industry-heavy state has held since the federal government begin keeping track more than two decades ago. Federal data released Thursday shows Texas continues to generate far more emissions of the heat-trapping gas than any other state. Texas pumped 652 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2010, the most recent year for which figures are available, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported. That was more than the combined emissions of the next two states, California and Pennsylvania. Power plants fueled by coal and natural gas accounted for 220 million metric tons of Texas’ carbon dioxide emissions. Other industries released 211 million metric tons, while cars, trucks and other transportation generated 195 million metric tons. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/02/02/like-everything-else-carbon-emissions-are-bigger-in-texas/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359835096629</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:58:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359836364717-22</Id><Title>US DOE provides $9 million to accelerate solar energy deployment</Title><Msg>US DOE provides $9 million to accelerate solar energy deployment REM Friday, 01 February 2013 US Department of Energy is providing $9 million to seven projects through its SunShot Initiative to accelerate solar energy deployment in the United States. The projects are located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas. The DOE says each represents an opportunity dramatically transform the operations of solar researchers, manufacturers, developers, installers, and policymakers, and speed the commercialization and deployment of affordable, clean solar energy. “Through powerful analytical tools developed by our nation’s top universities and national labs, we can gain unparalleled insight into solar deployment that will help lower the cost of solar power and create new businesses and jobs,” said Energy Secretary Steven Chu. “Projects like these will help accelerate technological and financing innovations – making it easier for American families and businesses to access clean, affordable energy.” As part of the investment, the DOE will provide $7 million to research teams led by Sandia National Laboratories, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Yale University and the University of Texas – Austin. These teams will partner with public and private financial institutions, utilities and state agencies to apply statistical and computational tools to industry problem-solving and lead regional pilot projects across the country to test the impact and scalability of their innovations. For example, Yale University researchers will partner with SmartPower’s New England Solar Challenge to design and implement innovative strategies that can increase the effectiveness of community-led bulk solar purchase programs. The team from the University of Texas – Austin will work with complex datasets from six Texas utilities to better understand customer needs and identify opportunities to streamline installation and interconnection. Similarly, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, will lead another project with Clean Power Finance to develop a computational model to analyze data from a network of U.S. solar installers and help identify new types of community- and regional-scale strategies that drive down financing and deployment costs. Additionally, the Energy Department is investing $2 million across three projects led by the University of North Carolina – Charlotte, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and SRI International to analyze decades’ of scientific publications, patents and cost and production data. Through these projects, researchers will be able to obtain a complete picture on the US solar industry and discover methods to accelerate technological breakthroughs and remove roadblocks to greater cost reduction. Based in Menlo Park, California, SRI International will develop advanced software that reads and analyzes thousands of scientific publications and patents to discover new ways to speed solar energy technology innovation and commercialization. Meanwhile, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina – Charlotte will apply computational tools to patent, cost and production data to speed up solar technology cost reductions and better forecast future cost reductions for new energy technologies. The SunShot Initiative is a collaborative national effort to make solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of energy by the end of the decade. renewableenergymagazineDOTcom/article/us-doe-provides-9-million-to-accelerate-20130201</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359836364717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:19:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359846906358-23</Id><Topic><Title>Keystone pipeline decision to languish until mid-June-US source</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359811238670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 08:20:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there are several issues with Keystone.

(XOM), the world’s largest company by market value, expects to begin bitumen production at its Kearl oil sands project in Alberta before the end of March after weather delays, a company executive said. Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is stockpiling ore and preparing to introduce solvent to the processing plant, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a conference call today. Initial production will be about 37,000 barrels a day, increasing to 110,000 by the end of 2013. “The weather situation was a major factor in the startup moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year to the first quarter,” he said. “Weather came earlier than normal, and then it has just been brutally cold up there. And so we’ve had to adjust accordingly.” Lagging infrastructure has created a glut of oil in Alberta that pushed prices to a record discount to U.S. crude in December. Western Canada Select oil in Alberta was priced at a $42.50-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, on Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was at $31.50 below the U.S. benchmark at 12:13 p.m. New York time today. Exxon can run all 110,000 barrels of Kearl production in its own refineries, Rosenthal said. “We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but we do not have an issue in terms of logistics moving those barrels outside of the Kearl project and into the market,” he said. businessweekDOTcom/news/2013-02-01/exxon-says-kearl-oil-sands-production-to-begin-this-quarter</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359862242636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:30:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
