He said China hopes to sign a deal on building a natural-gas pipeline during the visit, Xi’s first trip abroad since he was named Communist Party general secretary in November and president last week. “We will have some outcomes related to energy, investment and major projects of strategic importance,” Cheng said. “We expect some breakthrough on these pragmatic cooperation fields.” Cheng struck a different tone than Gazprom Chairman Viktor Zubov, who said yesterday that talks with China are difficult because of disagreements over price for natural gas China wants to buy. A pipeline deal would help supply the world’s second- biggest economy as demand in Europe weakens. Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural-gas producer, said last month it plans to sign a contract with China National Petroleum Corp. after almost a decade of talks to supply as much as 68 billion cubic meters of gas a year. Cheng said companies and working groups from the two sides are having “intensive discussions” in Moscow on transporting natural gas and constructing a pipeline. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-03-20/china-expects-energy-talks-breakthrough-in-xi-s-visit-to-russia.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363788718082</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 10:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363794928575-10</Id><Topic><Title>13 INDICATOR XOM BUY/SELL/HOLD REPORT !</Title><Username>barry.white95</Username><Timestamp>1362318160412</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 08:42:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>████████████LOADS A KEY STROKE LOGGER!!! ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</Msg><Username>thatsmrmorontoyou</Username><Timestamp>1363794928575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363795043701-11</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>████████████LOADS A KEY STROKE LOGGER!!! ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</Msg><Username>thatsmrmorontoyou</Username><Timestamp>1363795043701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:57:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363796197675-12</Id><Title>Even more oil resources added to the massive global glut....</Title><Msg>Another big oil find in the Gulf of Mexico, one of the biggest ever. Oil production is shooting up globally, even as demand plummets in Europe and the United States from efficiency. This always happens whenever energy prices or any other commodity prices is high - capital is deployed, technology improves, supply increases, and in the end the price crashes. There is no worse investment on this planet at the moment than an oil &amp; gas share, or a share in any commodity based, capital intensive business. Capital is not in short supply - in fact it is more abundant now than it has ever been - and it is just a matter of time until its potential to increase supply, lower prices, and demolish profit margins is realized.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363796197675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363796916482-13</Id><Title>FNHC - Article issued trading at 30% value of a growing invest port and no debt - Seeking alpha.</Title><Msg>It all looks real good here and a big move soon as the news is starting to flow.

Sen. Pat Toomey's (R-Pa.) amendment aimed to shift $60 million from the Defense biofuels effort to the department's operations and management budget. The measure continued a fight between some defense- and budget-minded conservatives and Democrats and Midwest Republicans whose states host sizable biofuel operations. Some conservatives have argued the biofuels are too expensive when the military is staring down $500 billion of cuts slated for the next decade. They also object to using the military to kick-start biofuel technology. But the program's supporters say the military has long invested in technology, and argue biofuels save the military money in the long term. They contend the fuel insulates the armed forces from oil price shocks that eat at the operations and management budget. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), a proponent of the program, praised the Senate's actions. "Our military is on the cutting edge technologically, but much of our fighting capability relies on foreign fossil fuels and decades-old power systems. That dependence has very real human and economic costs," he said in a Wednesday statement. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/289361-senate-rejects-amendment-gutting-military-biofuels-program-by-40-59-vote</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363817231723</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 18:07:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363818583129-20</Id><Topic><Title>My, my, my...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363580883761</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 00:28:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stopem fromfloppen German for Bra</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1363818583129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 18:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363819799202-21</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH XOM Analyst Report</Title><Username>november_jason</Username><Timestamp>1362658049197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:07:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Got very tired of all the click here for Latest Info.

Russia’s top crude producer OAO Rosneft will increase exports to China by some 34 million tonnes to around 50 million tonnes (1 million barrels per day) by 2018, the sources told Reuters. The deal could be signed later this week during a visit to Moscow by China’s new president, Xi Jinping, as a part of a broader agreement which may include more arms deliveries and long-discussed gas supply. The oil agreement may also involve loans up to $30-billion for Rosneft, which is in a process of acquiring Anglo-Russian oil company TNK-BP for $55-billion. A Rosneft spokesman declined comment. “No one expected that Rosneft would venture for such a massive oil supply increase to China,” a source said, adding that thanks to possible cheap money from China, Rosneft may refinance the loans it amassed from Western banks for the TNK-BP deal. The source said that on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin was expected to chair a meeting attended by Igor Sechin, his long-standing ally and Rosneft’s president, as well as newly-appointed Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina and Federal Customs Service officials, to discuss the deal. Russia has been steadily increasing crude exports to Asia at the expense of Europe with flows due to amount to around 15 per cent of its oil exports this year via pipelines to China and theglobeandmailDOTcom/report-on-business/international-business/asian-pacific-business/rosneft-deal-puts-china-top-of-russias-oil-customers/article10012827/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363835105762</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 23:05:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363837123047-23</Id><Topic><Title>Currency Purchase</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363802340978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:59:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sold for € @1.1682 €/£... cost: 1.1681 €/£ 100% €</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363837123047</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 23:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363838049691-24</Id><Topic><Title>My, my, my...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363580883761</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 00:28:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nein... den büstenhalter, oder dessous für die besonderen stunden</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363838049691</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 23:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
