More than 120 Florida county officials and scientists sent a letter to President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney today urging them to address, while campaigning and debating in Florida, how they will deal with sea level rise. The letter asks candidates to answer three questions while in the state: •What will be the federal government’s planning and policy priorities in order to reduce the risks of future sea level rise? •What will be the polices for adaptive measures to respond to current and future impacts of sea level rise? •How would you work with the rest of the world to address rising sea levels and other effects of climate change? It also outlines what could happen if sea level rise is not addressed in Florida: As citizens and scientists concerned about the impacts and costs of sea level rise on our nation, we urge you to address this issue when you will be in Boca Raton, Florida. Scientists project increased coastal and inland flooding and inundation, an increased likelihood of significant damage to key aspects of our urban infrastructure, and compromised drinking water sources in more and more communities. The porous limestone underlying much of Florida resembles Swiss cheese, making sea walls ineffective and the state particularly vulnerable to sea level rise by allowing subsurface water to penetrate far inland. Because Florida is so densely populated, it is estimated 40 percent of the population and housing units at risk from sea level rise in the nation are here, in the state of Florida. Unfortunately, global sea level rise is a danger that must be considered by the next president of the United States. The issue threatens the future of Florida, the nation, and communities around the world. Providing effective solutions will challenge all levels of government. For Florida, sea level rise isn’t a distant threat: it’s a real and pressing problem. The letter states that sea levels rose by about eight inches in the twentieth century, and that this rise has caused flooding, abandonment of drinking water wells due to saline intrusion, and flood control structure failures. In Miami Beach, city leaders are considering a $206 million update of its outdated drainage system in order to deal with prolonged flooding in some neighborhoods that has “become the norm after heavy storms.” Mentioning sea level rise and other climate-related issues in Florida may not only be a win for Floridians, though. Data shows that if the candidates want to win votes in swing states, including Florida, they should talk about climate change. A Yale and George Mason study showed that 79 percent of voters in swing states want the U.S. to take some effort (small, medium or large) on global warming, and 69 percent of independent voters in swing states say the U.S. should make a medium or large-scale effort to reduce global warming. Other swing states are experiencing the effects of climate change already as well: Colorado wildfires caused about $500 million in property damage this year and are still burning in some places. So far, both candidates have seemed reluctant to break the climate silence, but addressing climate change in these states could be a strategically important move, particularly for President Obama. thinkprogress</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350105439282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 01:17:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350106860712-2</Id><Title>Renewable ‘frenzy’ in Japan but Germany considers suppport cap - phasing in a tax on oil, natural gas &amp; coal</Title><Msg>Renewable ‘frenzy’ in Japan but Germany considers suppport cap 12 October 2012 There has been a ‘frenzy’ of activity in the Japanese renewable energy market over the last year, while Germany is considering a cap on support levels. Japan has added 912 MW of new renewable capacity since April and has a further 1780 MW of capacity approved by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, driven in part by a feed-in tariff introduced in July. As the nation looks to move away from its reliance on nuclear power, the Ministry expects a further 2.5 GW of renewable generation to be added by the end of March next year. Most of that new capacity is solar, with solar power accounting for 83% of renewable energy development since the introduction of the feed-in tariff. Meanwhile, the government is also phasing in a tax on oil, natural gas and coal over the next five years, on top of levies already in place on fossil fuels. But in Germany, the government is planning to limit support for wind and biomass generation, after bringing in similar measures for solar photovoltaics. For years, renewable energy generators in Germany have been paid at above market rates for the electricity they produce leading to concerns that incentives are distorting the market. Solar incentives for domestic installations have now been capped, and tariff rates decrease as the installation rate goes up. Similar measures are now likely for wind power and biomass, although the authorities are also planning on increasing the overall target for renewables from 35% by 2020 to 40%. The aim of the modifications is not to slow the expansion of renewables but limit the financial burden on consumers. energyefficiencynews</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350106860712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 01:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350108463966-3</Id><Topic><Title>Iraq Iran Syria alliance not a surprise to US officials</Title><Username>rockhardchicano</Username><Timestamp>1350072199445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 16:03:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that supposed based on some report you read??

MILWAUKEE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - A former aide to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was convicted on Friday of stealing money from a fund for families of U.S. soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. A jury in Milwaukee County Circuit Court found Kevin Kavanaugh guilty of embezzling more than $42,000 from Operation Freedom, a military appreciation event held each year at the Milwaukee County Zoo. Kavanaugh, who worked for Walker when the first-term Republican governor served as Milwaukee County executive, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. Sentencing is expected on Dec. 7. Kavanaugh, 62, was the treasurer of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, a charity involved in Operation Freedom, from 2006 to 2009. Walker appointed him to serve on the Milwaukee County Veteran Service Commission during Walker's term as Milwaukee County executive.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350136623927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 09:57:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350136760892-11</Id><Topic><Title>ROFL - I doubled my portfolio Trading XOM!</Title><Username>jeffryrobinson109</Username><Timestamp>1350132741631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 08:52:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Something is up and we will know soon!</Msg><Username>carminecarr840</Username><Timestamp>1350136760892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 09:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350137143095-12</Id><Title>Biden lied, people died</Title><Msg>I always say what I mean,” Joe Biden said Thursday. The notoriously gaffe-prone train enthusiast and current vice president of the United States made a number of factually inaccurate statements during last night’s debate. 1. The Obama administration “did not know” the Libyan embassy had requested additional security prior to the terrorist attack that killed four Americans “We weren’t told they wanted more security there,” Biden said in response to a charge from Republican opponent Paul Ryan. “We did not know they wanted more security.” The vice president’s statement stands in direct contrast to sworn testimony from State Department officials during a congressional hearing earlier this week. Two security officials working in Libya at the time told members of Congress they repeatedly requested additional security prior to the attack out of concern for their safety, but were denied. “All of us at post were in sync that we wanted these resources,” said Eric Nordstrom, the former head of regional security in Libya. “We felt great frustration that those requests were ignored or just never met,” lamented Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, a Utah National Guardsman who led a security team in Libya. State Department officials have confirmed that repeated security requests were made and subsequently denied. Nordstrom said he believed the requests were not approved “because there would be too much political cost.” The White House now claims Biden only meant that neither he nor President Obama was personally informed of the security requests, but press secretary Jay Carney on Friday awkwardly declined to say whether or not they ever were briefed on the matter. 2. Ryan and House Republicans “cut” embassy security by $300 million The House Republican budget, which Ryan authored, proposed spending about $22 billion less on non-defense discretionary spending in 2014 compared with Obama’s budget, or about 0.63 percent of the federal budget for that year. Budgets do not typically identify specific cuts, as those are determined by congressional appropriations committees. However, Democrats have extrapolated that $300 million of the $22 billion would be cut from embassy construction, maintenance, and security. That is not necessarily true, however. And it is certainly not true that Republicans have “cut” the embassy funding—because the Ryan budget was never enacted. A senior State Department official who testified before Congress earlier this week said budget considerations were not a factor in the decision to deny the U.S. Libyan delegation’s repeated requests for additional security. 3. The Obama administration has “decimated” al Qaeda “We decimated al Qaeda central,” Biden said, echoing a popular Obama campaign talking point. Intelligence reports and other sources, however, have indicated that the Islamic terrorist network responsible for the 9-11 attacks is actually on the rise throughout the greater Middle East and elsewhere. The Free Beacon‘s Bill Gertz recently reported on an internal Pentagon report describing the terrorist group’s resurgence. Most recently, an al Qaeda offshoot has been credited with carrying out the deadly attack in Libya that claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and several other Americans. “Al Qaeda is, unfortunately, alive and well in the Maghreb, Yemen, and elsewhere, as the administration will probably admit after the election,” former National Security Council member Elliott Abrams told the Washington Free Beacon earlier this week. “The claim that the organization was rendered toothless after [Osama bin Laden] was killed is simply not accurate, and every terrorism specialist in our government knows that.” Lara Logan, chief foreign correspondent for CBS News, recently described the Obama administration’s declaration of victory in the war on terror a “major lie.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350137143095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:05:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350137180418-13</Id><Topic><Title>Biden lied, people died</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350137143095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:05:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4. Obama doesn’t want to raise taxes on families and small businesses earning less than $1 million a year. “The middle class will pay less and people making a million dollars or more will begin to contribute slightly more,” Biden said of President Obama’s tax plan. “We can’t afford $800 billion going to people who [are] making a minimum of $1 million,” he added. President Obama has often stated his desire to raise taxes on all individuals and small businesses earning at least $200,000 a year, a proposal he included in his most recent budget resolution. Doing so is estimated to raise about $800 billion in new revenue over the next decade. “Biden appeared to have moved the goal posts,” wrote Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s in-house fact-checker. Raising tax rates on incomes above $1 million only, which some Democrats have proposed, would raise just $463 billion, or about half the figure Biden cited. White House press secretary Jay Carney on Friday was forced to disavow Biden’s inaccurate portrayal of the president’s tax plan. 5. Syria is five times the size of Libya “[Syria] is a different country, it is five times as large [as Libya] geographically,” Biden said. This claim is literally false. Libya has a geographic area of 1.76 million square kilometers, according to the Central Intelligence Agency. Syria has a geographic area of 185,180 square kilometers. Libya is 9.5 times larger than Syria geographically. 6. Obama has ordered all American troops out of Afghanistan by 2014 “We are leaving [Afghanistan] in 2014. Period,” Biden said Thursday. However, the administration has discussed maintaining an “enduring presence”—in the words of Defense Secretary Leon Panetta—in Afghanistan beyond 2104. That would likely consist of somewhere between 10,000 to 15,000 military advisers and special forces troops, contingent on an agreement with the government of Afghanistan. 7.The federal government is not forcing Catholic institutions to cover contraception “With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact,” Biden said. Yet 35 lawsuits against the HHS mandate, which forces insurance companies to cover contraception for free, are pending right now, including many from Catholic universities. The Becket Fund pointed out this fact in an email this morning objecting to the Vice President’s comments. After an initial uproar against the Health and Human Services mandate requiring institutions to pay for insurance coverage of contraception, the Obama administration announced that “the cost would be shifted to health insurance companies,” reported the New York Times. However, this concession has not placated religious groups, who argue that the rule violates the first amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom. 8. Biden voted against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars The vice president said economic crisis of 2008 happened in part because of Paul Ryan “voting to put two wars on a credit card.” “I was there, I voted against them,” Biden continued. “I said, no, we can’t afford that.” Then-Sen. Biden voted for the Afghanistan resolution on Sept. 14, 2001, authorizing “the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States.” And on Oct. 11, 2002, Biden voted for a resolution authorizing unilateral military action in Iraq. Biden did, however, vote against the First Gulf War to repel the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, arguing that the U.S. had no “vital interests” in the region.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350137180418</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:06:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350137373157-14</Id><Title>Obama’s Constitution</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama is running roughshod over the Constitution, legal scholars say, by disregarding it, changing laws outside the legislative process, and extending federal power in unprecedented ways. The president has “profound disdain for the Constitution,” said David Rivkin, a lawyer at the BakerHostetler law firm in Washington, DC. “Across a whole host of policy areas, President Obama and other high officials in his administration have pushed the envelope of anything attempted before,” said Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Cato Institute. Under the president’s judicial philosophy, legislation ideally “streamlines government action” so it can “grow and experiment,” all while overcoming barriers like the checks and balances built into the Constitution, said Charles Kesler, a professor of government and constitutional scholar at Claremont McKenna College. A pending lawsuit against the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exemplifies several aspects of the complaints legal scholars have against the president’s treatment of the Constitution. The State National Bank of Big Springs, Texas launched a lawsuit against Dodd-Frank in June, joined by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the 60 Plus Association. The lawsuit argues that three parts of the bill—the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Orderly Liquidation Authority, and the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel (FSOC)—all violate the Constitution, according to Adam White, a lawyer at Boyden Gray &amp; Associates who is working on the lawsuit. Three states—Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Michigan—joined the lawsuit in September, arguing that the Orderly Liquidation Authority is unconstitutional. The CFPB and the FSOC, said White, both violate the separation of powers. “Dodd-Frank authorizes the CFPB to define and prosecute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices,” White said, and this ability to define constitutes legislation, which is forbidden under the separation of powers. “Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act delegates effectively unbounded power to the CFPB, and couples that power with provisions insulating the CFPB against meaningful checks by the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches,” reads the lawsuit. White said that the CFPB does not receive its money through congressional appropriations, but rather from the Federal Reserve, insulating it from congressional oversight. He also emphasized that CFPB director, Richard Cordray, has a high level of job security, as the president cannot fire him at will as he can with Cabinet appointees. The lawsuit says that the FSOC “has sweeping and unprecedented discretion to choose which nonbank financial companies to designate as ‘systemically important,’” that is, too big to fail. Yet this discretion is “not limited by any meaningful statutory directives,” giving the FSOC “virtually boundless discretion in making its highly consequential designations,” says the lawsuit. White said that independent agencies have sometimes been created by Democratic presidents to form “entrenched structures for preserving progressive priorities,” with the goal of withstanding subsequent shifts in public policy by future presidents or Congresses. “The Supreme Court has recognized that agencies can have limited independence in one form or another,” White said. “Our case does not challenge any of those precedents. Our case simply observes that the Dodd-Frank agencies have independence far greater than the Supreme Court has allowed for any other agency.” “These agencies are so thoroughly insulated from the checks and balances of the other branches of government, that the arrangement violates the Constitution’s separation of powers,” he said. Shapiro called these institutions a “dangerous precedent of technocratic rule unaccountable to the people.” Neither the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nor the Justice Department returned a request for comment. According to Kesler, the president’s judicial philosophy requires taking a structurally inflexible document that views political power as potentially dangerous—and thus divides it between three coequal branches—and changing it to “concentrate political power.” The goal? “Letting good people do good things,” Kesler said. The lawsuit also objects to Obama’s recess appointment of Richard Cordray as director of the CFPB. “There has never been a president who has appointed executive branch officials in a blatant disregard of the Senate’s advice and consent power,” Rivkin said. White emphasized that the appointment of Cordray broke many years of precedent for such an action. The president has the power under the Constitution to appoint executive officials while Congress is in recess, but the Constitution never defines what “recess” is. Presidents have typically waited 10 days before appointing officials during a recess, but Obama disregarded that precedent, appointing Cordray while the Senate was in pro forma sessions. The president initially justified the appointment on pragmatic grounds. “When Congress refuses to act, and as a result hurts our economy and puts people at risk, I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them,” Obama said when announcing Cordray’s appointment. Michael McConnell, a law professor at Stanford Law School and a former 10th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, said that it is “almost impossible to justify” the installation. While Kesler pointed to the “living Constitution” judicial approach as giving rise to such executive activism, Jeremy Rabkin, a law professor at George Mason University, gave a slightly different perspective. “I wonder if he has a philosophy,” Rabkin said. Rabkin mused that Obama might be a “cynic” regarding the Constitution, not caring what it means at all. Rabkin accused the president of “reinterpreting the Constitution so it never constrains him.” Rabkin said that Obama “seems to think that the federal government has limitless power… of domestic regulation.” He confessed that many legal scholars agree with this idea, but, Rabkin continued, the president has taken to himself a broad power to “disregard” or rewrite statutes. Most legal scholars do not agree with this assertion of executive power, Rabkin said. The nature and relevance of the Constitution is “not just a casual question for” Obama, Kesler said, as he emphasized Obama’s experience as a lecturer on the Constitution at the University of Chicago. Multiple experts interviewed for this article cited the Obama administration’s willingness to disregard laws for the sake of his policy goals as evidence that the president is disregarding the Constitution. Rivkin cited the changes in welfare work requirements, the changed No Child Left Behind Act requirements, and the president’s implementation of parts of the DREAM Act as examples of the president “blatantly ignoring the laws on the books.” The president “just wanted to get it done,” Rivkin said. Kesler said that simply by executive order, the president “changed the whole structure of American immigration law.” He also cited a great number of exemptions and waivers to laws that the administration has granted. The president has been “extending the power of the federal government in its ability to enforce or not to enforce the law,” Kesler said. McConnell noted a stark difference between the posture Obama took toward the Constitution while campaigning for president and how Obama has governed. “He campaigned for office on a very different basis than the way he ended up governing,” McConnell said. McConnell highlighted Obama’s shifting stances on signing statements, national security measures, and excessive executive power. McConnell called the “gulf” between the pre- and post-election Obama “particularly striking.” McConnell also highlighted the administration’s argument that churches do not have First Amendment rights in hiring and firing, infringing on religious liberty. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled against the administration nine to zero.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350137373157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:09:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350137575070-15</Id><Topic><Title>The Neighbor Test....</Title><Username>pmm_boston</Username><Timestamp>1350128887627</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 07:48:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Biden would probably have me laughing like crazy vs some smirking punk that would get political and start tossing phoney number around like lottery machine.

By Julie Cart, Los Angeles Times October 13, 2012 The Obama administration has formally adopted a plan to help create large-scale solar energy plants, offering incentives for solar developers to cluster projects on 285,000 acres of federal land in the western U.S and opening an additional 19 million acres of the Mojave Desert for new power plants. The plan places 445 square miles of public land in play for utility-scale solar facilities. The program, announced Friday by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar at an event in Las Vegas, will apply to new projects only and not the 17 solar facilities already awarded permits or the 78 currently in the approval pipeline. "This historic initiative provides a road map for landscape-level planning that will lead to faster, smarter utility-scale solar development on public lands," Salazar said. The plan establishes 17 solar energy zones in six Western states, including 154,000 acres in California. The zones were chosen because they avoided major environmental, cultural or other conflicts. The policy encourages developers to select sites within zones by promising minimal environmental reviews and expedited permitting and a range of additional financial incentives. But developers can sidestep the zones under certain conditions. Companies may construct plants on 19 million acres designated as "variance" zones, but the government offers fewer incentives to build there. Another 79 million acres are in exclusion zones, where no energy development is allowed. California has 2 1/2 times more acreage in solar zones than any other state. The state has 750,000 acres in variance areas. Some conservation groups fought to prevent approval of utility-scale projects in the region, contending that the desert — home to scores of endangered plants and animals — was not capable of absorbing industrial-scale projects. "We are ... disappointed to see that vital habitat for the federally threatened desert tortoise is still open to potential development through the variance process," said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president of Defenders of Wildlife. Critics contend that the policies are too late, coming after years of free-for-all leasing that encouraged rampant speculation. Since leasing began, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has been working to process more than 300 solar applications. Many of those are for land in California's Mojave Desert, where counties have seen the cost of private land soar and the desert given over to thousands of acres of mirrors. Earlier this week the Interior Department announced that it had surpassed a milestone — authorizing the first 10,000 megawatts of power. The fast-tracking of solar facilities on public lands is expected to generate nearly 24,000 megawatts of renewable power by 2030, officials said. But so far, the unprecedented urgency given to solar energy projects on public land has yielded only 50 megawatts of produced power, according to officials. Janine Blaeloch of the group Solar Done Right supports renewable energy but said wholesale development of the desert is a mistake. "This should all be happening on rooftops and in cities," Blaeloch said. "But that wouldn't profit the big utilities, and industry wouldn't be able to get tax breaks, so we wreck the desert instead. We aren't getting that public land back. Once it's industrialized, everything that lives there and everything we enjoy about it will be gone." latimes</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350160142211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:29:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350164752198-21</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Yahoo Finance charts - all on one screen - for free</Title><Username>kevininthecity72</Username><Timestamp>1350151270976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 14:01:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, I just downloaded it and I might end up using this every day now...</Msg><Username>peelingoutsummer</Username><Timestamp>1350164752198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 17:45:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350169534145-22</Id><Topic><Title>Federal plan designed to create large solar energy plants</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350160142211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:29:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Cluster" is the operative word.

They are traitors and every Republican voter supports them. Billionaire William Koch is facing a lawsuit in federal court from a former top-level employee who claims the energy mogul lured him to a secluded property, where he was imprisoned and interrogated for a period of time, according to a report in Courthouse News. John Houston Scott, an attorney for Kirby Martenson, a former executive for a number of Koch subsidiaries, confirmed the story to HuffPost, adding that he guessed the case could go to trial in a year. The case was filed in San Francisco, where the Republican-backing Kochs are not deeply popular. Martensen alleges that the multiple-day-long incident was set off by an anonymous letter accusing Martensen of mismanaging and stealing from Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals International while serving as the company's vice president. That accusation prompted the company's leadership to read Martensen's letters and emails without his knowledge, the suit charges, which led the company to discover that Martensen had deep reservations about the legality of the company's tax avoidance strategies. Martensen alleges he was told by his superiors that he was transferred overseas to Asia so that the Koch company could avoid paying U.S. taxes on some $200,000,000 in profits.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350171682940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 19:41:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350172215409-26</Id><Title>The VP Debate Lyan Ryan Beating Rewind</Title><Msg>The essence of the whole campaign for me was crystalized in the debate exchange over Romney's 20 percent tax-cut plan. ABC's Martha Raddatz turned the questioning to Ryan: MS. RADDATZ: Well, let's talk about this 20 percent. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well – (chuckles) – MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters? Here Ryan is presented with a simple yes-or-no answer. Since he doesn't have the answer, he immediately starts slithering and equivocating: REP. RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the – "We want to have bipartisan agreements?" This coming from a Republican congressman? These guys would stall a bill to name a post office after Shirley Temple. Biden, absolutely properly, chuckled and said, "That'd be a first for a Republican congress." Then Raddatz did exactly what any self-respecting journalist should do in that situation: she objected to being lied to, and yanked on the leash, forcing Ryan back to the question. I'm convinced Raddatz wouldn't have pounced on Ryan if he hadn't trotted out this preposterous line about bipartisanism. Where does Ryan think we've all been living, Mars? It's one thing to pull that on some crowd of unsuspecting voters that hasn't followed politics that much and doesn't know the history. But any professional political journalist knows enough to know the abject comedy of that line. Still, Ryan was banking on the moderator not getting in the way and just letting him dump his trash on audiences. Instead, she aggressively grabbed Ryan by his puppy-scruff and pushed him back into the mess of his own proposal: MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what you're doing? So now the ball is in Ryan's court. The answer he gives is astounding: REP. RYAN: Look – look at what Mitt – look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that. What we're saying is here's our framework: Lower tax rates 20 percent – we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion [dollars] in loopholes and deductions. And so what we're saying is deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader base of taxation – Three things about this answer: 1) Ryan again here refuses to answer Raddatz's yes-or-no question about specifics. So now we know the answer: there are no specifics. 2) In lieu of those nonexistent specifics, what Ryan basically says is that he and Romney will set the framework – "Lower taxes by 20 percent" – and then they'll work out the specifics of how to get there with the Democrats in bipartisan fashion. 3) So essentially, Ryan has just admitted on national television that the Romney tax plan will be worked out after the election with the same Democrats from whom they are now, before the election, hiding any and all details. So then, after that, there's this exchange. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can I translate? REP. RYAN: – so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now, here's why I'm saying this. What we're saying is here's a framework – VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this. REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress – MS. RADDATZ: I – you'll get time. REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress on how best to achieve this. That means successful – look – MS. RADDATZ: No specifics, yeah.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350172215409</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 19:50:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350175901802-27</Id><Topic><Title>If This Happened At Republican Office It Would Be ALL DAY Coverage on Fox.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1350145309670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 12:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fox gave it the same degree of coverage as did other news outlets.

Now some are saying this hard-earned pride has become prejudice in the form of blind loyalty to President Barack Obama. Are black people supporting Obama mainly because he's black? If race is just one factor in blacks' support of Obama, does that make them racist? Can blacks' support for Obama be compared with white voters who may favor his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, because he's white? These questions have long animated conservatives who are frustrated by claims that white people who oppose Obama's policies are racist. This week, when a black actress who tweeted an endorsement of Romney was subjected to a stream of abuse from other African-Americans, the politics of racial accusation came full circle once again. Stacey Dash, who also has Mexican heritage, is best known for the 1995 film "Clueless" and the recent cable-TV drama "Single Ladies." On Twitter, she was called racial epithets after posting, "Vote for Romney. The only choice for your future." The theme of the insults: A black woman would have to be stupid, subservient or both to choose a white Republican over the first black president. Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul and Obama backer, called Dash's experience "racism." Said Barbara Walters on "The View": "If she were white, this wouldn't have happened." Twitter users are by no means representative of America, and many black Obama supporters quickly denounced the attacks. But for people like Art Gary, an information technology professional, the reason Dash was attacked is simple: She is a black woman supporting a white candidate over a black one. "It goes both ways," said Gary, who is white. "There is racial bias amongst whites, and there is racial bias amongst blacks. But as far as the press is concerned, it only goes one way." Antonio Luckett, a sales representative in Milwaukee who is black, called the attacks on Dash unfair. But when people speak out against a symbol of black progress like Obama, he said, "African-Americans tend to be internally hurt by that." "We still have a civil rights (era) mentality, but we're not living in a civil rights-based world anymore," he said. "We want to say, `You're black, you need to stand behind black people."' Luckett said one reason he voted for Obama in the 2008 primary against Hillary Clinton was because Obama is black: "Yes, I will admit that." Such logic runs into trouble when applied to a white person voting for Romney because he understands whiteness better. Ron Christie, a black conservative who worked for former President George W. Bush, finds both sides of that coin unacceptable. "It's not the vision that our leaders in the civil rights movement would have envisioned and be proud of in the era of the first African-American president," Christie said. Martin Luther King Jr. fought Jim Crow laws, which deprived blacks of political rights after Reconstruction, upheld by Southern Democrats. But black voters switched after Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through the 1960s civil rights legislation and Republicans successfully pursued the votes of white people who disliked the civil rights agenda. Since then, Democrats have persistently wooed black voters with programs and platforms that African-Americans favor, and the party has been rewarded every four years. Clinton got 83 percent of the black vote in 1992 and 84 percent in 1996; the third-party candidate Ross Perot probably sliced away some of Clinton's black support. Al Gore got 90 percent in 2000; John Kerry got 88 percent in 2004. Obama captured 95 percent in 2008, and 2 million more black people voted than in the previous election. Christie says he, too, shares the sense of pride in Obama smashing what for blacks is the ultimate glass ceiling. He understands that black pride springs from a shared history of being treated as less than human, while the history of pride in whiteness has a racist context. But he still sees black people voting for Obama out of a "straitjacket solidarity." Christie sees it in his barbershop, where black men shifted from calling candidate Obama "half-white" and "not one of us" to demanding that Christie stop opposing the first black president. He sees it in the comments of radio host Tom Joyner, who told his millions of listeners a year ago, "Let's not even deal with facts right now. Let's deal with our blackness and pride — and loyalty. . I'm not afraid or ashamed to say that as black people, we should do it because he's a black man." The actor Samuel L. Jackson said much the same thing: "I voted for Barack because he was black," he told Ebony magazine. "Cuz that's why other folks vote for other people — because they look like them."</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350181163152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 22:19:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350181562503-33</Id><Topic><Title>Analysis: Do black people support Obama because he's black?</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350181163152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 22:19:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Got Racism?
