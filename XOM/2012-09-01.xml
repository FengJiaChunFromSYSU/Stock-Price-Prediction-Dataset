The result will simply be lower wages, profits, and rents as the debt and interest on the debt rises each passing year. Japan has been doing this for 20 years, running up debt to try to grow their economy, and the Nikkei 225 has dropped steadily over that period (capitalized profits) and real estate values (capitalized rents) have dropped steadily.

Being opposed to foreign aid and the racist card gets played. The GOP has come full circle and since at least Yugoslavia they have surpassed the Democrats in wanting to profit from spending hundreds of billions of US tax dollars on foreign invasions.

On the contrary, for the 150 years before 2000 increasing militarism and increasing economic growth went hand in hand. The worst economic crashes could be found in the interludes of peace between wars - periods when all manner of speculation and liberal experiments ran rampant. Peace was not the problem; liberal governance was the problem and unfortunately it ran hand in hand with peace. There is a second factor in play however besides militarism: energy prices. When energy prices rose during the 1970s the rate of economic growth slowed down, producing sub-par returns during the larger period of cold-war militarism and high economic growth from 1949-1991. Energy prices rose after 2002, as well, slowing down the economy, and causing the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009. Barack Obama has done everything he can to increase energy prices since he was elected, and been very successful. The result is the worst economic recovery in nearly 100 years. His military efforts have been feckless and quite useless to the job of improving access to energy resources worsening the situation still more.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346517933000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:45:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346519701000-28</Id><Title>Oil and gas firms work to restore output after Isaac</Title><Msg>Oil and gas firms work to restore output after Isaac August 31, 2012|Reuters HOUSTON (Reuters) - http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-31/news/sns-rt-us-storm-isaac-shutdownsbre87u14q-20120831_1_refinery-motiva-enterprises-natural-gas</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346519701000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 13:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346520206000-29</Id><Title>Japan’s First Floating Wind Farm Gets Going</Title><Msg>Japan’s First Floating Wind Farm Gets Going August 31, 2012 By Chelsea Leave a Comment Add Japan to the list of countries setting up innovative wind farms.

The 100-kilowatt turbine will be replaced with a 2-megawatt turbine next summer, once data regarding performance and maintenance is collected.

Needless to say, numerous people who understand the numbers have torn this cornucopian drivel to shreds as most of these stories ignore or gloss over the 3 or 4 million b/d of new production that must be found each year to offset the declines from existing fields amongst other fallacious logic." "Fracked tight oil from shale deposits will slow the rate of decline in global oil production a bit, but will never offset the loss of production from the world's giant oil fields currently underway and likely to accelerate. The problems of fracking and difficulty and expense of producing oil and gas from fracked wells that run dry far more quickly than conventional wells simply will not produce enough oil to run civilization as we know it today. We must look for other solutions and the quicker the better for unless there is record-breaking depression in the offing and the Middle East is settled peaceably, we are only a few years away from much higher oil prices and even scarcity." "At some point, and that day is not far away, it will be recognized that the economic growth as we have come to know it in recent years is no longer possible and the search for other lifestyles will begin in earnest." http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/With-the-Peak-Oil-Crisis-Looming-Economic-Growth-of-the-Past-is-not-Possible.html</Msg><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1346530555000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 16:15:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346531965000-35</Id><Title>Koch Brother Supports Wahleee</Title><Msg>Says he supports Wahleee's marriage to his husband.

GE, North America’s leading wind turbine supplier, is featuring its new 1.85-82.5 wind turbine at the Brazil Windpower Conference in Rio de Janeiro, August 29-31. The 1.85-82.5 wind turbine, which is IEC-certified for higher wind speed sites or environments, is the latest evolution of GE’s wind turbine technology and builds upon the vast and diverse experience of GE’s installed fleet of 18,000 wind turbines worldwide. As the General Electric Company reported, the new turbine offers an 8 percent increase in annual energy production (AEP) at 9 m/s, which drives improved project economics for wind developers in higher wind regime sites. GE’s proprietary Advanced Loads Control allows siting of the 82.5-meter rotor in more aggressive wind regimes, combining drive train sensors and capabilities of the Mark Vle controller to individually pitch blades and improve load-handling performance. A sophisticated set of grid-friendly features will enable operators to meet stringent grid requirements in 60-hertz regions. “With the introduction of the 1.85-82.5 wind turbine, we continue to advance our 1.5-megawatt class wind turbine product line, which has been proven in a wide range of wind regimes worldwide,” said Victor Abate, vice president of renewable energy at GE. “Focusing on performance, reliability, efficiency and multi-generational product evolution, the 1.85-82.5 is designed for Brazil’s growing wind energy requirements.” GE technology already is well established in Brazil, with 300 GE wind turbines now installed in the country. Last year, GE secured agreements to supply wind and gas turbines for projects in Brazil that will produce 1.4 gigawatts of electricity—40 percent of the total amount awarded in energy auctions conducted by Brazil’s National Electric Power Agency. At AWEA Windpower 2012, GE announced that the Miassaba 2 and Aratua 1 wind farms, developed and implemented by Bioenergy, a pioneer in clean energy in Brazil, were the first projects in Latin America to enter operation with GE wind turbines. http://finchannel.com/Main_News/Tech/115088_GE_Introduces_1.85-82.5_Wind_Turbine_for_Brazil%E2%80%99s_Promising_Wind_Energy_Sector/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346556046000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 23:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346557365000-56</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Pulling Ahead</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346515659000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:07:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well heres couple links that show your lack of facts but another FACT to ponder--during the gop debates--the newt bragged several times about presiding over several balanced budgets and annual surplus so now either the newt is a liar or you are ??take your pick http://factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ http://articles.cnn.com/2000-09-27/politics/clinton.surplus_1_budget-surplus-national-debt-fiscal-discipline?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS back to your diaper defecation</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1346557365000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 23:42:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346557814000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Pulling Ahead</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346515659000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:07:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are both wrong and relying on budget gimmicks, Find me a year in which the total federal debt at the end of the year was lower than at the end of the previous year.
