"USDA's continuing investments in research and development are proving a critical piece of President Obama's strategy to spur innovation of clean bioenergy right here at home and reduce our dependence on foreign oil," said Vilsack. "The advances made through this research will help to boost local economies throughout rural America, creating and sustaining good-paying jobs, while moving our nation toward a clean energy economy." USDA funds intended to increase the availability of alternative renewable fuels and biobased products The projects announced Friday are funded by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture through the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, established in the 2008 Farm Bill. The funded research will help increase the availability of alternative renewable fuels and biobased products to diversify the nation's energy resources. The Department of Energy will make additional awards through this program. Each award was made through a competitive selection process. Grant recipients are required to contribute a minimum of 20% matching funds for research and development projects and 50% matching funds for demonstration projects. Awardees must pursue projects that integrate science and engineering research in three areas: feedstocks development, biofuels and biobased products development, and biofuels and bioproducts development analysis. The following projects have been selected for awards: Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kan., $5,078,932. The goal of this project is to make the oilseed crop camelina a cost-effective biofuel and bioproduct feedstock. Camelina production will be incorporated into a cropping system with wheat-based crop rotations in Montana and Wyoming. Once harvested and processed, camelina oil and meal will be chemically converted to a variety of adhesives, coatings and composites. Ohio State University, Wooster, Ohio, $6,510,183. This project will result in an anaerobic digestion system for the production of liquid transportation fuels and electricity from animal manure, agricultural residues, woody biomass and energy crops. The novel anaerobic digestion system will be integrated with partial oxidation and Fisher-Tropsch technologies to produce gasoline. Ceramatec, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah, $6,599,304. This project will convert lignocellulosic biomass to infrastructure-compatible renewable diesel, biolubricants, animal feed and biopower. New hybrids of energy sorghum will be developed, and other biomass resources include switchgrass and forestry residues. USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center, Wyndmoor, Pa., $6,865,942. ARS scientists will develop an on-the-farm distributed technology for converting forest residues, horse manure, switchgrass and other perennial grasses into biofuels and high-value specialty chemicals. The process will be implemented at on-the-farm scale using a patent-pending unit that will mimic the petroleum industry's catalytic cracking process. USDA is working to develop the biofuels industry in every region of the country. In addition to today's awards, USDA has previously announced major support for public and private research in renewable energy and products in every major American region, aimed at developing renewable energy markets, generating rural jobs, and decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil. By partnering with industry, the research is enabling private-sector partners to produce advanced ready-to-use liquid transportation and aviation biofuels. In addition, USDA is helping companies build biorefineries—including the first ever commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol facilities—and supporting farmers, ranchers, and businesses taking risks to pursue new opportunities in biofuels. More than 130 biodiesel and ethanol projects funded by USDA are currently producing almost 3.7 billion gallons of biodiesel and ethanol annually, enough fuel—in equivalence to gasoline—to keep five million vehicles on the road every year. farmfuturesDOTcom/story-usda-announces-investments-biobased-renewable-products-17-93354</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358174635879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 09:43:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358174829572-3</Id><Topic><Title>60 degrees in New Jersey today (January).</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1358111833183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 16:17:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boring lies again - but then that's always your "strategy".</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1358174829572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 09:47:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358175477550-4</Id><Title>2013 tax increase -- about $264 billion</Title><Msg>...around 1/4 of the US budget deficit.

Once reviled as one of the dirtiest coal plants in the U.S., today the Baldwin plant is a different kind of poster child. Last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. completed $1 billion in environmental upgrades at Baldwin and its three sister Illinois plants, a calculated bet that it will emerge as one of the coal plant operators left standing as rivals are clobbered by a depressed electricity market that leaves little money to add federally mandated pollution controls. Dynegy's move, together with the closures of several coal-fired plants in and around Chicago, should add up to cleaner air for Cook County, which has consistently failed to meet federal health standards for air quality. The pollution spewing from three massive smokestacks at Baldwin, about a five-hour drive southwest of Chicago, had plagued the city and other downwind communities for decades, contributing to the smog and soot that trigger asthma and other ailments. "Hundreds of people in the state have died in recent years and thousands have been sickened simply because they had no choice but to breathe the pollution being pumped out by huge coal power plants. What we are starting to see now are the real health benefits of legal enforcement actions taken years ago," said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs for the Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago. The closures of the coal-burning Crawford and Fisk power plants in Chicago and the State Line plant just across the border in Indiana mirror a story playing out across the country. The abundance of natural gas, a cheaper fuel than coal, has cut into profits of coal plant operators just as states and the federal government have pressed for expensive pollution upgrades. The Brattle Group, a financial consulting firm, predicts that one-fourth of the nation's coal-fired electricity will be wiped off the map by 2016; more than 100 coal-fired generating units have been mothballed since 2009. The state's other two major coal plant owners — Ameren Corp.'s generating arm and Edison International's Midwest Generation — largely have been cast off by their parent companies because of poor financial performance. And they have pleaded with regulators for more time to meet pollution standards. As a result of upgrades, it is more costly to operate Baldwin and Dynegy's other Illinois coal plants in Wood River, Havana and Hennepin than those of competitors. But Dynegy doesn't expect that to be a burden long term. Fewer players making electricity means surviving power plant operators will receive higher payments from grid operators that pay reservation fees for power. "There's short-term pain until you flush the noncompliers out of the game," said Robert Flexon, Dynegy's president and chief executive. Longer term, if coal-fired plants keep closing as Dynegy anticipates, it expects to earn $100 million more per year beginning in 2016 in so-called capacity payments from grid operators. Cleaning up Dynegy's decision to upgrade its plants was not altogether altruistic. The improvements stem from a 2005 settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice that set deadlines for the company to clean up its plants or close them. The Baldwin plant, an hour's drive from St. Louis, is massive; its white smokestack plumes can be seen for miles in this flat farming area. Its fuel comes in by rail. The cars, brimming with 120 tons of coal every 2 1/2 minutes, are flipped over, rails and all, only to return full in an eight-day loop that begins in Wyoming. The amount of coal burned every two months is enough to fill Willis Tower. It is just the start of a laborious process that strips the coal of toxic pollutants. Truckloads of lime are shipped to the plant each day to supply the sulfur dioxide scrubbers. After the coal is burned, the resulting coal gas is piped to the building-size scrubbers, each containing 20 nozzles that spray a mixture of limestone and ash to chemically remove the sulfur dioxide. The pollutants bind to the slurry mixture, drop to the bottom and are recycled, while the coal gas pushes through to two smaller buildings called "bag houses," essentially giant filters that catch tiny particles that would otherwise enter the air. To avoid nitrogen oxide emissions, the coal is burned at a lower temperature. All told, improvements since 1998 have reduced 93 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 85 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions and 88 percent of particulate matter emissions, according to Dynegy. "All that's really coming out that stack now is carbon dioxide and water vapor," Dave Glosecki, Baldwin's maintenance director, told a group during a recent plant tour. Depending on the direction it is blowing, wind can carry pollutants from Baldwin or from any other number of coal plants to Chicago's front door. "Meteorology matters, topography matters, stack height matters, drought conditions matter," said Laurel Kroack, chief of the Illinois EPA's Bureau of Air. Scientific environmental modeling has shown that Illinois coal plants also contribute to pollution in New York, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Texas, Kroack said. There are plenty of other culprits. Pollution from cars, trucks and buses remains one of the largest contributors to the ozone that leads to health problems. Asthma rates have increased even as air has gotten cleaner. The disease has many triggers, including air pollution. Stumbling blocks Dynegy's 2005 settlement set the stage for similar state-level agreements with other coal plant owners. The next year, Edison International's Midwest Generation and St. Louis-based Ameren, which together own nine coal plants in Illinois that produce enough electricity to power 8.5 million homes, promised to invest about $1 billion each to clean up their respective Illinois plants. Dynegy and Ameren agreed to reduce the rates of nitrogen oxide, mercury and sulfur dioxide emissions their coal fleets produce, which left them the option of closing plants that increase those averages. In 2011, Dynegy closed its Vermilion County plant, and Ameren mothballed its Meredosia and Hutsonville plants. Midwest Generation's agreement required upgrades to all its plants, in addition to stringent reductions in overall pollution rates. Closing its Fisk and Crawford power plants in Chicago in 2012 didn't help it reduce the upgrades needed at its four other coal plants. Last year, the parent companies of Ameren and Midwest Generation cut off financial support and set into motion plans to jettison these businesses. Edison International subsidiary Edison Mission Energy, parent of Midwest Generation, filed for bankruptcy protection late last year with a plan to emerge as an independent company. Midwest Generation also has asked Illinois regulators for a "pause" in meeting yearly deadlines to gradually reduce sulfur dioxide emissions until 2019, saying it will miss targets for two years but catch up in the later years and meet its obligations. "We come up to our biggest expense at a time when power prices are quite depressed," said Douglas McFarlan, spokesman for Midwest Generation. "We have to generate cash flow or go out and get financing to do this work, and this is obviously a difficult time to do that." In September, Ameren won a reprieve from the Illinois Pollution Control Board to meet a 2015 deadline to reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide its power plants churn into the air, arguing that under current market conditions it couldn't afford the upgrades. The gas — it's a consequence of burning coal, which contains sulfur — has been linked to respiratory illnesses. Even playing field? Environmental advocates say Ameren and Midwest Generation's extensions are unwarranted, as does Dynegy. "Both Ameren and Midwest Generation agreed to these standards in proceedings before the Pollution Control Board," said Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center, who helped negotiate the various settlements governing pollution at the plants. "They're now trying to go back on the deal that they made. What's really happening is that Ameren's and Midwest Generation's projections on the economics of the competitive power market didn't work out as they planned." Dynegy's CEO said that allowing extensions for his competitors is incentivizing the "wrong behavior." "Either invest or retire," said Flexon, an intense businessman who cycles 100 miles a weekend. "They strictly are following a policy of hope for better times." In practical terms, he said, the Pollution Control Board is giving those coal plants more time to pollute before the plants are, inevitably, shut down. Without help from their parent companies, Flexon said, the money simply isn't there under current market conditions to make the upgrades. Midwest Generation intends to meet its obligations, McFarlan said, pointing to the $170 million the company has spent to meet nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions limits as part of the deal brokered with the state in 2006. "We invested over $100 million in these plants just last year. (Those are) not the actions of a company that is just trying to string this along and then shut them down," he said. To finish upgrades by a 2019 deadline to meet sulfur dioxide emissions limits, the company would need to spend an additional $800 million, assuming it doesn't choose to shut plants. "We're not trying to avoid the investment or get a free pass here," McFarlan said. "We're just looking to defer $200 million for a couple of years to allow time for market recovery, to allow time for federal regulations to catch up and to allow for our financial restructuring." If Midwest Generation does not receive the extension, he said, it increases the chance that plants will be shut down. chicagotribuneDOTcom/business/ct-biz-0114-dynegy-20130114,0,2742161,fullDOTstory</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358175908337</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 10:05:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358175925492-7</Id><Topic><Title>China, Japan and Germany are leaving America behind in Green Energy.</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1358116860464</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 17:41:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The oil industry has developed marvelous new tight oil and shale gas technologies.

When there’s sufficient demand and room for electricity to flow, utilities and grid overseers want wind farms to run full throttle. But during periods of congestion, or when market conditions call for less power on the grid, wind energy operators have to apply the brakes to keep their power from overwhelming the system. Such downward shifts in electrical output, called “curtailment,” can make running a wind farm more difficult, especially when every turbine represents an independent engine that must be throttled up or down to meet the desired overall generation output. Indeed, curtailment remains one of the industry’s most significant challenges as dozens of new wind farms come online every year, significantly adding to the U.S. power supply but also changing the balance of where power is generated and how it is integrated into the grid. But solutions are being developed by GE and others to make wind farms more resilient to supply-and-demand sine curves and ease the unanticipated shifts in electrical output that have forced wind farms to make hasty “all-on” or “all-off” decisions based on the needs of the grid. Among the technologies being put into service at wind farms around the country is GE’s WindCONTROL software, which allows for the automation of most decisions about wind turbine operation and electrical output during periods of curtailment. Human decisions about which turbines to turn on and which to turn off are no longer required. Rather, the software evaluates the wind farm’s operations and automatically dials down the output based on a host of factors, including wind conditions and turbine configuration. Minesh Shah, manager of the Electrical and Controls Center of Excellence at GE Renewable Energy, said the software signals each turbine at a wind farm to produce at a certain level. Then the turbines use blade-pitching technology to reduce electrical output to the desired level. “Hence, we avoid having to turn the turbines off and on,” Shah said. “The continual start and stop of the turbines creates more wear and tear on the turbine components than making smaller changes by blade pitching that will simply reduce the power.” Regional variation While curtailment is already posing challenges in some parts of the country with high wind farm densities, such as west Texas, experts predict start-stop issues will become even more pronounced as turbines become more densely concentrated on the land and new farms expand to regions once considered unsuitable for wind power generation. A recent report from the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said curtailment “has become common,” particularly in Texas where new wind farm construction has outpaced transmission expansion and upgrades. In 2011, Texas’ primary grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), curtailed 2,622 gigawatt-hours of wind power, or 8.5 percent of all wind energy available to the grid, according to the laboratory. Two years earlier, in 2009, ERCOT’s curtailment rate was 17.1 percent (3,872 gigawatt-hours), the highest level recorded in the United States. By comparison, the Midwest has had generally lower curtailment rates. In 2011, the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator curtailed 657 gigawatt-hours of wind energy, or roughly 3 percent of capacity, across all its territory excluding Minnesota. In the Gopher State, the curtailment rate has held steady at 1.2 percent for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Bruce Hamilton, a director at Navigant Consulting’s energy practice in Portland, Oregon, and former operations executive at Iberdrola Renewables, said industry sources have reported increases in curtailment across the country, including Texas, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest and New England. In some cases, the amount of curtailed generation has approached 10 percent of total capacity. “That’s a big number, and it’s real money lost for a wind farm owner, right off the top,” Hamilton said. Wind energy supply disruptions can be caused by factors other than transmission capacity and utility needs, according to experts. In 2011, for example, curtailment shot up in the Pacific Northwest as the Bonneville Power Administration faced a surge in hydropower production after a heavy spring runoff created unprecedented high flows in the region’s rivers, according to the Lawrence Berkeley lab. Kevin Porter, a senior analyst at the energy consulting firm Exeter Associates and co-author of a 2010 survey of U.S. wind power curtailment for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said that although start-stop issues have long been a factor in wind farm operations and will continue to be in the future, curtailment levels will increasingly depend on weather and climate variables rather than the ebb and flow of electricity demand and transmission congestion. “This is going to differ from year to year,” Porter said. “If you have a strong wind resource in a given year, and you’re in an area like California and the Pacific Northwest where there are other generation assets like hydrodams, then the grid operator might have problems. You’ll see curtailment shooting up.” On the other hand, “if you have a bad wind year, you’re not going to see a whole lot of curtailment. It’s all very dynamic, and it’s not always easy to predict where things are going to tighten up,” he said. Broader economic implications Jonathan Cheszes, a Toronto-based associate director with Navigant Consulting, said such start-stop issues are more than an operational challenge for wind energy producers. Where curtailment exists at high levels, it affects the underlying economics of wind power. For example, wind farms that are subject to high rates of curtailment will face higher project financing costs than farms where the electricity output is less constrained. “At 1 percent curtailment, revenues and [debt service coverage ratios] remain at a level that would be comfortable to most lenders,” Cheszes wrote in a March 2012 analysis for Renewable Energy World. “However, at 5 percent curtailment and higher, revenues and DSCR deteriorate, putting projects at risk of not meeting their debt obligations or reducing the amount of debt the project’s cash flows can support.” In an interview, Cheszes noted that curtailment does not necessarily make a project uneconomical, but that investors want to be able to reliably predict how much electricity a wind farm will produce over a year, after accounting for any curtailment. Technologies like GE’s WindCONTROL will help facilitate dispatch of that energy to the grid. “I think it is becoming more standard in the industry to have this type of tool,” he said. “The goal is to have the ability to help the wind farms to go down to a certain generation level rather than go off completely.” midwestenergynewsDOTcom/2013/01/14/technology-helps-wind-industry-overcome-start-stop-hurdles/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358176645161</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 10:17:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358177258216-10</Id><Title>Debt Ceiling Fight</Title><Msg>Obama should demand that Congress deliver another tax increase in exchange for their being allowed to have a say over the debt.

Most of the energy used to produce electricity is wasted as heat. Superconductors and new materials to construct boilers etc could reduce the waste considerably. Those are being developed now in Europe and Japan, and probably by the US government and DARPA. Combined heat and power can deliver waste heat to residential and commercial users.

That is according to Dr Mario Anderson, group managing director, Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). The PCJ-operated Wigton Windfarm in Manchester produced enough energy to save the country more than US$5.3 million (J$493 million) on oil imports during fiscal year 2011/12 or 47 per cent more year on year, due to its own expansion. Dr Anderson said there are plans to generate a further 24 megawatts of wind power. Another alternative energy supplier, Clean Alternative Energy Limited (CAEL), also plans to construct a 24 megawatt facility. That facility, to be based in Manchester, would raise the nation's wind energy output by some 60 per cent. CAEL directors include Wesley McLeod, businessman; Christopher Townsend, attorney; and Roger Williams, quantity surveyor. "CAEL is estimated to save Jamaica US$4 million per year in fuel import costs annually, as approximately 40,183 barrels of oil equivalent will be saved per year in imports at an average price of US$100," said the company in an environmental impact assessment report to the National Environment and Planning Agency. The combined saving from Wigton and CAEL, however, would save only a fraction of Jamaicas annual oil bill, which hit US$2.4 billion in 2011. But the economic savings are augmented by the environmental benefits. Wigton accumulated nearly 76,000 units of tradable carbon credits or certified emission reductions (CERs) in fiscal year ending 2012, equivalent to some US$375,000 based on estimates of existing rates. Wigton earned some 52,000 CER units a year earlier. Carbon credits are worth about US$5 per tonne or unit. CAEL said that its facility slated for Great Valley, Manchester would draw visitors to the area. "The installation of the wind farm at Great Valley may lead to an increase in visitors to the area. There will likely be school trips as well as visits by persons who are interested in viewing the installation. The company said. This may lead to increased commercial activity in the nearby towns. The Wigton farm located less than five kilometres from the proposed Great Valley wind-farm is said to receive thousands of visitors annually, it added. CAEL plans to employ 100 persons during the nine to 12-month construction period but the cost of developing the wind-farm has not been disclosed. Up to last year, the PCJ held the exclusive right to exploit and develop renewable resources in Jamaica. In October 2012, the Government of Jamaica rescinded the PCJ's exclusivity, which in effect liberalised the renewable energy sector. jamaica-gleanerDOTcom/gleaner/20130114/business/business1.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358194329245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 15:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358194821726-22</Id><Title>Germany, China Sign Agreement to Push Renewable Energy Expansion</Title><Msg>Germany, China Sign Agreement to Push Renewable Energy Expansion By Stefan Nicola - Jan 14, 2013 5:59 AM MT 0 COMMENTS Germany and China agreed to work together for the expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.

Investment in power generation and grids and other technologies for producing heat and energy in an environmentally sustainable way should accelerate if states are to achieve the UN’s goal of doubling renewables use by 2030, the agency known as IRENA said. Nations must add an average renewables capacity of 150 gigawatts a year through 2030, in contrast to the increase in 2011 of 110 gigawatts, IRENA said today in an e- mailed statement. Governments want to diversify their energy mix and reduce fuel imports and costs without adding to global carbon emissions, IRENA Director General Adnan Amin said in a Jan. 9 interview at the agency’s Abu Dhabi headquarters. Declining costs have made many renewables more competitive with fossil fuels, he said at his office in the United Arab Emirates capital. A boom in the output of natural gas trapped in shale would complement growth in renewables use because both are substitutes for dirtier fuels such as coal, Amin said. Gas can supply constant power, unlike intermittent wind or solar. Costs for some types of solar panels have fallen by as much as 60 percent in two years, Amin said. Small-scale hydropower often provides the cheapest source of energy for developing countries, according to an IRENA report this week. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-14/irena-urges-faster-use-of-renewable-energy-to-meet-un-target.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358195765530</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 15:36:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358206425094-24</Id><Topic><Title>China, Japan and Germany are leaving America behind in Green Energy.</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1358116860464</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 17:41:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>snth is a #$%$ POS liar.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1358206425094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 18:33:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358208350454-25</Id><Topic><Title>Obama looked poised and spoiling for a fight on the debt ceiling</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1358185453404</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 12:44:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama is acting more and more like an emperor. bellowing and finger-jabbing at his opponents etc.. executive orders right and left. people are starting to ask: is he not accountable? and as for checks and balances should he not work with Congress?

API, a powerful industry lobbying group, is urging lawmakers to repeal the renewable fuel standard. The biofuels industry is vehemently defending the rule, which requires refiners to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuel into traditional transportation fuel by 2022. API also will discuss other policy and regulatory issues facing refineries and pipelines during the media call. ------------------------------------- Sen. Vitter ready for battle on ‘fracking’ Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), the new ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, is signaling that he’ll use the perch to criticize White House policy on “fracking.” Vitter is among the many Republicans who fear Obama administration officials will place tough limits on the oil-and-gas extraction method called hydraulic fracturing. “That’s under attack from the left and I’m concerned that the EPA and other federal agencies may again, by administrative fiat, try to over-regulate or even shut down that activity,’’ he told The Shreveport Times. The Times story also looks at the rest of Vitter's agenda on the panel.

Keith EllisonCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th District GET UPDATES FROM REP. KEITH ELLISON Last week, I said that if Congress has to make cuts, we should embrace the idea of ridding ourselves of wasteful giveaways to the fossil fuel industry. Here's an idea. Let's cut the Master Limited Partnership loophole and fossil fuel subsidies. The Master Limited Partnership is an obscure but harmful multibillion dollar loophole that allows fossil fuel companies to avoid all income taxes on transportation or processing of fossil fuels -- things like oil pipelines. Renewable energy companies don't have the same option, meaning the taxpayer is subsidizing polluters at the expense of cleaner, renewable energy. The total cost to the taxpayer? $2.4 billion dollars every 5 years. Now, some folks propose to extend the Master Limited Partnership to green industries. That's fine, but what about leveling the playing field and cutting the deficit at the same? The Master Limited Partnership is just one example of the billions of dollars in handouts that polluters get from Congress. For instance, BP was able to deduct nearly $10 billion from cleaning up its own mess in the Gulf of Mexico. Over the next 10 years, fossil fuel companies will receive over $110 billion in taxpayer giveaways. Ending these subsidies would recoup the $12 billion fossil fuel companies will be able to deduct by claiming they are manufacturers, and the almost $11 billion we will lose from free leases to drill on public land. With all the chatter in Washington, it is easy to miss what is really at stake. The debate is about our country's future; it's about fairness; it's about whether we invest in jobs or tax breaks for hedge fund managers, polluters and already profitable industries. It's about whether we level the playing field for sustainable energy or continue to give unnecessary and harmful tax breaks to oil companies who have been making record profits -- and not paying their fair share. It's time for Republicans in Congress to put their money where their mouth is. Middle class families should not be forced to scrape by with less while oil companies get away with more. Any cuts we make should reflect our priorities and needs as a country. Rather than cutting important lifelines like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, let's cut corporate tax loopholes like the Master Limited Partnership.. The five largest oil companies made more than $1 trillion in profits in the last decade. They don't need our help. UPDATE: Many of you asked how we can end wasteful tax breaks like the Master Limited Partnership. I introduced a bill with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
