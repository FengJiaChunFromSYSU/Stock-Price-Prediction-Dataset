High-profile protesters, citing what they say is Canada's poor green record, want President Barack Obama to block TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Gulf Coast. Obama made clear in his State of the Union speech this week that he wanted to focus on climate change, and David Jacobson, U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, said Canada needed to do more to curb emissions. The Conservative government, which together with the province of Alberta insists it serious about tackling global warming, has repeatedly delayed the release of proposed rules to curb emissions from the oil and gas sector. "We're going to be moving on that and that, I think, will send a signal not only to the Americans but to the world that we're very serious about this issue," Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver told reporters. Minutes earlier, Environment Minister Peter Kent told the House of Commons that "we are now well into, and very close to finalizing, regulations for the oil and gas sector". He did not give details. Canada is the biggest supplier of energy to the United States and sits on the world's third-largest reserves of crude. Much of it is in the clay-like tar sands of Alberta and needs large amounts of energy to extract. Canada says it will cut output of greenhouse gases by 17 percent of 2005 levels by 2020, a goal that even Kent admits cannot be reached unless the government and the energy industry do more. Environmentalists are skeptical about how serious Ottawa really is about clamping down on the energy sector, given the Conservatives' close ties with the industry and their determination to increase exports of oil and gas. U.S. officials say a final decision on Keystone is unlikely before the middle of the year. Jacobson told reporters in Toronto on Thursday that his comments about Canada doing more on climate change were not a threat. The Globe and Mail newspaper, noting that the United States is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gases, said "it feels like Canada has been singled out as a convenient example of President Obama's new determination on climate change. But the potential damage to Canada is out of proportion with a message that verges on double-talk." reutersDOTcom/article/2013/02/14/canada-energy-idUSL1N0BEBDB20130214</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360936759417</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 08:59:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360937166781-5</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how does it feel to be a commie rat traitor to america.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360937166781</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 09:06:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360937654388-6</Id><Title>American Electric Power (AEP) 3Q Earnings Drop 93.2 Pct On Ohio Plant Charges</Title><Msg>American Electric Power (AEP) 3Q Earnings Drop 93.2 Pct On Ohio Plant Charges February 15, 2013 08:37 AM (By Balaseshan) American Electric Power Co. Inc. (NYSE: AEP : 44.77, -0.16), a utility holding company, reported a 93.2 percent drop in quarterly earnings primarily due to Ohio plant impairments and restructuring charges. Profit plunged 93.2 percent to $21 million for the fourth quarter, while earnings per share (EPS) dropped 92.2 percent to $0.05. Operating earnings per share rose to $0.50 from $0.40. The company said its operating earnings were in line with results from last year despite sluggish demand growth and the negative impact of customer switching in Ohio. The company said the operating results was higher than GAAP earnings because of Ohio plant impairments, adjustment associated with the Texas cost cap on the construction of the John W. Turk Jr. (Turk) coal-fueled power plant, and cost restructuring charge. Revenue marginally increased 0.2 percent to $3.6 billion. Retail margins for the fourth quarter were $178 million higher than last year, as the company experienced colder weather in its eastern service territories and the continuing favorable impact of rate decisions. Transmission Revenue for fourth-quarter 2012 was $27 million higher than previous year, primarily as a result of increased revenues in Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and PJM, including revenues associated with customer switching. Total retail energy delivered marginally fell 0.8 percent to 40.29 billion kilowatt hour (kWh), while total wholesale energy delivered grew 43.8 percent to 11.48 billion kWh. Looking ahead into the fiscal 2013, the company established 2013 operating earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. "We've filed for corporate separation and transfer of our Ohio generation assets to our competitive generation entity and other operating companies and expect to fully separate our Ohio generation from our Ohio utility operations at the end of 2013," said Chief Executive Nicholas Akins. AEP closed Thursday's regular session down 0.36 percent at $44.77. The stock has been trading between $36.97 and $45.48 for the past 52 weeks. istockanalystDOTcom/finance/story/6293364/american-electric-power-aep-3q-earnings-drop-93-2-pct-on-ohio-plant-charges</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360937654388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 09:14:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360937840348-7</Id><Title>GE Wind Tops List Of Wind Turbine Manufacturers In Global Market</Title><Msg>GE Wind Tops List Of Wind Turbine Manufacturers In Global Market February 15, 2013 Adam Johnston US Based GE Wind topped the list as 2012′s top wind turbine manufacturer, according to a new report. According to preliminary data from B&amp;M Navigant’s World Market Update 2012, GE Leapfrogged past second place Danish company Vestas, largely on the mad dash to complete projects (helping GE Capture 15% of the global market last year) before the Production Tax Credit was originally set to expire by December, 31, 2012. However, the credit was extended for another year in January. Image of wind farm via Shutterstock Siemens was number three, up six spots from 2011. Enercon moved up one spot to fourth, and rounding out the top five was the Suzlon Group, up from sixth the prior year. Meanwhile, Spanish company Gamesa fell out of the top five, thanks to wind moratorium concerns within its own border. Perhaps most surprising was despite the strength of China as a leader in wind energy, and having four of its top companies in the top ten (United Power, Goldwind, Sinovel, and Mingyang), none of them were in the top five. While GE’s move up the wind turbine market ladder was positive for them, the same can not be said for Vestas, who lost the top spot for the first time since 2000. An analyst in Bloomberg recently had this to say on Vestas losing the number one spot and who they should be watching over their shoulder: “It’s been part of their identity at Vestas that they’re the biggest in the world,” said Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa, Denmark. “From a Vestas point of view I would fear Siemens a lot more than GE. Siemens is more global in their reach. GE is extremely dependent on the U.S. Market.” Siemens had some solid market gains globally, including a 270 megawatt order from Australia last August, as well as announcing a new Turkish wind power plant in October. With total wind capacity increasing by 20% globally in 2012, will turbine manufacturers like GE Wind benefit thanks to firm US Growth? Will China see one of their own companies crack the top five within the next few years, like its solar counterparts? Will Vestas regain the top spot after a disappointing year? No one knows, but there is definitely interesting times in the global wind market. sDOTtt/1zOTd</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360937840348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 09:17:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360939733386-8</Id><Topic><Title>(XOM) - Important Update!</Title><Username>davidprater801</Username><Timestamp>1360929913311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 07:05:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you guys rock</Msg><Username>jose.backus</Username><Timestamp>1360939733386</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 09:48:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360940441430-9</Id><Topic><Title>(XOM) - Important Update!</Title><Username>davidprater801</Username><Timestamp>1360929913311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 07:05:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hear good things about them</Msg><Username>preston.francisco</Username><Timestamp>1360940441430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:00:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360940528349-10</Id><Title>America's Healthcare Catastrophe</Title><Msg>America's healthcare system is totally unworkable and it will result in the impoverishment of the American middle class as US taxes are increased to pay for the mounting government obligations.

On Thursday, Wyden introduced a measure aimed at boosting development of geothermal energy by tweaking the leasing program for tracts of federal land to develop the renewable resource. Currently the Interior Department holds lease sales, and then offers land on a “noncompetitive” basis if no bids are received, Wyden said. The bill, Wyden said, would expand access to land that’s offered outside of competitive lease sales. “This legislation extends the authority for noncompetitive leasing in cases where a geothermal developer wants to gain access to Federal land immediately adjacent to land on which that developer has proven that there is a geothermal resource that will be developed. This will allow a geothermal project to expand onto adjacent land, if necessary, to increase the amount of geothermal energy it can develop. It will also add to the royalties and rents that the project pays to the U.S. Treasury,” he said in a statement Thursday. The measure is co-sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Energy Committee’s top Republican, a long with a bipartisan mix of other lawmakers. Here’s more from Wyden: The reason for this legislation is to allow the rapid expansion of already identified geothermal resources without the additional delays of competitive leasing and without opening up those adjacent properties to speculative bidders who have no interest in actually developing the resource, only in extracting as much money as they can from the existing geothermal developer. The bill is not a give away at taxpayer expense. The bill limits the amount of adjacent Federal land that can be leased to 640 acres. This lease on Federal land must be acquired at fair-market value. The bill also requires the lease holder to pay the higher annual rental rate associated with competitive leases even though this new parcel is not being competitively leased. Again, the purpose of this higher rental rate is to ensure that taxpayers will get the revenue due to them from the use of their public lands. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/283441-wyden-floats-plan-to-boost-geothermal-energy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360958681371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 15:04:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360961055828-24</Id><Title>Methes Energies signs contract for biodiesel sale of 1.2M gallons</Title><Msg>Methes Energies signs contract for biodiesel sale of 1.2M gallons By Methes Energies International Ltd. | February 15, 2013 Methes Energies International Ltd., a renewable energy company that offers an array of products and services to biodiesel fuel producers, announces that its wholly owned subsidiary, Methes Energies Canada Inc., has signed a contract with a U.S. client for the delivery of 50 railcars of ASTM quality biodiesel. The delivery of approximately 1.2 million gallons of biodiesel will take place over the next several weeks. Under the terms of the contract, the buyer has agreed to prepay for the biodiesel before the railcars leave Methes' Sombra facility. Methes' biodiesel qualifies for the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS2). Methes Energies Canada is approved by the U.S. EPA as a foreign renewable fuel producer, making the biodiesel produced at both its Sombra facility and Mississauga facility in Ontario, Canada, eligible for export to the U.S., which provides its U.S. importer the ability to generate RINs. Nicholas Ng, president of Methes Energies International, said, “This is the largest contract that the company has ever signed for a short-term delivery agreement. I believe that this is the beginning of a long-term relationship that will provide for more railcars to be shipped to the same client in the future.” Methes Energies operates a fleet of 28 railcars that are used to transport feedstock and biodiesel to and from its Sombra facility.

The New Mexico Environment Department also issued a press release. At issue was pollution from the large coal-fired power plant and the insistence of power plant operator Public Service Company of New Mexico that putting proper controls on the power plant would be too costly. In the deal, the two coal-fired units would be replaced with natural gas units which would put off less pollution. The deal allows the other two coal-fired units to operate indefinitely with less expensive pollution controls — using selective non-catalytic reduction technology. This type of technology that is designed to lessen nitrogen oxide emissions was part of a negotiated deal between the state of New Mexico and the power plant. The AP also reports: PNM, 46 percent owner of the 1,800-megawatt plant, estimates its share of the capital costs under the settlement would be $400 million to $430 million. It says ratepayers would not see an immediate impact on their bills. In addition, PNM agreed to no layoffs due to the units’ closures and will provide more than $1 million for job retraining and economic development in the Four Corners area. At issue was the Clean Air Act, which requires the “best available retrofit technology” be used to reduce pollution. Public Service Company of New Mexico said this would cost $750 million — too expensive to keep the Four Corners area power plant running. According to a Sierra Club fact sheet, “SJGS is the second-largest source of air pollution in New Mexico after the nearby Four Corners power plant.” Gov. Susana Martinez hailed the settlement as a victory. “All along, our goal has been to strike the right balance between the environmental and economic impacts of energy production in the Four Corners,” said Martinez in a statement. “We worked hard to craft a reasonable solution that would improve air quality, conserve New Mexico’s precious water resources, avoid an extremely burdensome rate hike on consumers, protect jobs in northwestern New Mexico, transition away from coal and toward New Mexico natural gas, and position the state to take full advantage of exciting new economic development opportunities in the Mancos Shale. This compromise is a reasonable step forward to achieving all of those goals.” Navajo Nation president Ben Shelly weighed in as well. “I support the most recent terms that the State of New Mexico has agreed to work on with EPA to address Best Achievable Retrofit Technology (BART) for the San Juan Generating Station. I have continued to support the multi-faceted efforts of New Mexico to acquire the most effective agreement with the EPA for meeting BART,” said Shelly in the press release from the New Mexico Environment Department.

By Jim Motavalli · February 15, 2013 New York has only 100 public chargers now, but some entrepreneurs—and Mayor Michael Bloomberg—are trying to change that. As that famous song about New York says, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” And that applies to electric cars, because the Big Apple is an awesome challenge. If we keep talking about EVs as “city cars,” this is where they’ll have to prove themselves. Although the outer boroughs have some private homes with garages, apartment living predominates, less than half the population even owns a car, and street-level parking is worth its weight in gold. That’s why wiring the city for EVs has focused on public lots and parking garages. Not Many Chargers Now So far, New York has 100 public chargers, which is not many for a city of more than eight million people. The challenge is particularly acute in high-rise Manhattan, which is quite populous (1.6 million) but also a place where nobody in his right mind keeps a car—vehicle storage equals rent in most other places. In Manhattan, public chargers are mostly in garages or lots owned by companies such as Icon and Central Parking. CarCharging Group is one company that is installing New York infrastructure at its own expense, hoping for a payback as people plug in and pay for electricity at profit-making rates (currently 49 cents per kilowatt-hour, CEO Michael Farkas told me). So public charging commands a premium in the city. The company currently has 25 to 30 chargers around the city, which means it operates a quarter of all available public infrastructure. Other companies have been slow to jump into this market. New Initiatives Things may be looking up for EVs in New York. In an interview, Farkas praised Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his final State of the City address, in which he endorsed a plan to require new parking lots to prepare an unspecified number of spots for electric car charging. Specifically, owners would need to put in conduit so after the lot was constructed it could be easily wired for a charger. The details would have to be worked out with the City Council. The city is also adding 50 electric vehicles to its municipal fleet, and putting in more charging for them, as well as a pair of fast chargers (one public). This is good news, but Bloomberg is leaving office and it’s uncertain if his successor will be as bullish on electrics. Mixed Record Bloomberg’s record on green cars is largely positive, but on taxis it’s a bit mixed. He pioneered the introduction of hybrid cars into taxi fleets, but then launched the Taxi for Tomorrow initiative that got mired in politics and the letter of the law, and ended up selecting a non-hybrid Nissan. Farkas says his company will expand its efforts in New York, and will shortly announce a major new initiative there. He says that Bloomberg’s focus on EVs in his speech helps, and the parking lot initiative would be a godsend. “It would make it much cheaper for us to roll out our infrastructure if the conduit is there,” he said. New York is a modern city, but Farkas says that many of its buildings have antiquated electrical systems, which makes wiring more expensive. The positive side is that centrally located chargers are within reach of a surprisingly large number of EV owners. “We’re seeing expanded use of our stations,” he said. So to any future EV planners in New York, the Bronx is up and the Battery’s down, and there’s enormous room for growth in an industry that is really just getting started. plugincarsDOTcom/new-york-city-if-evs-can-make-it-here-126449.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360988589447</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 23:23:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
