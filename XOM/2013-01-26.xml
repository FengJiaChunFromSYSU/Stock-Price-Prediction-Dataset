But it did last about 1000 years. The Germans, on the other hand, thought they were so superior they started two world wars and were destroyed by others in a matter of a few years. I guess some, like you, refuse to learn from history. I love to watch self righteous demagogues who believe they are the only ones with the answers. They inevitably crash and burn as will you.

Look up Mussolini fascist - fasces - Roman Catholic Centre Party vote - Enabling Act the Fuhrer's Concordat with Rome and see how Hitler came to power. Nazism was quite Roman, and aped Mussolini's Roman fascist ideology in just about every way except speaking Italian. Hitler was no more a German than Churchill. The two were Germanic, but then most Americans are Germanic too, at least they will be for a few years more. Hitler was born and raised an Austrian. And Austrian and German are not the same thing, especially not in those days. And let me clear something up for you: I have no respect for people who deserve none. It defies rational thinking to display such respect unless one happens to want something from the unworthy party, and you have nothing of value I could possibly want. It is obvious when someone knows nothing too, except just popular media garbage...

Come on Hansi, Rome isn't the problem today." Romanism - is a collection of cultural traits. Rome is a city... You are obviously too brainwashed with liberal American thought to even comprehend the issues or how to make money from the comprehension. Have you ever heard of the acronym PIGS? - (P)ortugal, (I)taly, (G)reece, (S)pain. All one need have done in the latest financial crisis was draw a red-line around the areas of Europe that were not Germanic and you had a 100% accurate prediction of just where the weakness would lie and just exactly which sovereign bonds to short. Drawing Germanic and Roman into the euro was the ultimate folly. A topic of thought for you: Did the London bankers and hedge funds, and their New York compatriots, think that acronym up before or after the fact? Some saw this coming and made large bets... California is ground zero for the destruction of American Germanic culture with Mexican Romanism too. Determining which banks and insurance companies were making loans in California gave you perfect information on which banks to short in the latest financial crisis, just as it did with European bond, CDS, etc... US Census Bureau data are most useful. The United States of America as a whole has done quite well as a Germanic country, which is in contrast to every other part of America that is not Germanic and is a failure. Since 1994 and the Mexican Tequila crisis, and wide open borders, it has deteriorated rapidly.... The American Progressives of old understood these issues perfekt.

Today, a sizable gap still exists between the efficiency of laboratory and commercial-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and the predicted maximum efficiencies of different solar cell materials. Accelerating breakthroughs in solar cell conversion efficiency will help continue to lower the overall cost of solar power; drive the development of advanced, low-cost PV modules; and fortify America's leadership in the global solar energy market. In 1961, William Shockley and Hans Queisser published their seminal research detailing the limit of energy conversion efficiency for solar cells. Since then, various solar technologies have come closer to meeting this maximum level, about 30% for a single-junction solar cell. The initiative announced today—the Foundational Program to Advance Cell Efficiency II (FPACEII)—aims to accelerate record-breaking conversion efficiencies that will close the gap with this theoretical limit for a variety of PV cells including silicon-based technologies and thin-film materials such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cooper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS). The new funding opportunity announced today builds on the SunShot Initiative's FPACEI projects awarded in September 2011 which are aimed at eliminating the gap between the efficiencies of best prototype cells achieved in the laboratory and the efficiencies of typical cells produced on manufacturing lines. In the current solicitation, FPACEII seeks proposals from collaborative teams of researchers from national laboratories, universities, and industry that can develop materials model systems and fabricate prototype devices that achieve efficiencies near the Shockley-Queisser limit. For more information related to this funding opportunity, visit the Funding Opportunity Exchange website. The Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy accelerates development and facilitates deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and market-based solutions that strengthen U.S. energy security, environmental quality, and economic vitality. The SunShot Initiative is a collaborative national effort to make solar energy cost competitive with other forms of energy by the end of the decade. Inspired by President Kennedy's "Moon Shot" program that put the first man on the moon, the SunShot Initiative has created new momentum for the solar industry by highlighting the need for American competitiveness in the clean energy race. apps1DOTeereDOTenergyDOTgov/news/progress_alertsDOTcfm/pa_id=830</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359228264714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:24:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359228577482-14</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 XOM Earnings Conference Call</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359206444124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 08:20:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>XOM Chart bigchartsDOTmarketwatchDOTcom/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&amp;insttype=Stock&amp;symb=xom&amp;time=6&amp;startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&amp;enddate=1%2F8%2F2012&amp;freq=1&amp;compidx=aaaaa%3A0&amp;comptemptext=&amp;comp=&amp;ma=4&amp;maval=9+15+50&amp;uf=7168&amp;lf=1&amp;lf2=4&amp;lf3=2&amp;type=4&amp;style=320&amp;size=3&amp;timeFrameToggle=false&amp;compareToToggle=false&amp;indicatorsToggle=false&amp;chartStyleToggle=false&amp;state=11&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Analyst Estimates marketwatchDOTcom/investing/stock/xom/analystestimates</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359228577482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:29:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359229390756-15</Id><Title>Chile Adding 2.2 GW Of New Solar Power Capacity</Title><Msg>Chile Adding 2.2 GW Of New Solar Power Capacity January 26, 2013 Nathan Chile is aiming to add about 2.2 GW of new solar power installations to its grid within the next 15 years, according to a newly released plan. In the 125-page report, the National Energy Commission (CNE) states that investment in solar energy in the northern electricity transmission system will be equivalent to the price of coal power (at US$2,500 per kW), and that in the central electricity system, solar will be only slightly more expensive. Of course, these prices don’t include the health and climate costs of coal, which, in a perfect world, they would. The report “lists 13 solar plants with a combined capacity of 1.5 GW that are expected to come online on SING up to 2028.” As the report states, the 100MW-scale Sol De Lua and Crucero 1 plants are due to come online in 2014, and be followed in 2015 by the 50MW Arica 1 and 100MW Crucero 2. “In 2016, the 50 MW Arica 2 and 100 MW Pozo Almonte 1 will start production, followed by the 100 MW-sized Crucero 3 and Laguna 2 in 2018 and the similarly sized Pozo Almonte 2 in 2019.” Then, they will be followed by the Solar Sing 1 and Solar Sing 2 in 2026 and Solar Sing 3 in 2028, each of which will be 200 MW. “Eight more plants totalling 700 MW are slated for development on the SIC network, including the 100 MW Sol de Almagro 1, Inca de Oro 1 and Carrera Pinto 1 (in 2018) and the 50 MW Sol de Vallenar 1 (in 2018 or 2019). The remaining four plants – the 100 MW Sol de Almagro 1, Inca de Oro 2 and Carrera Pinto 2 and the 50 MW Sol de Vallenar 2 – will be developed in the next decade up to 2027.” Chile is continuing to move forward in its transition to becoming a clean energy giant in the region. Just earlier this month, it approved over 3.1 GW of new solar power projects. With the enormous solar power potential in the region, the country could easily receive all of its energy needs solely from solar power. sDOTtt/1yYRc</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359229390756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:43:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359230686410-16</Id><Title>Smith Electric Vehicles will build big electric trucks in Chicago</Title><Msg>Smith Electric Vehicles will build big electric trucks in Chicago By Jon LeSage Posted Dec 4th 2012 4:11PM Comments7 Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Smith Electric Vehicles are working together to create an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Chicago. Smith Electric Vehicles was drawn to the city by the mayor's voucher system designed to accelerate conversion from diesel to zero-emission electric vehicles, a large number of fleets that are interested in going electric and development incentives offered to Smith. Smith is saying it will create "hundreds of direct and indirect jobs" there. The Chicago Department of Transportation has a $15-million incentive program set up to encourage companies to modernize their fleets, converting some to electric power. The initial $15 million for this program is funded by resources from the federal Congestion Mitigation Air Quality program. It provides vouchers to assist companies in reducing their conversion costs. Through its program and similar federal incentive programs, Chicago has helped deploy 404 cleaner vehicles, mainly compressed natural gas vehicles, along with 202 electric vehicle charging stations. Chicago has been committed for a while to bringing electrified vehicles and a charging infrastructure to the area. Mayor Emanuel says the Smith partnership is a smart way to create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs and to boost the already rapidly growing battery and electric vehicle sector in the city. As former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, Emanuel was involved in pushing for policies that integrated job creation with environmental concerns and energy security. This will be the third US city where Smith has locations set up, including its headquarters in Kansas City, MO, and a manufacturing facility in New York City. Smith has been looking for ways to grow its capital investments and audience. Not long ago, the company was looking to go public on the Nasdaq exchange, but has canceled that plan. New owners bought the decades-old company from its UK-based parent company in 2011. Smith has done an impressive job of breaking into the electrified fleet market. Customers include Frito-Lay, FedEx, Staples, TNT, Sainsbury's, Coca-Cola, DHL and the US military. In addition to the deal with the city of Chicago, Smith announced that FedEx Express is adding 100 Smith vehicles in the US, Europe and Asia, and that Coca-Cola's pilot deployment of Smith vehicles has been successful enough that additional EVs will be purchased in 2013. greenDOTautoblogDOTcom/2012/12/04/smith-electric-vehicles-will-build-big-electric-vans-in-chicago/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359230686410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:04:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359231530680-17</Id><Topic><Title>Smith Electric Vehicles will build big electric trucks in Chicago</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359230686410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Testa Produce Adds Electric Trucks To Delivery Fleet LEED® Platinum Distributor Continues to Raise the Bar on Sustainability By Testa Produce Published: Tuesday, Jan. 15, 2013 - 7:09 am CHICAGO, Jan. 15, 2013 -- /PRNewswire/ -- Testa Produce has added two new trucks to its delivery fleet, both of which operate solely on electricity.
