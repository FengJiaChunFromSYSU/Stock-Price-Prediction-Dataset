Speaking to delegates at the annual European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) conference in Vienna, the IEA's Dr Fatih Birol described fossil fuel subsidies as "public enemy number one" for the production of sustainable energy. FURTHER READING Updated: Nuclear renaissance under fire as Centrica confirms project exit Wind farms are Spain's top electricity producers Figures from the IEA show that global fossil fuel subsidies jumped to $523bn in 2011, which Birol said represented an incentive to emit carbon equivalent to $110 per tonne. In contrast, the EU emissions trading system currently provides a disincentive to emit carbon of less than $10 per tonne. Analysts argue that the bulk of fossil fuel subsidies are found in developing and emerging economies, but Birol has consistently maintained that huge subsidies and tax breaks are tilting the global energy market in favour of fossil fuels. "On one hand these countries talk about renewable energy, efficiencies and climate change, and at the same time subsidises fossil fuel energy - [it] does not make sense," he said. "All the countries and governments of the world need to pay attention to this issue. "In the presence of these fossil fuel subsidies... we have no chance whatsoever to meet these climate change targets and provide room for renewable energies to compete with coal, oil and gas as they are artificially cheap as a result of those subsidies." In response to critics who claim wind power and other renewables are too intermittent and unpredictable to be a reliable energy source, Birol argued that political unpredictability rather than technical challenges was the greatest barrier facing green energy markets. "My message to governments is that if their policies are as predictable as the availability of wind, we will win this game," he said. Answering questions from BusinessGreen, Birol said he had little optimism any country would scrap fossil fuel subsidies in the near to medium future, particularly following a recent spike in oil prices as a result of the Arab Spring. "Before the Arab Spring, there was among some countries in the Middle East and North Africa an appetite for fossil fuel subsidy reduction but I'm afraid this appetite is not there anymore," he said. "Some countries like Russia, India did make some progress. But overall, if there is no major push, I don't expect a major change in these policies." He also criticised those countries in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America that claim fossil fuel subsidies are key to boosting development. "They claim that people need fossil fuel subsides to help the poor, but our analysis shows that only eight per cent of this half a trillion dollars goes to the 20 per cent of the lowest income levels and the remaining 80 per cent goes to middle and higher income levels," he said. "So it doesn't help development." The comments come on the same day as a new analysis from Friends of the Earth revealed that British Chancellor George Osborne has handed oil and gas firms tax breaks worth nearly £1bn, despite the government's stated support for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. businessgreenDOTcom/bg/news/2241226/iea-chief-fossil-fuel-subsidies-are-public-enemy-number-one-for-green-energy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360324965753</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 07:02:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360325702720-4</Id><Title>WHATS NEXT</Title><Msg>MCP AKS GST</Msg><Username>maker.stock</Username><Timestamp>1360325702720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 07:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360327584870-5</Id><Topic><Title>Where is maxi pad</Title><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1360241132666</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 07:45:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In prison cell 1544 in Louisiana.

The adaptation plans outline initiatives to reduce the vulnerability of federal assets, programs, and investments to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and more frequent and severe weather, the White House Council on Environmental Quality said. Federal agencies are required to develop sustainability plans outlining how they will meet environmental and energy goals set in Executive Order No. 13,514, which was issued by President Obama in 2009. Agencies are required to reduce petroleum use in vehicles by 30 percent by 2020, improve water efficiency by 26 percent by 2020, divert or recycle 50 percent of waste by 2015, and meet other targets under the order. The climate change adaptation plans are part of larger agency sustainability plans. Agencies also included fleet management plans and strategies to purchase more biobased-products in their sustainability plans in 2012. The 2012 sustainability plans were reviewed by CEQ and then approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget before being made publicly available. The climate change adaptation plans will be open for public comment for 60 days. The sustainability plan for the Agriculture Department states that the department has reduced indirect greenhouse gas emissions by more than 12 percent since 2008, has reduced potable water use by nearly 19 percent since 2007, and has purchased or generated renewable energy equivalent to nearly 20 percent its total electricity use. The sustainability plan for the Interior Department states that the department has reduced potable water intensity by more than 11 percent since 2007, among other reductions. EPA to Help Vulnerable Coastal Communities Building the country's capacity to adapt to climate change is part of the Environmental Protection Agency's mission to protect human health and the environment, the agency said in its climate change adaptation plan. Climate change is likely to increase tropospheric ozone levels over broad areas of the country, which may increase the vulnerability of U.S. citizens to air pollution, EPA said. As a result, it may be more difficult to attain or maintain ozone standards, which may require EPA to implement new control measures, the agency said. Climate change will also affect the quality and availability of drinking water supplies, and EPA may need to take action to address these issues, the agency said. Increasing heavy-precipitation events from climate change may increase the pollutants in runoff, dirtying streams and threatening public health, EPA said. EPA said it will integrate climate change adaptation planning into its programs and policies; increase the resilience of EPA facilities in coastal areas to protect them from severe weather, flood damage, and sea level rise; and help communities in vulnerable areas, such as low-lying coastal areas, reduce their exposure to climate change impacts. Groups Laud Agency Plans Elizabeth Martin Perera, senior Washington representative at the Sierra Club, said in a Feb. 7 statement: “It's good to see the government coming to terms with the impacts of climate disruption at the agency-level and now we hope these agencies will rapidly transition to a low-carbon and more resilient future. The Sierra Club is happy to see the government release these plans that evaluate risks and vulnerabilities of both the short- and long-term effects of climate disruption on everything the government does.” Daniel Weiss, senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, said in an emailed statement: “The horrible devastation from super storm Sandy and other recent climate related extreme weather events makes it essential that EPA and other federal agencies help communities protect their residents and infrastructure from future floods, drought, heat waves, storms, and wildfires. “At the same time, the federal government must adopt policies to reduce the industrial carbon pollution responsible for climate change, beginning with existing power plants,” he said.

S 251, which Sens. Mike Crapo (Idaho), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), and David Vitter (La.) offered on Feb. 7, followed a similar measure that House Energy and Commerce Committee members Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) and Jim Matheson (D-Utah) introduced on Feb. 6. Crapo said that current law and annual EPA estimates require US refiners to blend millions of gallons of cellulosic biofuel into US fuel supplies, even if it’s not being produced. Only 1,024 gal of product that could have been used to meet the cellulosic biofuel mandate were produced in 2012, he noted. Yet in 2013, EPA is requiring 14 million gal to be blended, which is almost double the 8.65 million gal initially required in 2012, Crapo said. “Requiring industry to use millions of gallons of a substance that does not exist and in turn fining them for noncompliance is irrational and unfair,” he maintained. Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed 2013 biofuels quotas representing more than 1.35 billion gal from what it mandated for 2012 (OGJ Online, Feb. 1, 2013). Industry reacts American Petroleum Institute and American Fuels &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers executives endorsed goals of the bills. “EPA’s mandate for nonexistent biofuels is effectively a tax on making gasoline that could ultimately burden consumers,” said Bob Greco, API’s downstream group director. “The agency is directed by Congress and a recent DC Circuit Court order to set the fuel requirement at a realistic volume,” he explained. “But EPA continues to set absurd mandates based on production promises by biofuel producers that disappoint year after year. This is bad public policy, and it’s time for Congress to step in and put a stop to it.” ADPM President Charles T. Drevna said the organization is grateful to the bills’ sponsors for recognizing that this nonsensical mandate forces refiners to pay for fuels that do not exist. “EPA’s actions make clear that only legislative remedies will constrain the agency’s haphazard and irresponsible implementation of this unworkable mandate,” he declared. “This bill highlights and would solve just one of the many inherent problems with the [Renewable Fuel Standard], and magnifies the need for Congress to repeal an unnecessary and costly law.” ogjDOTcom/articles/2013/02/us-senate-republicans-aim-to-reform-epa-cellulosic-biofuel-rule.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360348433609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 13:33:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360349218131-32</Id><Title>New York City Eyeing Wider Use of Biodiesel</Title><Msg>New York City Eyeing Wider Use of Biodiesel Posted by Jack Curran | Feb 7, 2013 PHOTO Kevin B./City Limits Most of the city's fleet already uses biodiesel, but some want New York to embrace a mandate for public—and perhaps some private—vehicles. As New York attempts to improve its environmental efficiency, biodiesel has become a key tool. Biodiesel is currently used to heat homes throughout the city and power the city’s fleet. With the first biodiesel mandates going into effect this winter, biodiesel use in New York City may continue to grow. According to the National Biodiesel Board, biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from agricultural oils, fats and greases. Biodiesel is normally blended with petroleum diesel. Biodiesel blends are identified with a number representing the percentage of biodiesel in them. Blends can range from B2, a blend with 2 percent biodiesel, to B100, pure biodiesel. Biodiesel can be used for anything that traditional petroleum diesel is used for. Biodiesel produces fewer emissions than traditional diesel. The U.S. Department of Energy has certified that pure biodiesel produces 86 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional diesel. The Environmental Protection agency has also found that switching from diesel to a B20 biodiesel blend in vehicles produces 12 percent less carbon monoxide, 20 percent less unburned hydrocarbons and 16 percent less carbon dioxide over the life of the vehicle. Last week, the City Council committees on Environmental Protection and Sanitation &amp; Solid Waste Management met to discuss future plans for reducing emissions from the city’s fleet—including possible biodiesel mandates for all of the city’s diesel vehicles. The committee heard from a panel made up representatives from biodiesel and renewable energy groups and representatives of city departments directly affected by the city’s previous fleet emission reduction laws. In his testimony, Stephen Levy of Sprague Energy said biodiesel has become a viable option for New York City. “There are dozens of suppliers, there has been a great history of using biodiesel of many blends and concentrations, not just here within the city, but throughout the country and it is a proven product.” Most of the panelists supported a biodiesel mandate for the city’s fleet. During his testimony, Mike Gilsenan, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Environmental Protection, said his department’s plans for updating the air pollution control code involve biodiesel requirements that could affect public vehicles. “DEP, as part of revisions to the air code, is proposing stricter standards on the city fleet including increasing the fuel economy percentages, requiring the use of biodiesel and requiring that vehicles that cannot install retrofit technology after receiving a three-year waiver, must retire that vehicle from service,” he said. Although no official mandates have been made, most of the city’s fleet currently uses some blend of biodiesel. Scott Hedderich, the director of corporate affairs for Renewable Energy Group, said this was a good step for the city, and it should begin using stronger blends. “Having B5 fleet wide is an excellent first step that mimics what other states have done,” Hedderich said. “Moving to a B20 is a natural next step.” The panel also discussed the idea of creating public biodiesel requirements. Hedderich said if biodiesel works for the city fleet, then it should it will work for the rest of the city. “If it’s good for the city fleet, if it’s good economics, if it’s good for the health and well being of New Yorkers, why stop at the city fleet?” he said. “If the city can successfully implement B20 in its fleet … the City Council should look at an innovative way to take forward thinking and apply it to all diesel vehicles.” Most drivers would not be affected by biodiesel requirements, as few American cars run on diesel, and cannot use biodiesel. Diesel is typically used by trucks and some SUVs. Citywide biodiesel requirements would mainly affect private-sector construction and shipping vehicles. Biodiesel can also be used with heating oil for home heating. In 2010, the City Council passed, and Bloomberg signed a law requiring all home heating oil sold within the city must be made with biodiesel by October 2012. John Maniscalco of the New York Oil Heating Association, a group that represents oil dealers in New York City, said BioHeat is a low-sulfur blend of biodiesel and heating oil. “BioHeat is ultra low sulfur heating oil combined with a percentage of biodiesel,” Maniscalco said. “BioHeat in New York City is 98 percent petroleum product, 2 percent agricultural.” Although critics of the law argue that BioHeat will increase the cost of oil heating, several tax incentives have been created to keep the costs low. Last month Congress reinstated a federal biodiesel tax incentive. Until the end of 2013, suppliers of biodiesel will receive $1 for every gallon sold for both vehicles and homes. With this incentive, the price of biodiesel is equal to the price of traditional diesel. New York State also has a BioHeat tax incentive. The state currently offers a tax credit of $.01 per gallon for each percent of biodiesel used in home heating. All city residents using the mandated 2 percent BioHeat blend will be able to file for a $.02 per gallon tax credit at the end of the year. Maniscalco said the combined tax incentives keep the cost of oil heating low. “With the Biodiesel tax credits at the state level as well as the federal level, [BioHeat] reduces the costs,” he said. citylimitsDOTorg/blog/blog/254/new-york-city-eyeing-wider-use-of-biodiesel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360349218131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 13:46:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360350144903-33</Id><Topic><Title>WAHLEEE SIGHTING</Title><Username>wahleee_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1360332284081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 09:04:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HILARIOUS!!</Msg><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1360350144903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:02:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360350450668-34</Id><Title>Vilsack assures support for ethanol</Title><Msg>Vilsack assures support for ethanol Speaking at ethanol trade group events, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack reassured the industry of the support coming from the Obama administration. By: Jerry Hagstrom, Agweek LAS VEGAS — If the ethanol and biodiesel industries need reassurance of support from the Obama administration, they got it here on Feb. 8 from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. But they also got some advice on how to convince people outside their industry to support them. “The biodiesel industry is making us a more secure country, and the most exciting piece is that it’s not just limited to fuel and energy,” Vilsack said in his speech to the National Biodiesel Board. “Because of how innovative you are, with new technology and techniques ... you’ve given birth to a biobased economy, and with that the possibility of a new American economy.” Vilsack made similar comments to the National Ethanol Conference, telling the 1,100 attendees that they are responsible for increasing farm income, allowing Americans to have less expensive gas, reducing the country’s dependence on foreign oil and increasing entrepreneurship. And speaking with reporters afterwards, the secretary reiterated the administration’s support for the Renewable Fuel Standard. “Our position is that we are strong supporters of the RFS,” Vilsack said. “It is doing what it is supposed to do.” Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Bob Dinneen noted that Vilsack has been a supporter of ethanol since he was governor of Iowa. But the secretary also told both conventions that they and the RFS are under attack because they have been so successful. “Unfortunately it is a challenging industry,” Vilsack told the Renewable Fuels Association. “It is challenged by those who perpetuate the falsehood that you are asking us in this country of plenty to choose between fuel and food.” American farmers, he added, “have been able to produce enough corn to meet domestic needs, as well as export.” Environmentalists who criticize ethanol, he said, do not realize it improves air quality. Vilsack told both groups they need to “fight back” by extending their influence. In rural America, he said, “We do a great job of talking to ourselves, we pat ourselves on the back, [but] we have to find a way to talk to a broader audience.” The first step they could take, he said, is take an interest in the nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., to be Defense secretary. In previous speeches, Vilsack has said he believed Hagel would be in favor of continuing use of biofuels in the military, but this time he said “we ought to be out there supporting Hagel.” Vilsack noted that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus believes that 50 percent of the Navy’s fuel should come from U.S.-produced biofuels, but that he needs the support of the Defense secretary to continue that policy. Vilsack also said that the biofuels producers should form alliances with environmental groups that support them and make sure that chambers of commerce and local development groups are aware of the economic power and job creation of biofuels. Dinneen does a great job of responding to the criticism, he said, but the industry needs a proactive message to remind people of its contributions to society. That audience should include young people, Vilsack said, adding that they should recruit FFA students to use Facebook, Twitter and “create a YouTube sensation” to communicate their message. “They want a role. It is their future, their rural America,” Vilsack said. agweekDOTcom/event/article/id/20504/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360350450668</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:07:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360351134788-35</Id><Title>OXF - Easy Money!</Title><Msg>Value trade!</Msg><Username>m.gild</Username><Timestamp>1360351134788</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:18:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360351969346-36</Id><Title>Major oil company breaks with trade group over SEC disclosure lawsuit</Title><Msg>Major oil company breaks with trade group over SEC disclosure lawsuit By Ben Geman - 02/08/13 01:08 PM ET Norwegian oil-and-gas giant Statoil is distancing itself from petroleum industry litigation to scuttle Securities and Exchange Commission rules (SEC) that will force oil and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. The multinational company’s position has delighted human-rights groups that back the rule, and activists are using Statoil’s stance to try and build support for the controversial regulation that’s required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. “Statoil has not supported the lawsuit initiated by [the American Petroleum Institute]; in fact, Statoil has explicitly withheld support for the litigation. As you know, we have not taken an active stand regarding the lawsuit, but chose to communicate our view on the new rule to the SEC, internally in the API and in other relevant fora,” the company said in a late January letter to the watchdog group Global Witness. The American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and two other groups filed in a lawsuit in October to overturn the rules that the SEC finalized in August. The business groups allege the rules will create costly burdens, violate companies’ First Amendment rights and place companies listed on U.S. exchanges at a disadvantage when competing overseas against Russian and Chinese companies that aren’t bound by the mandate. The disclosure rule will force SEC-listed oil, natural-gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments (including the U.S.) related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses, taxes, royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects.   It’s aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the “resource curse,” in which some impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth. Advocates of the rule are circulating the Statoil letter. “We are encouraged to see a major oil company with global operations in such places as Angola, China and the United States refusing to support a lawsuit based on unsubstantiated claims,” said Ian Gary, senior policy manager of Oxfam America’s oil, gas and mining program, in a statement. Statoil has emphasized its support for transparency but has also expressed some concerns about the SEC rule that are, in some cases, aligned with other companies and industry groups that have challenged the measure aggressively. In 2011 comments to the SEC (available here) when the rule was under development, Statoil called, for instance, for provisions that would allow exemptions from reporting payments if they aren’t allowed in a country where a company is operating. The final rule did not provide such an exemption. Opponents have argued that such provisions would allow a “tyrant’s veto” of the rules by foreign governments. “Although Statoil has expressed its concerns about elements of the 1504 law, the fact that an incredibly profitable company like Statoil chose to communicate their views about the law through regular fora, rather than a lawsuit, raises serious questions about claims being made by API,” said Isabel Munilla of the Publish What You Pay coalition. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/281957-major-oil-company-breaks-with-trade-group-over-sec-disclosure-lawsuit</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360351969346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360353636705-37</Id><Title>Ethanol plant planned for Spiritwood Energy Park receives EPA certification</Title><Msg>Ethanol plant planned for Spiritwood Energy Park receives EPA certification Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Great River Energy announced today that the Environmental Protection Agency has approved Renewable Fuel Standard-2 certification for the company’s Dakota Spirit AgEnergy facility in the Spiritwood Energy Park near Jamestown. Published February 08, 2013, 12:45 PM By: Sun Staff, The Jamestown Sun Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Great River Energy announced today that the Environmental Protection Agency has approved Renewable Fuel Standard-2 certification for the company’s Dakota Spirit AgEnergy facility in the Spiritwood Energy Park near Jamestown. Dakota Spirit AgEnergy, currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRE, will have a significant impact on the local economy, creating 36 direct jobs in the community. The project will also create approximately 275 trade and construction jobs during the 18-month construction period. Hoeven last summer pressed EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to expedite the approval process. A press release from Hoeven’s office said this notice of certification clears the way for GRE to market next-generation biofuels as part of a model energy complex. The biorefinery will use 23 million bushels of No. 2 yellow corn to produce annually 65 million gallons of ethanol, as well as corn oil and distiller’s grains. The facility will be located adjacent to GRE’s Spiritwood Station, a combined heat and coal-fired power plant, which will provide excess steam to produce ethanol at the biorefinery. Future growth opportunities for the biorefinery are also being explored, including emerging technologies such as cellulosic feed stocks, and the production of isobutanol, an organic compound used primarily as a solvent. The facility will also incorporate technology to meet the EPA’s revised Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires cornstarch-based ethanol production facilities built after 2007 to have lifecycle carbon emissions 20 percent lower than conventional motor fuels. The Spiritwood Energy Park complex includes Spiritwood Station, a coal-fired plant that produces both electricity and steam, and now the Dakota Spirit AgEnergy facility. CHS, a Fortune 500 company owned by agricultural cooperatives and farmers and ranchers, is also planning to build a $1.4 billion fertilizer plant in the park to take advantage of shared resources and infrastructure. Hoeven said the project will become a national example of how combined heat and power can be used to enhance industrial efficiencies and lower the carbon footprint of transportation motor fuels. “With the addition of Dakota Spirit AgEnergy, the Spiritwood Energy Park brings to life the concept of energy colocation – partnering traditional and renewable energy facilities to create new syntheses and drive the new technology that will create more energy with better environmental stewardship,” Hoeven said. “GRE’s is taking a step into the future with this ambitious new facility, which will bring the energy and agriculture industries together and take our nation one step closer to energy security.” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., also applauded the announcement in a press release. “When Great River Energy reached out to me last year to let me know that they were at a standstill with EPA on the approval process and were in danger of having their financing pulled if the delays persisted, I made this an priority for my staff and I to help get this done,” Heitkamp said. “After exhaustive efforts by all parties involved and thanks to extensive preparation by Great River, another North Dakota ethanol biorefinery is on the cusp being up and running. I applaud Dakota Spirit AgEnergy’s efforts on its progress, and I look forward to continued collaboration with Dakota Spirit and other North Dakota stakeholders to lead the nation in energy development. The increase in North Dakota production of biofuels is not only good for our state’s economy, but it will help us to alleviate our dependence on foreign oil.” Rep Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., the state’s only member of the U.S. House of Representatives, also praised the announcement. “I am pleased the Dakota Spirit AgEnergy ethanol biorefinery achieved its renewable fuels certification. The ability of this project to utilize the synergies of the water supply, energy and agricultural resources in our state is an excellent demonstration of North Dakota ingenuity,” Cramer said. “Our dynamic economy serves as a leader for the rest of the nation. The Dakota Spirit AgEnergy ethanol biorefineries expected creation of several hundred jobs certainly maintains this reputation.” jamestownsunDOTcom/event/article/id/179371/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1360353636705</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:00:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360354957507-38</Id><Topic><Title>XOM needs to raise its dividend BIG-TIME immediately.</Title><Username>perho</Username><Timestamp>1360340970066</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:29:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They should also Splitz The Stock 3 for 1,so the less fortunate can begin accumulating.</Msg><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1360354957507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:22:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360356404775-39</Id><Title>There’s not much shy about the project, signed in 2010.
