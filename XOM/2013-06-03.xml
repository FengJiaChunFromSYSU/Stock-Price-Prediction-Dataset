Poet, the second-largest U.S. maker of the corn-based fuel, argued that the standard, which requires transportation fuel-sellers in California to reduce the “carbon intensity” of their products by 10 percent by 2020, should be held invalid because regulators approved it before completing an environmental review. “We’re looking for alternative remedies to throwing out the regulations completely,” Justice Rebecca Wiseman said today at the start of an hour-long hearing before the California Court of Appeal in Fresno. Wiseman and two other judges on a panel hearing the case didn’t make a final ruling. Poet’s lawsuit is one of two cases by out-of-state ethanol producers challenging the low-carbon fuel rule, which assigns a higher carbon intensity score to ethanol produced outside California. While the fuel is chemically and physically identical to ethanol produced in the state, more emissions are produced by corn farming, transportation and processing elsewhere, California officials say. The Fresno case is Poet LLC v. California Air Resources Board, F064045, California Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District (Fresno). bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-05-30/california-carbon-fuel-standard-may-remain-in-place.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370236776147</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370270089739-2</Id><Topic><Title>How rich is too rich?</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370196460519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 14:07:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Germany tried the Deutschland über alles thing once before and it didn't work.

See “Bridge To Nowhere? NOAA Confirms High Methane Leakage Rate Up To 9% From Gas Fields, Gutting Climate Benefit.” Here’s yet another study. Methane data collected from Florida to California in 2010. Both the spatial average and the raw data show the highest levels were in the East Texas area, decreasing westward and eastward. UC Santa Barbara news release After taking a rented camper outfitted with special equipment to measure methane on a cross-continent drive, a UC Santa Barbara scientist has found that methane emissions across large parts of the U.S. are higher than currently known, confirming what other more local studies have found. Their research is published in the journal Atmospheric Environment. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, stronger than carbon dioxide on a 20-year timescale, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, though on a century timescale, carbon dioxide is far stronger. “This research suggests significant benefits to slowing climate change could result from reducing industrial methane emissions in parallel with efforts on carbon dioxide,” said Ira Leifer, a researcher with UCSB’s Marine Science Institute. Leifer was joined by two UCSB undergraduate students on the road trip from Los Angeles to Florida, taking a primarily southern route through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and along the Gulf of Mexico. They used specialized instrumentation, a gas chromatograph, to measure methane. The device was mounted in the RV, with an air ram on the roof that collected air samples from in front of the vehicle. “We tried to pass through urban areas during nighttime hours, to avoid being thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/06/03/2080621/nationwide-air-sampling-confirms-methane-emissions-across-large-parts-of-the-us-are-higher-than-currently-known/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370285330419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 14:48:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370288362819-7</Id><Topic><Title>How rich is too rich?</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370196460519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 14:07:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the latest beauty contest conducted by the BBC, encompassing the views of 16000 people around the world, Germany ranked #1, and Israel was just about dead last.
