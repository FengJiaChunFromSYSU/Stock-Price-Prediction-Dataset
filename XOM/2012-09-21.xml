"You, cover your eyes," she replied, instead putting her dukes up and giving him a shove. "I fell on my back on the floor,” the cleric said, according to a state news report obtained by Bloomberg. “I don’t know what happened after that, all I could feel was the kicks of this woman who was insulting me and attacking me." He was hospitalized for three days, but he says "commanding right and forbidding wrong" is a religious obligation and he'd do it again.

Manufacturers, oil refiners and others appeared before the California Air Resources Board to protest the state's pending cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The program's fees amount to a $1 billion-a-year tax increase at a time when the state's economy is sputtering, they said. "We are concerned that out-of-state refiners will have an unfair advantage because they are not being held responsible for their emissions," said Lisa Bowman, a Phillips 66 worker and member of United Steelworkers Local 675. The California Chamber of Commerce and others wrote Gov. Jerry Brown urging him to halt the start of the program, which begins in earnest on Nov. 14 and is the central element of California's 2006 climate-change law, AB32. A key issue for those opposed to the program is costs associated with the permits — called allowances — which the program will require businesses to buy, some at auction. In general, cap-and-trade will place a limit, or cap, of the emissions of heat-trapping gases that are allowed from pollution producers like refineries and cement manufacturers. The businesses will be required to buy these allowances from the state, with each permit allowing for a specified amount of greenhouse gases each year. For the first two years of the program, businesses will receive 90 percent of their allowances for free, with the free amount and the cap declining over time. The chamber and other businesses want the amount of free allowances increased to reduce the impact on their businesses in a struggling economy. "The fact is that this auction represents a multi-billion dollar hidden tax that will harm California businesses and consumers by dramatically increasing energy costs at a time we can least afford it," the letter to the governor stated. Business groups say the uncertainty about what costs associated with cap-and-trade will be in 2015 — when the number of free allowances are set to be reduced — are influencing investment decisions being made now. They want assurance that those costs will be lowered by offering more free allowances. "We need to send the message now ... that more allowances will be available to industry," said Dorothy Rothrock of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. "2015 is right around the corner and manufacturers are making plans this year for the next three-to-five years and capital investments may or may not happen in California based on the current regulations." The board has designed the system to financially reward businesses that reduce emissions below their cap — meaning money could be made through cap and trade. Companies that cut emissions and have extra allowances can then sell the permits in a marketplace; greenhouse gas emitters could purchase those allowances if they failed to cut emissions. Polluters that reduce emissions could turn a profit if the market price for extra allowances rises above the initial cost of the permit. "This system rewards those that are more efficient and allows those who can't or don't want to reduce their emissions too keep on operating and pass the cost of allowances on to their customers," Mary Nichols, the board's chairman, said. A company can also meet up to 8 percent of its emissions reduction obligations by purchasing carbon "offsets," or investments in forestry or other projects that reduce greenhouse gases. The program, the largest in the U.S., is modeled on similar programs in Europe, and designed to be able to link up with plans in other states and elsewhere to increase the size of its market for carbon allowance trading. "(The board) has gone a long way to make these regulations as simple and palatable as possible," Nichols said. "At this point it's time for CMTA and WSPA and the chamber to join the many of hundreds of businesses that are investing in the fight against climate change instead of fighting AB32." rdmag</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348204504722</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 01:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348214009911-5</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Is So Unappealing They're Hiding Him</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1348144879873</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:41:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's definately a dull candidate.Too worried about beeing seen as "a nice guy" rather than throwing some punches and letting the chips fall where they may.Otherwise he ends up with junk like that fund raising video doing all the talking.Obama had his own fund riaser vid - the "Guns n' religion" vid.But he's a way better politician than Romney.

In a scathing report, the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said New York overcharged taxpayers by $15 billion since 1990. In 2011, New York charged a per-diem rate of $5,118 for residents of the institutions, a network of 11 centers that now house about 1,300 people with severe developmental disabilities. Over the course of a year, Medicaid spends $1.9 million for every resident, or $2.5 billion in total—with half coming from the federal government. But the cost of running the institutions is only a quarter of that amount. The report said New York took advantage of a complex formula and kept federal officials in the dark for years. It also faulted the federal agency that oversees Medicaid for waiting years before investigating after becoming aware of the high payments. "This is intentional fraud," said Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican committee member. The committee's report said Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration refused to cooperate with the investigation. Joshua Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the report's conclusions were "wrong and totally misleading" and that a threatened "precipitous reduction" in funding would jeopardize administration efforts to modernize and restructure its Medicaid program. The report could pose budget problems for Mr. Cuomo. Republican lawmakers in Washington are putting pressure on the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to crack down on New York's reimbursements. CMS officials had indicated that they favored a gradual reduction in the rates over several years. But at a Thursday hearing, Penny Thompson, a CMS deputy director, suggested that the agency may take a tougher line. "You can expect to see a rate that's about one-fifth of its current level," Ms. Thompson said, without specifying a time frame. Such a reduction would reduce the annual federal reimbursement by about $1 billion, punching a hole in New York's $54 billion Medicaid program. The skewed methodology traces back more than 20 years, when New York got permission from the federal government to use a different formula for state-run developmental centers, assuring officials that the rates would hew close to costs. But almost immediately, reimbursements began to skyrocket. The new methodology allowed New York to bill Medicaid for ghost patients: When a patient was discharged from a state-run facility, New York retained nearly two-thirds of the reimbursement amount. The formula also double-billed taxpayers: Many of those patients who left the centers moved into Medicaid-financed group homes. Between 1990 and 2011, the daily reimbursement rate grew to $5,118 from $348. Ms. Thompson said it wasn't clear if CMS "completely understood" the cost projections when it approved the rates. CMS officials acknowledge they first became aware of the problem in 2007 but waited three years before launching a probe.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348227919651</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 07:45:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348230355516-12</Id><Title>Not Just the Middle East: Obama Foreign Policy Record Is Appalling</Title><Msg>A few days ago on The Daily Beast, Leslie Gelb praised President Obama’s handling of the unfolding crisis in the Middle East last week and evidently discerns no connection between the ensuing wave of anti-American violence and the broader parameters of American foreign policy. He is wrong on both counts. The administration’s crisis management has been mediocre. Even more fundamentally, the current assault on America’s position in the Middle East is attributable not to the trailer for an obscure anti-Muslim movie, but to Obama’s own foreign-policy failures. The administration’s crisis-management strategy continues to emphasize its regret about that film, Innocence of Muslims. This was manifest not only in the original (and subsequently retracted) statement from our embassy in Cairo, but in all statements by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the president. But deploring efforts to denigrate Muslim religious beliefs is only the first half of the sentence. The administration should have also robustly propounded its commitment to the virtues and values of free expression in a free society, and why this must necessarily encompass offensive speech. Whenever the White House mentions the First Amendment these days, it is done mostly in a defensive mode, by way of explaining (almost in sorrow) to the Muslim world why the U.S. government cannot legally suppress anti-Muslim films rather than a compelling explanation of why such films should not be suppressed. As Clinton stated on Sept. 14, “I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day.” But simply saying that free speech is “enshrined in our Constitution” is not enough—the administration must explain why that is a good thing to which they too should aspire. The administration also has failed to tell the Muslim world that Western critics of religion, far from singling out Islam, regularly unleash a torrent of offensive speech directed at Christianity and Judaism. In addition, no senior administration official has seen fit to elucidate any historical perspective on America’s relationship with the Islamic world, including our unparalleled record of support for Muslim causes. Brief references to U.S. support for the Libyan revolution is not sufficient—this must be at the center of our message to the Muslim world. America and its NATO allies have spent their own blood and treasure to protect Muslims facing slaughter and oppression in places ranging from Afghanistan to Bosnia to Kosovo to Iraq. Equally lacking has been any public manifestation of the administration’s anger about the anti-American demonstrations that have taken place over the last week. Simply condemning violence is not enough. The administration must make clear that there can be no justification for any protests against America as a country simply because some private Americans have exercised their First Amendment rights in an offensive manner. And Washington’s failure to do so is viewed as the ultimate manifestation of American guilt, thus enflaming, rather than calming, the situation.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348230355516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:25:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348230492441-13</Id><Topic><Title>Not Just the Middle East: Obama Foreign Policy Record Is Appalling</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348230355516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:25:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The administration has also conspicuously failed to criticize publicly President Mohammed Morsi and other Arab leaders, whose responses to the anti-American demonstrations have been slow, equivocal, and relatively ineffective. Indeed, to this day Morsi has condemned violence but endorsed the anti-American protests from which it ensues. The fact that the Egyptian prosecutor-general has found time to indict several American citizens, allegedly associated with the production of an anti-Islamic film, is both a violation of international law and a sign of disrespect for the United States. Morsi’s behavior is particularly deplorable because the U.S. was instrumental in bringing him to power, first by easing out President Hosni Mubarak and later by playing the leading role in restraining the Egyptian military during the post-Mubarak transition. The fact that Morsi has unimpeachable Islamic credentials, and is therefore in an excellent position to both speak out forcibly and act robustly against anti-Americanism, makes the administration’s failure to call him to account all the more glaring. But all of this flawed crisis management pales in comparison with the administration’s strategic failures. The organizing principle of the administration’s foreign policy is one of weakness and passivity—whether in dealing with Russia, China, or Venezuela—coupled with a conspicuous rhetorical abdication of American leadership, evident in speeches by the president, secretary of state, and other administration officials. The ultimate irony for an administration oft-praised for superior rhetoric is that in today’s tightly knit global environment, words have palpable consequences. This overarching problem is accentuated by the fact that everybody in the Middle East—our friends, foes, and folks in between—has correctly concluded that the administration has begun America’s disengagement from the region, on a scale unseen since the days of the British withdrawal from “East of Suez.” This has manifested itself in virtually every facet of our Middle East policy, from our failure to maintain any American military presence in Iraq and the consequent loss of diplomatic and economic influence in Baghdad; to Washington’s unwillingness to rally the American public to support our military efforts in Afghanistan and its repeated snubs of our strongest traditional Middle East ally, Israel; to our leading from behind on Libya and the total failure to lead from any direction on Syria; and last but not least, to our timidity in confronting the Iranian nuclear weapons program. As a result, the Middle East elites and the proverbial “Arab street” have concluded that the U.S. is a waning power, Israel’s future is one of a besieged state that someday may disappear from the regional chessboard, and Iran has an excellent chance of becoming a regional hegemon, to be feared and placated. These are self-inflicted wounds. The American disengagement has not been caused by military defeat or some adverse international developments that we have tried but failed to stop, but by an administration that has profoundly misunderstood the kind of world we live in, the types of threats we confront, and what constitutes vital American interests. The administration has amassed not just a middling or even moderately bad foreign-policy record, but an appalling one. It is this record that is shaping the way the governments in the Middle East are handling the anti-American unrest. Unless the record is decisively reversed, it will lead to many disastrous developments down the road.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348230492441</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:28:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348231276192-14</Id><Title>Audi Places Its Biofuel Bets On Joule - at a price of $1.28 a gallon</Title><Msg>Audi Places Its Biofuel Bets On Joule 9/17/2012 @ 10:58AM |1,937 views If there’s a technology that has over promised and under delivered, it’s advanced biofuels. But there are signs that startups are making progress. Boston-area biofuel startup Joule and Audi today announced a partnership, where the automaker will test and validate Joule’s fuels for the auto industry. Last week, Joule commissioned a demonstration plant in Hobbs, New Mexico for its radical approach of directly making ethanol from sunlight and CO2 on a fraction of the land used with traditional approaches. The deal with Audi helps validate Joule’s technology and gives Audi a potentially important relationship as it seeks to be a carbon-neutral driving. “Joule and the fuels it is developing can ultimately enable sustainable mobility, as its highly-efficient process consumes waste CO2 emissions, avoids depletion of natural resources and doesn’t require agricultural feedstock or arable land,” says Reiner Manglod, the head of environmental products at Audi in a statement. Joule’s biotech-heavy process is unique among the many approaches for making biofuels in a way that doesn’t create competition with food production. Rather than grow and harvest biomass, such as wood chips or algae, and then process that into fuel, Joule has engineered microorganisms to secrete fuel and chemicals, including ethanol and diesel. The microbes grow in closed glass bioreactors and are fed waste CO2, sunlight, and nutrients. As the fuel is produced, it’s separated from the growing solution and collected. At a pilot lab in Texas, it’s been able to grow ethanol outdoor at a rate of 8,000 gallons per acre per year. That’s vastly more land-efficient than corn ethanol and better than the highest claims of cellulosic ethanol companies. Joule expects that its first commercial plants will be able to produce at 10,000 gallons per acre per year and ultimately 25,000 acres per acre per year at a price of $1.28 a gallon. Joule’s bioreactor design is modular so if it can operate at sufficient yield at this four-acre site in New Mexico, it can scale up to larger volumes only by adding more of the same modules. The company raised $70 million in January to finance construction of its demo plant and has raised $110 million in total. Its plans are to start building “alpha” plants that will be about 1,000 acres in size, Joule’s director of marketing Felicia Spagnioli says. What’s needed is a location with lots of sunlight, non-potable water which is later recycled, and a source of CO2. The company is in discussions with locating plants near power plants and cement factories where the scrubbed gases can be piped into its bioreactors. Joule was founded specifically to sidestep the failures of previous biofuel companies, particularly algae-based biofuel efforts. In the late 2000s, oil prices were nearing $150 a barrel and investor enthusiasm for green technologies was at an all-time high. A recently passed Renewable Fuel Standard had created demand for biofuels, both corn-based ethanol and later, fuels made from other sources. It created a race to build the technology for making fuel from non-food sources, whether it was ethanol from wood chips and jet fuel from algae. In the end, things didn’t go so smoothly. Cellulosic ethanol is still made in small quantities and a number of once-ambitious startups have gone out of business. Some researchers say algae-based fuel is still ten years away. But advanced biofuels are most definitely not dead and Joule isn’t alone in making progress toward making fuel without biting into food production. Sapphire Energy earlier this month began production of a drop-in replacement oil made from algae. The company’s demo plant in Columbus, New Mexico, which uses an open-pond design, is projected to produce 100 barrels of oil a day by the end of 2014. Once it proves it can operate at the scale, it expects to make a larger commercial-scale plant. Meanwhile, Kior last month said it received EPA approval for a drop-in replacement fuel from wood chips using a pyrolysis process adopted from the oil refining business. The company plans to start production at a facility in Columbus, Mississippi and start selling renewable fuel this fall. Certainly, the volume from demo and even commercial-scale advanced biofuels facilities is tiny when compared to petrofuels and much less than corn ethanol production. But these technology companies, backed by patient investors, are showing that the quest for advanced biofuels is far from over. It’s just taking a while. forbes</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348231276192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348231837699-15</Id><Title>Green crude: Sapphire Energy in Las Cruces extracts oil from algae to make fuel - Our goal: Make oil, make a lot of it</Title><Msg>Green crude: Sapphire Energy in Las Cruces extracts oil from algae to make fuel Brook Stockberger and Matt Robinson \ Las Cruces Sun-News; The Deming Headlight2 comments LAS CRUCES -- Bryn Davis was succinct and on point. "Our goal: Make oil, make a lot of it," said Davis, operations manager of Sapphire Energy as he gave a tour of the company's research facility in Las Cruces. San Diego-based Sapphire works to extract oil from algae that can then be refined and made into fuel. In addition to the Las Cruces location, the company has what it calls a green crude farm near Columbus, N.M., south of Deming. The idea is to make a renewable crop that can produce fuel. "We say over and over: This is farming," Davis said. The process starts in California. "A lot of the biology takes place in San Diego," Davis said. "Then it is shipped over here in petri dishes." But the Las Cruces folks are very open to finding other strains from Southern New Mexico. "We sample algae all over," he said. If something does not work? "There is (no) failure, just knowledge," Davis said. Chris Meenach, a scientist at the Las Cruces facility, said that they put some of their effort into trying to "grow the bad guy." The idea is that, if they can identify and grow species that are harmful to algae, they can learn how to defeat it. Thus, they pay attention "if something blows into a pond and tries to eat it." Davis said that, from the lab to harvesting to production of oil, the process takes a little bit more than a month. "The finished product is very similar to crude oil (from the ground,)" said Veronica Madwell, who also works in Las Cruces. Currently, the Columbus team is growing algae in 30 acres of ponds with the help of 35 full-time employees, 32 of whom are New Mexicans. The process entails growing algae in one- and two-acre ponds, then pumping the water through devices that separate the algae from the water. The algae is extracted into green crude, which the company says "is a drop-in replacement for crude oil, compatible with existing refineries that produce gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, to blend seamlessly into oil and gasoline pipelines and run in today's engines without modification." The first phase of the Columbus facility is now operational. Sapphire reports that it harvested its first crop in June without any system difficulties and has since harvested 21 million gallons of algae biomass, totaling 81 tons. The company's short-term goal is to begin producing 100 barrels of green crude per day by 2014. Long term, the company plans to develop a 5,000-to-10,000-barrels-per-day facility with commercial production by 2018. If successful, the facility would produce more than one billion gallons of green crude per year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that, from each barrel of oil, refineries usually produce about 19 gallons of gasoline with the rest being turned into jet fuel and other products. "We came in and added real industrial biology," said Tim Zenk, Sapphire vice president. "We don't look at one strand a day; we look at thousands." As of the end of June, the project had created 632 full-time positions during the construction phase at the 100-acres of land near Columbus. Zenk says the project has a $16 million economic impact to Southern New Mexico. Dissent from some lawmakers on the merits of using "green fuel" to power the U.S. Navy is not stopping Sapphire Energy from continuing to develop and explore algae-based fuel at its Columbus green crude farm. Despite the criticism of some that biofuel is too costly and not yet fully developed, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee approved $70 million for the Navy biofuels program in the 2013 budget. The House of Representatives has not approved the $70 million in funding, but consideration by the full House and Senate is expected to make the final decision in September. "Our view is that clear heads will prevail at the end of the presidential cycle," Zenk said. The project has already been funded by approximately $105 million in federal loan guarantees and grants, in addition to $229 million in private investments. sapphireenergy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348231837699</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:50:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348233108425-16</Id><Topic><Title>Audi Places Its Biofuel Bets On Joule - at a price of $1.28 a gallon</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348231276192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:41:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"and nutrients"?

The changes proposed by Connie Hedegaard will limit food-based biofuels to 5%, just above the current output of 4.5%. Green campaigners, who see biodiesel as doing more harm than good, hailed the move as a major victory for the environment. But the biodiesel industry condemned what it sees as a catastrophic U-turn that will cost thousands of jobs. The EU has a target of 10% for renewable transport fuels by 2020. But biofuels have become increasingly controversial because those derived from oil crops such as rape and palm can result in greater carbon emissions than the diesel they replace, as well as higher food prices and deforestation. Hedegaard told the Guardian: "We cannot morally afford to build a very big industry on something that is not good for the environment or for food prices. One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is ensuring affordable food prices. "We are not closing down the existing [biodiesel] industry," she said. "What they produce they can continue to produce." Much greater incentives will be given the so-called second and third-generation fuels, produced from agricultural or urban waste or by growing algae, with all existing support for food-based biofuels ending in 2020. These technologies are at a much earlier stage of development, but Hedegaard said the changes would give the market a "very, very strong" signal. "These proposals prevent a further spread of today's unsustainable biofuels," said Nusa Urbancic, at campaign group Transport &amp; Environment. "After having dragged its feet for so long, it's encouraging that the commission finally seems to take all the accumulated science seriously and is about to take meaningful action." But the European Biodiesel Board, an industry body, said the changes could lead to the "catastrophic" end of an industry worth €10bn a year. Alain Brinon, president of Fediol, another trade group, said: "The represents a U-turn in EU policy-making and a blow to investors in the renewable energy supply chain." "It is important to get biofuels but it would be absurd to get to the 10% target using something not very good for the environment," said Hedegaard. "We must get our priorities right." Another key change in the proposals is to include the impact of deforestation, peatland drainage or other land clearance caused by biofuels in their carbon footprint. Environmental and development campaigners argue this factor – called indirect land-use change (ILUC) – has been a missing from calculations of the green credentials of biofuels. A new peer-reviewed scientific study by Chris Malins at the International Council on Clean Transportation found that without ILUC factors, the EU's biofuel policy "could be expected to deliver only a 4% carbon saving compared to fossil fuel, with a 30% chance that it would actually cause a net emissions increase." Malins added: "Biodiesel from non-waste vegetable oil is likely to have a worse carbon footprint than fossil diesel." Transport &amp; Environment said that not including ILUC factors would result in carbon emissions equivalent to putting between 14 and 29m additional cars on the road across Europe in 2020. The industry has attacked the scientific work upon which the ILUC factors will be based and said more data is needed. "They always say we need more knowledge, but we have several studies," said Hedegaard. "We have to base political decision making on the available knowledge. Everyone knew from 2007 that ILUC factors were a probability." guardian</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348250104554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348250481276-28</Id><Topic><Title>Will The Low IQ Democrat Sheeple</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1348223396814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 06:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the chart is accurate, which I very much doubt, then you are clearly a DC resident and your IQ of 17 is bringing down their average.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348250481276</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:01:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348250731849-29</Id><Topic><Title>Not Just the Middle East: Obama Foreign Policy Record Is Appalling</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348230355516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:25:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does the first Aendment cover the right to scream "FIRE" in a crowded movie theater?</Msg><Username>co1trane</Username><Timestamp>1348250731849</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:05:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348251738851-30</Id><Topic><Title>Will The Low IQ Democrat Sheeple</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1348223396814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 06:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is well known and generally accepted that liberal "sheeple" are more highly educated and intelligent than Teaparty Sheeple.

The Stop the War on Coal Act, H.R. 3409, was approved in a 233-175 vote, although as usual, the bill many Democrats described as anti-environmental still found some Democratic support — 19 Democrats voted for it. The legislation is a combination of five bills that would overturn or prevent an array of regulations that Republicans say would harm the coal industry and the economy. Among other things, it would block the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other sources, and prevent rules on the storage and disposal of coal ash and limit Clean Water Act rules. It would also prevent potential Interior Department rules to toughen environmental controls on mountaintop removal coal mining, and thwart other air emissions rules, including air toxics standards for coal-fired power plants. Republicans say the bill is needed because power companies plan to close some coal-fired plants due to the EPA's air emissions rules, and because of additional EPA and Interior Department rules affecting coal mining. The GOP says that taken together, the Obama administration's regulations on the industry amount to a "war on coal." The White House has threatened to veto the bill, arguing it would gut vital protections and presents a false choice between economic growth and public health safeguards. But the veto threat will not be an issue, as the Senate will not consider the bill before it leaves for the election. Still, it provided Republicans an election-season messaging platform to argue that President Obama's environmental policies are bad for the economy. During debate this week, Republicans reminded their colleagues that when Obama was running for office in 2008, he warned that he would seek to bankrupt the coal industry. "It was the President, when he was a candidate, that said that his policies, if enacted, would cost coal jobs," Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday. "For nearly four years, we have seen evidence of that." Hastings and other Republicans cited Obama's comments in 2008, when he said that people wanting to build a coal-fired power plant would still be able to do so under his administration, although doing this would "bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted." As evidence that the "war on coal" is being waged, Republicans cited this week's announcement from mining giant Alpha Natural Resources that it would cut 1,200 jobs and idle eight mines in three states. Democratic opponents of the bill argued that the coal industry is not being hurt by regulation, but instead by competition from other energy sources, notably low-cost and abundant natural-gas supplies. "When the Republicans say there is a war on coal, in a market sense, yes, there is a war," Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said. "In the same sense that when we started carrying BlackBerrys, it was a war on the black rotary-dial phone; in the same sense that when we started using Macs and PCs, it was a war on typewriters; in the same sense that the horseless carriage was a war on horses; in the same sense that refrigerators were a war on salted meats; in the same sense that the telegraph was a war on carrier pigeons." Before the final vote, the House approved two amendments that would require the government to publish the scientific data it uses as a basis for writing regulations. Another Republican amendment that was accepted would require the secretary of Transportation to estimate the number of jobs lost due to auto emission standards. The House rejected several Democratic amendments, including one from Energy and Commerce ranking member Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) that would have struck language repealing the EPA's 2009 scientific finding that carbon pollution endangers public health. That finding provides the legal underpinning for EPA climate change regulations. The lower chamber will return after the election for a lame-duck session. thehill ---------------------------------------------- Hoyer Statement on Republican Coal Bill By Newsroom America Feeds at 9:25 am Eastern Grant, 202-225-3130 Hoyer Statement on Republican Coal Bill WASHINGTON, DC - House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (MD) released the following statement today in opposition to H.R. 3409, the "Stop the War on Coal Act": “This bill is just another example of Republicans’ agenda of distraction from issues that matter to Americans. Their partisan legislation would have terrible effects on the air our children breathe and the water they drink, and it won’t help us meet the challenge of creating jobs for our middle class or provide us with greater energy security. Moreover, the House of Representatives has already voted on every title of this bill and sent legislation to the Senate that comprises its core provisions. There is no reason why we should be spending our time voting on these issues again. “Much for the same reason House Republicans insisted on voting over thirty times this Congress to repeal or defund health reform, we’re voting on this bill because Republicans would rather waste time than accept the responsibility of governing. To govern entails making difficult decisions and compromising with the other side to make progress. It means putting the country first and ideology second. We’ve seen far too little in terms of real governing from this Republican House. “Instead of voting on a bill that falsely claims that we can only have a future for coal by denying the existence of climate change and abandoning health-based pollution standards, Republicans ought to work with Democrats to invest in growing our advanced energy sector by pursuing an all-of-the-above energy policy. That’s how we’ll help create jobs and move our country forward.” newsroomamerica URLs at talkstock</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348256619872</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348258904807-37</Id><Topic><Title>Will The Low IQ Democrat Sheeple</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1348223396814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 06:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you had an IQ above 80, you would know I can have it both ways since I indicated low IQ, ignorance, drugs, and/or enemy as the reasons and even went so far as to post i think it is primarily a combination of the 1st 3.

The DNC initiated an $8 million loan with the Amalgamated Bank of New York on Aug. 10, the report shows, accounting for the majority of the committee’s overall debt of $11 million. Amalgamated Bank, often described as “America’s Labor Bank,” is a national entity, the majority of which is owned by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), a politically active union with deep ties to the Democratic Party. The SEIU is also involved with the Democracy Alliance, a shadowy group of wealthy left-wing donors founded by billionaire investor George Soros. The bank announced in an August press release that the DNC had “moved its primary banking relationship” to Amalgamated Bank, which would handle the committee’s “day-to-day banking needs.” The DNC had previously done most of its banking with Bank of America, which helped finance the Democratic convention in Charlotte. DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz hailed the transition to Amalgamated Bank, and noted the longstanding political and financial ties between the two organizations. The committee, she said, had a “fiduciary responsibility to those who invest in our party.” “It is critical that we honor their efforts to strengthen our infrastructure and build our organization by partnering with an institution that shares our commitment to standing with America’s working families and small businesses,” she said in a press release. The SEIU is one of the most active political interest groups in the country, and a top financial backer of the Democratic Party. The union has given at least $200 million in direct contributions to candidates and committees since 1990 and has spent at least $14 million on lobbying since 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The SEIU spent more than $80 million in 2008 in support of Obama and other Democratic candidates, an investment that has reaped numerous political dividends. Former SEIU president Andy Stern was the most frequent visitor to the White House in the first year of Obama’s presidency and was later nominated to serve on the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission. Stern was spotted poolside at a lavish Democracy Alliance summit in May held at the historic Biltmore Hotel near Miami. The group’s international president, Mary Kay Henry, sits on the Democracy Alliance (DA) board of directors. The DA funnels millions of dollars in secret donations to Democratic candidates and causes. The SEIU and the DNC did not return requests for comment.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348278131445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348278310562-49</Id><Title>Obama’s Army : Who needs elections when we have the mainstream media?</Title><Msg>You are probably eager to vote on Nov. 6. You have followed the news closely, watched the ads, listened to the conventions, and waited for the debates. If you are like most people, you are worried about the direction of the country, and for good reason. Calling the current economic situation a “recovery” is an insult. The government has failed to address important matters such as taxes, spending, and debt. American embassies across the Muslim world are under siege. The situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating, Putin just ejected USAID from Russia, and China and Japan are hurtling towards conflict. The candidates agree: This election is a choice between two futures. You get to say which path you would prefer in a little over a month. Just kidding! The election is over, and Mitt Romney lost. He’s toast; his goose is cooked; put a fork in him he’s done; he’s yesterday’s news. Disagree? That’s too bad. The American media have made up their minds. And on this they are certain: Barack Obama is a lock for reelection. They may not be sure when Romney lost exactly—was it his trip to England, Israel, and Poland? Was it the Clint Eastwood speech at the RNC? Was it Romney’s response to the attacks on our embassies in Benghazi and Cairo? Was it his leaked remarks on government dependency? The exact date doesn’t matter. What matters is that the chorus has spoken. The politburo has decided. A consensus has been reached. Romney will lose, and the only question is by how much. The voters might as well stay at home. The conceited arrogance with which our most sophisticated and well-schooled editors, writers, and journalists voice this conclusion makes it that much more annoying. Their eagerness to judge Romney a failure is not only premature but also erodes whatever credibility they had left. Indeed, the ridiculous manner in which the political press has covered the 2012 campaign suggests that “bias” is no longer a suitable description of the character of the media establishment. “Partisan toadies” may be a better one. “Obama’s army” is another. Here is where the campaign actually stands. The Real Clear Politics average of polls has President Obama in the lead with 48 percent of the vote, and Mitt Romney close behind with 45 percent. That is a tight race, with less than seven weeks before Election Day. The fundamentals, moreover, seem not to have changed much at all, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising. Americans remain disappointed in Obama’s job performance while liking him personally, but recent history and Romney’s personal and political nebulousness make them reluctant to embrace the challenger. The final outcome of the election will depend on several factors that cannot be anticipated: How the candidates perform in the debates; unpredictable events such as the financial crisis in Europe or war in East Asia or the Middle East; and the extent to which Obama’s base shows up to vote. The election is a jump ball. As Joe Biden might say, literally no one on this planet knows the future. Political forecasting, like astrology and reading entrails, is a junk science. Historical “laws” hold true until the day they are exposed as false. Does anyone doubt that if it were Romney rather than Obama who led by three points, the creed recited daily on MSNBC would stress the inexact nature of polling and the overwhelming power of conservative millionaires and billionaires? Imagine for a moment that a Republican was president: What would appear on the front pages and at the top of the network news broadcasts? There would be stories on long-term unemployment, stagnant wages, brutalized net worth, and credit downgrades. There would be stories on last weekend’s brazen attack on our base in Afghanistan, which led to the deaths of two Marines and the loss of eight Harrier jets. The White House would be slammed for its changing and evasive explanation of the murder of a U.S. ambassador and his security officers. Charges of corruption would be leveled at the president for naming the wife of a wealthy contributor to the U.N. General Assembly just weeks after that contributor penned a New York Times op-ed arguing the president does indeed support Israel (though if the president were a Republican support for Israel would not be in doubt). The AP would resurrect its headline from the spring of 2008: “Everything Seemingly Is Spinning Out of Control.” Imagine the deafening, glass-shattering howls as NBC and ABC and CBS and PBS and NPR and CNN and MSNBC and NYT and WAPO and WSJ and AP and Reuters and FT and Bloomberg and Politico demanded accountability. The fact that the media line is so mutable—that the tone and emphasis of their coverage is merely a function of Obama’s relative position—reveals the extent to which the press has become a withering and slightly deformed appendage of the center-left. This is not a matter of “vetting” the president’s biography and past associations four years into his term. It is a matter of covering Obama’s official record, right now, as the global economy stagnates, Washington deadlocks, Europe teeters, Islamists take power in the Middle East, Iran grows emboldened, Afghanistan falls apart, and China and Russia fester. It is about suggesting, if only hinting, that Obama and not George W. Bush, ATMs, or an idiot in California might be at least somewhat responsible for what is happening in the world. What we receive from the media is something else entirely. Obama is not the incumbent in their eyes. He is the challenger. He is running against what Elizabeth Warren called a “rigged” system—the same system over which he has presided for almost four years. He is running against the Wall Street fat cats whose money he is happy to take when it suits his purposes. In the eyes of the media, the stimulus was a roaring success. The problem with the health care overhaul is that the Democrats have failed to explain its virtues to a confused and “frustrated” public. Obama’s dismal record and his emphatic failure to say what he might like to accomplish in a second term do not merit inclusion in the approved storyline. Obama’s most successful reset, it turns out, was not with Russia but with the mainstream media: In their eyes we are back where we started, in 2008, and Obama is once again nothing more or less than a symbol of racial and political progress whose opponents are ideologues or reactionaries or bigots. This is the story line that has dominated news coverage of Obama ever since that first tingle ran up Chris Matthews’ leg, and we know the media love story lines. They have been committed in this election to the twin notions that the Republicans are radical obstructionists and that Romney is an out-of-touch and gaffe-prone plutocrat. Neither the Republicans nor Romney can do anything to change such an impression once it has been set in media concrete. It is left to the rest of us to show the media oligarchy that it is wrong, and that the election is not over until Nov. 6 (and perhaps, God help us, not even then). But be warned: If Romney does lose, not only will you have to deal with the consequences of a second Obama term. You also will have to watch as the smug and puffed up soldiers in Obama’s vainglorious army pat themselves on the back, and pompously remind the country that they were right all along. And that is a price even the most eager voter should be unwilling to pay.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348278310562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348278475984-50</Id><Title>All I hear on MSNBC &amp; CNN</Title><Msg>One can not turn on a cable news channel without hearing the sound of Bibi's cojones bouncing off of Mitt Romney's chin.
