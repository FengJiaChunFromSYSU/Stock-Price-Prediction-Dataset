So now America has boxed itself into a corner of its own making. It has a military that could easily accomplish any objective given to it. The U.S. military is far more (potentially) powerful than the Wehrmacht ever was. However, the US cannot use its power without contradicting its past rhetoric, which makes is military power ineffective and unconvincing to its enemies. The Cold War was a product of the same attitude. The entire sorry episode could have been dealt with in 1945-1946, rather easily. Generals such as US General Patton and Field Marshal Manstein could have ended the Communist menace for all time but Washington DC cowardly chose another path. They are paying the price for their error now. Now Moscow supports one group of terrorists in the Middle East while they are put in the position of locating allies where this is nothing but enemies. You will never get a Field Marshal Manstein today to tackle your problem. He's gone. Patton is gone.... You Barack Hussein Obama to lead you.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364300785475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:26:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364306365867-7</Id><Title>Dividend Announcement This Week.</Title><Msg>Why don't They get creative,and announce some big news early,instead of the tired old routine of late April.

CCUR's business is about to boom big this year as cable TV operators begin investing heavily to expand their content to IP connected devices like tablets and smartphones. CCUR has developed the industry's leading multi-screen video delivery platform MediaHawk and Virgin Media (VMED) just announced that they are using it to power their new Virgin TV Anywhere service! VMED is a $23 billion company with 3.8 million subscribers! CCUR's net income last quarter was up 100% from previous quarter and up 300% from two quarters ago! CCUR pays a big dividend and has huge gross margins of 58%. Their main rival Seachange (SEAC) has gross margins of only 50% yet it's trading with enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.93x revenue, which would make CCUR a $15.80 per share stock. Look at CCUR's chart, it looks ready to explode after it breaks $8!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1364307831925</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:23:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364308325610-10</Id><Topic><Title>The last time Germany went to war against a Muslim power...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364227700252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:08:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Polish King was an ally of the brief coalition and led the attack.

XOM needs to position itself to offer a product that is competitive with its rivals. The quicker they do it the better off they will be. Last year's 20% dividend increase was an acknowledgment that they needed to address the situation. If XOM sees it the way we see, 20% increases will continue until the dividend yield nears the industries' average. However, knowing XOM, 20% per year will be the maximum. This prediction is for entertainment purposes only.</Msg><Username>mwds06</Username><Timestamp>1364315425337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:30:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364316386810-16</Id><Title>stock splits &amp; dividends</Title><Msg>are splits &amp; div increases announced at annual meetings? or any time</Msg><Username>geezee003</Username><Timestamp>1364316386810</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:46:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364317451314-17</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxwizard68 • Feb 8, 2013 11:21 AM Flag 0users liked this postsusers disliked this posts11Reply ref_steve is mentally unbalanced To call him #$%$ would be a compliment. maxwizard, have tried to figure out your constant haranguing of this person steve.
