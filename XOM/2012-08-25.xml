When the Arabs and OPEC stopped negotiating after 1973, and just started manipulating markets and "nationalizing"/stealing American assets abroad, the Republican attacks just escalated.

Lots of these people are on the left and the right. They watch the News (controlled by the Elite), they enjoy their 50” flat screens, mansions, swimming pools, I phones, sports cars, vacations, casinos, speed boats, and bloated pensions. They don’t care about the cost of entitlements because they have all their little toys listed above. With the National Dept growing…..a Trillion plus every year, America is either near or past the point of no return. Our Government and The Federal Reserve are playing us like fools. Once America defaults on its debt, our dollar will be devalued severely and we will be at the mercy of the New World Order. The way I look at it is this; America and its so-called leaders have two choices: Option #1: Balance the budget immediately which would probably cause a Depression. This would mean a threshold of pain for most American's to some degree or another. (It would be like starting CHEMO treatments which would make our country very sick for a decade or two). Option#2: Keep the entitlements growing and keep spending more than we take in, just keep the entitlement hog trough full, keep raising the debt ceiling, and wait for that day financial day of reckoning to come. (At that point the America “dollar” will need embalming fluid). So will our financial system. That’s where the FEMA camps will come in handy…..and the new “One World Order” will be happy to pay for that. They’ll take care of everyone.</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1345914472000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 13:07:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345916524000-18</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY HIT A HOME RUN TODAY</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1345772318000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you use your brain in the voting booth in November, then the choice is clear.

For nationalists the cultural element is important. Multiculturalism is tolerated only to the extent the other cultures within America, aside from the dominate one, live up to the standards of the dominate group. Support for the cultural groups and their aims does not extend beyond the borders of America, especially not to alternative nationalist identities. The J E W I S H group within America has a very high level of achievement and produces many great scientists, lawyers, and business leaders, and has proven its cultural worth by its achievements. Such a group naturally commands a great deal of influence and respect within Republican circles. However, a group of American nationalists like the Republicans is not going to support a foreign nationalist cause like Z I O N I S M While it may please I S R A E L when American nationalists attack Arab countries for their own reasons, they are not doing it to please I S R A E L and Z I O N I S T S within or outside I S R A E L The Democrat Party is not interested in nationalism at all and outright rejects the concept of superior cultures. They embrace multiculturalism precisely because of their belief in cultural equality. Because they reject nationalism outright, Democrat have no problem supporting foreign nationalist aims, such as Z I O N I S M especially when doing so earns the Democrat Party votes. That is why Truman recognized I S R A E L - to win New York. He admitted as much himself. The Democrat Party has also been known to support competing national identities within America as well. Examples include the Black P A N T H E R S the various Native American "national" causes, and more widely efforts to create hyphenated Americans wherever they can. Actively supporting a foreign national identity certainly is not problematic for them.</Msg><Username>weald_of_kent</Username><Timestamp>1345924959000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 16:02:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345927141000-23</Id><Topic><Title>Texting and stock investing don't mix</Title><Username>oiouxcxjijn</Username><Timestamp>1345811732000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 08:35:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will subscribe now.</Msg><Username>stacyherman67</Username><Timestamp>1345927141000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 16:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345928974000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Arab Socialism</Title><Username>weald_of_kent</Username><Timestamp>1345911469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must still be upset that Hitler lost.</Msg><Username>casey_iii</Username><Timestamp>1345928974000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:09:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345929279000-25</Id><Topic><Title>If anybody hates women, it’s not the Republicans</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1345920267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:44:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an amazingly stupid man.</Msg><Username>hypno_hype</Username><Timestamp>1345929279000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345929772000-26</Id><Topic><Title>War on Women</Title><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1345904625000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:23:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>goodness rewind, y'all sound like a lil two year old throwing a hissy fit, 'cause y'all and Romney don't understand women!... thus, unless y'all can change y'all's tune, real quick, Obama's going to win the election, again... all i've ever seen on this board, is guys, who just don't get it!...</Msg><Username>be.pick</Username><Timestamp>1345929772000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345930827000-27</Id><Topic><Title>Arab Socialism</Title><Username>weald_of_kent</Username><Timestamp>1345911469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An American nationalist could hardly be expected to care if a foreign nationalist loses a war. There were plenty of German nationalist available to take over in 1945. Germany has succeeded well under nationalist rule, that is it has succeeded until the multicultural European Union bureaucrats have undermined its banks with foreign debt, causing the latest financial crisis. If I could change one thing in history it would be decision of the Southern Democrats to secede from the United States after the Republican victory in November 1860. At that time the Democrats were by far the more nationalistic of the two parties. If the Southern Democrats had not seceded and split the power of the Democrat Party in America, there is no way the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments ever would have been passed. There would have been no Civil War. Over 600,000 American lives would have been saved. The United States, under the direction of the Nationalist Manifest Destiny Democrat Party would have conquered much more of Mexico by now, as well as Columbia, Venezuela, and all the Caribbean islands. The discovery of oil in the Southern US would have given the Southern Democrats iron clad control over their Constitutional property rights.</Msg><Username>weald_of_kent</Username><Timestamp>1345930827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:40:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345930987000-28</Id><Title>Want more taxes?</Title><Msg>Then Obama's your man/dictator. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIfI2whjiM</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1345930987000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345931038000-29</Id><Topic><Title>War on Women</Title><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1345904625000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:23:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thankfully you live in Georgia which Obama will never win.
