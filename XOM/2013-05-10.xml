The average speed of the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere is 1000 feet per second or 700 miles per hour. I have little doubt that panels will be developed to convert this kinetic energy into electrical energy just like the solar panel was developed to collect to kinetic energy in the photons of light. So get going inventors. We now have multiple solar panel designs. So have at it. This is like the race to develop the electric light bulb from current. The electricity will be stored as hydrogen and this will fulfill the hydrogen economy. There will be hydrogen cars, trucks, buses, lawn mowers, boats, jets, motocycles, mopeds, and so on.</Msg><Username>susiesweatsocks</Username><Timestamp>1368170451682</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 03:20:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368170891897-2</Id><Topic><Title>OIl prices will free fall</Title><Username>kopach</Username><Timestamp>1368107007947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:43:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No real demand for oil?

Printable LED, sensors, and other devices can be produced on paper at a cost impossible before. The knowledge of catalysts to make the printing process work is useful for increasing the efficiency of the manufacturing process for carbon nanotubes as well, and the production of light-weight, strong, low-energy cost materials at low monetary cost. ………. This is just one more defeat for the oil &amp; gas industry. Anything that reduces the waste it thrives on is bad for it. The advances certainly are coming much faster now being driven by the powerful mix of supercomputers, computational chemistry, and quantum theory applied to materials and molecular dynamic modeling + the backing of permanent (and profitable) government R&amp;D groups with effectively unlimited funds for state objectives…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1368185264170</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 07:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368191928881-4</Id><Topic><Title>OIl prices will free fall</Title><Username>kopach</Username><Timestamp>1368107007947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:43:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Forbes predicts 75 bbl.

Technology will create alternatives and destroy waste, shift demand, and destroy the market for oil. Economies of scale working in reverse with a falling market size are much more relevant than meaningless past relationships of price and quantity.

Obamao again. WASHINGTON – The Internal Revenue Service improperly screened applications from conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status, a senior IRS official said Friday. IRS staffers selected for more review the applications that included the words “tea party” or “patriot,” Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations, said in a conference call with reporters. “That’s absolutely inappropriate and not the way we should do things,” Lerner said. The staffers also requested information the IRS does not normally ask for, including donor lists. Lerner first disclosed the improper screening in response to a question she received at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Assn. in Washington earlier in the day. In the conference call that followed, she said that of 300 applications staffers selected for additional review, about a quarter were selected solely because of the flagged words. The rest were selected for a “broad spectrum” of reasons, Lerner said. She could not elaborate on the other groups’ purposes or politics.
