In 2012, ConocoPhillips earned $8.4 billion in profits, while the company’s new CEO, Ryan Lance, received a staggering $19.3 million in compensation. To put this huge figure in perspective, a worker earning minimum wage would need to work for 1,279 years to make as much money. ConocoPhillips received an estimated $600 million in special tax breaks in 2011. Lobbying efforts by the oil and gas industry have secured these tax benefits over and over again. In the last year alone, ConocoPhillips spent $3.9 million on lobbying expenditures. Here are some additional facts about ConocoPhillips: •Conoco is sitting on $5.4 billion in cash reserves. •Despite earning $2.1 billion this quarter, the company’s oil production has decreased. Conoco produced 2 percent less oil than this time last year. •Last year, the company spent 61 percent of its 2012 profit — or $5.1 billion — buying back its own stock, enriching its largest shareholders and executives. •Since 2011, ConocoPhillips has spent over $20 million lobbying Congress, making it a top spender in the oil and gas industry. •Conoco paid an 18 percent effective federal tax rate in 2011. This is nearly half of the 35 percent standard top corporate tax rate. Exxon Mobil also announced it first quarter profits today. Chevron will be the next of the Big Five companies to announce their quarterly earnings on Friday, April 26. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/04/25/1920421/conocophillips-earns-21-billion-in-first-quarter-while-producing-less-oil/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366949991957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366950200980-2</Id><Title>Exxon Earns $9.5 Billion Q1 Profit One Month After Arkansas Oil Spill That It Pays No Taxes To Help Clean Up</Title><Msg>By Rebecca Leber on Apr 25, 2013 at 10:26 am One month after dumping 500,000 gallons of tar sands crude oil from a ruptured pipeline in Arkansas, the most valuable and profitable corporation in the world ExxonMobil announced higher first quarter profits. Exxon earned $9.5 billion in the first quarter, compared to $9.45 billion last year, and [color=#FF0000][b]Exxon’s total oil and natural gas production declined 3.5 percent.[/b][/color] Meanwhile, Exxon is exempt from paying taxes toward the oil spill liability fund that helps clean up spills like in Arkansas, where wildlife have been killed and covered by oil. The 1980 law exemption applies to diluted bitumen so companies escape paying the 8-cents-per-barrel fee to the fund that helps clean up hundreds of spills each year. At the federal level, Exxon’s tax rate comes to only 13 percent. Here is how else Exxon spends its dollars, and what it receives in return: – Exxon spent $12,970,000 on lobbying in 2012 to protect low tax rates and block pollution controls and safeguards for public health. In the first three months of 2013, Exxon spent $4.84 million lobbying. – The company sent $3.6 million in total political contributions to PACs, candidates, and outside groups for the 2012 election cycle, and 89 percent of contributions went to Republicans. It has spent over $76,000 for the 2014 cycle so far. – Exxon receives an estimated $600 million in annual federal tax breaks. In 2011, Exxon paid just 13 percent in taxes. The company paid no federal income tax in 2009, despite $45.2 billion record profits. – In the first quarter, Exxon bought back $5.6 billion of its stock, or 59 percent of its profit, which enriches the largest shareholders and executives of the company. – This year, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson received a 15 percent raise to a $40.3 million salary. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/04/25/1917601/exxon-first-quarter-profit-2013/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366950200980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:23:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366953113641-3</Id><Title>Crude-by-rail no substitute for Keystone XL -energy minister</Title><Msg>Wed Apr 24, 2013 4:30pm EDT * Trains poor alternative to pipeline for oil sands, minister says * He says oil sands output would be dented if rail only option * Upbeat view of crude-by-rail of State Dept. questioned By Patrick Rucker WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - Using trains to move heavy crude oil out of Western Canada would be a poor alternative to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, Canada's top energy official said on Wednesday, and a rail-only plan would likely put a dent in future oil sands development. U.S. officials are weighing whether to approve construction of the proposed Keystone pipeline that could deliver as much as 830,000 barrels a day of mostly Canadian and some U.S. crude oil to refiners in Texas and Louisiana. Joe Oliver, Canada's natural resources minister, said costs and logistical challenges make crude-by-rail a poor second choice for oil sands producers trying to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast. "I don't think anybody feels that it could be a substitute for pipelines," Oliver told Reuters. In a report that weighed the environmental impacts of the Keystone pipeline, the U.S. State Department concluded that blocking the 1,200 mile project would do little to slow the oil sands sector since crude-by-rail was such a close second choice. "Limitations on pipeline transport would force more crude oil to be transported via other modes of transportation, such as rail, which would probably (but not certainly) be more expensive," the State Department said in the report released in early March. But Oliver said pipelines reliably beats crude-by-rail which "is more expensive for longer hauls than pipelines." "It is a good supplement but not the longer-term solution," he said. "I don't think anybody would suggest it is." Industry officials, energy analysts and recent data raise questions about whether the industry is really eager to adopt crude-by-rail... reutersDOTcom/article/2013/04/24/usa-keystone-rail-idUSL2N0DB23P20130424</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366953113641</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 01:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366981219404-4</Id><Topic><Title>Green Party growing and merging with right...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366889335934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 07:28:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't be pleased if the US did Star Wars instead?

Fast-forward another year and the Navy biofuel program is still going full steam ahead, even though those same members are still trying to stomp it down. In the latest development, another $18 million in matching funds has just been announced for four new pilot projects. Funny thing is, this time around there’s been a minimum of grandstanding over the votes. Why could that be, we wonder. Navy Biofuel From Non-Food Feedstocks The four new projects all follow the same Obama Administration pattern of focusing on biofuel feedstocks that don’t involve food for humans or livestock. As an added sustainability bonus, these next-generation feedstocks generally don’t take up land that could be used for food crops, either. That includes switchgrass and other woody plants that can thrive on land that’s unsuitable for other crops, as well as municipal waste and other forms of refuse, and algae. A United Biofuel Front The four new projects also follow the Obama Administration pattern of enlisting other federal agencies, namely the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, to the biofuel front lines whenever Congress maneuvers against the Navy. Last year, the naysayers in Congress (Okay, so Republican leadership. There, I said it.) took the tack of prohibiting the Navy from purchasing any fuel that is more expensive than conventional fuel, effectively ruling out biofuel. In response, the Obama Administration used its powers under the decades-old Defense Production Act and other pipelines to authorize funds for private companies to build pilot projects and commercial-scale facilities. The end goal is to help jumpstart a cost-competitive U.S. biofuel industry, and cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/04/26/navy-biofuel-program-gets-four-new-pilot-projects/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1366982329213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366983036058-6</Id><Title>Official: ND flare emissions still acceptable</Title><Msg>Official: ND flare emissions still acceptable Posted on April 26, 2013 at 6:25 am by Associated Press in Bakken Shale Comments(0) A drilling rig aims for oil in the Bakken Shale near Watford City, N.D. (AP Photo/James MacPherson) BISMARCK, N.D. — More than 30 percent of North Dakota’s natural gas production is being burned off because development of the pipelines and processing facilities needed to handle it has not kept pace with production. Natural gas is a byproduct of oil production. Records show North Dakota oil drillers are deliberately torching and wasting 275 million cubic feet of natural gas each day. That’s enough to heat more than 1 million homes daily. Terry O’Clair is the state Health Department’s air quality director. He says the flare emissions in the state’s oil patch continue to fall within acceptable air quality guidelines.

Jack Dalrymple that offers North Dakota oil drillers tax breaks to stop the intentional practice of burning and wasting natural gas. Published April 25, 2013, 02:36 PM By: James MacPherson, Associated Press BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Legislation headed to Gov. Jack Dalrymple's desk that offers North Dakota oil drillers tax breaks if they stop burning and wasting natural gas will aren't enough to dim the burning glow over North Dakota's oil patch, critics say. The Republican-sponsored bills offer oil companies tax incentives for capturing and using the byproduct of the state's booming crude production. But critics say the measures won't completely compel drillers to stop torching and wasting the gas. Records show 275 million cubic feet of natural gas goes up in smoke each day in North Dakota, or enough to heat more than 1 million homes daily. Flaring also accounted for about 5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in North Dakota last year, or about the same amount that 945,000 automobiles would emit. The hundreds of flares in the oil patch emit a collective blaze so bright that it has been photographed from space. "It's fine to offer a carrot but you also have to have a stick to ensure something actually gets done," Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for the Sierra Club, said of oil companies' practice of flaring. The Legislature has passed a pair of bills that give tax breaks to companies if natural gas is collected and used for agricultural, industrial and railroad purposes. Projects that also convert natural gas to such things as farm fertilizer or electricity also would be given incentives. The measures that were endorsed last week by lawmakers had not reached the Dalrymple's desk on Thursday.

American professionals rate them at worse than D grade on a scale of A to F. It would take trillions of dollars to upgrade them to European standards. Without this upgrade the US economy will deteriorate, and possibly collapse as it de-industrializes. Building a casino economy around debt, and gambling on Wall Street is not a sustainable solution to what ails the US economy. The best place to raise the money to modernize American infrastructure is a tax on oil &amp; gas. Most of the energy consumption going on in American is simply total waste. Encouraging people to stop their consumption by increasing energy prices is the best way to reduce the waste. It would require greatly increased spending on higher education to support a modern infrastructure too. Rednecks laying concrete and asphalt will not suffice for electrified rail systems, maglev, modern power plants and grids. A special speculator tax levied on capital gains earned in enterprises deemed to be gross polluters would be very useful too to fund these improvements.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366987168758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:39:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366987289501-12</Id><Topic><Title>Green Party growing and merging with right...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1366889335934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 07:28:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That could be...

The Friday ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit doesn’t wade into the substance of the controversial SEC rule and doesn’t end the legal battle over the regulation. Instead the appellate judges agreed with Oxfam America, which intervened in the case to defend the SEC rule, that the industry challenge belongs in federal district court. The appellate judges dismissed the case “for lack of jurisdiction.” The American Petroleum Institute (API), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups had already filed suit in district court alongside the appellate challenge, and Friday’s ruling notes, “Their caution proved prescient.” To read why, specifically, the appeals court believes it’s not the proper venue for the challenge right now, click here. The SEC rule in question forces SEC-listed oil, natural gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses; taxes; royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects.   It’s aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the “resource curse,” in which some impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth.

Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, has seen better profit margins than the other energy majors in recent years because a big part of its production mix is oil, which has been fetching high prices. Rivals, like Exxon Mobil, produce more natural gas in the U.S, where gas prices have been low. But crude prices fell across the globe in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, reducing Chevron’s revenue and profit. Chevron Corp., based in San Ramon, Calif., reported Friday that net income fell to $6.18 billion, or $3.18 per share, on revenue of $56.82 billion. Last year the company earned $6.47 billion, or $3.27 per share, on revenue of $60.71 billion. Photos: Chevron’s Big Foot hull arrives in Texas The profit exceeded analysts’ average forecast of $3.09 per share. Shares rose 40 cents to $118.91 in early trading. Chevron’s production of oil and gas rose slightly in the quarter, to 2.65 million barrels per day of oil and gas from 2.63 million barrels per day. But Chevron’s average sale price for a barrel of oil slipped to $94 from $102 last year in the U.S., and to $102 from $110 abroad. Natural gas prices edged up around the world, but not enough to offset the decline in oil prices. Performance at Chevron’s refining operations slipped because of maintenance and upgrades at refineries in El Segundo, Calif. and Pascagoula, Miss. and continued repairs at its Richmond Calif. refinery in the wake of an August fire. Refinery output fell 38 percent to 576,000 barrels per day. Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones, said Chevron’s disappointing U.S. refining results were the only “hiccup” in an otherwise solid quarter. fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/04/26/chevron-profit-down-4-5-pct-on-lower-oil-prices/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367001768671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367002004338-22</Id><Title>Diesel and hybrid vehicle registrations surge</Title><Msg>April 26, 2013 at 11:14 am by Zain Shauk Diesel car and SUV registrations jumped 24 percent over the last three years, despite a weak economy, the Diesel Technology Forum said this week.

The nonprofit diesel advocacy group used registration information compiled by R.L. Polk and Company to illustrate the growth in adoption of clean diesel vehicles. Modern diesel engines are sometimes referred to as clean diesel because they run on low-sulfur fuel and are designed to emit fewer particles and greenhouse gasses than most gasoline engines. Historically, diesel engines have been targeted for hefty emissions, but recent regulations inspired changes that made the engines cleaner burning. U.S. diesel car and sports utility vehicle registrations jumped from 640,779 in 2010 to 796,794 in 2012, while registrations for hybrid cars and SUVs jumped from 1.7 million to 2.3 million during the same period, according to the data.

California had the second largest amount of diesel passenger vehicles, with 572,303, and the most hybrids, with 548,199. “This new data of total national vehicle registrations coincides with what we’ve been seeing in the monthly auto sales – clean diesel and hybrid cars are showing consistent and impressive growth patterns in the U.S.,” said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum. “This consistent growth in clean diesel registrations in the last three years is particularly noteworthy since it has occurred during an economic recession, the availability of an extremely large number of fuel efficient vehicles,... fuelfixDOTcom/blog/2013/04/26/diesel-and-hybrid-vehicle-registrations-surge/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367002004338</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:46:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367002415579-23</Id><Topic><Title>Man, Cramer really HATES Exxon !!!!</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1366991686449</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:54:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cramer is never right with is picks.

But one thing they do agree on is the need to closely examine how the dramatic increase in the price of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, could lead to gasoline price increases. Recently, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Energy Committee Ron Wyden of Oregon warned of "unprecedented price spikes" for credits, known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs. Across the political aisle Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and David Vitter of Louisiana argued that "recent prices for RINs have skyrocketed" likely resulting in "increased costs to consumers" as well as greater gasoline exports and reduced domestic production. Obviously, this is a grim picture recognized by both sides in Washington as we approach the summer driving season. Policy makers are smart to be concerned. Whether you support ethanol or oppose it, there is clearly something wrong with the way refiners and importers must demonstrate compliance with the RFS. Back in 2007, Congress enacted the renewable fuel standard as part of broader energy legislation. Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been ratcheting up the amount of ethanol that must be blended into gasoline, but at the same time, the recession and efficiency gains have significantly decreased demand for gasoline. No one expects that gasoline demand will rebound strongly, and there are physical constraints on safely using higher blends of ethanol. As a result, there aren't enough gallons of gasoline to put all of the required gallons of ethanol into - and that has driven the price of credits through the roof. Without action by the EPA, the results could be particularly bad for a nation only beginning to recover from a thehillDOTcom/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/296429-its-time-to-revisit-renewable-fuels-standard</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1367021723117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 20:15:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
