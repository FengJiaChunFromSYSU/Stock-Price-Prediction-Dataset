Issa criticized a "dramatic" alteration to the credit that he said amounted to an expansion of the program. “In 24 hours the heavily subsidized wind industry has gone from the verge of collapse to a modern-day Gold Rush. H.R. 8 seems to create a perverse incentive to rush production of additional facilities even when there may not be adequate demand for wind, biomass, or geothermal energy,” Issa told The Hill in a statement. The House and the Senate agreed Tuesday to extend a 2.2 cent per kilowatt-hour credit for wind power production through this year as part of the "fiscal cliff" deal. It also changed the incentive to let wind projects earn the credit if under construction — rather than in service — by the end of the year. Issa's comment signals that the wind industry’s next battle — securing a long-term phase-out for the credit — could face significant hurdles. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) in December floated extending the credit one year, then ramping it down to end after 2018. The group wants more stability for the industry, as the uncertainty that clouded the credit’s future led to layoffs and a drop in planned investment for this year. But as Congress settles into possible tax code overhaul talks, whether the AWEA can get what it wants remains to be seen. Some fiscal conservatives wanted Congress to let the credit end when it expired at midnight Tuesday. They said the extension and the change to the credit was too costly, coming in at $12.1 billion through 10 years. Issa said the incentive’s renewal and change falls under the committee’s “ongoing oversight of the federal government’s excessive and wasteful spending.” Separately Wednesday, Issa created a new Energy subcommittee, intimating his committee would get more involved in energy issues next Congress.

Quick measures to cut emissions would give a far better chance of keeping global warming within an agreed U.N. limit of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times to avert more floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels. "If you delay action by 10, 20 years you significantly reduce the chances of meeting the 2 degree target," said Keywan Riahi, one of the authors of the report at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. "It was generally known that costs increase when you delay action. It was not clear how quickly they change," he told Reuters of the findings in the science journal Nature based on 500 computer-generated scenarios. It said the timing of cuts in greenhouse gases was more important than other uncertainties - about things like how the climate system works, future energy demand, carbon prices or new energy technologies. The study indicated that an immediate global price of $20 a ton on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, would give a roughly 60 percent chance of limiting warming to below 2C. Wait until 2020 and the carbon price would have to be around $100 a ton to retain that 60 percent chance, Riahi told Reuters of the study made with other experts in Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia and Germany. And a delay of action until 2030 might put the 2C limit - which some of the more pessimistic scientists say is already unattainable - completely out of reach, whatever the carbon price. "The window for effective action on climate change is closing quickly," wrote Steve Hatfield-Dodds of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia in a separate commentary in Nature. Governments agreed to the 2C limit in 2010, viewing it as a threshold to avert dangerous climate change. Temperatures have already risen by 0.8 degree C (1.4F) since wide use of fossil fuels began 200 years ago. ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN After the failure of a 2009 summit in Copenhagen to agree a worldwide accord, almost 200 nations have given themselves until 2015 to work out a global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions that will enter into force in 2020. Amid an economic slowdown, many countries at the last U.N. meeting on climate change in Qatar in December expressed reluctance to make quick shifts away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energies such as wind or solar power. Each U.S. citizen, for instance, emits about 20 tons of carbon dioxide a year. There is no global price on carbon, only regional markets - in a European Union trading system, for instance, where industrial emitters must pay off they exceed their CO2 quotas, 2013 prices are about 6.7 euros ($8.83) a ton. The report also showed that greener policies, such as more efficient public transport or better-insulated buildings, would raise the chances of meeting the 2C goal. And fighting climate change would be easier with certain new technologies, such as capturing and burying carbon emissions from power plants and factories. In some scenarios, the 2C goal could not be met unless carbon capture was adopted. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/01/02/us-climate-costs-idUSBRE9010HU20130102</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357225740852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:09:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357226097716-7</Id><Title>Oil and Gas Companies Lag Far Behind Other Firms on Emissions Cuts</Title><Msg>Oil and Gas Companies Lag Far Behind Other Firms on Emissions Cuts Eight of the 11 domestic energy companies on the Fortune 100 haven't set greenhouse gas reduction or renewable energy goals, a report finds. By Jason Plautz, InsideClimate News Jan 3, 2013 Valero is one of the U.S. energy companies that hasn't set an internal greenhouse gas and renewable energy goal, according to a new report. Credit: 350.org, flickr Recognizing the impact of global warming—or perhaps just looking for a little positive press—large corporations are adopting internal greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals. Noticeably underrepresented? Oil and gas companies. A report released last month by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) showed that 58 of the country's Fortune 100 companies set goals in 2012 to either use more renewable energy for their operations or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, the number of participating companies was even higher—68 of the world's 100 largest companies have set some sort of greenhouse or renewable energy goal. But energy companies lagged behind on both lists. Eight of the 11 domestic energy companies on the Fortune 100 haven't set internal energy goals. The exceptions are Hess and Chevron, which both set renewable energy and greenhouse gas targets, and ExxonMobil, which set a greenhouse gas target. (Hess was accidentally omitted from the report, according to a WWF spokesman.) Eleven of the 20 energy companies on the global list hadn't set targets, the lowest participation rate of any industry. The report was produced by WWF, Ceres and Calvert Investing, and is the first in a series of reports that will look at sustainability in business. Ceres is a coalition of large investors and environmental groups that promotes sustainability in the business community. Calvert Investments is a Maryland-based mutual fund company that invests in socially and environmentally responsible companies. "The industry is quite technologically advanced, but it just hasn't prioritized that innovation in a way that's commensurate to approaching the challenge of climate change," said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program for Ceres. "Not only is this possible, it's necessary. If the world is going to address climate change, the oil industry is going to have to come along, either willingly or kicking and screaming." The world's largest companies have begun setting environmental goals for a variety of reasons—policy pressures, public relations or simply an acknowledgment that renewables might someday be cheaper than, or at least competitive with, oil and gas. Three quarters of the nation's industrial companies now have some sort of environmental target, led by Caterpillar's goal of using 20 percent renewably energy in its operations by 2020 and reducing 25 percent of its emissions in that time. Sixty percent of the "consumer staples" businesses, including Procter &amp; Gamble, have renewable energy or emissions goals. The challenge for companies that produce fossil fuels, of course, is that the very products they're selling contribute to climate change, so moving towards renewables would seem to be a foolish business move. "Admitting that there's a climate problem is like admitting that your product has a problem," said Marty Spitzer, the World Wildlife Fund's director of U.S. climate policy. "Maybe there's an irrational fear that setting goals for their internal operations somehow undermines their business model." But Spitzer said energy companies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions without killing their own business, by cutting emissions associated with their internal operations and the electricity they purchase. Emissions are generally separated into three categories or "scopes." Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions, resulting from internal operations, which for oil and gas companies can include extraction and refining. Scope 2 emissions are associated with the electricity a company buys. Reducing these types of emissions can be easier than trying to reduce Scope 3 emissions, which are associated with the use of the industry's final products, Spitzer said. "I think there's a really good case for companies setting goals for Scope 1 and Scope 2, because it's just about efficiency," he said. The oil and gas sector is directly responsible for 6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to a 2010 report by McKinsey &amp; Company. A new campaign by climate advocates says fossil fuel companies must keep 80 percent of their carbon reserves in the ground to prevent uncontrollable climate change. Spitzer said that even a modest 5 percent reduction—below the goal many other companies have set—could have a major impact on the world's emissions. Chevron, ExxonMobil and Hess have made a stab at it. In 2001 Chevron established an Action Plan on Climate Change that set annual greenhouse gas reduction targets for their internal operations. Although the company has missed some of its annual targets in the past due to expanded production, it met its 2011 goal, according to the company's website. Its 2012 goal is a 0.7 percent reduction compared to 2011 levels, which would mean reducing their emissions to 60.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Chevron is also investing $2.2 billion between 2011 and 2013 on renewable energy, and has raised its energy efficiency by 34 percent over the last 20 years. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, has set out to reduce its greenhouse gas intensity by 20 percent this year, relative to 2002 levels. And Hess aims to cut the carbon intensity of its emissions by 20 percent by 2013 relative to its 2008 levels. Some energy companies, including ConocoPhillips and Marathon Petroleum, have set internal goals, but without defined targets. ConocoPhillips, for example, says on its website that each of its business units is required to develop its own climate change action plan. Ceres has tried for years to persuade oil and gas companies to set their own goals, by reaching out to company shareholders and boards. But Logan, with the Ceres oil and gas program, said the organization has had little success, most likely because the industry has a "short-term mindset" and is "blinded by just how profitable it is to be an oil company at the moment." "There actually was movement five or so years ago, but it just hasn't been replicated," Logan said. As energy companies target increasingly unconventional fuel sources in offshore areas or through hydraulic fracturing, the emissions associated with extraction are expected to rise. ExxonMobil said in a shareholder resolution that its emissions rose 3 percent between 2009 and 2010, in large part because "significant investments in deepwater, shale oil and fracking plays ... contribute significant GHGs emissions. "They're locking in a high-carbon future," Logan said. "A lot more has to be done to push them toward a different trajectory, whether that's investor engagement or policy." Policy Solutions The energy sector could take a cue from the chemical industry, where many companies began regulating themselves in response to the negative publicity generated by the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. The inventory, established in 1986 under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, forced large companies that use potentially toxic chemicals to publicly disclose which chemicals they use and where they are released. That information is then posted on the EPA's website. Today, chemical companies are considered among the leaders in terms of cleaning up their production, despite the relative carbon intensity of their products. But there is no policy equivalent of the TRI for the energy industry. Most companies participate in programs where they voluntarily register their greenhouse gas emissions, such as the California Climate Action Registry or the Carbon Disclosure Project. The EPA collects greenhouse gas emissions data from large facilities and industries—including refineries—to better inform future policy, although individual data is not released. The American Petroleum Institute, the lobbying arm of the industry, also collects emissions and energy use data from its member companies. But voluntary efforts haven't been very successful, Logan said. And he sees no sign that the federal government is planning to enact anything that could move them along. "The lack of any threat of policy is an obstacle," Logan said. "There's not even a framework of a policy." Logan said it will take either a targeted policy like the Toxic Release Inventory that focuses on oil and gas company emissions or a broader climate change policy to make the energy industry reduce its carbon footprint. One thing that might work, he said, is a low-carbon fuel standard like the one established in California, which takes into account the full life-cycle emissions of fuel. California requires oil refineries and distributors to cut the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in the state by 10 percent by 2020. The standard considers "well-to-wheels" emissions, including those associated with extracting and transporting the fuels. The program remains tangled in legal battles. A similar standard has been proposed for 11 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. But the effort hasn't moved passed the discussion stage. Setting a national price on carbon through a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program also could work, Logan said, by raising the cost of carbon-intensive fuels and forcing companies to rethink their production models. A federal government requirement that a certain percentage of electricity come from renewable sources, tax incentives for wind and solar production, and power purchase agreements that allow for long-term renewable contracts and on-site generation could also encourage companies to set internal targets. insideclimatenewsDOTorg/news/20130103/oil-and-gas-companies-exxonmobil-chevron-greenhouse-gas-reductions-climate-change-renewable-energy-corporations</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357226097716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:14:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357226605658-8</Id><Title>The Fracking Pioneer Is At Our Helm.</Title><Msg>Anyone who is not up to date on the furure of U.S. Domestic production,should consider the plausability of XOM acquiring The Bakken Fields,tripiling proven reserves,and wisling spending cash horde at hand. keep in mind the lng prospects,as world consumption demands outpace production,and We have an estimated 1,000 dollar SP (Splitz Adjusted),by 2016,and more than twice the current Divendenz Yieldz.

Industry is already in a major recession, and the reason is energy prices. Germany is being supported by exports and a strong real estate market. The real estate market is stimulated by capital flight from Southern Europe, and the exports are stimulated by an undervalued euro weakened by southern Europe. Southern Europe's problem is poor governance, tax avoidance, and inability and political systems that are far too democratic and thus unable to take tough choices. In short southern Europe is a disaster and may never recover. France's real estate market had recovered from the collapse of 2008-2009, but now is slipping. Its economy is hamstrung by environmental radicalism, unions, and far too much speculation, especially in its bloated state supported banking sector. The US is doing comparatively well because there is really no other place to park large amounts of capital, risk-free. The dollar gets a boost thanks to China. The high energy prices and divided government pose many challenges though. It will go into recession...The cliff deal is irrelevant to the outcome. The Republican Party could easily make it worse, too, if it tries to reassert itself after failing so miserably in the cliff deal.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1357227201472</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:33:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357227215158-10</Id><Title>Bridge To Nowhere? NOAA Confirms High Methane Leakage Rate Up To 9% From Gas Fields, Gutting Climate Benefit</Title><Msg>Bridge To Nowhere? NOAA Confirms High Methane Leakage Rate Up To 9% From Gas Fields, Gutting Climate Benefit By Joe Romm on Jan 2, 2013 at 4:56 pm Photo by Walter Disney Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have reconfirmed earlier findings of high rates of methane leakage from natural gas fields. If these findings are replicated elsewhere, they would utterly vitiate the climate benefit of natural gas, even when used to switch off coal. Indeed, if the previous findings — of 4% methane leakage over a Colorado gas field — were a bombshell, then the new measurements reported by the journal Nature are thermonuclear: … the research team reported new Colorado data that support the earlier work, as well as preliminary results from a field study in the Uinta Basin of Utah suggesting even higher rates of methane leakage — an eye-popping 9% of the total production. That figure is nearly double the cumulative loss rates estimated from industry data — which are already higher in Utah than in Colorado. The Uinta Basin is of particular interest because fracking has increased there over the past decade. How much methane leaks during the entire lifecycle of unconventional gas has emerged as a key question in the fracking debate. Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4). And methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than (CO2), which is released when any hydrocarbon, like natural gas, is burned — 25 times more potent over a century and 72 to 100 times more potent over a 20-year period. Even without a high-leakage rate for shale gas, we know that “Absent a Serious Price for Global Warming Pollution, Natural Gas Is A Bridge To Nowhere.” That was first demonstrated by the International Energy Agency in its big June 2011 report on gas — see IEA’s “Golden Age of Gas Scenario” Leads to More Than 6°F Warming and Out-of-Control Climate Change. That study — which had both coal and oil consumption peaking in 2020 — made abundantly clear that if we want to avoid catastrophic warming, we need to start getting off of all fossil fuels. A March 2012 study by climatologist Ken Caldeira and tech guru Nathan Myhrvold came to a similar conclusion using different methodology (see “You Can’t Slow Projected Warming With Gas, You Need ‘Rapid and Massive Deployment’ of Zero-Carbon Power“). They found that even if you could switch entirely over to natural gas in four decades, you “won’t see any substantial decrease in global temperatures for up to 250 years. There’s almost no climate value in doing it.” And that was using conventional (i.e. low) leakage rates. But the leakage rate does matter. A major 2011 study by Tom Wigley of the Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) concluded: The most important result, however, in accord with the above authors, is that, unless leakage rates for new methane can be kept below 2%, substituting gas for coal is not an effective means for reducing the magnitude of future climate change. Wigley, it should be noted, was looking at the combined warming impact from three factors — from the methane leakage, from the gas plant CO2 emissions, and from the drop in sulfate aerosols caused by switching out coal for gas. In a country like the United States, which strongly regulates sulfate aerosols, that third factor is probably much smaller. Of course, in countries like China and India, it would be a big deal. An April 2012 study found that a big switch from coal to gas would only reduce “technology warming potentials” by about 25% over the first three decades — far different than the typical statement that you get a 50% drop in CO2 emissions from the switch. And that assumed a total methane leakage of 2.4% (using EPA’s latest estimate). The study found that if the total leakage exceeds 3.2% “gas becomes worse for the climate than coal for at least some period of time.” Leakage of 4%, let alone 9%, would call into question the value of unconventional gas as any sort of bridge fuel. Colm Sweeney, the head of the aircraft program at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory, who led the study’s aerial component, told Nature: “We were expecting to see high methane levels, but I don’t think anybody really comprehended the true magnitude of what we would see.” The industry has tended kept most of the data secret while downplaying the leakage issue. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) is working with the industry to develop credible leakage numbers in a variety of locations. The earlier NOAA findings were called into question by Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations. The NOAA researchers “have a defence of the Colorado study in press,” Nature notes. Right now, fracking would seem to be a bridge to nowhere. thinkprogressDOTorg/climate/2013/01/02/1388021/bridge-to-nowhere-noaa-confirms-high-methane-leakage-rate-up-to-9-from-gas-fields-gutting-climate-benefit/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357227215158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:33:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357227476169-11</Id><Topic><Title>The Fracking Pioneer Is At Our Helm.</Title><Username>stenchcloud</Username><Timestamp>1357226605658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:23:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You inspire me to short your stock.

The SEC is defending the new rules against an array of legal claims by the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups. The business groups’ lawsuit contends that the disclosure mandate runs afoul of the First Amendment by “compelling U.S. companies to engage in costly speech on controversial matters in order to influence political affairs in other nations.” Not so, the SEC argues, calling the claim “an unprecedented attack on a disclosure requirement involving purely factual, non-ideological information that does not implicate any significant First Amendment interests.” The SEC brief argues that the industry groups’ First Amendment claim, if successful, would have far-reaching effects that go way beyond the disclosure rule at hand in the case. “Tellingly, petitioners ignore both that regulated entities are subject to innumerable comparable federal, state and local public reporting requirements and that their novel theory could have wide-ranging and potentially devastating implications for these important government programs,” the brief states. The brief is the latest move in litigation over SEC rules finalized in August that were required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. The disclosure rule forces SEC-listed oil, natural-gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments (including the U.S.) related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses, taxes, royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects.   It’s aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the so-called “resource curse,” in which some impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth. Beyond the First Amendment argument, the business groups’ lawsuit raises a series of additional objections to the rule. Critics of the rule and the underlying Dodd-Frank provision say it will impose costly burdens and put SEC-listed oil companies at a disadvantage against state-owned Russian and Chinese competitors. Companies including Exxon, Shell and Chevron have fought against the public disclosure mandates. The SEC brief attacks “a series of meritless challenges” in the lawsuit filed by API, the Chamber and two other groups: the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the National Foreign Trade Council. The SEC states: Contrary to petitioners’ argument that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by promulgating a rule without first determining whether Congress’s sought-after transparency and accountability benefits would in fact materialize, the Commission rightly declined to second-guess the wisdom of Congress’s policy determination. Moreover, in conducting its economic analysis, the Commission— which was generally dependent on industry commentators for empirical data— acted appropriately when it used the little data that they provided to quantitatively #$%$ (and generally confirm) their claims about the potential costs of Rule 13q-1. Industry groups allege that the SEC’s economic analysis underlying the rule is badly flawed and that regulators abused their discretion by failing to allow exemptions if foreign governments bar the disclosure, among other claims. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/275341-sec-oil-disclosure-rule-doesnt-violate-first-amendment</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357238007098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:33:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357238730003-18</Id><Title>Universal Bioenergy Inc.

The grain-based additive traded 61.61 cents below gasoline, based on front-month futures compared with 62.2 cents on Dec. 31, the widest since Sept. 28. Gasoline traded for February delivery while ethanol traded for January. The ethanol contract expires Jan. 4. “You would think they would increase ethanol blending,” said Mark Schultz, chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “The spread has moved up to about 60 cents.” Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.1 cents to settle at $2.179 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures were down 1.1 percent from a year ago. The more actively traded February contract fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.194 a gallon, about 60 cents cheaper than gasoline. In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.195, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Ethanol on the West Coast was unchanged at $2.35 a gallon and in New York the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.28. Gasoline for February delivery jumped 3.34 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.7951 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Corn for March delivery decreased 7.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $6.9075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from 31 cents Dec. 31, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to data collected by Bloomberg. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-02/ethanol-gasoline-gap-narrows-on-speculation-discount-to-spur-use.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357239939974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:05:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357240153056-21</Id><Topic><Title>Ethanol-Gasoline Gap Narrows on Speculation Discount to Spur Use</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357239939974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:05:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brazil 2012 ethanol exports surge to highest since 2009 London (Platts)--3Jan2013/727 am EST/1227 GMT Brazil exported 3.04 billion liters (804 million gallons) of ethanol in 2012, a surge of 55% over 2011 to the highest level since 2009, data released by Brazil's ministry of foreign trade showed Wednesday. In December, Brazil shipped 462.1 million liters of ethanol, the second highest monthly volume in 2012 and a record high for the month. The main buyers of Brazilian ethanol in 2012 were the US, Jamaica, South Korea and Japan, according to data from Brazil's ministry of foreign trade.

These projects use innovative synthetic biological and chemical techniques to convert biomass into processable sugars that can be transformed into bioproducts and drop-in biofuels for cars, trucks, and planes. The awards announced today will support projects led by collaborative teams, including universities, national laboratories and private industry. The five projects support the Energy Department's broader biomass portfolio which focuses on research, development and demonstration efforts to achieve affordable, scalable and sustainable advanced biofuels. Two of these projects will develop cost-effective ways to produce intermediates from the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass, while three projects will propose new conversion techniques to transform biomass intermediates into advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The following projects were selected for negotiation of award today: J. Craig Venter Institute (up to $1.2 million; Rockville, Maryland): This project will develop new technologies to produce enzymes that more efficiently deconstruct biomass to make biofuel. This work will be performed in collaboration with La Jolla, California-based Synthetic Genomics, Inc. Novozymes (up to $2.5 million; Davis, California): Through collaborative work with a team of partners, Novozymes will expand their existing capabilities to find new sources of enzymes which can be targeted to deliver more cost-effective solutions for deconstructing biomass into processable components. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (up to $2.4 million; Richland, Washington): The goal of this project is to increase the production of fuel molecules in fungi growing on lignocellulosic hydrolysate. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory will partner with universities and industry, including the University of Kansas, to complete the project. Texas AgriLife Research (up to $2.4 million; College Station, Texas): This project will employ state-of-the-art technology to develop a novel and integrated platform for converting lignin, a component of all lignocellulosic material, into biofuel precursors. The team includes scientists from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of British Columbia, Washington State University, and Texas A&amp;M University. Lygos (up to $1.8 million; Berkeley, California): The overall goal of this project is to develop efficient, inexpensive methods and tools to convert biomass into common and specialty chemicals. This work will be performed in collaboration with San Francisco-based TeselaGen Biotech. The Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy accelerates development and facilitates deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and market-based solutions that strengthen U.S. energy security, environmental quality, and economic vitality. biomassmagazineDOTcom/articles/8470/doe-awards-10-million-to-develop-biofuels-biobased-products</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357244377020</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 15:19:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357245401479-24</Id><Topic><Title>The newest board idiot = hanseteelyard</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356983478975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:51:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still begging for money - and not even on a proper street corner but an internet message board.

"I am still of the belief that we can get this done, on the assumption, of course, that it passes regulatory muster," Joe Oliver told Postmedia News in an interview published on Thursday. "If the conclusion is this project can be safe for Canadians, safe for the environment ... that, I hope, will go a long way in respect at least to people who are kind of open-minded to the facts." Both the federal and Alberta governments, as well as the oil industry, are keen for the C$6 billion Enbridge Inc (ENB TO: Quote) pipeline to be built to enable the increasing supply of crude from the oil sands to satisfy thirsty Asian markets. A glut of Albertan oil relative to current pipeline capacity has forced deep discounts that are taking a toll on provincial and federal coffers as well as oil company profits. But the Liberal government of the province of British Columbia, the main opposition New Democratic Party, aboriginal groups and environmental groups have raised strong opposition to the 550,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) line. It is currently undergoing an environmental review, which is to conclude at the end of the year. Oliver said Ottawa had much work to do to convince British Columbians of the value of the pipeline but said that if environmental concerns were allayed, the provincial government should not be opposed. Ian MacDonald, editor of Macdonald-Laurier Institute's Inside Policy magazine, said in an op-ed piece on Thursday that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper should convene a meeting of provincial premiers and aboriginal leaders to push for pipelines as part of a Canadian Energy Strategy. The difficulties in getting approval for pipelines from Alberta have prompted a proposal to send oil by rail to the Valdez terminal on Alaska's southern coast, though studies show rail is proportionately more likely to record spillages and accidents. The Alaska rail project is being promoted by Generating for Seven Generations, a group that advocates extensive collaboration with native groups. It says it could transport 1.5 million to 4 million barrels per day, far more than pipelines could handle. Mike Deising, spokesman for Alberta Energy Minister Ken Hughes, said the province advocates for market diversification without endorsing one project over another. "We support the need to get the product to market and work with other provinces and stakeholders to help ensure Canadians understand the benefits of our oil," he said. Canada is also awaiting a verdict from U.S. President Barack Obama on whether to allow TransCanada Corp's (TRP TO: Quote) Keystone XL pipeline into the United States. He rejected an initial application last year. caDOTreutersDOTcom/article/businessNews/idCABRE9020IA20130103?sp=TrueType</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357267958680</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 21:52:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357269473203-37</Id><Topic><Title>For Full time posters!</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1357265635718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 21:13:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who pays for the wasted military spending when thank you w for 2 credit card wars</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1357269473203</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:17:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357270858300-38</Id><Topic><Title>More Dem hypocrisy</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1357257961790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you have proven many times that you are "not too smart" but you do realize that it is already the New Year don't you ?? you do realize karl rove was 100% wrong don't you ?? you do realize USA oil production continues to increase don't you ?? you do realize saddam didn't fly the planes on 9/11 don't you ??</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1357270858300</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:40:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357272976608-39</Id><Topic><Title>More Dem hypocrisy</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1357257961790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ah, the brain dead wahleee boy speaks again - and one of the symptoms of brain death is clearly displayed; His "thoughts" are pure gibberish.
