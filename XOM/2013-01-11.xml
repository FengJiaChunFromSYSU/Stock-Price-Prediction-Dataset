The sector is eagerly waiting for federal tax experts to give detailed guidance that interprets a language change to the PTC, the crucial industry support that was extended by one year in the final fiscal cliff package. The new language allows companies to take advantage of the PTC if they begin construction by the end of 2013, rather than when a project is placed into service, as previously required. The tweak marked a major victory for the wind industry, which argued that the existing PTC language didn’t give companies enough time to claim the 2.2-cents-per-kilowatt-hour tax credit. But the federal government still must decide this looming question: How do you define “begin construction”? That definition could have huge ramifications for wind developers. “This is a big deal,” said David Burton, a partner at Akin Gump. The wind industry is hoping the federal government takes a cue from the Treasury Department, which said in 2009 that companies qualified for the 1603 cash grant program once they invested 5 percent of the total cost of their project. Under that scenario, developers would not need to complete the time-consuming legwork required before starting to build a wind farm in order to take advantage of the tax credit. Instead, developers would just need to meet the modest investment threshold. If adopted, that guidance would ease the politicoDOTcom/story/2013/01/wind-industry-awaits-tax-guidance-on-ptc-rule-86037.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357912643130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:57:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357913674682-3</Id><Title>Ethanol’s Discount to Gasoline Narrows to Two-Week Low on Supply</Title><Msg>Ethanol’s Discount to Gasoline Narrows to Two-Week Low on Supply By Mario Parker - Jan 10, 2013 3:12 PM MT. 0 Comments Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed to the lowest level in more than two weeks on speculation that higher corn prices will curtail supply and on optimism for increased demand. The grain-based additive was 54.83 cents below the motor fuel, which includes reformulated gasoline known as RBOB, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities. That was down from 54.89 cents yesterday and the smallest gap since Dec. 24. “The spread to RBOB has widened,” said Ian Jackson, a trader at SCB &amp; Associates LLC in Chicago. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see guys take advantage.” Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.245 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level since Dec. 18. Prices have fallen 0.8 percent in the past year. In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York at $2.285 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.20, in the U.S. Gulf at $2.25 and on the West Coast at $2.335 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Gasoline for February delivery advanced 1.44 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.7933 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers RBOB, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Corn for March delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $6.9875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Losing Money Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged from yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock. Corn inventories are dropping at the fastest pace in 17 years because of drought in the U.S. Midwest. Stockpiles on Dec. 1 were 15 percent lower than a year earlier at 8.22 billion bushels, the smallest post-harvest level since 2003, according to the average of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Agriculture Department releases its supply report tomorrow. Ethanol companies have tempered output 13 percent in the past year to 826,000 barrels a day as of last week, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-01-10/ethanol-s-discount-to-gasoline-narrows-to-two-week-low-on-supply.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357913674682</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:14:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357914642050-4</Id><Title>Sempra U.S. Gas &amp; Power Energizes First Phase Of Arizona Solar Project</Title><Msg>Sempra U.S. Gas &amp; Power Energizes First Phase Of Arizona Solar Project Solar Farm Ranks Among Largest Photovoltaic Installations in U.S. Jan 9, 2013 SAN DIEGO, Jan. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra U.S. Gas &amp; Power today announced that it has completed construction of Mesquite Solar 1, the first 150-megawatt (MW) phase of the company's Mesquite Solar complex in Arlington, Ariz., about 40 miles west of Phoenix. The photovoltaic solar energy project is now operational and ranks among the largest in the U.S., generating enough clean electricity to power about 56,000 homes. "We are pleased to continue the momentum of our solar program with the completion of Mesquite Solar 1 and will now focus on the development of the remaining 4,000-acre complex," said Jeffrey W. Martin, president and chief executive officer of Sempra U.S. Gas &amp; Power. "This accomplishment puts us solidly on track to own and operate more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by the end of this year. We are excited about the future. This milestone would not have been possible without the strong support of neighboring communities, regulators and local and state elected officials." "Arizona continues to lead the nation in the production of clean, renewable solar energy," said Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer. "Projects like Sempra U.S. Gas &amp; Power's Mesquite Solar 1 not only create clean energy, they also generate quality jobs for Arizonans. I am thrilled to see our great state at the forefront of this promising industry and I look forward to Arizona continuing to establish itself as our nation's solar capital." Construction began in June 2011 and employed more than 450 workers. The power has been sold to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric under a 20-year contract. Future phases planned at the solar complex could produce up to 700 MW, making it one of North America's largest solar power installations. sempraDOTmediaroomDOTcom/index.php?s=19080&amp;item=136599</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357914642050</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:30:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357915513996-5</Id><Topic><Title>Bullish still</Title><Username>audrycusimanobbyz303</Username><Timestamp>1329696763000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-02-19 19:12:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a great day!</Msg><Username>dchottey</Username><Timestamp>1357915513996</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:45:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357917884257-6</Id><Title>Gold bugs and inflation lunatics are up in arms over Japan</Title><Msg>The reason is they are getting desperate. Japan's new monetary policy is highly deflationary for the United States. The policy is really just a copy of China's policy of printing yuan to devalue its currency, helping them to flood the United States and other countries with cheap products. With China and Japan following the same policy the pressure on industrial export prices will be extreme. China's trade surpluses will wither in the competition with Japan on prices. With China's trade surplus on the decline they will have less money to buy gold bars with. That's bad for the gold bugs, very bad. The floods of cheap industrial products will naturally lower prices in the countries that buy them. Again that's bad news for the gold bugs. Worse still, the Japanese are going to buy European debt with a printing press to devalue the yen, just as China is buying dollars with a printing press to devalue the yuan. That is a powerful reinforcement to the Eurozone's credit and helps Germany immensely in the long slow process of deflating the southern European economies and whipping them into shape. The credit of Germany is strong but the credit of Germany + Japan is unbeatable. The gold bug deserves this of course. The sad thing is the government will not have an opportunity to put an enormous speculator tax on them and capture a piece of their wealth before it is gone.

The rules finalized last August are required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, but they have drawn a legal challenge from oil industry and business groups that say the mandate will impose costly burdens. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has previously expressed support for the Dodd-Frank provision, Section 1504, and the SEC’s rules when they were in draft form. Additionally, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and ex-Sen. #$%$ Lugar (R-Ind.), who authored the Dodd-Frank language, as well as Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), have joined a closely watched lawsuit to defend the rule. The disclosure requirement could also prompt legislation aimed at thwarting it. The rule forces SEC-listed oil, natural-gas and mining companies to reveal payments to governments (including the U.S.) related to projects in their countries, such as money for production licenses, taxes, royalties and other aspects of energy and mineral projects.   It’s aimed at increasing transparency to help undo the so-called “resource curse,” in which some impoverished countries in Africa and elsewhere are plagued by high levels of corruption and conflict alongside their energy and mineral wealth. But the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and two other groups are challenging the mandate. They say it will place SEC-listed oil companies at a disadvantage when competing for contracts overseas against state-owned Russian and Chinese firms that aren’t subject to the regulation. The business groups’ lawsuit also contends that the mandate runs afoul of the First Amendment by “compelling U.S. companies to engage in costly speech on controversial matters in order to influence political affairs in other nations.” However, the State Department aide said the rule provides needed sunlight. “Section 1504 and the SEC rule provide transparency by ensuring that a sufficiently detailed level of information concerning payments from the extractive industry for the development of oil, natural gas, and minerals, much of which has been previously inaccessible, will soon be made public and accessible to civil society and investors,” Finn said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/276711-state-dept-says-sec-oil-rule-directly-advances-us-foreign-policy-interests</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1357931401059</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 14:10:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
