The survey covers the period ended May 17 and is based on information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the Camarillo, California-based company. The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in the period ended Feb. 22, is 12.67 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.7833 a gallon. The recent increase is “one of the exceptions to the rule that most likely crude oil will be the mover and shaker for change in the direction of gasoline prices at retail,” Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “It was driven by infrastructure problems downstream at the refinery level.” Wholesale price increases related to refinery issues haven’t been passed fully along to consumers, and some retailers’ profit margins have been squeezed, Lundberg said. Drivers in the U.S. West and Midwest have been among the most affected by higher prices so far, she said. U.S. prices may rise 4 cents to 7 cents in coming days, Lundberg said, and increases may pause before the Memorial Day holiday next week. Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 8.15 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.0969 a gallon in the two weeks ended May 17. It was the highest settlement since April 9. WTI Crude U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 2.59 million barrels in the week ended May 10 to 217.7 million, the first increase in five weeks, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex rose 41 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $96.02 a barrel in the two weeks to May 17. Prices have advanced 11 percent since April 17, when they reached $86.68, the lowest settlement of the year.

Twelve years later, European Union regulators may discover energy traders never learned the lessons of the scandal. BP Plc (BP/), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Platts were visited by EU inspectors last week over allegations they “colluded in reporting distorted prices” to manipulate the published prices of oil and biofuel products, the European Commission in Brussels said after the raids. Shell, London-based BP and Statoil ASA (STL), three of Europe’s biggest oil explorers, are under investigation for potential manipulation of prices in the $3.4 trillion-a-year global crude market. The involvement of McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI)’s Platts, which publishes pricing data, hearkens back to other pricing scandals including Enron, and more recently, Libor. “We’re making exactly the same mistakes we did with Enron, just with a different commodity,” Robert McCullough, an energy consultant, said by telephone from Portland, Oregon. “The same manipulation we saw in electricity and gas pricing is what we’re seeing in oil.” The Enron scandal started in 2001 as traders used trading strategies called “Fat Boy” and “Get Shorty” to create phantom congestion in the California energy markets. Electricity prices rose 10-fold on average and California consumers endured days of rolling blackouts. Rapid Fire Large-volume, rapid-fire trades between Enron and a Reliant Energy Inc. unit’s gas trader through an Enron-run electronic platform triggered price moves that all traders could see without knowing the cause, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found in a 2003 report. The transactions made through EnronOnline influenced daily price indexes used in physical gas contracts and for settling financial derivatives such as swaps.

Interested parties and members of the public have until June 13 to weigh in on the1572-page proposal to require lower sulfur content in fuel. Firstannounced on March 29, the contentious proposal endeavors to reduce smog, soot and toxic pollution. Refiners would be forced to lower sulfur content of gasoline by more than 60 percent to 10 parts per million by 2017. The requirements spelled out in the so-called “Tier 3” gasoline standards are intended to improve the performance of catalytic converters. “Few other national strategies exist that would deliver the same magnitude of multi-pollutant reductions projected to result from the proposed Tier 3 standards,” the EPA contends in its proposal. More than 158 million Americans currently experience unhealthy levels of air pollution linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, according to the agency. Motor vehicles are seen as an important source of the pollution. “More than 50 million people live, work, or go to school in close proximity to high-traffic roadways, and the average American spends more than one hour traveling along roads each day,” the EPA reasons. While automakers have backed the rule, the powerful American Petroleum Industry opposes them, warning the regulations would lead to higher gas prices for consumers. The EPA maintains the rule would increase pump prices by less than a penny per gallon.

The training center is based on the German army’s facilities in Letzlingen, Germany and will offer troop training for 30,000 troops yearly in combined arms tactics and maneuvers beginning next year. 4 more troop training centers are planned, one for each Russian military district. Rheinmetall and other German defense contractors will most likely be supplying the Russians with equipment too. Their technology is quite good. With only a modest R&amp;D budget Rheinmetall has developed 50 kW laser weapons, superior to US army technology, technology which can intercept mortars and shoot down drones. It will be deploying 100 kW vehicle mounted units soon. This feat is possible because of the very high level of laser technology in Germany, much of which is used in industry to achieve dominance over foreign enterprises, and also in solar system manufacture and on ongoing programs to replace petrochemicals. US laser technology, on the other hand, is pushed forward in an artificial environment of classified military programs which are very wasteful and inefficient and offer little or no value to US industry. The rising technological proficiency of the Russian military will surely require yet more spending by the US military to match it. This will bodes poorly for the oil industry as it is a prime candidate for taxes to fund the spending as well as the nearly $20 trillion in debt run up to fund past wars and US military spending. For its part, it would be very easy for Germany to match Russian military spending, but there is no real hurry. German defense contractors are making plenty selling to foreigners and developing the technologies of the future with other people’s money.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1369108434086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 23:53:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369108481534-18</Id><Topic><Title>Will James Inhofe Ask For Federal Assistance?</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1369085870867</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 17:37:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The oil rednecks don’t care.
