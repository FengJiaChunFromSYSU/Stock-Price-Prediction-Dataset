Electricity generated from a new wind farm can be supplied for A$80 per megawatt hour, whereas energy from a new coal-fired plant will run at about A$143 or A$116 from a new station powered by natural gas. However, coal-fired power stations built in the 1970s and 1980s can still produce cheaper power. Not to mention, Australia's price on carbon emissions has played an integral role in the shift. The price on carbon (A$23 a metric ton of CO2 emitted as of last year) continues to rise, making it harder for fossil fuel-powered plants to compete. Meanwhile, the cost of wind generation has fallen by 10 percent since 2011 with the help of lower equipment expenses, and the cost of solar has dropped by 29 percent. “The fact that wind power is now cheaper than coal and gas in a country with some of the world’s best fossil fuel resources shows that clean energy is a game changer which promises to turn the economics of power systems on its head,” Michael Liebreich, chief executive officer of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in a statement. By 2020, the country plans to get at least 20 percent of its power from renewable energy. As of 2011, renewables accounted for nearly ten percent of Australia's electricity production. Wind power is well on its way to comprising the majority of Australia's renewable energy portfolio in the decades to come, especially after just completing construction of the Western Hemisphere's largest wind farm, the Macarthur Project, with the help of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world's largest turbine maker.

They don’t have the money. They have US dollars, but what good are those in a war? They have tens of millions of cars and trucks that require oil without the oil to fuel them. They have hundreds of millions of workers near starvation ready to riot at any time. I expect the Chinese to become very big buyers of German machinery as they attempt to boost industrial production to generate more exports to buy more oil in the years ahead, and more BMWs and Mercedes for their elite. How many willing "slaves" does that equate to for each German? LOL On the topic of turmoil, it does appear too that the gold market has figured out the concept of the sale of central bank gold reserves to meet senior claims by the ECB, and in turn its main creditor the Bundesbank… Yes they let that slip in the Cyprus situation when somebody had the bright idea of selling them to come up with more money to bail out their banks. When Italy’s turn comes, it will either sell its gold and wipe out its bank deposits, or do what Germany orders. As Frederick the Great said: “l'audace l'audace toujours l'audace.” I’m not worried, and don’t see anyone in Berlin looking very worried either. China and the USA have some serious problems, however…</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1365869112668</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:05:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365899352156-10</Id><Title>The world's first algae-powered building</Title><Msg>The world's first algae-powered building 13th April 2013 The first 100% algae-powered building has been constructed in Hamburg, Germany. Credit: Arup With 15 apartment units, the Bio Intelligent Quotient (BIQ) House demonstrates a cost-effective way of producing environmentally-friendly, sustainable architecture. It is one of many projects currently being showcased at the International Building Exhibition. The BIQ House took around three years to build, with design and construction costs of €5 million ($6.5 million). It features "bio-reactors" in the facade which contain microalgae. These live in a water solution, with nutrients and carbon dioxide provided by an automated system. Each of the 129 tanks can be rotated towards the Sun, generating biomass that can either cool or heat the building, while serving as a renewable energy source. Even if you don't believe in man-made climate change, this type of building makes sense from an economic viewpoint – given the finite supply of fossil fuels. Such "living" buildings could actually produce more resources than they consume, potentially easing the population crisis. They are expected to be commonplace by 2050. Josef Hargrave, consultant in Arup's Foresight + Innovation team: "By producing food and energy, and providing clean air and water, buildings can evolve from being passive shells into adaptive and responsive organisms – living and breathing structures supporting the cities of tomorrow." futuretimelineDOTnet/blog/2013/04/13.htm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1365899352156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 20:29:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365900190914-11</Id><Topic><Title>GOOD LUCK TO BLUE STATES---selling municipal bonds after Detroit and Stockton CA</Title><Username>gcoffman008</Username><Timestamp>1365861673883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:01:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep those states going to starve like rats.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1365900190914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 20:43:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365901254265-12</Id><Title>GOP working hard to disarm Red States</Title><Msg>Importing impoverished and crime prone Latinos is Republican Party theology as they see a larger consumer population and downward pressure on wages.

The GOP has most of its base thinking it is somehow conservative. They doubled federal welfare spending in just four years with Republican control of the House and Senate during Bush's first term-somethng the Democrat Party could never pull off. Both parties will support taxpayer bailouts for any big banks or multinational corporations and both parties are spending fiends when it comes to the Trotskyite globalism of maintaining 1000 military bases in 140 countries. The Democrats and Republicans are beholden to the too big to jail theology of crooked banks laundering money for drug cartels. The GOP will never push the Corzine looting of $1.5 billion dollars and the Democrats are thrilled that Eric Cantor engineered legislation to allow for insider trading by Senator's and Congressmen's spouses and sibblings.</Msg><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1365910342120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 23:32:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
