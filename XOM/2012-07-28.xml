I mean, is it just XOM or, does your disgust extend to Pfizer, A&amp;W Root Beer, GM, Ford, Ken's Kitchen, etc. etc. etc. and, every farm in the country? You could contact Maxine Waters. Maybe she could help you. It sounds like you both have a similar IQ.</Msg><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1343487518000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 10:58:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343487647000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Should the American taxpayer keep subsidizing the richest company on the planet?</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1343421507000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:38:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The majority of foreign aid goes to subsidizing Fortune 500 comapnies.

But petroleum will also be the Great Leveler in terms of equalizing everyone: People will go through a final, grasping petroleum grab with whatever funds and connections they have, before the attempt fails for good. Then all people will have no choice but to work together or perish. Until then, we have skewed values: for example, when a kindly old lady drives to a shop and has her charitable concerns, the use of oil makes her a killer of the planet and she is not pursuing a sustainable form of transportation. Meanwhile, a mean old man who scowls at little children who walks to the shop might be a much more valuable citizen in a practical fashion that matters to the world. http://www.culturechange.org/e-letter-peakoil.html</Msg><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1343529838000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 22:43:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
