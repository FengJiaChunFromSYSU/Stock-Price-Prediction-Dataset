The manager is in a position to do something about their reduced income such as reduce the wages of their underlings, or increase the price of the firm's products, which frees of money to pay themselves more to compensate for the tax. Before a hypothetical tax was imposed they were receiving what they thought was fair, and they will do whatever is within their considerable power to get back to that situation. Raising taxes on all "rich people" just makes it that much easier for the managers to raise prices or reduce wages as all other managers are confronted with the same tax and no one manager will place his/her firm at competitive disadvantage by raising prices or cutting wages to pass the tax through. The workers or consumers face a united front. Singling out a single person for a tax is both unconstitutional and also would bring in little revenue anyway... Economic tax incidence works yet again.

It is irrelevant that the corporation's profit will not be reduced by a tax placed on the executives and other managers. The firm's owners/shareholders do not set the pay of the managers so their economic incentives are irrelevant. The managers from upper level to lower level determine their own pay and compensation, based on the dynamics of supply/demand running through the corporate structure. The pay is arrived at through negotiation, comparable pay at competing firms. Just watch as the pay of the corporate managers rises when taxes get placed on them, and the pay or benefits of their workers (those with minimal bargaining power in the corporate structure) get hosed... You will then understand through experience what could have been arrived at ahead of time through rational analysis. I already gave you a source for corporate management and the interactions... see Chandler. No doubt you are incapable of grasping any of it.

The change in the tax rate was not the only thing going on during the Reagan years. There were great advances in computer technology and automation which allowed corporations to fire unskilled or semiskilled workers, and reduce wage costs, gains which the managers divided among themselves and the shareholders as could be expected by theory. Also, foreign trade picked up and many jobs were moved out of the country, with the improvement in wage costs again flowing to the corporate coffers to be split between the corporate managers, and preferentially so by the top ones, and the shareholders. You obviously forget that social security taxes were raised during the Reagan years. Tax incidence theory clearly indicates that corporations and other businesses are going to attempt to shift the cost of that into lower worker salaries. This, no doubt, offset many of the gains from worker productivity which could theoretically have resulted in them being paid higher wages - that is if the corporate managers were not in a strong enough bargaining position to co-opt the increment of higher productivity of themselves. The Reagan years played out just as could be expected. Galbraith is a far too academic and impractical for me. It should be proof enough for you that the poor failed to accomplish much under the New Deal or thereafter. About all that could be said for the New Deal through the 1960s is commodity prices fell relative to wage costs, and many products such as cheap plastic and rubber were introduced which improved their living standard. Those advances came from corporate management, not thanks to workers. They got a free ride, and without it their lot would have gotten worse thanks to the high taxes and other burdens imposed by the leftist Democrats...</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345614552000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 01:49:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345619946000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345603067000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:37:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The change in the tax rate was not the only thing going on during the Reagan years" So if you can apply certain external forces that would interfere the direct passage of increased employment from reduced taxes on the wealthy, why haven't you done so to the reverse, where increased tax on the wealthy is supposed to reduce employment?</Msg><Username>lc298h</Username><Timestamp>1345619946000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 03:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345620825000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345603067000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:37:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is as stupid to say that Government spending did not help during the GFC (because the alternative is never known) as it is to say that the New Deal was not beneficial.

(SO), Edison International (EIX) and rival power companies won a legal fight with the Environmental Protection Agency, gaining more time and leeway to cut pollution from burning coal. The bigger challenges from cheap natural gas may make it a muted victory. “This really is a black eye for the EPA,” James Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners LLC in Washington, said in an interview. “But for the industry, the critical factor overall has been the low price of natural gas,” which is “the great destroyer.” The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington yesterday struck down the EPA’s cross-state air pollution rule, saying the agency illegally usurped state authority for air-pollution programs and imposed caps on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide lower than necessary to clean up the air in neighboring states. While Edison and American Electric Power Co. (AEP) say that gave them a needed reprieve, the trouble is that other EPA requirements are looming and cheap natural gas is making coal- fired electricity generation increasingly uncompetitive. “At the end of the day the older, dirtier coal plants are going to close,” Sam Brothwell, a senior utility analyst at Bloomberg Industries, said in a telephone interview. “It’s an economic decision.” Stock Performance AEP fell 46 cents to $42.65 yesterday, after initially rising on the news. Southern fell 15 cents to $45.82, reversing an initial decline once the court decision was announced. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the largest U.S. coal producer, rose 85 cents to $23.79 in New York trading. The cross-state rule, issued in July 2011, is just one of a suite of regulations the EPA has proposed to curb pollution from coal-fired power plants. While the other rules won’t go into effect soon, and also face legal challenges of their own, together they are forcing power producers to install control technologies and cut the pollution they emit. In yesterday’s ruling, the court ordered the agency to continue to enforce a similar rule issued in 2005 until a viable replacement can be issued. The EPA has already begun to do this; however, a different panel of appeals court judges in 2008 ordered the EPA to rework that rule, saying it was too weak. Conflicting Mandates The government may need to go back and ask the full Court of Appeals or Supreme Court to sort out these conflicting legal mandates, said David Marshall, a senior counsel at the Clean Air Task Force, who represented environmental groups in this case. AEP, the largest U.S. coal consumer, said the air-quality goals that cross-state rule targeted would be achieved by the 2005 rule. The earlier regulation’s emission limits aren’t as tough as the Obama-era rule, and it allows producers to trade pollution credits, easing the burden on some smaller plants. “We are willing to move forward to make additional emission reductions, but we believe it can be done in a more reasonable way,” Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for Columbus, Ohio- based AEP, said in an e-mail. Sulfur dioxide can lead to acid rain and soot emissions harmful to humans and ecosystems, and nitrogen oxide is a component of ground-level ozone, a main ingredient of smog. Coal accounts for 98 percent of sulfur dioxide and 92 percent of nitrogen oxides released into the air by power plants, according to the EPA. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-22/coal-plants-victory-over-epa-is-muted-by-low-gas-prices.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345640213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:56:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345640224000-28</Id><Topic><Title>Coal Plants’ Victory Over EPA Is Muted by Low Gas Prices</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345640213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:56:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Undue Burden Among the power companies challenging the rule were Southern, EME Homer City Generation LP, a unit of Edison International, and Energy Future Holdings Corp. units in Texas.

The cases were consolidated by the court. For Republican lawmakers, who have accused President Barack Obama’s EPA for waging a “war on coal,” the ruling was welcomed as a much-needed reprieve. The cross-state rule “is just one of several new EPA rules targeting America’s power sector that together will cost our economy tens of billions of dollars and put thousands of jobs at risk,” Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement. “The EPA is an agency out of control.” Mercury Rules AEP and Southern say they will need to spend billions of dollars complying with the EPA rule issued in December that forces them to curb mercury and other air toxic emissions. That rule is one of the most expensive regulations ever issued, and applies to every coal plant in the country. Southern, based in Atlanta, already spent more than $8 billion on pollution controls and plans to invest at least $1.5 billion more through 2015, Southern spokesman Tim Leljedal said in a phone interview. Southern now burns more natural gas than coal. Any future EPA rule on cross-state pollution, “may have minimal regulatory impact” given related requirements from the mercury standard, Christine Tezak, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners LLC, said in a research note. The EPA also proposed rules for greenhouse gases from power plants, a regulation that power companies warn will preclude the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Gas Prices Natural gas matched coal as the primary fuel for U.S. power generation in April for the first time since the government started collecting data, as natural gas prices reached a 10-year low that month. Electricity generated from natural gas is expected to increase 23 percent this year in the U.S., while coal-fueled power falls 12 percent, according to an Aug. 7 Energy Department report. Energy Future Holdings Corp., the biggest power generation owner in Texas, said in September 2011 the cross-state rules would force its Luminant division to shut two coal-fired units that produce 1,200 megawatts, close nearby coal mines and fire 500 workers. After the cross-state rule was stayed in December, the company put those plans on hold. “There will be no layoffs or facilities closures,” Allan Koenig said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “We will continue to face pressure created by other regulations affecting power plants, as well as low power prices in the state.” The case is EME Homer City Generation LP v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 11-1302, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345640224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345641392000-29</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Worth $500Mil Pays A Lousy $3 Mil in Taxes</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1345582836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:00:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typical shallow liberal thinking.

LARSON,Edmonton Sun First posted: Tuesday, August 21, 2012 07:25 PM MDT | Updated: Tuesday, August 21, 2012 10:27 PM MDT A proposed upgrader at the Kitimat terminal of the Northern Gateway — and the much-maligned pipeline itself — are getting definite interest from cities in northern B.C. That’s despite provincial hostility to the project from B.C. Premier Christy Clark, who threw down the gauntlet at last month’s Council of Federation in Halifax. British Columbia newspaper-tycoon David Black and his proposed $13 billion upgrader could reverse the economic decline in the northwestern port town where losses of a mill and a plant have decimated the labor force and separated families, said Kitimat Mayor Mayor Joanne Monaghan after polling city councillors Monday night. Black came and talked with the city’s economic development officer first, then met with the Kitimat city council a few weeks ago. Adding the value of refining to Alberta bitumen before sending it to Asian markets makes environmental and economic sense, providing the science is good, she said. “Their feeling is that it’s good if we use natural resources and value-add them instead of shipping it out — and we’ll wait for the review. This project would be good for Kitimat and Terrace and the entire regional district and the entire northwest if it would be environmentally sound and it would go ahead,” Monaghan said. “It’s the most logical place. We’re close to water, we’re right on the rail — why would you want to put it any other place?” Monaghan has a long history of active service on local and regional issues. She was chair of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine for eight years, president of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) for two terms, and president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities for one term. During her UBCM tenure a “Protocol Agreement” was signed by the Province of British Columbia to recognize all municipal and regional governments as levels of government. The provincial government is now bound by protocol and legislation to consult municipalities and regional districts before considering legislation affecting them. Kitimat bills itself as a “successful competitor for new global trade,” touting $30 billion in new investment in a decade, including an aluminum smelter expansion, liquid natural gas export facilities and green power developments. The fact is that the loss of a mill and a methanol plant within the past few years were hard on Kitimat, taking the population down to about 8,500 — a far cry from a bustling 15,000 when Monaghan came to town four decades ago. http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/08/21/bc-town-shows-interest-in-gateway-pipline-upgrader</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345642135000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:28:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345642147000-31</Id><Topic><Title>B.C. town interested in pipeline upgrader</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345642135000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:28:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Currently the town’s population is about 10,000 — but the upgrader’s reported 6,000 construction jobs for five years, and then 3,000 full-time staffers and private contractors to operate it, brings a heady promise of jobs to lure families back to town. “We’re hoping they will come back. We were splitting up families — the men had to leave and get jobs,” Monaghan said. On the street in downtown Kitimat, Monaghan said she hears both opposition and support for the upgrader. The town has been economically depressed, so the new project offers help for families with kids to put through school, she said. Environmental lobbyists have railed against bitumen’s “heavy oil” weight that would make it sink to the bottom in case of a spill instead of forming a slick atop the water that’s easier to clean up. Refining the bitumen in Kitimat could help mitigate the dangers of carrying it via tankers to Asia as well as for residents who make their living with tourism, crustacean farms and fishing and even Monaghan’s own helicopter adventure company along the 110 kilometres of channel leading to Kitimat’s inland port. “It keeps the bitumen tankers out of the channel, which was a very important issue,” she said, quick to add that the science touted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper as the determining factor for the Northern Gateway is critical. “I think science is always important and I think we always have to look at environmental reviews,” Monaghan said.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345642147000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:29:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345642497000-32</Id><Title>First Nations must be partners, not an afterthought - national chief Assembly of First Nations</Title><Msg>First Nations must be partners, not an afterthought Shawn Atleo The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Aug. 22 2012, 2:00 AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Aug. 21 2012, 7:02 PM EDT The debate over the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline has vaulted First Nations people and their rights to the forefront of the national discussion on energy, the environment and resource development. This is fitting. Our lands are the backbone of the Canadian economy. Yet we have often been seen only as an obstacle or afterthought to development (when we were seen at all). Now we have an opportunity and impetus to reconcile our rights and interests and reap benefits for all Canadians. The Northern Gateway project is capturing headlines, but it is only one of many major projects planned or under way, projects worth hundreds of billions in economic activity. All these projects are located in or near First Nations’ traditional territories. Any project that could affect their lands or lives requires their consent. This is what we agreed to in treaties and it is a reality in Canadian law. The old approach of limited, back-end consultation must be swept away. It only leads to frustration, injunctions and conflict. The new standard, as articulated in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is “free, prior and informed consent.” From a practical standpoint, this means “engage early and engage often” with First Nations – right from conception to the last spike. Business and industry increasingly understand this. In July, the Canadian Council of Chief Executives called for “stronger partnerships” with First Nations, citing a spectrum of positive, mutually beneficial approaches. We also see new trends toward “localnomics” – with increasing energy costs and new technologies, there is tremendous value and profit in working directly with and for local jurisdictions. Engagement does not guarantee a green light. It must be meaningful and it must respect community values and long-term interests both for their lands and their peoples. Together, we can create the conditions for shared success. First, governments must be prepared to address key, long-standing issues that are holding us back. The federal government must work with First Nations to move away from the Indian Act, to honour and give life to inherent rights, title and treaties. This work is under way, but going slowly. It requires a vigorous commitment from all governments and a national framework based on treaty implementation and rights recognition. Endless negotiation and mounting legal costs on all sides serve no one. Recognizing and implementing clear constitutional duties is a necessary and sound fiscal plan for all of Canada. Some of this work will take time. All the more reason to start now. But there are also immediate, practical steps. We can confirm the requirement for early engagement from local projects to national discussions on a national energy strategy. We pressed this point with premiers at the recent Council of the Federation meeting. We want to review current regulatory frameworks and ensure access and support for First Nations engagement.

We can push past conflict to implementing rights through agreed upon revenue-sharing formulas, reinvestment strategies and clear requirements for engagement and agreements with First Nations before a project proceeds. First Nations look to build capacity and partnerships that support long-term holistic community development plans. This requires approaches that are sustainable, stable and diverse enough to adapt to new requirements for future generations. We see the opportunity and need for greater support locally. Nationally, we can create tools and supports to share models, experiences and best practices for everyone’s benefit. We can unleash the full potential of our people and communities. Our people need employment and training. Our governments want the skills to develop their own proposals for resource revenue sharing, reinvestment funds, environmental monitoring and management. We must support the institutional and governing capacity of First Nations to ensure fairness and sustainability of resource revenues, and transparency and accountability so economic and social benefits flow to all members. Canada’s path to prosperity and productivity continues to run through First Nations territories. But we are the gatekeepers, the original stewards of the land. With increased legal recognition and our unrelenting resilience as peoples, we have re-emerging confidence. There is a new opportunity to foster self-reliance of local economies for the long-term. We insist on respect for the lands, sustainable approaches and a fair share of the benefits of development. We must be full participants and drivers of new sustainable and responsible economic opportunity. This is a path forward to prosperity for all, now and into the future.

It is a simple problem in vector addition. V = V1+ V2 + Vn. Wages are just one item of the vector. There is no difficulty adding them all up. Addition and subtraction is difficult for some, I know, and keeping logical distinct things separate, difficult, I know... The decrease in the tax rate on the wealthy gives you impacts on wages across the economy from managers to workers of different skill levels. The increase in the tax rate on lower skilled workers from social security has an impact on their after-tax wage as well. A lower skilled worker does not have the bargaining power of a manager and is not in a position to get the tax passed through to anyone - but them. New production technology produces an impact on wages as it changes the production processes of firms, and the power of managers to manage far flung enterprises and shift production to low wage areas overseas. Managing a far flung mult-national supply chain is much easier with better computers and communications technology, and much harder with telephones, typewriters, and poor IT tech. The budget was not balanced under the Reagan years, either, thank to Democrat obstruction of spending cuts, and had to be financed by borrowing, much of the money to finance it came from foreigners. Borrowing from foreigners impacts exports, and wages earned in export industries, by reducing how many U.S. products foreigners can buy with the money they earn from selling things to Americans. Foreigners cannot allocate a dollar earned twice: once to buying goods in in America and once to buying U.S. bonds. Yet another red herring argument with poor logic and an irrelevant conclusion by the wayside.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345643669000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345645147000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Defended Stimulus When Bush Wanted It</Title><Username>bankhouseone</Username><Timestamp>1345533469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 03:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The TRUTH hurts these RIGHT WING MAGGOTS !!!!</Msg><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1345645147000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:19:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345648087000-36</Id><Topic><Title>Look out for pulsating orders on XOM stock clever by the experts.</Title><Username>brandihooper870</Username><Timestamp>1345641715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:21:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you all have a point but keep in mind that when you watch your stock hit up</Msg><Username>danielsdirk538</Username><Timestamp>1345648087000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:08:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345648235000-37</Id><Title>ISAAC getting closer</Title><Msg>How will this effect oil prices ?

The National Hurricane Center’s latest report noted Wednesday morning that tropical storm Isaac is getting “better organized” as it nears the U.S. coast. So far, hurricane warnings or watches are in place for areas that include parts of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the report said. It could become a Category I hurricane by Thursday, according to reports. (Also on POLITICO: 10 facts about 'Isaac') Florida could be slammed by early next week, said NBC meteorologist Bill Karins. “It still could be off the coast of Florida or could be down here by Cuba come early Monday morning,” said Karins on MSNBC’s “First Look” Wednesday morning. He added, “Right now … it looks like sometime on Monday, Florida should be dealing with Hurricane Isaac. It looks like a Monday, Tuesday event with all eyes on Tampa and the convention there. There’s going to be a lot of issues with this storm.” (Also on POLITICO: 2012 national conventions) He said that on Sunday, meteorologists will have a much better idea of the direction and strength of Isaac. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn downplayed the threat Wednesday morning, saying that there’s plenty of time to prepare for the possibility of Isaac. “I’m not really worried about this one yet,” Buckhorn said on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “The good thing about living in Florida is, we’re accustomed to this. This is our reality every storm season. So we’ve trained for this … but, you know, we’re monitoring it, we’re watching it, we’re tracking it. I think we’re going to be okay, but we’ll be prepared in the event that it heads this way.” Buckhorn said that safety will come first — going so far as to say that he would cancel or reschedule the convention, if necessary — but he said the experienced staffers working on convention logistics won’t be fazed by weather. “You’ve got some professionals down here that have done 10 or 12 of these conventions. They’re ice cold, nothing bothers them, you know, they know we’re going to deal with our side of it,” Buckhorn said. But, he added, “Obviously public safety is going to trump politics. If we had to make that decision to cancel or to postpone or move the convention, we will do that knowing full well that my obligation and the city’s obligation is to move people out of harm’s way. The politics will take care of itself.” http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79973.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345658771000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345659015000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Look out for pulsating orders on XOM stock clever by the experts.</Title><Username>brandihooper870</Username><Timestamp>1345641715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:21:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm into the XOM DRIP -- buying regularly without any fees.

After an initial increase of 32 cents per gallon on August 7, spot prices in Los Angeles for California-specification Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (CARBOB) have fallen 18 cents per gallon to $3.09 per gallon on August 21, a discount to similar prices in New York Harbor (Figure 1). Although press stories indicate that the crude distillation unit at the Richmond refinery is expected to remain offline for four to six months, reports that gasoline-producing units at the Richmond refinery will continue to run using gasoil feedstocks transported from other sources, along with news that other West Coast refineries were increasing gasoline production, appear to have mitigated its impact on wholesale gasoline prices. This situation contrasts with that following the earlier outage at BP's Cherry Point, Washington refinery, when CARBOB traded at a large premium to gasoline in New York Harbor for an extended interval. The price response to both the Richmond and Cherry Point outages highlights the special sensitivity of the West Coast gasoline market to supply disruptions. Unlike other U.S. markets, which are interconnected by pipelines and river systems, the West Coast liquid fuels market is relatively isolated and largely supplied by in-region refinery production. Through May of this year, West Coast refinery production supplied 80 percent of the almost 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of gasoline consumed in the region (Figure 2). Additionally, while there are 23 refineries in PADD 5 (exclusive of Hawaii and Alaska), and 2.6 million bbl/d of operable refinery capacity, four large refineries, each with an operable capacity greater than 200,000 bbl/d, account for almost 40 percent of the region's total crude oil distillation capacity. Both the Richmond and Cherry Point refineries are in this group. Assuming a typical gasoline yield of about 50 percent, an outage at a 245,000-bbl/d refinery (the average size of the four biggest West Coast refineries) has the potential to remove more than 120,000 bbl/d of gasoline from the market. Given that the West Coast market depends heavily on in-region production, and given that a small number of large refineries contribute major shares of that production, a single unplanned refinery outage can have a dramatic impact on supply.

It still will collapse as the demand erosion will be relentless as the lower income groups see their income decline even more as taxes rise going forward.

Those giving it guarded backing include Kitimat City Council. Mayor Joanne Monahan said Wednesday she could support the refinery plan because it would bring jobs to the north coast while avoiding the shipment of thick, tarry bitumen by tanker through B.C.’s treacherous coastal waters. Ms. Monahan has remained silent on the controversial Northern Gateway pipeline proposed by Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. that would end in Kitimat. I think it’s a healthy development even if it doesn’t come to fruition . In corporate Vancouver, the plan is attracting lots of commentary and is seen as worthy of a close look, said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president and chief policy officer at the Business Council of Business Columbia. “I think it’s a healthy development even if it doesn’t come to fruition,” he said. “It’s interesting and it adds a dimension to the whole discussion around economic development in the energy sector.” And according to Neil Godbout, managing editor of the Prince George Citizen, the plan, proposed by Mr. Black and his company, Kitimat Clean Ltd., is “crazy” but also “tantalizing,” as it addresses Premier Christy Clark’s desire to gain further financial benefits from the Northern Gateway pipeline and would position the province as a major player in the global refining business. “Regardless of whether Kitimat Clean ever sees the light of day, Black’s plan is a bold suggestion to turn a problem into an opportunity, rather than just opposing the pipeline without offering alternatives,” Mr. Godbout writes. Mr. Black, a successful B.C. entrepreneur, said last Friday he wants to submit an environmental assessment application for a 550,000 barrel-per-day refinery to process all the output of the Northern Gateway pipeline. The refinery would be specifically designed to process Alberta heavy crude oil from the oil sands and sell refined products in Asia. Mr. Black is convinced the refinery would reduce the threat of offshore pollution from an oil spill because transportation of refined fuels is safer and is looking for financial backers. Related Media tycoon David Black proposes $13B refinery for Northern Gateway oil Oil sands producers could feel squeeze in crowded market The plan would be the first significant B.C.-grown initiative to take advantage of oil and gas opportunities emerging in the province. The discovery of immense shale gas resources, plans for at least three major liquefied natural gas export terminals, and plans for two major oil sands pipelines, are turning B.C. into one of North America’s hottest energy regions. Yet not a single major energy industry player is based in the province. http://business.financialpost.com/2012/08/22/media-mogul-david-blacks-kitimat-refinery-proposal-stirring-b-c-energy-debate/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345680331000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:05:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345680346000-68</Id><Topic><Title>Media mogul David Black’s Kitimat refinery proposal stirring B.C. energy debate</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345680331000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:05:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The vast majority of decisions are made in corporate headquarters in Calgary and elsewhere around the world, from the United States to Asia. The void is no doubt contributing to the backlash against the oil pipeline schemes, pitting B.C.-based environmental and aboriginal groups against what are perceived as outside interests. The void may also explain why oil and gas has not been seen as a platform for value-added growth. Rather than capitalize on its natural gas resources to power its economy, the provincial government has implemented aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets that discourage its use, said Mr. Finlayson. “One of the things missing in B.C. is any discussion about what are the value added opportunities around natural gas development,” Mr. Finlayson said. “We actually have a policy regime in B.C. that says we don’t want to use natural gas as a domestic energy source or as a feedstock for manufacturing. It’s an odd position to take for a jurisdiction that is drowning in natural gas, when all around the world jurisdictions are rushing to take advantage of the bounty.” The Western World has all the refinery capabilities they need . Mr. Finlayson said the refinery proposal is unusual for B.C., where “you rarely hear of anybody who is contemplating building new large greenfield industrial facilities. It shows the whole narrative around value added industrial development tends to be rather impoverished here on the West Coast.” Meanwhile, the province, once a refinery hot bed, has seen more shutdowns than any other region in the country. Five refineries closed in the province in the last 30 years. The two remaining refineries, one run by Chevron Corp. and the other by Husky Energy Inc., are small and account for only 3% of Canadian production, according to a report by the Conference Board of Canada on the challenges faced by the country’s refining sector. Would a massive, independent refinery focused on Asian exports do better? Unlikely, based on today’s economics and existing plans. Bill Simpkins, spokesman for the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, said refinery plans are floated often as a way to promote economic development, but get discarded when there is a fuller understanding of the tough environment. Calgary-based expert Michael Ervin, principal of MJ Ervin &amp; Associates, said the plan is not feasible and is unlikely to attract investors. Demand for petroleum products in North America is declining, while markets in Asia are building huge plants that will exceed demand for a long time, resulting in a soft market for refined products, Mr. Ervin said. Columba Yeung, CEO of Calgary-based Value Creation Group, which has worked on various oil sands development and upgrading plans, said shipping products is expensive, refining is more expensive than assumed by Mr. Black, and margins are very volatile. “The Western World has all the refinery capabilities they need,” he said. “Developing and emerging economies want the refineries in their lands.” Yet refineries in Atlantic Canada have increased their capacity and are exporting petroleum products abroad. North Atlantic Refining in Come by Chance, Nfld., produces 115,000 barrels a day and is owned by Korea National Oil Corp. Irving Oil owns Canada’s largest refinery in New Brunswick, with the capacity to produce 300,000 barrels a day.

David Black, whose Black Press Ltd runs 150 newspapers in Canada and the United States, last week said he wants to build what would be Canada's largest refinery at Kitimat, British Columbia, near the planned terminus of Enbridge's planned 525,000 barrel-per-day Northern Gateway line. Black, who has spent a year studying the potential of a refinery capable of processing 550,000 barrels of crude per day, said he sees the facility as a way to lower the environmental risks of shipping heavy crudes from Canada's oil sands by tanker and to provide jobs in the province's north. Black, whose company Clean Kitimat Ltd is looking to complete environmental studies at the facility site over the next two years, said he is certain the refinery will be profitable. "Is it economic? Yes it is," Black said in an interview. "The budget is pretty solid I think. I employed two different consultants and they came up with basically the same numbers and I ran them by one of the big oil companies and they confirmed the numbers." Black's plan is the latest twist in the Northern Gateway saga, which has pitted governments against each other, riled many aboriginal communities in British Columbia and dominated headlines in Canada. Under current plans, tankers would take diluted bitumen from an oil port at Kitimat and ship it to California and across the Pacific. While Black will pay the costs of the environmental studies, he is looking for investors willing to fund construction of the massive refinery. While no company has yet stepped forward to back the proposal, he expects there will be more interest as his plans move forward. "I want to prove to them I can get the permits and that will remove a lot of the question marks around this," Black said. "And the second thing I want to do is more work on the offshore marketing of the refined fuels ... and talk to the oil patch about getting contracts with them. Once I've done that then the whole thing is financeable." Most of the fuel produced at the site is expected to go to Asian markets. http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL2E8JMEPY20120822?sp=true</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345680625000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345680639000-70</Id><Topic><Title>New Canadian oil refinery to be profitable: backer</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345680625000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:10:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The plant would produce 240,000 barrels a day of diesel, 100,000 of gasoline and 50,000 of kerosene or aviation fuel, from 550,000 bpd of diluted oil sands bitumen. The diluent, an ultra light oil, would be stripped from the bitumen and shipped back to Alberta. Construction would start in 2014 and take six years. Black also said he does not expect construction costs to exceed his C$13 billion forecasts. He plans to have most of the facilities modules built in Asia then shipped to Kitimat for assembly at the site. "The consultants built in quite a contingency (to the cost estimate)," he said. "The price will go up or down depending on the current price of steel, but the whole approach here is to tender as much of the construction as we can offshore, to low wage areas that are technically competent." Enbridge has not commented on the proposal other than to say it remains committed to the regulatory process for reviewing Northern Gateway, which would move oil sands heavy crude over a 1,177-km (731-mile) route. If built, the refinery would be larger than Irving Oil Ltd's 300,000 bpd refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick, now Canada biggest, and one of the largest anywhere. "It's a big refinery," Black said. "We are talking about revenues in the order of C$22 billion a year. It would be one of the 10 biggest in the world." &#127;($1 = $0.99 Canadian)</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345680639000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:10:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345681150000-71</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Policy Beats Up The Poor &amp; Women</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1345660596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:36:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Facts?

Here were are talking about changes. V1, V2,...,Vn individually describe the changes caused by the economic impact factors 1,2,...,n you are interested in analyzing. 1 can be called the change in the tax rate on the wealthy, and V1 = (dx,dy,dz,...,dn) describes the changes to upper class wages = dx, middle class wages dy, lower class wages dz, up to n changes to as many desired groups as desired from the change in tax rate on the wealthy. 2 can called "moving jobs out of the country" and 3 another factor impacting the economy up to n factors. You add the vectors together and the resulting vector describes the cumulative changes to upper class wages, middle class wages, lower class wages, up to n other changes flowing from the factors analyzed. "If these jobs came back just when the tax on the wealthy returned to previous rates, would wages and employment still decrease?" The change in the tax on the wealthy is not why the jobs were moved out of the country. The factors causing that are independent of the tax rate on the wealthy, which is assumed in the vector analysis above to categorize the factors clear, and it is a sufficient condition for the cost of production to be lower in a foreign locale than a U.S. locale to warrant and firing of a the American workers. The increase in profit certainly impacted the wages of the upper class when the managers and shareholder's divided the gains, and it impacted the other groups to lesser degrees as it trickled down to them. If the wealthy's tax rate had not been cut during the Reagan years that would have only have perpetuated the situation of high pass through of high taxes placed on them to lower wages and benefits flowing to others in the corporate structure showing up there as low wages and benefits as a proportion of total wages and nominally as well. The improvement in tax rates no doubt mitigated some of the reductions in lower skilled wages, coming from automation and off-shoring... Perhaps someday you will be able to understand these impacts.

The need for growth due to interest The essential conclusion from this is: If interests are too low, money circulation by lending it is interrupted. Money is accumulated (hoarded). Following this, money circulation - and consequently the economy - collapse or at are least badly affected, in case real interest rates sink below the liquidity advantage of about 2% to 3% or only gets close to this point. Neither the state nor the credit owners nor entrepreneurs are really interested in letting this happen. Consequently the state and the credit owners and the entrepreneurs try to increase money demand by different measures in order to increase interest rates, even though no real additional demand exists, i.e. even though real needs can already be satisfied by current economy. Measures undertaken by the state are: - Increase of demand by increasing money supply, which leads immediately to inflation as the increased money supply has no increased Gross National Product as counterpart. - Artificial increase of demand, especially for goods where no real demand exists: e.g. arms, space travel, nuclear power and many other big projects, which very often result in serious ecological damage as well. Measures undertaken by capital owners are: - To create new demands of consumers with the extensive use of advertising. This leads finally to an economic growth which is not based on its original function, the satisfaction of needs. On the contrary it leads to unnecessary growth, induced by artificially created wishes. Economic growth is therefore not induced by demand in order to satisfy needs, but by increasing supply, which has to be consumed by an artificially increased demand. http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~roehrigw/gloetzl/howand.htm</Msg><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1345685482000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 21:31:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345685985000-77</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1345603067000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:37:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You used exiting jobs from the Country to break the link between reduced tax on the wealthy without job numbers and wage increases. --- if you decipher that garbage into the vector V1 (impact of lower taxes on wealthy) what you have dz = e &gt;0 expressing wage increases for low income workers caused by reduced pass through of taxes from the upper income managers to them.

The question is, why have you introduced external circumstances to prove your equation correct (when real events seem to indicate the equation is wrong), but then attempt to use the same equation in its reverse, without admitting that other external forces could also present a real case where reintroducing the higher wealthy's tax rate does not decrease jobs and wages?

Having clearly defined terms and concepts, even complicated relationships become comprehensible. Unclear definitions can even muddle simple facts and relationships. Someone coming from other fields of endeavor and starts to learn about money matters will be amazed at the double talk which is prevailing in these circles. Somewhere changes in the general level of prices get mixed up with the change of single prices and even get subsumed under the term inflation. Elsewhere profit, earnings, interest, yield and surplus value are used for the same as for different phenomena. And then checks and credit-cards are called »money« or bank notes and coins are put together with deposits and declared as »amount of money«. The stated reason is that the transfer from account to account can balance a claim, just as a change of hands with money. What would we think of tradesmen, if they comprised nails, screws and fasteners within the term »glue« just because all of them can be used to fix two pieces of wood in a similar way as with glue? Even laymen would rightfully tell them that they are confusing everybody including themselves. In the following we will try therefore to shed some clarity on the conceptions and functions around money, even though antiquated and deeply engraved thinking habits have to be challenged. http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~roehrigw/creutz/geldsyndrom/english/chap1.html</Msg><Username>riskgrowswithprice</Username><Timestamp>1345691325000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345692819000-84</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Kinda Guys..</Title><Username>walhieeeee</Username><Timestamp>1345692491000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an incredibly stupid post!
