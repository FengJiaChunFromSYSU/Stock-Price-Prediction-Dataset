Guam Weather Central called the storm of apparently weak intensity "Louise" and put out the first weather advisory on it at 041200Z, with further advisories following at intervals of six hours. Up to that time of the 16th advisory (080600Z), the storm was following a fairly predictable path to the NW, and was expected to pass between Formosa and Okinawa and on into the East China Sea. At this time, however, the storm began to veer sharply to the right and head north for Okinawa. The 17th advisory at 081200Z (081100I) showed this clearly, and units began to be alerted for the storm late in the evening of the 8th. The forecast for Okinawa was for winds of 60 knots, with 90 knot gusts in the early morning of 9 October, and passage of the center at 1030(I)..... Conditions on shore were no better. Twenty hours of torrential rain soaked everything, made quagmires of roads, and ruined virtually all stores. The hurricane winds destroyed from 50% to 95% of all tent camps, and flooded the remainder. Damage to Quonset huts ran from 40% to 99% total destruction. Some of these Quonsets were lifted bodily and moved hundreds of feet; others were torn apart, galvanized iron sheets ripped off, wallboarding shredded, and curved supports torn apart. Driven from their housing, officers and men alike were compelled to take shelter in caves, old tombs, trenches, and ditches in the open fields, and even behind heavy road-building machinery, as the wind swept tents, planks, and sections of galvanized iron through the air.... The storm center of typhoon "Louise" passed Buckner Bay at about 1600, from which time until 2000 it raged at peak strength. The storm was advancing at the rapid rate of 15 knots in a northerly, then northeasterly, direction, and by 2000 the center was 60 miles away. The winds gradually began to subside. Conditions in Buckner Bay were at this time somewhat improved by the wind's having veered to the northwest across the land mass of Okinawa, which reduced the size of the seas, and probably saved many more damaged ships from being driven off the reefs and sunk in deep water. Nevertheless, the subsidence at 2000 was a relative one, from "super-typhoon" to typhoon conditions, with steady winds of 80 and 60 knots throughout the night, and some gusts of higher velocity. A wild, wet, and dangerous night was spent by all hands, afloat or ashore. It was not until 1000 on the 10th that the winds fell to a steady 40 knots and rains slackened. Having left Okinawa, the storm proceeded NNE on a curving track. Ships of occupation groups anchored in Amami O Shima anchorage had a rough time, with winds over 70 knots; and Japan, from Nagasaki to Tokyo, was alerted for the storm. On the night of 10-11 October, "Louise" ran into cold air from over Japan; as a result the center of the typhoon occluded, moved aloft to the north, and eventually dissipated. Our forces from Nagasaki to Wakayama experienced winds of 40 to nearly 60 knots on the 11th and 12th. Ships at sea were enabled to maneuver clear of the worst of the storm, and sustained only minor damage, despite heavy seas. This ended typhoon "Louise", but the damage it left behind on Okinawa was tremendous. Approximately 80% of all housing and buildings were destroyed or made unusable. Very little tentage was salvageable, and little was on hand as a result of previous storms. Food stocks were left for only 10 days. Medical facilities were so destroyed that an immediate request had to be made for a hospital ship to support the shore activities on the island....</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355930895568</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 10:28:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355931084272-10</Id><Topic><Title>It Took Sleazy Republicans 4 Days To Promote More Gun Sales</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1355927636634</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:33:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harry Truman's decision to drop the bomb was correct.

A Prussian Junker, like European aristocracy broadly, saw the role of government in a very paternalistic way. In short the people had to be guided, because if they were left to their own devices they would not succeed. Long experience showed what they would do. They would wallow in mud and reed huts and scratch a living off the land like pigs, or fall prey to the schemes of moneylenders who knew just how to manipulate them, or find their lands pillaged and ruined either by each other, or some other rabble from across the hill or dale...They would throw their waste in the street or build in wood and straw when stone and brick was better. They needed to be guided to civilization and better ways of living. It was only natural for the leaders to build schools, and universities, and set the elite to work figuring out how better living could be accomplished. Military academies were important too, and powerful police forces, and courts. American Progressives found much to admire in such an approach. The Southern planters' way of many liberties (for themselves and for obvious reasons) or the Corporate Raiders' way of many liberties (so they could take advantages of the stupidity of others) was a non-starter...</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355936581624</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 12:03:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355936909683-20</Id><Topic><Title>It Took Sleazy Republicans 4 Days To Promote More Gun Sales</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1355927636634</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:33:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wahleeeee, you are one sick puppy.

You really don't get it.... The Northern United States has been leading the USA's economy since before the Civil War. It's like an alien plant in your version of the USA - one right out of Europe. Government public education, copied directly from Germany, government universities, government services that make cities that dwarf entire southern states possible. The Americans who oppose you thought of a name for it – Progressive, as in an improvement over what was before… Government control of the financial system with central banks - European/Progressive. A spreading Federal government copied almost exactly from the aspirations of European right-wingers by good little American students. The system has the appearance of being Democratic - as long as the mob picks whichever brand of progressive medicine is on sale. The libertarians elect the occasional buffoon - no system is perfect. As for Europe, where what you hate comes from. Europeans don't need your brand of tripe either, and most are richer than you will ever be.

EIA observed that developers planned more installations to take advantage of the credit as the year progressed. As of Nov. 30, EIA noted about half of the new planned wind power capacity this year has yet to come into service, but should be operational by Dec. 31 when the credit is scheduled to end. “If all planned wind generators for 2012 come on line, as reported by industry participants, wind capacity additions could top 12,000 MW (megawatts) for this year. This would account for 45 percent of total additions and exceed capacity additions from any other fuel source, including natural gas, which was the leading fuel source for electric generating capacity additions in 2010 and 2011,” EIA said. Wind turbines must be generating power by that Dec. 31 deadline in order to get a 2.2-cent per kilowatt-hour credit. The wind industry and its congressional allies are fighting to get it extended one year. EIA said the spike in installations this year was consistent with other years when the credit faced expiration. In December 2011, EIA said about 5,000 megawatts of new wind capacity was anticipated for 2012. That figure rose every quarter thereafter, with a final expectation of more than 12,000 megawatts of new generating capacity this year. Fiscal conservatives say the rush in activity to complete shows wind power is not competitive with other energy industries. They argue the federal government cannot afford to prop up wind, especially given the deficit situation. The credit’s supporters say it has helped bring the wind industry closer to self-sufficiency. They call the industry a boon for job growth, drawing upon a wind industry-commissioned study that says axing the credit would eliminate 37,000 jobs. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), the main wind trade group, last week suggested extending the credit one year and then phasing it out after five. It said wind would be cost-competitive with other energy sources by the end of that timeframe. AWEA wants to make sure the one-year extension includes a key language change. Wind projects would only need to be under construction — rather than in service — by Dec. 31, 2013, to get the credit for a 10-year period. That would come with a $12.1 billion cost though 10 years. For now, the credit’s fate is wrapped up in “fiscal cliff” talks between President Obama and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Boehner’s “Plan B” package to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases did not include any energy tax credit extensions. Still, energy insiders expect the wind credit to get a one-year extension. Most of the nation’s wind installations lie in GOP districts, helping attract vocal Republican backers for the credit’s extension. A good many other House Republicans have not weighed in on the issue. In the upper chamber, the Senate Finance Committee already has approved a $205 billion tax-extenders package that includes the wind credit. Obama also pledged to extend the credit during the campaign, raising the issue often in wind-heavy swing states such as Iowa and Colorado. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/273723-eia-threat-of-losing-tax-credit-drives-wind-installations</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355942559261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:42:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355942699560-35</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Hypocrisy Regarding Arming Teachers</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1355929294577</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 10:01:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It doesn't surprise me, wahleee boy, that you don't know what right wing means either.

The full conversation follows. TIME: So we’ll start right in. In fact, we’re going to go so far ahead. If we were sitting here four years from now and you were looking back on what your legacy is as a two-term Democratic President — we know what Ronald Reagan did and we know what FDR did — what would you want people to say about your two terms? THE PRESIDENT: I think what I’d want people to say is that having come in at a time when our economy was on the brink of collapse, when we had gone through a decade in which middle-class families were doing worse and worse, and the ladders of opportunity into the middle class for people who were willing to work hard had begun to deteriorate; at a time when, internationally, we were embroiled in two wars but our leadership around the world was being questioned, that we had steered this ship of state so that we once again had an economy that worked for everybody; that we had laid the foundation for broad-based prosperity; and that internationally we had created the framework for continued American leadership in the world throughout the 21st century, while recognizing that the world is changing and that we should encourage the kind of growth and development in other parts of the world, but over the long term will be good for us and good for the world. (PHOTOS: New, Never-Before Seen Photos Inside the Obama Administration) So I think about this eight-year project as one in which domestically on education, on energy, on tax policy, on manufacturing, on research and science we have gotten our — we’ve shaken off some ongoing problems that have hampered our growth, we have reasserted the idea that if you work hard in this country, you can make it. And that we’ve also accommodated all the demographic changes, andcultural and technological changes that are taking place, and been able to marry those with some of the old-fashioned virtues of hard work and discipline and responsibility — all in a way that allows us to succeed and to thrive, and not just for a few at the top, but for the many. I had a question about one part of the exit polls — that one of the things that came out comparing 2012 to 2008 is that numbers saying they think the government should be doing more versus the government is already doing too much dropped a bit. I mean, there’s a different feeling. And what you just laid out, a lot of that is the government doing more to bring fairness to the economy — a fair shot, fair share. How do you interpret that result? Well, I’m not arguing for government to do more; I’m arguing for government to do more of the right thing. So I haven’t been arguing for greater government spending per se. I think it makes sense for us to spend less on wars and more on research and development. In sectors like energy, I haven’t been arguing for more spending per se; I’ve been arguing that it doesn’t make sense for us to spend $4 billion subsidizing an oil industry that’s mature and very profitable. We should be using that money to finance clean energy of the future. So some of this is how do we prioritize what government does in a way that fills the holes, the gaps that the market may not be able to address and that creates platforms and toolkits for individuals to succeed. And I think that’s true within government operations. We’ve spent a lot of time over the last several years having every agency go back and look at what are the existing regulations on the books. And if the regulations don’t work, let’s get rid of them. On the other hand, given the better science and knowledge that we have now, there may be some new regulations that do make sense. And, certainly, when it comes to the financial industry or the health care industry, I think we learned a lesson from 2007 and 2008 that a lack of smart regulation can be just as damaging as too much regulation. I wanted to ask you, Mr. President, about the film Lincoln. We know that you gathered a group to see it here. And for me watching that movie, it was as if I had spent three hours with Lincoln. And I wondered how — it was a very emotional experience. And I wondered how you felt watching that movie. What was it like for you to spend that time with Lincoln? Well, first of all, Daniel Day-Lewis was sitting next to me, or right behind me. (Laughter.) And so, even after the movie, I felt like I was still hanging out with Lincoln. He was masterful in that role. I think it’s well publicized that Lincoln is my favorite President, and so to see an intimate depiction of him in his work and the challenges that faced him even in a relatively compressed period of time was incredibly powerful. I think it’s generally a good idea for any President not to compare himself to Lincoln. (Laughter.) And so the magnitude of his challenges and the magnitude of his gifts are of a different scope and scale of any subsequent President. I do think that there are lessons to be drawn. Part of what Lincoln teaches us is that to pursue the highest ideals and a deeply moral cause requires you also engage and get your hands dirty. And there are trade-offs and there are compromises. And what made him such a remarkable individual, as well as a remarkable President, was his capacity to balance the idea that there are some eternal truths with the fact that we live in the here and now, and the here and now is messy and difficult. And anything we do is going to be somewhat imperfect. And so what we try to do is just tack in the right direction. And you do understand that as President of the United States, the amount of power you have is overstated in some ways, but what you do have the capacity to do is to set a direction. And you recognize you’re not going to arrive with — you’ll never arrive at that promised land, and whatever seeds you plant now may bear fruit many years later. So being able to project across a very long timeline while still being focused on the immediate tug and pull of politics I think is a useful lesson, and an accurate portrayal of how I think about my work day to day.
