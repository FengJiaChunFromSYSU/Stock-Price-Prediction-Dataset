In remarks during a meeting with Iowa biodiesel and farm industry representatives at the Soy Energy biodiesel production facility in Mason City, the USDA chief pointed to the green fuel as a demonstration of farmers bouncing back, according to this Iowa Biodiesel Board news release. “This is the resilient face of agriculture we see here today,” Vilsack said, flanked by Soy Energy plant workers. “Biodiesel plants like this one are getting America back in the business of manufacturing. They are creating jobs and revitalizing the rural economy.” The Iowa Biodiesel Board thanked the Secretary for his remarks and for his steadfast support of biodiesel. “Iowa’s leadership in renewable energy production shows what we as a nation are capable of in building energy security and green jobs, and we’re equipped to do even more,” said Randy Olson, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board. Those meeting with Vilsack pressed for more gallons of biodiesel under the Renewable Fuel Standard-2 (RFS-2). The EPA wants to go from 1 billion gallons this year to 1.28 billion gallons in 2013, what the Iowa biodiesel industry sees as a modest increase from last year’s record nearly 1.1 billion gallons of production. The Iowa Biodiesel Board points out that Soy Energy, LLC is a “multi-feedstock” plant, capable of producing biodiesel from many different fats and vegetable oils, including corn oil left over from ethanol production. http://www.hoosieragtoday.com/index.php/2012/07/24/ag-chief-says-biodiesel-driving-and-revitalizing-rural-economy/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214026000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:00:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343214237000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Ag Chief says Biodiesel Driving and Revitalizing Rural Economy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214026000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:00:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Truckers not on board with biodiesel increase Province planning diesel-blend hike $1-billion day bolsters Ontario auto sector By: Martin Cash Posted: 1:00 AM | Comments: 0 (including replies) MANITOBA'S trucking industry is far from pumped over the possibility the province may increase the biodiesel mandate to five per cent. Since early 2010, all diesel fuel sold in Manitoba must have an average two per cent blend of biodiesel. The province is at the early stages of considering an increase to that level, something a provincial official said was always part of the plan. According to the provincial government calculations, a five per cent biodiesel mandate in Manitoba will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 56,000 tonnes annually, the equivalent of taking 11,200 cars off the road. But truckers are concerned an increase to the blend might start gumming up engines because biodiesel has been known to get cloudy and gel at very low temperatures. As it is, since biodiesel does not perform well in cold weather, to achieve a two per cent average the fuel companies deliver a blend closer to five per cent in the summer months and much less than two per cent in winter. Bob Dolyniuk, executive director of the Manitoba Trucking Association, said increasing the mandate to five per cent would mean a blend closer to 10 per cent would be sold in the summer. "The problem with that," Dolyniuk said, "is that the diesel engine manufacturers, with the exception of Volvo, will not accept biodiesel over five per cent in their engines." An official with Manitoba Innovation, Energy and Mines (MIEM) said there are no imminent plans to increase the mandate to five per cent. But he said a consultation is likely to start this fall to get a reading from stakeholders. "We have not set any specific dates," said Bob Brennand, a business development project manager for transportation fuels with MIEM. "Engine warranty is a big factor and we appreciate the trucking industry's concerns." Other advocates for more biodiesel use are not so conciliatory to the truckers' concerns. Scott Thurlow, president of the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association, said he does not have all of the information about engine warranty requirements. But he pointed out British Columbia has already increased its average mandate to four per cent. "The trucking industry has put up a barrier every time anyone has made a move on the mandate," Thurlow said. "There really is no demonstrated evidence there is anything to be worried about. If there are warranty concerns, they need to be brought up with the original equipment manufacturers." Dolyniuk said there are plenty of instances where trucks won't start in the cold and need to be brought inside to let the fuel warm up. Although there's no unequivocal evidence such instances can be blamed exclusively on biodiesel affecting the operation, there is plenty of anecdotal concern. "We are not opposed to alternative fuels as an industry," Dolyniuk said. "My board is in support, but there's certain criteria that have to be met." That criteria include: that it is equally or more efficient that diesel; the same price or better than diesel; does not affect operability or the warranty of the equipment; and demonstrates positive environmental impact. The trucking industry argues it should not have to pay the price for economic development incentives to produce biodiesel, noting there are no similar incentives available for truckers. http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/truckers-not-on-board-with-biodiesel-increase-province-planning-diesel-blend-hike-163663136.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214237000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:03:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343214514000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Ag Chief says Biodiesel Driving and Revitalizing Rural Economy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214026000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:00:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>July 24, 2012, 12:27 p.m. EDT New Approach to Growing Waste to Value Industry in United States BDI-BioEnergy and LPCiminelli Form Teaming Relationship BUFFALO, N.Y., July 24, 2012 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Seeking to greatly expand its unique waste-to-value technology in the United States, Austrian-based BDI-BioEnergy International AG has entered into a teaming agreement with nationally-ranked construction firm LPCiminelli, Inc., headquartered in Buffalo, NY. The two companies began working together in 2010 on various BioDiesel and BioGas projects. Since then, there has been a significant increase in waste-to-value interest driven by unstable energy prices, an overall movement towards renewable energy sources and the need to recover valuable fertilizer from organic waste streams. This teaming agreement allows the firms to offer a value proposition to prospective clients of turn-key engineer-design-construct (EPC) services which include process performance guarantees. "The United States is not only the biggest consumer of energy but also by far the biggest producer of waste," said Louis Ciminelli, Chairman &amp; CEO of LPCiminelli. "We knew waste-to-value could be a good business opportunity for our EPC/Solutions group if we teamed with the right technology partner and that partner is BDI." BDI has established itself in Europe already in the 1990's and has since pioneered the areas of MultiFeedstock BioDiesel and BioGas technology. "In the United States, we still find large organic waste streams which go to landfill rather than being turned into renewable electricity or compressed renewable natural gas for transportation as well as valuable fertilizer. Our proven Anaerobic Digestion technology is well established in Europe and meets ample opportunity stateside," says Dr. Edgar Ahn, CSO of BDI-BioEnergy. The two organizations will immediately begin a joint marketing effort touting their combined expertise and approach. http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-approach-to-growing-waste-to-value-industry-in-united-states-2012-07-24</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214514000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:08:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343214851000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Ag Chief says Biodiesel Driving and Revitalizing Rural Economy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214026000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:00:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>7/23/2012 Clean Emission, Oasis Offer Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel in Detroit Detroit-based biodiesel company Clean Emission Fluids Inc. will open fueling stations at the Oasis Trucking Centers in southwest Detroit in the next two weeks, reports Crain's Detroit Business. Clean Emission Fluids and Oasis partnered to form a joint venture, Greenway Fueling LLC, to provide fuel in addition to Oasis's trucking services. The truck center, for which plans have been in the works for two-and-a-half years, will sell diesel and biodiesel to the 400 to 600 trucks use the center daily, as well as to trucks passing through. Clean Emission Fluids has a patent on a biodiesel blending machine that mixes different combinations of diesel and biofuel on site, allowing drivers to use blends specific to their individual vehicles. Drivers will be able to choose from two types of biofuel: biodiesel and renewable diesel. The price of renewable diesel is similar to regular diesel, and the biodiesel costs 50 cents to $1 more per gallon than diesel. According to the California Air Resources Board, renewable diesel is produced by hydrotreatment of the same feedstocks as biodiesel, resulting in a hydrocarbon fuel that is very similar to petroleum diesel in its chemical composition. Also available will be diesel exhaust fluid. The fuel service will be in addition to services such as laundry, showers and coffee drivers have access to when they park their trucks at Oasis, which is surrounded by electric fences, guard dogs, ID scanners and security cameras. Oasis charges drivers $15 a day or $180 a month to park their trucks. Clean Emission Fluids and Oasis have plans for additional complexes and fueling centers along I-75. http://www.truckinginfo.com/news/news-print.asp?news_id=77575</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343214851000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343215749000-5</Id><Title>Hong Kong Tycoon to Pay $1 Billion for British Gas Firm</Title><Msg>http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/hong-kong-tycoon-to-pay-1-billion-for-british-gas-firm/</Msg><Username>Low_Mac</Username><Timestamp>1343215749000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:29:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343222404000-6</Id><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on Exxon Mobil Corporation</Title><Msg>Im in shock!Exxon Mobil Corporation is on the verge of a major change in trend.

In a February 2012 report the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) had considered the impacts of a potential loss of almost 700,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of the Northeast's (PADD 1A and 1B) refining capacity by mid-2012, including Sunoco's Philadelphia refinery (335,000 bbl/d) in addition to ConocoPhillips' Trainer (185,000 bbl/d) and Sunoco's Marcus Hook (178,000 bbl/d) refineries that had closed in September and December 2011. Additionally, a major supplier of imports to the U.S. East Coast, HOVENSA's St. Croix refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands, closed in the first quarter of 2012. The need for the February report arose from the coincident actual and announced closings of these refineries that would have taken place within a year of one another. In a scenario with all three of the Philadelphia-area refineries shut down, EIA estimated an additional 420,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of petroleum products from outside the region would be needed to meet demand. EIA noted sufficient volumes of product would be likely available from Gulf Coast refiners or overseas suppliers to meet this requirement. However, EIA also found that stress on existing product supply infrastructure which had been closely integrated with the local refineries was possible, potentially raising the cost of fuel for consumers in the region. The worst case scenario evaluated in EIA's report has not come to pass. Following the recently formed joint venture between The Carlyle Group and Sunoco, the Sunoco Philadelphia refinery is now expected to remain in operation. In addition, Delta Air Lines has purchased the Trainer refinery and has announced plans to restart it in the third quarter of 2012. With these two refineries in operation, the supply of petroleum products refined in the Northeast region is expected to be much higher than in the scenario EIA considered in its February report, greatly reducing the requirement for additional petroleum products from outside the region. Other developments, including increased product flows into the region from the Midwest (PADD 2) that were identified as a possible outcome in the EIA report and an increased capacity to bring waterborne products into the product pipelines originating in the Philadelphia area, have also contributed to the easing of product supply concerns. Notably, the ability to bring in products to pipelines that feed Pennsylvania and western New York has increased as a result of Sunoco Logistics' Eagle Point Terminal in New Jersey becoming operational. With a connection to the Colonial Pipeline as well as dock capacity to bring in waterborne petroleum products and move them on the pipelines running westward, Eagle Point helps to create a more flexible infrastructure in the region. EIA has updated its calculations of supply requirements for the Northeast markets that appeared in the February report. The previously estimated regional "supply gap" of approximately 420,000 bbl/d for gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) combined that would have resulted from the idling of the three Philadelphia-area refineries is now expected to be just 50,000 bbl/d (Figure 1) of ULSD, with the gasoline gap disappearing almost entirely. The remaining potential ULSD supply gap is largely the result of an expected increase in demand for ULSD because of New York State's requirement that beginning in July 2012, all distillate fuel used for heating purposes be ULSD. http://www.eia.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343243343000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343243373000-13</Id><Topic><Title>This Week In Petroleum July 25, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343243343000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moving about 50,000 bbl/d of additional ULSD to the Northeast should be well within the capacity of existing infrastructure. While global ULSD markets remain tight, the U.S. Gulf Coast is a major center of ULSD production, exporting an average of almost 580,000 bbl/d of ULSD in 2012 through April. Given the recent 55,000-bbl/d expansion of the distillate segment of the southern portion of the Colonial Pipeline, the ability to ship ULSD from the Gulf Coast has increased by more than the updated estimate of additional supply required from outside the region. While the expanded capacity is only on the southern portion of the pipeline, where gasoline and distillate fuels have separate lines, it should help to deliver additional volumes of ULSD on the northern portion of the line (Greensboro, NC to Linden, NJ). However, on the northern portion of the pipeline, gasoline and distillate do not have separate lines. Thus, additional volumes of ULSD moving on the northern portion of the Colonial pipeline could crowd out shipments of other fuels such as gasoline until 2013, when Colonial is expected to complete an expansion on the Greensboro-to-Linden portion of the pipeline. As gasoline is available in greater volumes globally, importing additional barrels should not pose a challenge. It is also possible the Northeast refineries could increase ULSD production, reducing the need for additional supplies from outside the region. For example, The Carlyle Group and Sunoco joint venture announced planned upgrades to the Philadelphia refinery, including the installation of a hydrocracker, that will support higher ULSD yields. While the petroleum product supply picture in the Northeast has definitely brightened, EIA's current analysis is based on projected consumption from EIA's monthly forecasts. If consumption were to deviate significantly from projected levels for any reason, supply requirements would change accordingly. Global ULSD markets remain tight, and attracting supplies to the Northeast means competing with other demand centers, particularly Europe. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices both increase for the 3rd consecutive week The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased seven cents this week to $3.49 per gallon, 21 cents per gallon lower than last year at this time. The average price decreased in the Rocky Mountain region to $3.49 per gallon, down two cents from last week, while prices increased in all other regions. This is the 14th consecutive week that the Rocky Mountain price has decreased, dropping 31 cents since April 16, 2012. The Gulf Coast saw the largest increase, with the price up nine cents to $3.29 per gallon. On the East Coast, the average gasoline price increased eight cents to $3.49 per gallon. In the Midwest, the average gasoline price is $3.48 per gallon, an increase of six cents from last week.

The American Petroleum Institute, in lawsuits filed yesterday and in March, is seeking to overturn an EPA standard mandating the purchase of fuels formulated in part from biological materials including switchgrass, wood chips and agricultural waste. The group claims the regulations include cellulosic fuels that don’t exist. “EPA’s unattainable and absurd mandate forces refiners to pay a penalty for failing to use biofuels that don’t even exist,” Bob Greco, API’s director of downstream and industry operations, said in an e-mailed statement. First passed in 2007, the regulation required refiners to buy 250 million gallons of biofuel annually. Production failed to reach that level and the agency reduced the target to 6.6 million for 2011, and 8.65 million for this year. The Washington-based API, which represents more than 500 oil and gas companies, sued in March challenging the 2012 standard. Oral argument in that case has yet to be scheduled. Today’s lawsuit challenges the 2011 standard. Carlton Carroll, a spokesman for the group, said the cases are “essentially arguing the same thing.” Alisha Johnson, a spokeswoman for the EPA, said in an e- mail that the agency will review the lawsuit and “respond accordingly.” Johnson said the agency was required by law to set the cellulosic standard and offer ways for companies to comply, including the purchase of waiver credits. The case is American Petroleum Institute v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 12-01330; the earlier case is American Petroleum Institute v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 12-1139, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-25/oil-group-files-second-lawsuit-over-epa-biofuel-standards.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343258407000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:20:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343258680000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Oil Group Files Second Lawsuit Over EPA Biofuel Standards</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343258407000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:20:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KiOR receives key registration from EPA July 25, 2012 9:30:14 AM KiOR is one important step closer to putting its products in America's gas tanks.

"With this registration, KiOR's breakthrough cellulosic gasoline will be fueling cars of American consumers this year, providing a truly renewable fuel option that uses only sustainable non-food feedstock, reduces greenhouse gases, creates American jobs, and reduces our dependence on imported oil/ "Our first production facility, scheduled to begin production later this year in Columbus, is creating over 150 new jobs and will yield enough fuel to meet the annual transportation needs of over 20,000 families. This facility demonstrates how the Renewable Fuels Standard and forward-thinking states like Mississippi can combine to make a positive impact on both domestic energy policy and local rural economies." Part 79 registration does not constitute endorsement, certification, or approval by any agency of the United States. KiOR is a development stage, next-generation renewable fuels company that has developed a unique two-step proprietary technology platform to convert abundant and sustainable non-food biomass into cellulosic gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. KiOR's cellulosic fuels may be transported using existing distribution networks and are suitable for use in vehicles on the road today. http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=17944</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343258680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343259374000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Oil Group Files Second Lawsuit Over EPA Biofuel Standards</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343258407000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:20:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clariant opens Germany’s biggest cellulosic ethanol plant Meghan Sapp | July 23, 2012 In Germany, Clariant inaugurated Germany’s biggest pilot plant for the production of cellulosic ethanol from agricultural waste. Located in Straubing, Bavaria and supported by the Bavarian government and the Federal Ministry for Education and Research, the project will produce up to 1,000 tons of cellulose ethanol from around 4,500 tons of wheat straw based on the sunliquid® technology developed by Clariant. It represents an investment of around $34 million. http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/07/23/clariant-opens-germanys-biggest-cellulosic-ethanol-plant/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343259374000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:36:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343259938000-20</Id><Title>Biodiesel Gains New ASTM Standard</Title><Msg>Biodiesel Gains New ASTM Standard Comment on this post Posted by John Davis – July 25th, 2012 In a bid to better meet the needs of customers, the biodiesel industry sought out and gained approval of a new voluntary No. 1-B grade for B100 from the ASTM D2 Committee on Petroleum Products and Lubricants. This news release from the National Biodiesel Board says the new standard will help make the green fuel better for customers with Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) and new diesel engine and after-treatment technology: “The biodiesel industry took a proactive stance to improve the standards governing America’s Advanced Biofuel,” said Joe Jobe, CEO of the National Biodiesel Board. “For the large majority of biodiesel users, the current standard along with conventional industry management practices allow for biodiesel blend use year-round, even in extreme climates.” ASTM D6751, the ASTM standard for pure biodiesel (B100) prior to blending, was modified to create a new voluntary No. 1-B grade. The new grade provides more stringent controls for minor components in raw materials used to make biodiesel, such as vegetable oils and animal fats. The specification values of the current standard will become the No. 2-B grade in D6751 without change. Producers or blenders can continue to utilize the current specification under the No. 2-B grade at any time of the year exactly as done today, or they may opt to use the more stringent No 1-B grade. The finished blended fuel standards—D975 for on/off road diesel up to 5% biodiesel (B5), D7467 for B6-B20 on/off road applications, and D396 for heating oil up to 5% biodiesel—do not change. B100 used for D975, D7467, and D396 must continue to meet D6751 (either the No. 1-B or the No. 2-B grade) prior to blending. The No. 1-B and No. 2-B designations are in line with the current No. 1 and No. 2 diesel fuel categories. This new designation stems from a handful of cases with the new Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuel experiencing un-expected filter clogging above the cloud point of the finished blend. http://domesticfuel.com/2012/07/25/biodiesel-gains-new-astm-standard/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343259938000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:45:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343260374000-21</Id><Title>Maine leads nation with first commercial, grid-tied tidal turbine</Title><Msg>Maine leads nation with first commercial, grid-tied tidal turbine Posted July 25, 2012, at 6:26 a.m. Last modified July 25, 2012, at 6:49 a.m. Maine was at the center of green energy Tuesday as the Ocean Renewable Power Co. launched a major tidal energy project in Cobscook Bay, which is connected to the Bay of Fundy, famous for its tides. The first of several turbines was to be lowered into the water, and the goal is that it will start cranking out the power by Sept. 1. Natural Resources Defense Council energy expert Nathanael Greene notes that the project is “the first in the U.S. to receive a FERC license, negotiate a power purchase agreement, and install and operate a power-producing tidal generator. Initially, it will produce enough energy to power just 75 to 100 homes, but OPRC plans to add more devices and produce enough power for 1,000 homes. And here’s the Department of Energy report on the project. It quotes U.S. Sen. Susan Collins: “Maine is well positioned to lead the nation in tidal energy development. The Cobscook Bay Tidal Energy Project is one example of the type of actions we need on a national scale to stabilize energy, prevent energy shortages, and achieve national energy independence.” According to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, “The Eastport tidal energy project represents a critical investment to ensure America leads in this fast-growing global industry, helping to create new manufacturing, construction, and operation jobs across the country while diversifying our energy portfolio and reducing pollution.” http://bangordailynews.com/2012/07/25/business/maine-leads-nation-with-first-commercial-grid-tied-tidal-turbine/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343260374000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
