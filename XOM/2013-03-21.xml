In that case the Bank of England will owe money that it is forced to pay a higher interest rate on that the assets it owns, becoming a liability for the UK government. The fundamental idiocy and failure of this policy was just noted by a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, and he noted the need for its reversal. The Federal Reserve is following the exact same policy. Their latest grand plan seems to be to hold the debt they have purchased until maturity believing this will remove the risk of loss. That is wrong - they will still be exposed to the same risk because when interest rates move up and caused losses on their bonds they will be paying higher interest charges on the money they have borrowed from their member banks.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1363862823357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 06:47:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363863825773-5</Id><Title>Perhaps Cyprus can phone Obama....</Title><Msg>His government has borrowed about 1000 times as much money as Cyprus is begging from Russia, so what's a bit more? -- you know for the Cause. -- no bad debt should be left unpaid.

Cape Wind Associates called the term sheet agreement with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) a "financing milestone" for the 468-megawatt, 130-turbine farm off the coast of Cape Cod, Mass. The agreement means BTMU will be providing a "significant amount" of debt financing for the project and will also arrange banks for the remaining commercial debt portion of the project, said Cape Wind spokesman Mark Rodgers. The specific amount of debt financing, which will help pay for development and construction costs, could not be disclosed. The company is also in discussions with equity investors, Rodgers said. Today's financing agreement is the first for a project that outside analysts have estimated will cost $2.6 billion. "Obtaining financing is one of the last steps to complete before proceeding with the construction of the project," said Cape Wind President Jim Gordon. "Together with BTMU, we are engaging a group of experienced financial institutions as our core banking group and look forward to completing the financing of America's first offshore wind farm, which will deliver significant environmental, energy and economic benefits to Massachusetts and the surrounding region." Cape Wind said it expects to complete project financing and begin construction by the end of the year, which would qualify it to receive an investment tax credit covering 30 percent of a project's costs.

Big Oil and renewable fuels advocates on Wednesday blamed each other for motorists’ continued pain at the pump. Big oil companies said the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires that ethanol account for at least 10 percent of the 136 billion gallons of gas consumed by U.S. automobiles each year, is driving up fuel prices. The ethanol industry, on the other hand, says Big Oil is trying to divert attention from high gas prices. Because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, they say blaming biofuels is the rhetorical equivalent of a dry hole. Both sides agreed Wednesday that the matter is likely to come before Congress in some manner this year. Renewable energy people want an investigation of oil company pricing. The oil companies want Congress to repeal the six-year-old Renewable Fuel Standard that is the basis for demand for ethanol and biofuels. “We call on Congress to repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard, which is helping to drive up gasoline prices,” said Bob Greco, director of downstream operations for the American Petroleum Institute. ... shreveporttimesDOTcom/article/D2/20130321/NEWS/303210073/Big-Oil-renewable-fuels-advocates-point-fingers-each-other-high-gas-prices</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363905500163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 18:38:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363907568670-14</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH XOM Analyst Report</Title><Username>november_jason</Username><Timestamp>1362658049197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:07:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>sdalewere</Username><Timestamp>1363907568670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 19:12:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363910816062-15</Id><Title>5 companies vie to build wind farms off North Carolina coast</Title><Msg>Published: 08:30 PM, Mon Mar 18, 2013 By Sean Cockerham McClatchy Newspapers WASHINGTON - Five companies are interested in developing wind farms in the ocean off North Carolina, hoping to take advantage of what could be the East Coast's most promising chance to create energy through giant turbines anchored to the sea floor. The idea is embraced by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the Sierra Club alike, who see North Carolina as the next potential center for renewable energy in America. But big obstacles remain before the whirling farms become a reality. Offshore wind is an expensive form of energy, and Congress is losing interest in federal subsidies to encourage it. There are no offshore wind farms in the United States, although they're common in Europe. The federal government asked companies in December if they'd be interested in North Carolina offshore wind development. Five responded positively in filings released Tuesday. One is Virginia Electric and Power Co., part of the Dominion utility that serves Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. "We responded we are interested, but there is a long way to go," Dominion spokesman Dan Genest said. "We are interested. We would like to be a player. There's a lot we have to learn, though." The federal government has to finish an environmental study before auctioning the offshore leases. The agency also needs to decide whether to change the areas considered for wind farms in light of newly released public comments. Those include the assertion of the World Shipping Council, a trade association that represents container vessels, that inviting wind farm proposals off Kitty Hawk, N.C., is "dangerous and imprudent" for shipping. Two potential development areas are between... fayobserverDOTcom/articles/2013/03/19/1244490?sac=foDOTbusiness</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1363910816062</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 20:06:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363917628753-16</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a typical teabagger</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340514110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MY ID SAYS IT ALL. eat my #$%$ max.</Msg><Username>max_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1363917628753</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 22:00:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363917814650-17</Id><Title>MY ID SAYS IT ALL</Title><Msg>MAX ET MY SCHLOOOOONG</Msg><Username>max_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1363917814650</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 22:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363922473381-18</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>sanromanwiliam</Username><Timestamp>1361547275275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:34:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keylogger site from India...........report all these as ABUSE of Yahoo message boards.</Msg><Username>basherbuste_r</Username><Timestamp>1363922473381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363922490958-19</Id><Title>Renewable energy losing its shine in Europe</Title><Msg>BERLIN -- For British entrepreneur Timothy Porter and millions of other Europeans who get generous financial incentives for solar panels, the sun has been very lucrative. Not only does the government pay Porter for producing solar energy he produces, at far higher than the market rate for electricity, but he can also use what he generates for himself. "It's fantastic," he said, admiring the solar panel he installed on the roof of his home in the English West Midlands two years ago. Such subsidies are widespread in Europe, where policymakers say that energy from wind and the sun will stave global temperature increases they blame on the use of fossil fuels like oil and coal. But Europe's debt crisis has many countries worrying more about their bottom line than climate. Governments around the world have watched Europe as it has moved to implement generous subsidy schemes like Porter's to meet ambitious green energy goals and race towards a future free of fossil fuels. But with skyrocketing costs, major infrastructure challenges and biting austerity measures brought on by the debt crisis, some wonder why Europe has gone through the trouble of promising so much green so soon. ​Across the English Channel, Germans consumers are waking up to the costs of going green: As of Jan. 1, they are paying 11% more for electricity than they did last year thanks to government plans to replace nuclear plants with wind and solar power that requires significant and constant public money to be made cost effective. There were a few reasons the subsidies were put in place years ago. There was a general desire for energy independence from Russia, where natural gas had sometimes been used as a weapon to pressure nations on political matters and the cost was unpredictable. Renewable energy was also seen as a source for jobs and income.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1363922490958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:21:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363922576949-20</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH XOM Analyst Report</Title><Username>november_jason</Username><Timestamp>1362658049197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:07:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another keylogger Spam site from India</Msg><Username>basherbuste_r</Username><Timestamp>1363922576949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:22:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363922624345-21</Id><Topic><Title>Renewable energy losing its shine in Europe</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1363922490958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:21:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was also concern for the climate, say analysts: a 2011 Eurobarometer poll showed that Europeans believe climate change to be a graver problem than the financial crisis plaguing Europe. Nowhere is this concern more acute than in Germany. The country has long had an ambitious clean energy plan that aims to have the entire country running on 80% renewable energies by the year 2050. That plan was fast-tracked following the accident at Japan's Fukushima reactor in March 2011, and by Germans' overwhelming opposition to nuclear power stemming from the lingering memories of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union more than two decades ago. For years after, forest-loving Germans worried about picking wild mushrooms. Chancellor Angela Merkel – once a champion of nukes – did an about-face on her nuclear policy. She announced that all of Germany's 17 nuclear plants would be shut down by the year 2022, 14 years ahead of schedule and closed eight immediately. But her decision had little to do with the safety of Germany's nuclear reactors, say analysts. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union were worried over regional elections, and federal elections in September: If she wants to remain chancellor she needed to siphon votes from the Greens and Social Democrats, both anti-nuke. Dubbed the "energy transition," the move has become a logistical and financial headache for Berlin. Nuclear power had represented one-fifth of the country's energy supply, and Environment Minister Peter Altmaier recently estimated the shift to renewables could total up to $1.3 trillion by 2030. The move left some of Germany's neighbors grumbling. "Outside of Germany, we've noticed that there are two perspectives," said Gerd Rosenkranz, a spokesman for the non-profit German Environmental Aid. "One is, 'there go those crazy Germans again' and the other is 'there go those crazy Germans again' – but it's possible that they'll succeed.'"
