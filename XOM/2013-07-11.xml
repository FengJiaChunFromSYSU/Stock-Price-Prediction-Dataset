RINs, the credits that help the Environmental Protection Agency track whether refiners are meeting federal biofuel-use mandates, jumped 10 cents to $1.15 for grain-based ethanol and 8 cents to $1.18 for advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The surge in RINs has been a point of contention between ethanol advocates and oil interests such as the American Petroleum Institute, which wants the U.S. to repeal the 2007 energy law that requires use of the additive. The Environmental Protection Agency said today that it sent the final rule for this year’s volume standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget last week. “Some of these people had hopes that the volumes would get decreased and now for whatever reason, now realize that EPA isn’t changing it,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter, Florida. RINs are certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel. Once refiners blend ethanol into petroleum, they can keep the RIN to submit to the EPA for compliance, or trade it to another party. There were about 2.6 billion RINs created last year that can be carried over to this year, EPA said in a Feb. 7 notice in the Federal Register. The U.S. will consume about 132.9 billion gallons of gasoline this year, the Energy Information Administration forecast yesterday in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. The 2007 energy law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year. Ethanol is typically blended in a formula of 10 percent of the additive and the rest gasoline. While the EPA approved blends of as much as 15 percent of the biofuel to be sold at pumps, the higher concentrations aren’t in wide use.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373521238414</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 01:40:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373522900955-2</Id><Title>Vitter Won't Filibuster Obama's EPA Pick</Title><Msg>Vitter Won't Filibuster Obama's EPA Pick Wednesday, 10 Jul 2013 07:01 AM Gina McCarthy's embattled nomination to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleared a hurdle on Tuesday when one of her top Republican critics said he would not block a Senate vote on her appointment. David Vitter of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he would support a full Senate vote on McCarthy now that the EPA had agreed to a series of requests he made to address complaints about transparency at the agency. "I've had very productive conversations with EPA over the last several weeks, and believe the agency has taken significant steps forward on our five transparency requests... I see no further reason to block Gina McCarthy's nomination," Vitter said in a statement on his website. The decision from Vitter comes as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled he may start the process for a full Senate vote on McCarthy's nomination this week. McCarthy is currently the top air quality official at EPA. She was nominated by Obama on March 4. Among other actions, Vitter said the EPA has agreed to re-train its employees regarding record keeping under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and to commission an independent review of the agency's economic modeling. Republicans have accused the Obama administration of attempting to circumvent public records laws by using personal emails for official business. Critics of EPA have also questioned the economic assumptions the agency has used to support controversial regulations. The EPA has been a lightning rod during the Obama administration, with opponents accusing the agency of regulatory overreach aimed at shutting down the nation's coal plants and stifling U.S. businesses.

BRODER Published: July 11, 2013 WASHINGTON — The nation’s entire energy system is vulnerable to increasingly severe and costly weather events driven by climate change, according to a report from the Department of Energy to be published on Thursday. The blackouts and other energy disruptions of Hurricane Sandy were just a foretaste, the report says. Every corner of the country’s energy infrastructure — oil wells, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants — will be stressed in coming years by more intense storms, rising seas, higher temperatures and more frequent droughts. The effects are already being felt, the report says. Power plants are shutting down or reducing output because of a shortage of cooling water. Barges carrying coal and oil are being delayed by low water levels in major waterways. Floods and storm surges are inundating ports, refineries, pipelines and rail yards. Powerful windstorms and raging wildfires are felling transformers and transmission lines. “We don’t have a robust energy system, and the costs are significant,” said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy assistant secretary of energy for climate change policy and technology, who oversaw production of the report. “The cost today is measured in the billions. Over the coming decades, it will be in the trillions. You can’t just put your head in the sand anymore.” The study notes that 2012 was the hottest year on record in the contiguous United States, and last July was the hottest month in the United States since record keeping began in 1895. The high temperatures were accompanied by record-setting drought, which parched much of the Southwest and greatly reduced water available for cooling fossil fuel plants and producing hydroelectric power. A study found that roughly 60 percent of operating coal plants are in areas with potential water shortages driven by climate change.

Chevron produced 2.57 million barrels per day of oil and natural gas in April and May, down from 2.62 million barrels per day for the full second quarter of 2012. The decline was mostly driven by drops in international production of about three percent to 1.91 million barrels per day, as maintenance work was performed in Kazakhstan, Australia and Nigeria, the company said. The interim report covers the first two months of the second quarter, but is considered an early indication of quarterly results for other major oil companies. Gulf of Mexico: Chevron strikes oil more than 6 miles below sea level Chevron’s refineries processed 1.61 million barrels per day, down from 1.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2012. These numbers should improve with the Richmond refinery, which came back online in the end of April. Some analysts question whether continuing to keep its refineries is dragging down Chevron’s value. “Have the board of directors and management considered the possibility that the super-major business model may ultimately be the source of this undervaluation?” asked Deutsche Bank in a Thursday morning analyst’s note. Simmons lowered its earnings per share estimate from $2.98 per share down to $2.80 in response to the interim update, due to the updates forecast of weaker than expected international oil production, weaker contributions from its chemicals units and cuts to refining profitability expectations. Chevron has not invested heavily in domestic unconventional plays and has less to gain from recent higher natural domestic gas prices. It has focused instead on deepwater Gu</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373565392755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373567281150-13</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>Again stock is one of the biggest laggards on the Dow.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Thursday set the clock ticking toward a vote on Gina McCarthy, who was nominated by President Obama to run the Environmental Protection Agency back in early March. Reid filed for cloture on McCarthy, a procedural step that sets up a likely vote Tuesday on the nominee, who is currently the EPA’s top air pollution regulator. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged Thursday that McCarthy has more than the 60 votes needed to beat back a filibuster. But McCarthy is moving toward a vote amid a huge and fluid Senate procedural battle. Reid is threatening to trigger the “nuclear option” to have Democrats change Senate rules to bar filibusters of White House nominations. Click here, here and here for more coverage of the explosive battle over the filibuster rules and nominations coming to a head early next week. ... but others will rise to take its place Even if McCarthy avoids “nuclear” fallout, her confirmation would ensure she remains a target of intense GOP criticism. The EPA, under Obama’s plan for second-term climate actions, has committed to regulating carbon emissions from the nation’s power plants. Capitol Hill Republicans are likely to renew efforts to thwart the regulations. And while they probably lack the votes, Republicans will also seek chances to train the spotlight on climate rules they allege will hurt the economy. Case in point: The GOP is criticizing Democratic plans for a Senate hearing on climate change that lacks Obama administration witnesses.
