It was also a very hot month for renewable energy in the U.S. According to figures from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wind and solar accounted for all new electricity capacity added to America’s grid in September. The projects consisted of five wind farms totaling 300 megawatts and 18 solar installations totaling 133 megawatts: CHART thinkprogress Renewable energy Analyst Kenneth Bossong initially reported on the figures. “The remarkable expansion of renewable energy’s contribution to the nation’s electrical supply reflects continuing declines in costs, the impact of state renewable electricity standards, and the mix of tax and other incentives provided by the federal government,” said Bossong in an emailed statement. As the chart above shows, the U.S. has seen 4,055 MW of wind, 936 MW of solar, 340 MW of biomass, 123 MW of geothermal, 9 MW of hydro, and 3 MW of waste heat projects come online since January. This represents a 29 percent increase over the same period in 2011. thinkprogress URLs at talkstock</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351139050311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 00:24:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351139221940-3</Id><Topic><Title>Wind And Solar Make Up 100% Of New U.S. Electricity Capacity In September</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351139050311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 00:24:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting to view the NEW installed electrical capacity for NatGas during the last two years</Msg><Username>moooooooooooooooooooooooo4u</Username><Timestamp>1351139221940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 00:27:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351144535440-4</Id><Title>Surge in Women Voting for Mitt Romney for President</Title><Msg>From 12 to 26.

Oil and gas production increases have made U.S. propane markets well-supplied; propane production in June reached 1.28 million barrels per day (bbl/d), the highest monthly total since the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) data series began in 1981. These production increases have caused inventories of propane to reach near-record levels. Given the ample domestic propane market supplies, prices for propane have declined in 2012, and as a result, have encouraged rising exports of propane from the United States. With propane production at refineries experiencing little change in recent years, most of the propane production growth since 2010 has come from natural gas processing plants (Figure 1). Propane, along with other natural gas liquids (NGL), is a byproduct of natural gas production at fields containing wet gas-or, a high volume of NGL-such as the Eagle Ford play in South Texas, where operators target a combination of crude oil, condensate and NGL. The growing propane supplies are thus partly driven by producers responding to lower natural gas prices by increasingly focusing their production on wet gas fields, which are more profitable right now than dry gas production. In 2009, January-July total production of propane and propylene, which is similar to propane in chemical structure and use, averaged just under 1.07 million bbl/d, with about 540,000 bbl/d coming from natural gas processing plants and 530,000 bbl/d coming from refineries. Through the first seven months of 2012, total propane and propylene production averaged 1.24 million bbl/d, a 16-percent increase over the same period in 2009. Of the 170,000-bbl/d growth, about150,000 bbl/d was the result of increased production from natural gas processing plants, while 20,000 bbl/d was the result of increased refinery production. Despite the increase in production, U.S. consumption of propane has not been growing. Through the first seven months of 2012, EIA data show combined propane and propylene consumption averaged 1.15 million bbl/d, a decrease of 25,000 bbl/d (2 percent) from the average for the first seven months of the years 2007-11. While some of this decrease is weather related, consumption has not risen above the record annual average of 1.28 million bbl/d in 2004. The principal reason for this has been the reduced petrochemical use of propane and propylene. Growing production, combined with flat domestic consumption, raised inventory levels and reduced prices. Inventories of propane and propylene in the United States reached 75.9 million barrels on October 5, the highest level since October 1998. Even after a small draw for the week ending October 12, total U.S. propane and propylene inventories stood at 74.6 million barrels, 11.5 million barrels (18 percent) higher than the five-year average for the comparable week. At the same time, propane prices have been low compared to their typical relationship to crude oil. In September, the spot price for propane at Mont Belvieu, Texas, averaged 91 cents per gallon, the lowest September average price since 2004. On an energy-content basis, propane sold for an average of $9.96 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in September, while Brent crude oil sold at an average of $19.46 per MMBtu (Figure 2). The $9.50 differential between the two was the second largest since EIA's data series for propane prices began in 1992, the largest just one month earlier in August when it reached almost $10 per MMBtu. Prior to 2010, propane prices closely tracked Brent crude oil prices on an energy content basis. However, as production from natural gas processing plants has driven growth in propane supplies in recent years, propane prices have increasingly decoupled from crude oil prices and moved into a range between crude and natural gas prices. With domestic propane prices low, U.S. exports have become more competitive in global markets. Exports account for a growing share of U.S. propane and propylene production. In 2012, from January-July, the United States exported an average of 160,000 bbl/d, while importing an average of 130,000 bb/d. In April 2012, gross exports reached almost 190,000 bbl/d, a record since the EIA data series began in 1973. Almost all U.S. propane and propylene exports (about 90 percent in July 2012) come from the Gulf Coast (PADD 3). Mexico is the largest buyer of U.S. propane, with other Latin American countries such as Chile, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil also importing substantial volumes. Most U.S. imports come from Canada and go to the Midwest (PADD 2). Gasoline and diesel fuel prices fall The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline decreased 13 cents last week to $3.69 per gallon, 23 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. Prices decreased in all regions of the Nation, with the largest decrease in the Midwest, where the average price is down 20 cents to $3.49 per gallon. This is the largest one-week decrease in the Midwest price since November 3, 2008. The Gulf Coast price fell a dime to $3.45 per gallon and the East Coast price is now $3.70 per gallon, nine cents less than last week. The average price in the Rocky Mountains is now $3.71 per gallon, down three cents from last week, and the West Coast price fell 15 cents to $4.25 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price decreased three cents to $4.12 per gallon, 29 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The diesel price fell in all regions of the Nation, with both the Midwest and West Coast prices dropping a nickel, to $4.10 per gallon and $4.30 per gallon, respectively. The Rocky Mountain price is $4.24 per gallon, three cents less than last week. The average price decreased two cents on both the East and Gulf Coasts, to $4.11 per gallon and $4.00 per gallon, respectively. Propane inventories fall slightly Last week, total U.S. inventories of propane declined by 0.2 million barrels to end at 74.5 million barrels, 26 per cent higher than the same week last year. Midwest regional inventories were the only regional stocks to decline, falling 0.4 million barrels. Elsewhere, Gulf Coast stocks rose 0.3 million barrels, while the East Coast and Rocky Mountain/West Coast stocks rose slightly. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 5.7 percent of total propane inventories. Residential heating oil prices decrease while residential propane prices see minor increase Residential heating oil prices decreased during the period ending October 22, 2012. The average residential heating oil price fell by a penny per gallon last week to just below $4.03 per gallon, 23 cents per gallon higher than the same time last year. Wholesale heating oil prices decreased by 10 cents per gallon last week to reach a price shy of $3.25 per gallon, 13 cents per gallon more than last year at this time. The average residential propane price increased last week, by a penny per gallon, to reach a price near $2.39 per gallon. This is a drop of nearly 41 cents per gallon compared to the same period last year. Wholesale propane prices increased by less than a penny per gallon to just under $1.00 per gallon for the week ending October 22, 2012. This was a decrease of nearly 50 cents per gallon when compared to the October 24, 2011 price. eia</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351181301567</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:08:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351181630978-16</Id><Title>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report October 25, 2012</Title><Msg>Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report October 25, 2012 October 25, 2012 at 10:30 a.m. (eastern time) for the Week Ending October 19, 2012.

A grand opening promotion will be announced soon. The U.S. EPA approved of E15 for use in 2001 and newer cars, light duty trucks and SUVs and in June gave final approval for its sale and use. “This was a long time coming and we are excited that a retailer with new blender pumps is offering E15 as a fuel choice,” said Kim Clark, director of biofuels development for the Nebraska Corn Board. “There have been several hurdles, but we are finally starting to see E15 at the pumps right here in Nebraska.” Neal Hoff, owner of Uncle Neal’s in Lexington and one of the recipients of the Nebraska Corn Board blender pump grant, decided to offer E15 as a fuel choice for consumers in the new blender pumps he installed. “E15 seemed like the logical fuel to offer since vehicles that are 2001 and newer can use over 80 percent of the fuel sold,” said Hoff. “We want to give consumers fuel choice and what better than to offer a locally homegrown and produced fuel?” The Nebraska Corn Board and the Renewable Fuels Association worked with Hoff to ensure he was registered for the fuel survey, adopted the misfueling mitigation plan created by the Renewable Fuels Association, and the pumps were labeled properly for selling E15. “It is a great feat for the ethanol industry to see E15 being sold in multiple states, and we are pleased Nebraska is added to the list,” said Robert White, director of market development for the Renewable Fuels Association. Clark and White agree that many hours and phone calls have been spent by all parties to get E15 in Nebraska and ensure it is introduced properly. Sept. 15 was the earliest Nebraska could offer E15 to 2001 and newer vehicles because of the lack of a one pound reed vapor pressure waiver for E15. “It has been 30 years since a new fuel has been introduced, and we know adoption is going to be slow. Consumers in Nebraska now are one of the first in the nation to have a new fueling option that we believe other retailers in the state will choose to offer in the future,” stated White. Nebraska is the second largest producer of ethanol in the United States. Ethanol creates jobs, spurs economic development, increases energy independence, and helps Nebraska drivers by lowering the price at the pump.

"Biodiesel that we are using is recycled cooking oils," said Peter Bourne, President of Bourne's Energy. Wednesday the fuel provider cut the ribbon on a biodiesel blending plant in Morrisville. "Basically we are taking fossil fuel -- the biodiesel -- in a pipeline, pounding the molecules together so they become attached to one another, then are pumped into trucks for delivery to our customers," Bourne said. The facility is slated to pump out roughly 100-thousand gallons of the blend a year to heat homes and businesses. "It's a cleaner fuel, it's environmentally the right thing to do. It's an economic great thing because Vermonters get the local benefits of a biofuel made in the region and Bourne's gets the benefit of keeping customers and keeping their energy future bright," said Vt. Public Service Commissioner Liz Miller. Miller said it's a step in the right direction toward a Vermont goal to have 90-percent renewable energy statewide by 2050. "Where we really need to see transformation is in transportation and in heating, which is why this project is so exciting because it shows what's possible, not just for Vermonters who are customers, but for the business -- Bourne's as well," she said. Bourne will not say how much money it put into the project or if it's taking a financial loss, but he said it will sell the biodiesel to customers for the same price as its traditional fuel. "Probably from a business perspective it's not the brightest thing we've done, but what it is, is it's the best thing we've done," he said. The project was completed with 45-thousand dollars in federal money. wcax</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351187541978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351188306534-24</Id><Title>Interior Announces Commercial Lease for Renewable Energy Offshore Delaware</Title><Msg>Interior Announces Commercial Lease for Renewable Energy Offshore Delaware First Lease under Administration’s ‘Smart from the Start’ Offshore Wind Strategy Part of Effort to Expand American Made Energy 10/23/2012 WASHINGTON —As part of the Obama Administration’s all-of-the-above strategy to expand safe and responsible domestic energy production, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Director Tommy P. Beaudreau today announced that BOEM has reached agreement on a lease for commercial wind energy development in federal waters that covers 96,430 acres approximately 11 nautical miles off the coast of Delaware. This is the first lease completed under Interior’s “Smart from the Start” approach to facilitate environmentally responsible offshore wind development along the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by identifying wind energy areas in a coordinated, focused approach with extensive environmental analysis, public review and large-scale planning. “Delaware has remarkable offshore wind potential, and harnessing this clean, domestic energy resource will create jobs, increase our energy security and strengthen our nation’s economic competitiveness,” said Salazar. “The Administration has implemented a true all of the above approach to American energy, with renewable energy from sources like wind and solar doubling since the President took office, while at the same time domestic oil and gas production has increased each year, with domestic oil production currently higher than any time in almost a decade and domestic natural gas production at its highest level ever.” The lease grants NRG Bluewater Wind Delaware LLC the exclusive right to submit one or more plans to BOEM to conduct activities in support of wind energy development in the lease area. The company may submit a Site Assessment Plan (SAP) with a proposal to conduct site #$%$ment activities, such as the installation of a meteorological tower or meteorological buoy, and/or submit a Construction and Operations Plan (COP) to propose construction of the actual wind facility and cabling to shore. “This lease is the result of many months of hard work and collaboration among BOEM, our Federal partners, the Delaware Renewable Energy Task Force, and other stakeholders,” said Beaudreau. “I congratulate NRG Bluewater Wind and we look forward to their progress in standing up offshore wind energy generation under this lease.” In its original project nomination, NRG Bluewater proposed a 450-megawatt project offshore Delaware, with estimates that the project could generate enough power to supply electricity for over 100,000 homes. This estimate could change after NRG undergoes additional planning and survey work, and submits its COP to BOEM, which will #$%$ the potential plans based on environmental, technical and other factors before granting approval for construction. The lease area, which is composed of 11 full OCS blocks and 16 partial blocks, has been located to avoid existing uses of the OCS offshore Delaware, including but not limited to major shipping lanes into and out of Delaware Bay, a proposed vessel anchorage ground and a munitions disposal area. On public lands and waters, Interior recently eclipsed a major milestone by meeting the President’s goal of authorizing 10,000 megawatts of large-scale renewable power by the end of the year. Since 2009, Interior has authorized 33 renewable energy projects, including 18 utility-scale solar facilities, 7 wind farms and 8 geothermal plants, with associated transmission corridors and infrastructure that will enable the projects to connect to established power grids. When built, these projects will provide enough electricity to power more than 3.5 million homes, and support an estimated 13,000 construction and operations jobs according to project developers. Today’s action is in line with the President’s direction to continue to expand domestic energy production, safely and responsibly. Since President Obama took office, domestic oil and gas production has increased each year, with domestic oil production at an eight-year high, natural gas production at an all-time high, and foreign oil imports now accounting for less than 50 percent of the oil consumed in America – the lowest level since 1995.

Known as the BIQ building, it uses moveable panels of micro-algae to generate heat, shade, and energy. These panels are designed to be retrofitted onto the outside of existing buildings so that when sunlight hits them the micro-algae naturally photosynthesises and starts to grow. This means the building becomes a dynamic, living instrument whose “bio-adaptive façade” responds to increased sunlight by creating shade and generating power for immediate use or storage. The solution works in three specific ways: Firstly, it traps heat from the sun. This stops it from entering the building in the first place and the heat is then reused to help to power the building. Secondly, the growing micro-algae block out part of the sunlight entering the building — reducing glare, and creating a more pleasant environment. These first two will also have an impact on auxiliary systems such as air conditioners and purifiers. Thirdly, the micro-algae is harvested as biomass and used to generate power for the building, turning a shading solution into a uniquely clean source of renewable energy. The construction is based upon the winning entry in last year’s prestigious Metropolis magazine’s Next Generation Design Competition. This estimated that the panels would generate nearly 10% of a building’s energy requirements when fitted to an old federal building in Los Angeles. The prototype will be ready for demonstration at the 2013 International Building Exhibition (IBA) in Hamburg, Germany. By that time, hopefully fuller figures will be available, including greater depth into the 10% energy production figure, an insight into how it can effect auxiliary systems and the balance of both against energy required to manufacture the panels. That aside, though, the only other drawback I can think of is that we all get used to living and working in a subtle shade of green light. Not much to ask in a green economy, is it?

The man, who is holding a hidden camera, asks Moran how he can cast votes for those Virginians. Moran encourages the man to focus his time on legitimate get-out-the-vote efforts. But he also tells the man to forge utility bills with the names and addresses of the 100 Virginians and use those documents as a form of voter ID when casting votes in their name. “So, if they just have the utility bill or bank statement — bank statement would obviously be tough — but faking a utility bill would be easy enough,” Moran says in the video.

By Elizabeth Douglass, InsideClimate News Oct 25, 2012 PHOTO TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline depot in Gascoyne, North Dakota, February 2012/Credit: Bret Clanton The argument is familiar to just about every American by now: The United States needs to import more Canadian crude oil to secure its energy independence, and building the proposed Keystone XL import pipeline is critical to accomplishing that goal. Within the U.S. oil industry, however, the hot topic these days is not the nation's need to import Canadian oil—it's the possibility of exporting crude oil produced in the United States. "A paradigm shift happens when reality smacks you upside the head, and reality is now smacking us upside the head," said Mark Mills, a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative, free-market think tank. "We're about to have a gusher of oil." That expectation is causing the industry to make massive investments to reconfigure North America's pipeline network and change the way oil has been flowing for decades. "North America is in the process of being repiped," Al Monaco said as he kicked off his tenure as the new CEO of pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. earlier this month. The Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL is the most visible and highly charged part of that pipeline system restructuring, even though critics are now questioning the logic of building an import pipeline when the industry is increasingly focused on exports. The industry's growing interest in exporting U.S. oil stems from a dramatic and unexpected surge in domestic light, sweet crude production that has boosted this country's oil production to more than 6.6 million barrels per day, its highest level since 1995, according to federal data. The flood of crude has caused a wholesale reversal of thinking within the industry, triggering predictions across the political spectrum that the United States could become not only energy self-sufficient but also a major oil exporter whose output could rival Saudi Arabia's. Current U.S. oil output isn't nearly enough to satisfy domestic needs, but some of the newly accessible oil reserves still haven't been tapped. Already, the gush of home production has created an oversupply of light, sweet crude in the Midwest. Industry analysts expect rising production in Texas and North Dakota will create a similar surplus as early as next year in the Gulf Coast, where the nation's largest refineries are based—and where ports provide a launching point for overseas exports. "What's obvious now is that the United States is on track to become the world's largest producer of oil," said Mills, author of a widely cited paper pushing for the export of U.S. oil and other fossil energy resources. "No one would have talked this way 10 years ago ... even three years ago they were wringing their hands because we were going to run out of the stuff." The nation's unexpected petroleum boom has caught crude suppliers, traders and pipeline companies off guard. Limited pipeline capacity has caused oil supplies to build up in the Midwest, forcing oil producers from Colorado to North Dakota and Alberta, Canada to sell their crude at steep discounts. This week, the price of North Dakota oil stood at about $75 per barrel, about 12 percent below the U.S. crude benchmark and more than 30 percent below the international crude benchmark. If that same oil reaches the U.S. coasts or global markets, it can fetch as much as $30 more per barrel. That's why some North Dakota producers are loading their oil onto rail cars, river barges and trucks for the long trip to coastal refineries. New pipelines are even more essential for the Canadian oil sands producers. The value of their crude sank to the equivalent of less than $60 a barrel this week, well below the U.S. and international benchmark prices of $85 per barrel and $108 per barrel, respectively. They see the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline system as essential to helping them close that gap. Getting their heavy crude to Gulf Coast refineries, or to world markets through the Gulf ports, could boost the value of their crude by as much as $48 per barrel. Refineries are already taking advantage of higher international prices for gasoline, diesel and other oil byproducts. They've been exporting ever-increasing amounts of fuel, a trend that has made the nation a net exporter of refined products for the first time since at least 1949, the last year for which that data are available. The same forces have led to record exports of U.S. coal, and now have many energy companies poised to send liquefied domestic natural gas to overseas customers as well. But exporting crude oil is a different story. While there are no restrictions on exporting fuel produced by U.S. refineries, the same is not true for raw domestic crude oil. To export U.S. crude, sellers have to contend with a patchwork of overlapping restrictions that makes it illegal to export U.S. crude to any foreign country without government permission and special licenses. In the past, only a trickle of U.S. crude flowed out of the country through these licenses. But that's changing. In July, producers exported 77,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil to Canada—the highest level in more than a decade, according to federal statistics. Royal Dutch Shell, BP, oil trader Vitol and three other companies have applied for or received the necessary government clearance to export domestic crude oil—mainly, if not exclusively, to Canada—according to recent news reports. Now the industry has begun to tip-toe into the politically sensitive issue of removing the export barriers. "The reason for the [oil] export controls—short supply in the U.S.—is becoming somewhat of an anachronism, as the situation now being faced is of abundant supply," Citigroup Inc. oil analysts wrote in a March report that suggested North America could become "the new Middle East." Adam Sieminski, head of the federal Energy Information Administration, broached the possibility of exports during a June briefing on the outlook for U.S. energy. "I'm not sure we should just automatically assume [exporting oil] would be bad," said Sieminski, a former Deutsch Bank economist. "It might actually be a way to grow the economy, create jobs and ultimately help reduce prices." The industry is framing the notion of exporting domestic oil as a necessity created by a mismatch between the type of oil U.S. refineries are set up to refine and the type of crude oil flowing from North Dakota and South Texas. Because many Gulf Coast refiners upgraded their plants specifically to handle the cheaper heavy crude from Canada, the industry argues that light, sweet U.S. crude may need to be exported. Conversely, if Gulf Coast refiners decide to buy more domestic crude from resurgent U.S. producers, then Canadian heavy oil delivered by the Keystone XL would be exported—a scenario some believe is more likely given the export restrictions on U.S. crude. "There are likely to be economic incentives to export both Canadian and U.S.-based crude," the Citigroup report said. "Canadian crude should be the first to be exported from the U.S. to earn higher [profits] elsewhere." Keystone XL: Needed for Energy Security? Talk of oil exports and oil surpluses might come as a shock to Americans who still believe what they've been told for decades: that the nation is running out of oil and that we're importing too much oil from the politically volatile Middle East, which in turn makes the country more vulnerable to supply disruptions and price spikes. In reality, however, oil prices are determined by the world market and problems or worries involving Middle East oil push up the cost of all crude, no matter where it comes from or where it goes. Physical supply disruptions—whether caused by international conflict, pipeline ruptures, or hurricanes—also trigger oil price spikes (as well as big increases in retail prices for gasoline and diesel). What's more, the nation's dependence on foreign petroleum imports, now at 45 percent of consumption, has been declining since 2005, according to Energy Information Administration data compiled by the Congressional Research Service. Crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf, despite a recent uptick, are down 30 percent from the peak in 2001. Soaring U.S. production is expected to accelerate those trends. Still, the Keystone XL pipeline continues to be portrayed as a matter of energy security, a persuasive argument that opinion polls show resonates with voters. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney makes the energy security argument nearly every time he talks about energy. So do representatives with the oil industry. An executive with TransCanada Corp., the company behind the Canada-to-Texas pipeline, put it this way in a Congressional hearing in December: "Keystone will bring many benefits to the United States, but I believe the most important role that Keystone will play is to bring energy security to the United States during what has been recently some very unsettling times overseas." That assertion has overshadowed concerns raised by environmentalists, landowners and others who oppose the project. Those worries range from water pollution problems and greenhouse gas emissions in the Canadian oil sands to the perpetuation of the nation's reliance on oil, the seizure of U.S. landowners' property by foreign companies, and the potential for spills and leaks in streams and rivers along the pipeline route. The notion that the Keystone XL is needed for U.S. energy security persists even as a succession of experts acknowledge that the pipeline's primary target market—the Gulf Coast refining hub—is already well-supplied and will reach glut levels as more U.S. oil flows to the region. "If the public realizes that [the Gulf Coast refiners] don't need the Keystone XL ... I think it would have a huge impact on support for the project," said Anthony Swift, an attorney at the National Resources Defense Council, which has campaigned against the pipeline for years. The Keystone XL system was originally intended to run 1,700 miles from Canada's oil sands patch in Alberta to refineries in Texas. But the project needs a permit from the U.S. State Department because it crosses an international border. Early this year President Obama postponed his decision on that permit, saying further environmental review was needed—especially for the section that passes through the Ogallala aquifer in Nebraska, a key source of drinking and irrigation water. Most of pipeline's 830,000-barrel-a-day capacity would be reserved for diluted bitumen (dilbit), a blend of heavy tar sands bitumen diluted with liquid chemicals. In June, a series of reports by InsideClimate News showed that after a 2010 dilbit spill in Michigan's Kalamazoo River, the liquid chemicals began evaporating and the bitumen began sinking to the river's bottom. More than two years later, oil is still pooling in the river. The EPA recently informed Enbridge that the most expensive inland pipeline spill in U.S. history—costing more than $800 million at last count—is still far from over. To keep the Keystone XL project moving, TransCanada split it into two parts. While the company awaits permits for the northern leg, construction has already started on the southern section, which runs from Cushing, Okla. to Texas and doesn't need State Department approval. Romney has repeatedly pledged to approve the northern segment "on day one" of his presidency if he wins the election, arguing that the project would create jobs and increase the nation's energy independence. Obama hasn't said whether he plans to approve the northern route. Why the Oil Equation Changed The dramatic turnaround in U.S. oil production began with the twin technological breakthroughs of horizontal drilling and large-scale use of a controversial process called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which together have made it possible for oil companies to tease "tight oil" out from dense shale rock formations. Such unconventional oil formations are what’s fueling the boom in North Dakota and Texas. Oil production in North Dakota jumped to more than 700,000 barrels per day in August, more than triple its 2009 output, according to state reports. The Eagle Ford area in South Texas is still ramping up, but oil output there is already catching up to production in North Dakota. Tight oil production has already surpassed 900,000 barrels per day, and it's on pace to reach 1.2 million barrels per day by 2020, equal to 18 percent of total U.S. oil production, according to EIA estimates. "U.S. oil production is up 25 percent since we last had a presidential campaign," said Daniel Yergin, author of The Prize, an acclaimed history of oil, and The Quest, a new book about energy. "In 2008, everything was really dominated by this notion of scarcity and peak oil." With the rise of unconventional oil, or 'tight' oil, "there's this sense that our resources are more abundant," Yergin said in an interview. "The share of dependence on the Middle East oil will be lower than was anticipated." The rebounding production is just part of the nation's new oil equation, however. U.S. fuel consumption has fallen off sharply in recent years because of the combination of a slumping economy, more biofuels use, more efficient vehicles and a shift in driving habits and demographics. While demand may recover somewhat when economic activity picks up, experts say the other factors will keep U.S. oil use on the decline. Keystone XL supporters say neither the domestic oil boom nor the drop in fuel use negate the need for the pipeline and its cargo of Canadian heavy crude. "We are still the largest oil consuming nation on the face of the earth. The more oil we can bring from Canada, in general, will displace oil coming from Saudi Arabia, from Nigeria ... that's better for us," said Fadel Gheit, a senior analyst covering the oil industry for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "Basically, we reduce our dependence on imported oil." Indeed, the United States is currently a net importer to the tune of 8 million barrels per day of petroleum, driven mostly by demand from the nation's fleet of cars, trucks, trains and planes. That puts the United States a long way from becoming self-sufficient, and further still from becoming a major oil exporter. And nothing is certain in the world of oil. Politics, environmental concerns, industry accidents, world events, cost and price changes, economic trends, geologic surprises and a slew of other factors could suddenly rearrange oil markets again—and scuttle the export ambitions of North American oil producers. "Things could change, and very quickly," Gheit said. Oil economist and consultant Philip Verleger Jr. said the Keystone XL will be a victim of that rapid change. Verleger is a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics whose opposition to the Keystone project has rankled the industry. The pipeline was planned when America's oil demand showed no sign of letting up and its production seemed in permanent decline. Now the pipeline's builder, TransCanada, and the Canadian crude producers who plan to use the pipeline face an economic double-whammy: U.S. demand is declining and U.S.-produced oil is flooding their target market with competing oil. "The people who are saying we really need this [Keystone XL pipeline] don't recognize that circumstances have changed," said Verleger, who recently predicted that America will begin exporting more energy than it imports within the decade. "The Keystone XL is going to be just like an Egyptian pyramid. Useless." insideclimatenews</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351222581187</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:36:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
