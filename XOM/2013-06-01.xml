As part of an aggressive push to repeal the RFS, oil industry trade groups and their allies have used a well-stocked arsenal of half-truths and misinformation regarding ethanol and other biofuels. Big Oil’s PR machine regurgitates these myths via conference calls with reporters, meetings with editorial boards, sham studies, paid advertising, social media and many other channels. Their goal, of course, is to weaken political and public support for the RFS and put the brakes on the transition to renewables. My first post challenged the ridiculous idea that we don’t need an RFS or renewable fuels anymore because of the boom in domestic oil production from fracking. This post takes aim at another oft-repeated myth: the old “food versus fuel” canard. The oil industry has teamed up with industrial meat and grocery manufacturers to breathe new life into the false notion that crop-based biofuels expansion has “diverted” crops away from feed markets and significantly affected food prices. The facts demonstrate the absurdity of these claims. Myth #2: Ethanol Expansion and the RFS Have Meaningfully Affected Consumer Food Prices It is beyond dispute that the emergence of the ethanol industry has positively impacted prices for corn. Indeed, adding value to farm products was a fundamental reason for developing the ethanol industry in the first place. Stimulating demand and enhancing the value of local crops was a principal motivation for the tens of thousands of farmers and other rural Americans who invested in the development of ethanol plants in their communities. The RFS created an environment of certainty that gave those investors the assurance and confidence needed to theenergycollectiveDOTcom/gcooperrfa/230491/busting-big-oil-myths-rfs-and-ethanol-part-ii-food-prices</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370064650843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 01:30:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370065023727-2</Id><Title>new to XOM</Title><Msg>Is 1.42+ and a million shares traded in after hours normal for XOM?

TransCanada Corp. CEO Russ Girling said he hopes the State Department will complete its environmental review of the Canada-to-Texas pipeline by mid-summer. Foggy Bottom would then need to make a determination of national interest for the project, which Girling said he hopes would take no longer than 90 days. “I have never been involved in a process that has lasted this long. We're not reinventing the wheel here,” he said, according to excerpts of an interview with Bloomberg Government’s Capitol Gains that will air Sunday. “I remain extremely confident that we'll get the green light to build this pipeline." Republicans, industry and some unions that support Keystone have accused President Obama of dragging his feet on a decision to grant TransCanada a cross-border permit to finish pipeline’s northern leg. They say the project could bring immediate short-term construction jobs and enhance U.S. energy security. But green groups and many Democrats say the proponents’ jobs claims are overstated, and contend much of the crude is destined for export. They also say the carbon-intensive oil sands carried through Keystone would ramp up greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. Girling said arguments that Keystone is a choice between the environment and the economy are "simply not true." He suggested the pipeline would tamp down greenhouse gas emissions by displacing imports arriving on oil-powered tankers. “It's a win-win for both parties,” Girling said when asked if he had a message for Obama on the pipeline. “If you deny the pipeline it's a lose-lose. We lose jobs. We lose economic development and we lose energy security.

By Elise Viebeck - 06/01/13 12:31 PM ET The agency in charge of the National Weather Service will no longer furlough employees under sequestration. The announcement from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) came late Friday as severe tornadoes struck the Oklahoma City area, taking nine lives. The deadly storms came less than two weeks after a major twister hit Moore, Okla., killing 24 people. In an email to staff, NOAA Acting Administrator Kathryn Sullivan said the tragedies emphasize "how important every single employee within NOAA is." "That is precisely why I'm pleased to report that this evening the Department of Commerce transmitted to Congress a new sequestration plan," Sullivan wrote. "Because of this new development we are canceling our intent to furlough all 12,000 of our employees." Sequestration is another term for the automatic budget cuts that hit the federal government earlier this year. The cuts have prompted mass furloughs of federal employees. Lawmakers said weather personnel should be exempt and criticized the Commerce Department, which runs NOAA, when it said the furloughs would move forward. The department's original proposal would have ordered four days of furlough for every NOAA employee. Sullivan's email was sent at 11:39 p.m. on Friday night. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/302913-weather-agency-ending-furloughs-amid-tornados</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1370131697853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 20:08:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370133089920-8</Id><Title>bluecheese is a walking encyclopedia.....</Title><Msg>of totally useless information.
