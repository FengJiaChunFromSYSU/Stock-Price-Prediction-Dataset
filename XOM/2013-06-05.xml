By Lisa Song, InsideClimate News Jun 3, 2013 Canadian company Enbridge Inc. is expanding its network of pipelines to carry thousands of additional barrels of oil to and through the United States each day. Credit: Paul Horn. While all eyes are on TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline, another Canadian company is quietly building a 5,000-mile network of new and expanded pipelines that would achieve the same goal as the Keystone. In fact, the project by Enbridge, Inc., Canada's largest transporter of crude oil, would bring even more Canadian oil into the U.S. than the much-debated Keystone project. Enbridge has already begun growing its existing pipeline infrastructure to increase the flow of Canadian and U.S.-produced oil into refineries and ports in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Northeastern Canada. The company's plans have largely escaped public scrutiny, in part because its expansion has proceeded in many segments and phases. The linchpin of Enbridge's Canadian oil transport system is its proposal to increase the capacity of Line 67 (often referred to as the Alberta Clipper pipeline) to bring an additional 430,000 barrels a day of oil into the United States. Line 67 runs from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisc. and currently ships up to 450,000 barrels of oil a day. Enbridge wants to expand the line’s capacity to 570,000 barrels a day, with the possibility of future growth to 880,000 barrels a day. That's larger than the Keystone XL's proposed daily capacity of 830,000 barrels. Because Line 67 crosses the U.S.-Canada border, it needs a presidential permit from the State Department before it can be expanded. That’s the same kind of permit TransCanada is seeking for the northern segment of Keystone XL.

(50/50 rule) US courts have found no such protection in the US Constitution. There is nothing stopping the US Congress from taxing nearly all the income from an asset away. The weaker property protections afforded under US law will become important as the bill from decades of military buildups, wars, unrestricted immigration, and limited (incompetent) government, and energy &amp; tax policy of, by, and for Big Oil comes due. The need for revenue to cover such costs will only grow. It is not really very surprising that the right in the USA failed to get something useful like the 50/50 rule ruled into law either. They were more interested in military adventures, abortion controversies, and gun rights than pursing rational philosophies of statecraft. It will not take American asset owners long to discover that when they set foot in Frankfurt or Berlin they are in another legal world, one beyond the reach of the US Congress, and one that is actively profiting from many of the poor policies the US government follows.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370439609979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 09:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370441624212-7</Id><Topic><Title>The strongest protection of property</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370439609979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 09:40:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The bills have already come due, i.e. see U.S. government deficits and accruing interest. What difference has it made? I'm not actually asking you Hansel, as I don't care what you think, just refuting what you say. Interest rates are at historical lows, inflation is tame, and for all of the money infused into the U.S. economy by the government deficits over all of the years since the Great Depression, our economy is barely growing. So, in other words, you are just plain, and still, full of manure. Oh, and please do what you said you would do, and don't reply. Please ignore me as I prefer it that way. You are so different from the many German and Austrian people I've met in my travels.

He died at 99 two years ago and left me all his money. He was my great-uncle and my age when World War II began. He wrote me a letter through his attorney which I will summarize: “Find yourself a lovely Germanic woman to marry, thoroughly pamper, and impregnate many times.” My Freyja is the perfect angel. I can’t say I worry much about the other races who would like to be German but just can’t be. German law is quite clear and does discriminate based on race: if you are born to German blood you are German, and if not you may never be able to become a citizen or even be permitted to enter the country. I mean really, this is not so complicate. Race &amp; cultural identification is important and just good common sense. It's sad the USA can't figure out the right path, which in fact it followed in the past but has rejected to its peril.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1370490109249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:41:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
