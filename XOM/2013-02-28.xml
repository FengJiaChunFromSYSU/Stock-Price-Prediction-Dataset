They are borrowing money from US banks and buying long term bonds with it. That does not create money and it does not create inflation, which is why US inflation has not increased at all from the 2% pace its has been at the past 20 years.

M3 in the US shows nil change since 2007, whilst economic activity and productivity have advanced over the same period. In the UK M3 money is down after peaking in early 2010. In Northern Europe M3 grew only slightly and in Southern Europe it is down. Meanwhile the deployment of German and US technology to China has increased global productivity and reduced price levels for many industrial and manufactured goods. These cheap imports keep downward pressure on price levels globally. High energy prices have stimulated significant increases in oil production capacity in OPEC, and falling prices for alternative energy sources will decrease prices even more. Places such as Saudi Arabia will be deploying advanced solar power technology, technology that is being pushed forward by computational chemistry and supercomputers, to lower their internal oil demand - thus freeing up more cheap oil for export. State support for advanced energy in places like Germany will only accelerate these trends. What little price inflation there has been comes mainly from wealth impacts caused by inflated stock markets. High levels of investment and still higher productivity will dissipate that force.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1362071109710</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:05:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362071517279-23</Id><Title>US oil production hits 20-year high</Title><Msg>US oil production hits 20-year high By Zack Colman - 02/28/13 11:24 AM ET Average daily crude oil production in the United States hit a 20-year high during November and December 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Increased output from North Dakota and Texas pushed daily production to more than 7 million barrels per day, the highest mark since December 1992. Most of the nation’s oil-and-gas boom is occurring on private and state lands, giving places like North Dakota an economic boost. Industry groups and congressional Republicans want President Obama to open more federal lands to oil-and-gas development. They say doing so would enhance federal revenues while also spurring economic activity. They have pointed to examples like North Dakota’s Bakken formation as a reason to expand drilling access on federal lands. Drilling proponents say the recent boom has occurred in spite of the president’s policies, not because of them. But Obama has said oil-and-gas production has been rising under his watch, and has given no indication that he plans to open more federal lands to drilling. The energy agency said the domestic spike is coming from shale and other tight rock formations, where hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has sparked the increase. The drilling method injects a high-pressure mixture of water, chemicals and sand into the rocks to tap hydrocarbons buried deep underground. Environmentalists worry the practice contaminates drinking water, while industry contends it’s safe. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/285491-eia-us-oil-production-hits-20-year-high</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362071517279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:11:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071550412-24</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>willis.bachmann</Username><Timestamp>1362071550412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:12:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071942059-25</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Insider Trading Reported !!</Title><Username>rose.lazo</Username><Timestamp>1361977364676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful information! thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>gore_colleen</Username><Timestamp>1362071942059</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:19:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362073233150-26</Id><Topic><Title>This group of stock braniacs nailed XOM in advance of everyone.</Title><Username>jasoneric39</Username><Timestamp>1362057499274</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:18:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one.

Haley Barbour (R-Miss.) - 02/28/13 12:30 PM ET Every once in a while an idea gets broached in Washington that superficially appears to offer an easy way out of a difficult problem. Avoiding sequestration by raising taxes on America’s energy industry is one such idea. This we know: Washington has a massive spending problem. But pushing for tax increases on energy companies as a quick fix for our country’s fiscal problems is about as nonsensical as it gets. In fact, such tax increases actually would slow economic growth even further. Our country needs its robust energy economy to continue growing. Without it, the United States diminishes a dynamic industry that, instead of laying off workers in the midst of the recession, actually managed to create tens of thousands of well-paying jobs right here at home. Eliminating certain oil and gas tax provisions, which are often misleadingly presented as "subsidies," would compromise the industry's ability to add even more jobs and boost economic growth. It would also be counterproductive and risk bringing our emerging U.S. energy renaissance to a grinding halt. That renaissance today enables oil and gas firms to support more than 9.2 million American workers. These workers have high paying jobs, with an average salary, except for gas station workers, of $93,000, which is way above the average private sector wage. Furthermore, when the economy shed some 4.5 million jobs between 2006 and 2011, the energy industry actually added 120,000 new jobs. And it added thousands more last year. In Mississippi, we know about the benefits of a strong energy economy. In 2011, our state was ranked by the Fraser Institute of Canada as the number one place in the world for energy investment. In 2012, we were number two. Mississippi is able to compete with the rest of the world for energy investments because we have a clear tax and regulatory landscape that isn’t overly burdensome for companies looking to create jobs and lower prices for quality consumer products. Why should Mississippi or the U.S. government, for that matter, want to punish an industry that has managed to thrive despite the deep recession and this dismal recovery? And let’s not forget the unmentioned consequences of these higher taxes for American families. The natural gas boom, for instance, is driving a manufacturing rebirth in this country that is putting more money in consumers’ pockets. According to an IHS Global Insight Analysis released in 2011, savings from cheap natural gas combined with lower prices for consumer goods that are manufactured with natural gas will add more than $900 in disposable income per household annually between 2012 and 2015. By 2035, that figure is predicted to rise to $2,000 per household each year. Still, some members of Congress continue to naively champion the idea that if oil companies would only pay their fair share in taxes, our looming fiscal problems would be solved. But what is their fair share? Is a 44.3 percent effective tax rate fair? Because that’s what oil and gas companies paid on average in federal taxes from 2006-2011 while other industries and firms on the S&amp;P 500 paid much lower effective rates. Health care service providers, according to Standard &amp; Poor’s Research Insight, paid a rate of 35.1 percent in taxes; pharmaceuticals paid 24.2 percent; and industrial conglomerates paid a 15.8 percent tax rate. The oil and gas industry is already the highest-taxed industrial sector in the country, pumping about $86 million a day of taxes and fees into federal coffers. That’s $31 billion annually. A completely arbitrary tax hike on the energy industry would not only reduce industry growth, it would squelch job creation and pass higher energy costs along to consumers. Moreover, lost in all this talk about making oil companies “pay their fair share” i.e., more than 44.3 percent of net income, is the fact that the stronger our energy industry, the less we have to depend on buying foreign oil from places that are unstable or unfriendly to us. For forty years energy security has been a goal of every U.S. administration, regardless of party. We are at the dawn of North American energy independence, but a vital U.S. energy economy is essential to achieving that potential. Washington faces an enormously difficult challenge in getting its financial house in order, but doing it on the backs of the energy industry would make us less likely to achieve energy independence, a strong middle class, more jobs, and a stronger economy. Slapping the energy industry with higher taxes would be a step in the wrong direction. It wouldn’t help our country’s fiscal mess, but it would reduce economic growth, job creation, and North American energy security while increasing not only the cost of energy but also the prices of the vast number of products that have an energy cost component. If we let it, the U.S. energy industry will drive our country toward the kind of economic recovery we so desperately need. Let’s not derail that potential now with billions of dollars in harmful tax hikes. thehillDOTcom/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/285517-sacrificing-energy-is-no-way-out-of-sequester</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362080395144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:39:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362080997164-30</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!!!!!!

The proposition that photovoltaic panels will be the main power source by 2070 is one of the New Lens Scenarios Europe’s largest oil company published today in a report on energy demand this century. A second has natural gas as the main fuel by 2030. “These scenarios show how the choices made by governments, businesses and individuals in the next few years will have a major impact on the way the future unfolds,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser said in a statement. Shell’s solar estimate, which assumes higher energy prices, follows an industry boom that saw capacity grow to about 102 gigawatts in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That compares with a figure of 1 gigawatt in 2000, based on figures from the International Energy Agency. Lower costs and state support will boost solar to about 600 gigawatts in 2035, or more than 2 percent of power generation, from a small fraction in 2010, the Paris-based group has said. Shell’s wind, solar and hydrogen projects were suspended by former CEO Jeroen van der Veer in 2009 before Voser took over in July that year. Today’s study is its longest term outlook, after spending $2.3 billion on alternative energy and carbon capture and storage research and development in the past five years. Energy demand may double in the next 50 years on population growth and rising living standards, according to Shell, based in The Hague. At the same time it sees “global emissions of carbon dioxide dropping to near zero by 2100” under both scenarios. Prosperous, Volatile The first scenario, “a more prosperous, volatile world,” projects oil demand plateauing after 2040, and wind power and carbon capture growing more slowly on a lack of public and policy support. Solar power will dominate, making up almost 38 percent of supply, with oil providing 10 percent and natural gas 7.5 percent in 2100, Shell said. Solar is in 13th position now. In the second scenario, with more moderate economic growth, demand for oil will peak in about 2035. By the century’s end, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will dominate roads and there’ll be wide use of technology to trap carbon emissions. Output of hydrogen now accounts for 2 percent of energy content, mostly for making ammonia and refining oil, Shell said in the second scenario. By 2060, transportation uses of hydrogen will overtake industrial demand, allowing it to rise “phoenix- like” from failed “1990s hype” about hydrogen-powered cars. Shell decided in 2009 to focus on biofuels in the renewable energy industry and in 2010 set up the Raizen ethanol venture with Cosan SA Industria &amp; Comercio. In 2010, it saw the share of renewables in transport fuel doubling this decade, and since then has focused its research on biofuels made from sugar cane- farm waste after ending an algae project in Hawaii in 2011. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-28/shell-sees-solar-as-biggest-energy-source-after-exiting-industry.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1362081384629</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:56:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362081602080-32</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

By: Mike Nowatzki, INFORUM BISMARCK – As lawmakers debate whether North Dakota’s oil taxes need tweaking, a recent study suggests the state sits in the middle of major oil-producing states when it comes to oil taxation. The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that would reduce the state’s oil extraction tax rate from 6.5 to 4.5 percent, despite strong objections from Democrats who argue the tax cut is unnecessary. The lower rate approved in Senate Bill 2336 would take effect for new oil wells drilled starting in 2017, or if the average statewide daily production exceeds 1 million barrels per day for three consecutive months, whichever comes first. One Democrat, Sen. David O’Connell of Lansford, voted in favor of the extraction tax cut in a 34-13 vote on Tuesday. A recent study commissioned by the state Department of Commerce calculated North Dakota’s effective tax rate on oil production at 9.8 percent, making it the fourth-lowest rate among the top eight oil-producing states in the fiscal year ending in June 2010, the most recent year for which comparable data was available. “It absolutely begs the question (of) why we’re going forward with such a radical and reckless reduction of the extraction tax,” said Senate Minority Leader Mac Schneider, D-Grand Forks. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Dwight Cook, R-Mandan, said the study looks at only one point in time, and today’s effective tax rate is closer to 10.6 percent. He highlighted a provision in the bill that would eliminate current price “triggers” that protect the oil industry with extraction tax exemptions and rate cuts if the price of oil dips below a certain threshold. “The most important thing we need to do is decouple our tax rate from the price of oil,” he said. Rod Backman, the former state budget director whose Covenant Consulting Group did the study, said there have been a number of comparisons of oil production and severance taxes among states. But while many other states or their local jurisdictions impose a property tax on oil-producing properties, North Dakota imposes a 5 percent oil-and-gas production tax in lieu of property taxes. To reconcile the difference for comparison purposes, Backman divided the oil tax collections of each state by the value of their oil production to come up with an overall effective tax rate. North Dakota’s rate of 9.8 percent ranked between Montana, at 10.7 percent, and Texas, at 7.9 percent. Alaska had the highest rate, at 25.1 percent, while California had the lowest, at 2.5 percent. Without those two states, the average rate among the remaining six states was 9.8 percent, the same as North Dakota’s rate. “Based on these major producing states that were included in the study, we’re about in the middle,” Backman said, adding that the study method doesn’t account for all the differences between states, and an exact comparison is virtually impossible. Democrats warn the extraction tax cut will eventually cost the state billions. They point to a Legislative Council memo that projects the state will lose $595 million in oil extraction tax collections in the first five years alone, based on a Department of Mineral Resources projection of 1,750 new wells and an oil price of $80 per barrel, an estimate used in the governor’s budget for 2013-15. Cook has called those projections a “generous assumption.” He counters that the bill also closes an extraction tax loophole for low-producing “stripper wells” in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, which he claims will generate an additional $500 million in oil taxes – a claim Democrats dispute because of the grandfathering of old stripper wells that produce less than 150 barrels per day. Schneider said the claim that closing the loophole will offset the reduction in extraction tax revenue isn’t credible. “Anyone who says so is either delusional or being deliberately misleading. No rational person could think this is a revenue-neutral bill,” he said. Schneider said he hopes the bill receives more scrutiny in the House than it did in the Senate. “Unfortunately, I think this bill is greased,” he said. Cook said he fully expects the bill to pass and end up on the governor’s desk, calling it “sound tax policy for the future of our state.” “I’m open to some common sense changes to it,” he said. Oil tax rates compared A comparison of effective oil tax rates in fiscal year 2010 of the top eight oil-producing states in the U.S. found that North Dakota had the fourth-lowest rate. Here is the ranking of the rates, with the total taxable value of oil production in each state in parentheses. 1. California 2.5 percent ($15.2 billion) 2. Oklahoma 6.7 percent ($11.1 billion) 3. Texas 7.9 percent ($49.4 billion) 4. North Dakota 9.8 percent ($6 billion) 5. Montana 10.7 percent ($2 billion) 6. Louisiana 10.9 percent ($8.6 billion) 7. Wyoming 13 percent ($8.3 billion) 8.

FACT: The dollar supply measured by M3, the broadest measure, is the same as it was before the crisis broke. FACT: US inflation rates are actually lower than they were before the financial crisis which is to be expected given the lack of increase in the dollar supply and productivity improvements since then. US government spending is not a problem anyway, and is not inflationary, so we dispense with another irrelevant item. The Democrats' agenda of taxing will be quite useful over time, as indeed it already has been this year. The US tax increases in 2013 are easily the biggest in decades. Further big taxes await the rout of the GOP, especially in regards to advancing the environmental agenda. Get out and short the dollar if you think that is best.

"That would be an extremely strong signal for the Obama administration," Connie Hedegaard, the EU Commissioner for Climate Action, told reporters in a briefing in Washington. Hedegaard has been visiting lawmakers, administration and World Bank officials as well as other groups in Washington and Boston this week. She is due to meet with Democrats, including Representative Henry Waxman of California and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, two of the most vocal supporters of climate legislation in Congress, as well as U.S. envoy for climate change Todd Stern and White House economic adviser Michael Froman. Hedegaard said rejecting the controversial pipeline, which if completed will transport 830,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to oil refineries in Texas, would show that the United States would "avoid doing something" that could contribute significantly to climate change. She also said the EU will stick to its plan to label fuel from Canada's tar sands deposits as "highly polluting," deterring EU refiners bound by strict environmental rules. Canada's Natural Resources Minister said earlier on Thursday that he is "cautiously optimistic" that TransCanada Corp's proposed pipeline will be approved. U.S. officials say they expect the government to make a final decision on Keystone by the middle of the year.
