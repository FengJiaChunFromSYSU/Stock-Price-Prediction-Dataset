TransCanada is building the domestic leg of the project in the United States while it awaits federal approval to move on the artery slated from Canada. Project supporters say the project is vital for U.S. energy security and would boost the economy. Critics said Canadian crude oil is more harmful to the environment and its corrosive nature makes pipelines more susceptible to spills. Advocacy group Tars Sands Blockade said protesters chained themselves to heavy machinery and blocked a construction area. Ron Seifert, a spokesman for the group, said acts of civil disobedience were meant to protest "TransCanada's fraud, bullying, and reckless endangerment of their lives and fresh water." Advocacy group Oil Change International reported that a bipartisan group of 18 U.S. senators who called on U.S. President Barack Obama to sign off on the project "has taken on average, roughly twice as much money over their careers from fossil fuel interests as has the rest of the Senate." TransCanada has said safety is a top priority for Keystone XL. Marty Durbin, executive vice president for the American Petroleum Institute, said last week that "if we can source more of that energy from right here in North America while creating jobs and generating government revenue, approving the Keystone XL pipeline should be an easy decision." upiDOTcom/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2012/11/20/Protests-mar-Keystone-XL-build-in-Texas/UPI-19361353418129/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353422493861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:41:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353424298219-6</Id><Topic><Title>Allen West--more tea bag flushed</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352340710350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 21:11:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>finally the "loser" admits he is a loser another "koch" bros waste of $$$ bye bye mr "conduct unbecoming"--bye bye mr should be in prison bye bye teabag</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1353424298219</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:11:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353424802281-7</Id><Title>Europe Collapse Caused by Green Policies</Title><Msg>They have a sound fiscal and tax policy there, with high income taxes and high government spending paying for many public services.

Now for something that will surprise not one bit of the mass of mainstream media critics out there. A study by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism has found that President Obama enjoyed a “surge” in positive coverage over the last week of his campaign against Mitt Romney. From the study: During this final week, from October 29 to November 5, positive stories about Obama (29%) outnumbered negative ones (19%) by 10 points. A week earlier, negative coverage of Obama had exceeded positive by 13 points. The final week of the campaign marked only the second time in which positive stories about Obama outnumbered negative dating back to late August. So how did Romney fare during this period? Negative stories drubbed positive ones, according to the researchers, by a margin of 33 percent to 16 percent. Not only did Obama edge Romney on the positive-negative front, he was also beating him on volume, kind of like a Multimedia Costco. During that final week, the president talled an 80 percent mark of news articles in which he had a “significant presence,” according to the study; Romney reached that level in just 62 percent of articles. Tone completes the media win for Obama. In the end, 20% of stories during the fall period [Aug. 27-Nov. 5] about Obama were favorable compared with 29% that were unfavorable (a gap of 9 points). For Romney, 15% of stories during this full period were favorable while 37% were unfavorable, a gap more than twice as large as Obama’s. The study finds that the uptick in positive Obama coverage stemmed from horse-race considerations — the president’s slight but steady lead in certain polls, in other words, prompted favorable coverage of his slight but steady lead in certain polls. Talk about a nice, self-perpetuating news loop. Get a lead in the polls, get some media assistance in maintaining that lead. That, anyhow, is the innocent explanation for things.

They can buy supercomputers and hire petroleum engineers and geologists just as well as a Western oil company, but without the overhead of executive pensions, bonuses, and shareholders demanding share buybacks... The Russians do not need Western help either to develop their oil &amp; gas. If anything the Russian oil industry was more technically advanced when the USSR broke up than Big Oil was - many of the supposed advances in oil drilling which sprung on the scene in the 1990s actually came from the Soviets. In recent years the Russians have increased production quite substantially too. The Iraqis are quite happy to let PetroChina develop its fields, dispensing with the services of the Western companies. Brazil's state oil company (a small fraction is owned by New York and European speculators) does not have much use for Big Oil either. They are developing their reserves almost entirely alone, and have sued Big Oil recently due to its spills etc... The national oil companies are moving downstream too. One of the new flagship refineries on the Gulf Coast is half owned by Saudi Aramco...

Still, state officials call it a success. By Ricardo Lopez, Los Angeles Times November 20, 2012 In California's first auction of greenhouse gas pollution credits, companies paid just a few cents more than the minimum price per ton of carbon, generating almost $290 million from the sale held last week. The state Air Resources Board announced Monday that it sold all 23.1 million allowances available for 2013 at $10.09 each, generating $233.3 million. The minimum price was $10. Additionally, the state sold only 14% of almost 40 million credits available for 2015. That generated an additional $55.8 million. "The auction was a success and an important milestone for California as a leader in the global clean-tech market," board Chairwoman Mary D. Nichols said in a statement. "By putting a price on carbon, we can break our unhealthy dependence on fossil fuels." The price per credit came in lower than what analysts and traders had expected. Some had predicted the allowances would sell for $11 to $15 a ton of carbon. Quiz: The week in business Nichols, however, said despite the low price, the Wednesday auction showed that the market is competitive because all the 2013 allowances were sold. Some of the money will be used for energy efficiency and other projects. Utility regulators have proposed that some of the funds go to residential and business customers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. The cap-and-trade program is the result of AB 32, also known as the Global Warming Solutions Act, a landmark law passed in 2006. The legislation aims to reduce the state's production of carbon dioxide, methane and related gases to 1990 levels by 2020. The 1990 levels are about 17% lower than current amounts. The auction involved 350 industrial businesses in the state, which as a group operate about 600 facilities throughout California. They include utilities, food processors and oil refineries. Starting in 2015, the program also will cover distributors of natural gas and other fuels. After the announcement of the auction results, some firms said they would now be willing to invest in clean energy projects in the Golden State. "This does make me want to invest more in California and send more of my companies there," said Robert Day, partner at Black Coral Capital, a private equity firm that focuses on the clean-tech and renewable-energy sectors. Day said he was excited to see a viable market for pollution credits. The program, however, has not been without controversy. Critics have said the cap-and-trade program is unfair to large businesses and will kill jobs. On the eve of the auction, the California Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit to halt the sale. The group is challenging the state's authority to raise revenue from the sale of the credits. The sale went ahead despite the lawsuit. Air Resources Board officials have said they expect the program to survive any legal challenges. Polluters initially get 90% of their needed credits free, but they are required to buy more if they plan to release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases above allotted levels. Pollution credits start at a minimum price of $10 for the right to emit 1 metric ton of greenhouse gases. Glendora cement maker CalPortland Co., for example, expects its plants in Colton and near Mojave to produce 1 million tons of greenhouse gases this year. By comparison, a typical passenger vehicle produces about 5 metric tons per year. latimesDOTcom/business/la-fi-pollution-credits-20121120,0,1417750.story</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353434984129</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:09:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353435150578-23</Id><Topic><Title>Allen West--more tea bag flushed</Title><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1352340710350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 21:11:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And your 'source' as always was probably the Daily Kos.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353435150578</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:12:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353435210102-24</Id><Topic><Title>Media coverage favored Obama at end of campaign, study reports</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353425180772</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:26:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they covered losers, you would be on page 1 every day.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1353435210102</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:13:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353435292859-25</Id><Topic><Title>The irrelevance of "Big Oil" internationally</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353433002795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:36:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More of your #$%$.

The issues you cite relate to management. The Soviets made a choice to ignore environmental impacts and not maintain operations of marginal value. Technically it is possible to do all sorts of things, but those things are often not done for various reasons. The Soviets' poor management was rampant throughout their economy as it was centrally planned - that is why it failed. As far as technical ability went across their society, the Soviets could often match the U.S. military, and surpass it if they chose to apply themselves... The point still stands too that the Russians do not need the Western oil companies, hence their irrelevance in one of the biggest untapped petroleum resources on the planet. BP has given up even trying to deal with them and cashed out for a stake in a state oil company...

In a new report on developments in the latest round of Israel-Hamas violence, the Times says: On Sunday, Israeli forces attacked two buildings housing local broadcasters and production companies used by foreign outlets. Israeli officials denied targeting journalists, but on Monday Israeli forces again blasted the Al Sharouk block, a multiuse building where many local broadcasters, as well as Sky News of Britain and the channel Al Arabiya, had offices. That attack, which struck a computer shop on the third floor, sparked a blaze that sent plumes of dark smoke creeping up the sides of the building. Video footage showed clouds of smoke billowing. The Times leaves out the story’s single most relevant piece of information: Four senior Islamic Jihad terrorists were using the media building as a hideout. They were killed in the Israeli strike. Both Islamic Jihad and the IDF noted the presence of terrorists in the building, and that they were eliminated in the strike. As in a previous report on Gaza, the New York Times appears confused about the presence and actions of terrorists in the territory. The senior PIJ cadre was operating in a media building. They were’t there to be interviewed. They were using reporters as human shields. — IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) November 19, 2012 A direct hit was identified on the target.

"Big Oil" at one time owned all the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria, Mexico, Venezuela... Just how do you suppose it came to lose all of those, do you? - why the countries in question just forced the sale of the properties at some absurdly low figure, like book value or "updated book value," at a price which bore no resemblance to the value of the oil reserve at all, or declared the oil companies in question in violation of some law they would make before or after the fact and seized their properties in the courts, or imposed an oil export tax that confiscated all the profit, or all of the above. The situation is even more dangerous for "Big Oil" now because the state oil companies have acquired the ability to run their operations without Western help. Perhaps in the mind of a speculator it looks as if Obama is helping "Big Oil," that is if you take as true the premise that he is escalating the wars... The gain promise to be brief... When it really comes down to it Obama could care less what other countries do to Big Oil - the case of Chevron in Ecuador is case in point...

Babcock &amp; Wilcox landed part of a $452 million Energy grant that aims to speed commercialization of smaller, less capital-intensive nuclear reactors. The Charlotte, N.C.-based company will match the federal funds. The Tennessee Valley Authority and Bechtel, San Francisco-based construction and engineering firm also will partner in the public-private licensing agreement. “The Obama administration continues to believe that low-carbon nuclear energy has an important role to play in America’s energy future. Restarting the nation’s nuclear industry and advancing small modular reactor technologies will help create new jobs and export opportunities for American workers and businesses, and ensure we continue to take an all-of-the-above approach to American energy production,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a Tuesday statement. The Energy Department still has to negotiate the terms and total amount of the five-year cost-share deal, a spokesman told The Hill. It will use remaining program funds to finance other reactor designs, the Energy official said. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairwoman Allison Macfarlane praised the program last month. She said the first design certification applications for the reactors could come next year with the Energy program’s aid. Macfarlane said Energy’s investment could help domestic firms grab an early share of the international market for the smaller — and potentially cheaper — reactors. The reactors range between 100 megawatts and 300 megawatts of electric generating capacity. Most are designed to operate underground, potentially minimizing damage from a spill. Industry group the Nuclear Energy Institute lauded Energy for moving forward with the grant. "Our nation's energy future just became considerably brighter. The Department of Energy's important action to advance the development of this innovative reactor design supports the growth of clean-energy sources and the commercialization of advanced energy technologies that can be used domestically and sold overseas,” Marvin Fertel, the group’s president and CEO, said in a Tuesday statement. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/268991-energy-awards-grant-for-nuclear-reactor-commercialization</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353460897993</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 20:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353466488148-56</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Seen Pumping Gas In His New High Tax Home Of California</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353443695979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:34:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And don't you forget it..

Being a LOSER he must now and forever pump his own. Mitt will fade away into the irrelevance he so aptly deserves.. And poor Ann, she said, "It's our turn" I guess she meant to pump their own gas. Maybe Ann should just go back to the kitchen and cook herself a nice Farm Fresh Turkey for Mitt and the boys. Take your time Ann, you and Mitt have plenty of it now that your "turn" has come and gone..</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1353466937927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 22:02:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353468344971-59</Id><Topic><Title>Walhieeeee boy!
