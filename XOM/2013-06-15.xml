The place is as white as Germany and they speak English. The area's energy resources are quite large too. The region is remarkably well endowed with wind power potential located next to favorable industrial/scientific clusters, and transportation hubs. The living standard in Glasgow and Edinburgh is substantially higher than the USA owing to the better educated population, and the higher level of capital per person. The crime problem the USA caused by its minority non-white population does not exist.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371307091343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 10:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371318327974-3</Id><Topic><Title>GOP set to embrace Obama Amnesty under the guise of "immigration reform"</Title><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1371259895375</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 21:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Scotland will be over run by the same elements that have been burning the city of Sockholm the past few weeks.
