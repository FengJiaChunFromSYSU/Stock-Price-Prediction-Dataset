That is despite a new bill from Congress’ transportation committee, which has blocked funding in 2014. The Republican controlled House was too slow, they already provided $3.5 and the money can not be taken back. Now the California’s High Speed Rail Authority has released a report stating the project will produce zero net green house gas emissions. This does not allay concerns about the impact this project would have on 11 endangered species along the route, but does address the problem of air pollution from the diesel machinery that will lay down the tracks. “Our commitment is to make positive environmental contributions from day one,” said Authority CEO Jeff Morales. “High-speed rail will transform the state’s transportation system while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing environmental benefits for years to come.” The CO2 produced during construction is to be offset by a tree planting program. Only recycled concrete and steel is to be used and contractors will be required to divert 75 % of their non-hazardous waste from landfills. “The contractors will also be directed to explore methods to reduce the amount of potable water used onsite. These practical activities, including anti-idling programs, water efficiency, energy efficiency, and the use of fuel-efficient vehicles are among those that have been proven effective for reducing both GHG emissions and costs on many infrastructure projects.” The system is to run on 100% clean energy. “To estimate GHG emissions associated with the electricity purchased by the Authority for traction power, which is the power needed to propel the train along the rails, and facilities operations, the Authority assumed a mix of 20 percent solar, 30 percent wind, 45 percent geothermal, and 5 percent biogas (methane capture).” Thus</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373978765127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 08:46:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373979040309-3</Id><Topic><Title>HIGH SPEED RAIL TO PRODUCE ZERO NET ENERGY EMISSIONS</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373978765127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 08:46:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Natural gas investors should prepare for a loss of market share!</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373979040309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 08:50:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373979629643-4</Id><Title>Report: Keystone XL Pipeline Will Raise Gas Prices, Hurt Economy</Title><Msg>Report: Keystone XL Pipeline Will Raise Gas Prices, Hurt Economy RP Siegel | July 16th, 2013 Keystone gameoverConsumer Watchdog released a groundbreaking report today that asks and answers the following question: What economic effect will the Keystone XL oil pipeline have on U.S. drivers and the U.S. economy as a whole? The 19-page report compiles information from various sources including industry data, public records and company documents related to the issue. But the bottom line is this: the prime motivation behind the pipeline is to drive up the price of Canadian tar sands oil. The direct impact of this will be a significant increase in the pump price of gasoline for U.S. drivers, particularly those in the Midwest. According to the report, prices could rise anywhere from 20 to 40 cents per gallon as a direct result of the fact that various overseas markets will gladly pay more than what Midwesterners are currently paying for that oil. The authors expect the price of the crude would rise anywhere from $20 to $30 for a 42-gallon barrel and that it would be up to refiners to decide how much of that increase to pass along to consumers. Overall, the anticipated impact would be a $3 to 4 billion annual hit to the US economy. The Midwestern U.S. is the main market that this tar sands oil presently reaches, with a small amount going to the West Coast. Given the fact that the government of British Columbia recently refused to allow a similar pipeline through its territory to ports on the Pacific, it will likely remain that way unless Keystone is approved. This limited market access has led to a discount for the tar sands oil that would certainly disappear should its producers achieve the access to worldwide markets they desire. One of the major arguments used in the justification of the pipeline’s controversial 1,179 mile fourth phase, (the other three are already completed or under construction), which would connect Hardisty, Alberta with Steele City, Nebraska, i</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373979629643</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 09:00:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373980230357-5</Id><Topic><Title>HIGH SPEED RAIL TO PRODUCE ZERO NET ENERGY EMISSIONS</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373978765127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 08:46:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“In many regions of the U.S.A., grid parity has been achieved for end consumers, and solar power is already considerably cheaper today than power from the grid,”</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373980230357</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 09:10:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373986134974-6</Id><Topic><Title>Oil industry pushes Congress to axe biofuel mandate (video)</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373915414774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:10:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like another win for XOM.</Msg><Username>jjvet1945</Username><Timestamp>1373986134974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:48:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373991530250-7</Id><Title>bluecheese sure does enjoy talking to himself</Title><Msg>copy &amp; paste..........junk...........spam, and replies to his own messages.
