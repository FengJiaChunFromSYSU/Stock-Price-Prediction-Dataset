China’s State Council, or cabinet, in a statement dated July 4 but posted Monday said installed capacity for solar electricity would reach more than 35 gigawatts by 2015, and would grow by about 10 gigawatts a year between now and then. China’s previous target was 21 gigawatts, and its installed capacity in 2012 was about 7 gigawatts. The move is positive for Chinese solar companies, who will become eligible for more domestic projects, and who together provide more than half the world’s solar panels. In recent years they have been hit by falling prices of solar equipment, fierce competition and a slowdown in financing for solar projects in Europe and the U.S., both of which have been among China’s largest customers. The State Council acknowledged problems in the sector and reiterated several wide-ranging support measures, including promoting small-scale solar power generators, eliminating outdated production capacity, making subsidies more efficient, allowing access to cheap land and relying on “market forces” to encourage mergers and acquisitions. “China’s solar industry is facing widespread operating difficulties,” the State Council said. “Currently, global demand for solar power has slowed, product exports are facing heavy resistance and the growth of the solar industry is uncoordinated,” it said, adding that there were “severe overcapacity issues.” Chinese companies such as Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP), once the world’s largest solar-panel maker, and LDK Solar Co. (LDK), once the world’s largest supplier of solar wafers, have built up heavy debt loads after the 2008 global financial crisis to expand capacity.

The report on India Renewables, Good bye winter, hello spring, published on April 30, says the growing cost-competitiveness of renewable energy with new-build coal – and the arrival of wind parity, despite the upper wind FiT range being around 15 per cent lower than the upper tariff range for new coal capacity (see chart 3 below) – is helping to drive strong renewables growth on the sub-continent. India’s share of renewable generation in the total electricity mix increased to around 6 per cent in the 2012/13 financial year – an amount the government is hoping to grow to 20 per cent by the end of 2020, to help meet the nation’s a peak power deficit of 12GW, or around 9 per cent of its demand. “With electricity demand expected to grow and conventional power capacity facing its own challenges, we expect developers and investors to favour renewable capacity addition,” says the report, pointing to increasing constraints on new-build coal, gas and nuclear, as well as increasing levels of water stress. Screen Shot 2013-07-10 at 12.55.10 PM “Coal stress has been a key driver of renewables in India,” says the report. “We now see water stress as also supporting renewables growth. For the third consecutive year in a row, some coal-based capacity has been closed down during the pre-monsoon period driven by water shortages. We note that thermal power generation is the largest water consumer within the industry segment in India.” For wind, favourable policy support mechanisms, such as increased state tariffs (although most remain well below coal tariffs, as mentioned – chart 3) and the expected 2014 reintroduction of the government’s Generation Based Incentive for wind energy projects, are expect</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373897068320</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:04:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373899745732-8</Id><Topic><Title>hansesteelyard &amp; bluecheese have serious OCD</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371420582357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 18:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're truly demented .</Msg><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1373899745732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:49:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373900423647-9</Id><Topic><Title>hansesteelyard &amp; bluecheese have serious OCD</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371420582357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 18:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have given me reason to take personal offense to you.

Dlouhy The American Petroleum Institute is ratcheting up its campaign against the eight-year-old renewable fuel standard with new nationwide advertisements and a website casting the mandate as something only a mechanic would love. The oil industry trade group’s new TV, print and radio ads feature a car mechanic talking about the potential risks of engine damage from filling up with higher ethanol blends: “AAA says too much ethanol could cause engine damage that’s not covered under warranty,” the mechanic character says in the TV commercial, just before wheeling under the hood of a car. “And that’s good news for me. I take cash or check.” The punchline is delivered as lawmakers on Capitol Hill are evaluating whether — and how — to change the renewable fuel standard, which forces refiners to blend steadily increasing amounts of ethanol and other alternatives into the nation’s transportation fuel supply. By 2022, the mandate will require 36 billion gallons, up from 13.2 billion gallons last year. Under the mandate, refiners also are obligated to use cellulosic ethanol made from switchgrass and other non-edible plant materials, though production of those next-generation biofuels is just ramping up. Video: Oil industry uses Clinton, Bush to push Keystone XL As gasoline use has declined, the oil industry says it has hit the so-called “blend wall” — a point where they can no longer mix in enough ethanol to meet the mandate without exceeding a 10 percent threshold that is approved for use in all cars and trucks. The renewable fuel mandate is set annually on a total gallon basis — rather than as a percentage of the total gasoline sold. A higher 15 percent mix, known as E15, is only approved for vehicles made since 2001. Some automakers have warned that using E15 even in newer cars and trucks voids their warranty, and using it in older vehicles may cause equipment damag</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373915414774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373924229131-14</Id><Topic><Title>Oil industry pushes Congress to axe biofuel mandate (video)</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1373915414774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:10:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U.S. corn futures settled at a two-and-a-half-year low Monday, pressured by an improved weather outlook for what could be a record U.S. harvest this autumn.
