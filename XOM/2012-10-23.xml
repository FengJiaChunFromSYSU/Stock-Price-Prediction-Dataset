TransCanada, the country’s largest pipeline company, said it would operate the 590,000 barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline at reduced rates for up to 24 hours while it completes its testing. The outage of the line, which extends to southern Illinois, and the Cushing, Okla., storage hub from Hardisty, Alta., will affect scheduled shipments for this month, though the extent is not yet known, spokesman James Millar said in an email. “We will be having direct discussions with our customers regarding the impact this will have on their deliveries to us,” Mr. Millar said. The line, which can move up to a quarter of Canada’s crude exports to the United States, will return to regular contractual deliveries in November, he said. The unplanned shutdown pushed up oil prices last week, but they have since fallen back. November crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank $1.32 (U.S.) to $88.73 a barrel on Monday on economic worries and expectations that Keystone would restart. TransCanada shut the pipeline late Wednesday when an in-line inspection tool detected what the company called a “small anomaly” on the pipe. It did not give the location, but the U.S. Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it had sent an inspector to observe repairs on a section between Missouri and Illinois. The pipeline is the first phase of TransCanada’s overall Keystone system and has been in operation since 2010. The next phase, between Cushing and Gulf Coast refineries, is under construction amid opposition from some landowners. The contentious Keystone XL project, between Alberta and southern Nebraska, still requires U.S. federal approval after U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the initial application early this year. TransCanada has re-applied to build that $5.3-billion portion of the system, hoping for an approval early next year. theglobeandmail</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350973730268</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 02:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350973842199-7</Id><Title>ABC, CBS, CNN polls: Mittens LOST HUGE</Title><Msg>He seemed confused and pathetic.</Msg><Username>hello2bushdepression</Username><Timestamp>1350973842199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 02:30:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350974062016-8</Id><Title>Mitt Romney: Russia is America's "No. 1 geopolitical foe," HAHAHAHAHAHA!

"A year-long investigation by the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) has found that scores of known radical Islamists made hundreds of visits to the Obama White House, meeting with top administration officials. Court documents and other records have identified many of these visitors as belonging to groups serving as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic militant organizations. The IPT made the discovery combing through millions of White House visitor log entries. IPT compared the visitors' names with lists of known radical Islamists. Among the visitors were officials representing groups which have: Been designated by the Department of Justice as unindicted co-conspirators in terrorist trials; Extolled Islamic terrorist groups including Hamas and Hizballah; Obstructed terrorist investigations by instructing their followers not to cooperate with law enforcement; Promoted the incendiary conspiratorial allegation that the United States is engaged in a "war against Islam"— a leading tool in recruiting Muslims to carry out acts of terror; Repeatedly claimed that many of the Islamic terrorists convicted since 9-11 were framed by the U.S government as part of an anti-Muslim profiling campaign. Individuals from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) visited the White House at least 20 times starting in 2009. In 2008, CAIR was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorist money laundering case in U.S. history – the trial of the Holy Land Foundation in which five HLF officials were convicted of funneling money to Hamas. U.S. District Court Judge Jorge Solis later ruled that, "The Government has produced ample evidence to establish the association" of CAIR to Hamas, upholding their designations as unindicted co-conspirators. In 2008, the FBI formally ended all contact with CAIR because of its ties to Hamas."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350989772196</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 06:56:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350990003305-27</Id><Topic><Title>Down goes Romney</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350961479419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:04:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I cant wait to kick your commie #$%$ out of america you rat traitor.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1350990003305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 07:00:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350990220926-28</Id><Title>nobumba finished</Title><Msg>He has no knowledge, experience and no brains to be pres.

"President Obama appears to getting reelection support from three world leaders notorious for their anti-American views. Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, after winning a fourth term earlier this month, reportedly said he would vote for Obama and that the president would likely vote for him. The socialist-leaning ruler also reportedly called Obama a “good guy.” His support follows that of the Castro family, which has ruled Cuba under a communist dictatorship for more than 50 years. In June, Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, said in a CNN interview, translated into English: “As a citizen of the world, I would like (Obama) to win.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who is back in Moscow's driver's seat after a stint as prime minister -- has said the reelection of Obama could improve political relations between the two countries."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350990476054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 07:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350995895060-30</Id><Topic><Title>When 3 Enemy Dictators</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350990476054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 07:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're an idiot..

Driven by high prices and new drilling methods, U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons is on track to rise 7 percent this year to an average of 10.9 million barrels per day. This will be the fourth straight year of crude increases and the biggest single-year gain since 1951. The boom has surprised even the experts. "Five years ago, if I or anyone had predicted today's production growth, people would have thought we were crazy," says Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets research at IHS CERA, an energy consulting firm. The Energy Department forecasts that U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons, which includes biofuels, will average 11.4 million barrels per day next year. That would be a record for the U.S. and just below Saudi Arabia's output of 11.6 million barrels. Citibank forecasts U.S. production could reach 13 million to 15 million barrels per day by 2020, helping to make North America "the new Middle East." U.S. oil and liquids production reached a peak of 11.2 million barrels per day in 1985, when Alaskan fields were producing enormous amounts of crude, then began a long decline. From 1986 through 2008, crude production fell every year but one, dropping by 44 percent over that period. The United States imported nearly 60 percent of the oil it burned in 2006. By the end of this year, U.S. crude output will be at its highest level since 1998 and oil imports will be lower than at any time since 1992, at 41 percent of consumption. "It's a stunning turnaround," Burkhard says. Whether the U.S. supplants Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest producer will depend on the price of oil and Saudi production in the years ahead. Saudi Arabia sits on the world's largest reserves of oil, and it raises and lowers production to try to keep oil prices steady. Saudi output is expected to remain about flat between now and 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1351015723356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:08:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351017488634-45</Id><Title>Inhofe: Obama Stalls EPA Regulations Until After Election - Obama has big plans to curb domestic energy production and push forward his “green” agenda</Title><Msg>Inhofe: Obama Stalls EPA Regulations Until After Election Written by Brian Koenig Monday, 22 October 2012 16:40 An Oklahoma senator has issued a report asserting that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has halted action or “punted” on a number of regulations so President Obama can shore up votes for his November reelection bid. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), a ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, suggests that if the federal agency authorizes about a dozen regulations next year, it will “spell doom” for jobs and the economy as a whole. “The Obama-EPA plans to move full speed ahead to implement this agenda if President Obama wins a second term,” Inhofe notes in his report. “These rules taken together will inevitably result in the elimination of millions of American jobs, drive up the price of gas at the pump even more, impose construction bans on local communities and essentially shut down American oil, natural gas and coal production.” Citing a few of the president’s “job killing” regulations, Inhofe contends that new EPA rules would devastate the economy in the coming years: President Obama has spent the past year punting on a slew of job-killing EPA regulations that will destroy millions of American jobs and cause energy prices to skyrocket even more. From greenhouse gas regulations to water guidance to the tightening of the ozone standard, the Obama-EPA has delayed the implementation of rule after rule because they don't want all those pink slips and price spikes to hit until after the election. But President Obama's former climate czar Carol Browner was very clear about what's in store for next year: she told several green groups not to worry because President Obama has a big green 'to-do' list for 2013 so they'll get what they want. The radical environmental left may not need to worry but what about hard working Americans who will lose their jobs and be subjected to skyrocketing energy prices thanks to the Obama-EPA? The report concludes that if activated, regulations on greenhouse gases would inflict a $300-billion to $400-billion annual burden, resulting in a notable price hike on gasoline and home heating. “The requirements are so strict they virtually eliminate coal as a fuel option for future electric power generation,” Inhofe explains. “In a thinly veiled political move, the agency has put off finalizing the proposal until after the election.” Earlier this month, the Obama campaign responded to allegations of price-hiking and job-killing EPA regulations by claiming the president has doubled fuel-efficiency standards so vehicles “will go farther on a gallon of gas, helped double our production of job-creating clean wind and solar energies and has championed an all-of-the-above American energy strategy." Obama affirmed in the second presidential debate that he believes domestic energy production must continue to increase, but that we must also invest in new energy sources, such as wind, solar, and biofuels. However, Carol Browner, now Obama's head campaign advocate, recently assured the environmental community that Obama has big plans to curb domestic energy production and push forward his “green” agenda: I can tell you, having spent two years in the White House with the president, that this is not a fad. The president believes deeply in these issues. At every turn he has looked at what are the tools available to him to really help build a clean energy future for this country and has been committed throughout his first four years in office, and there’s no doubt in my mind this will be a big part of his to-do list and he will remain committed in the next four years. According to Inhofe, Obama has appeared to have drifted to the center with his political rhetoric on environmental regulations in order to appease voters who worry about rising energy prices and the overall state of the economy. But during a “second term, he’s made the commitment” to reverse his environmental policy back to his liberal base, the senator added. “They are all jumping on him," Inhofe continued. "All the Al Gore people, the elites, the MoveOn # orgs, saying, ‘You had control of the House and the Senate you still didn’t do it.’ And he says ‘wait until I get past this election and then I’ll do it.’” thenewamerican</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351017488634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351020321856-46</Id><Title>Our Bright Future!!!</Title><Msg>UNINSTALLING OBAMA.....……………. █████████████▒▒▒ 90% complete.</Msg><Username>cancel190</Username><Timestamp>1351020321856</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 15:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351025683170-47</Id><Topic><Title>So Romney caught in another huge lie: "Syria is Iran's route to the sea"?</Title><Username>hello2bushdepression</Username><Timestamp>1351007122441</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 11:45:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ commie POS.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1351025683170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 16:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351027309045-48</Id><Topic><Title>Our Bright Future!!!</Title><Username>cancel190</Username><Timestamp>1351020321856</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 15:25:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Women Review Debate 3, Governor Mitt Romney Pasted The Test, Ready to Lead USA By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Debate 3: Women's Review: President Obama Was Arrogant, Disrespectfully Angry Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney on Oct 22, 2012.

Lindsey Graham added his voice Tuesday to those calling for the Department of Defense to formally classify the Fort Hood shooting as terrorism, saying that classifying it "workplace violence" is "not fair" to the victims or their families. The Republican senator was responding to a push by victims for the U.S. government to change its description of the rampage that left 13 dead. Such a change would make those who sustained injuries eligible for certain benefits and awards, like the Purple Heart. A group called the Coalition of Fort Hood Heroes recently released a 14-minute Web video making their case -- those behind the video called on viewers to engage Congress in pressuring the Obama administration. "Based upon what we already know, this episode fits squarely into the realm of an act of terrorism," Graham said in a written statement Tuesday. "I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to challenge this characterization by the Pentagon and push for an accurate description of the tragic incident that took place at Fort Hood. It was terrorism and it should be described that way. "The difference in characterization between workplace violence and an act of terrorism is meaningful, in a variety of ways, to the victims and their families," he said. The Defense Department so far has resisted the push to designate it as terrorism, apparently reluctant to make any changes while suspect Nidal Hasan faces court martial.
