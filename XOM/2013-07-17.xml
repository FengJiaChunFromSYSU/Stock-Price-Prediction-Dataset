The aide said the breakthrough comes after the bill sponsors, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), negotiated a deal on amendments suitable to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Controversial amendments held up a similar version of the bill last session, as insiders say Reid was reluctant to trigger a vote on a menu of messaging bills ranging from the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and greenhouse gas emissions regulations. This time around, Shaheen and Portman have tried to persuade colleagues to withhold contentious provisions. Shaheen had told The Hill last week that the lawmakers were more concerned about reducing the number of amendments offered rather than their substance. The bill would authorize an array of initiatives designed to encourage energy conservation by the federal government, manufacturers and homeowners. It has broad support both on and off the Hill. It passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in May with a 19-3 vote, and has picked up endorsements from groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Natural Resources Defense Council, Alliance to Save Energy and the National Association of Manufacturers. Chief among the bill’s contents is a directive that the federal government, one of the largest energy consumers in the world, employ energy-saving practices at its buildings. It also would provide incentives for manufacturers to install more energy-efficient technologies at their facilities, promote workforce training and create voluntary, model buildings codes for new buildings. Reid's office did not respond to a request for comment.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1374061478855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:44:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374067480544-2</Id><Title>“Wind power is simply the cheapest resource available right now, and we are taking the opportunity ... to further shape our systems for the</Title><Msg>“Wind power is simply the cheapest resource available right now, and we are taking the opportunity ... to further shape our systems for the future,” he said.

Republicans and industry groups say the planned regulations are not needed, arguing that state regulation of hydraulic fracturing provides safe oversight. “Why do we need to put down an entire layer of regulations from [Interior’s Bureau of Land Management]? ... Why do we need to do that when there appears to be no problem?” Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) asked at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing. But Jewell said minimum federal standards are needed for fracking on federal and Indian land, noting that states vary in their ability and understanding of the development method. Jewell said fracking technology, used alongside horizontal drilling methods, is evolving and also noted there are multiple fractures within hydrocarbon reservoirs and higher pressures than seen before. She also said that federal regulators are deferring to states if their oversight is sufficiently strong. “If the state standards meet or exceed the federal standards, we will be going with the state or tribal standards. ... [I]n many cases, the standards don’t exist or are variable within states, and so we felt that they needed to be modernized on federal lands,” Jewell said during her first appearance before the House panel since her April confirmation. The regulation, which has been proposed in draft form, will address disclosure of chemicals used in the fracking process and also set requirements on well integrity and management of so-called flowback water. Fracking is enabling a U.S. oil and gas production boom but bringing fears of water pollution along with it. It involves high-pressure injections of water, chemicals and sand into shale formations to open seams that enable gas and oil to escape.

Refinery crude oil inputs reached 16.2 million barrels a day during the week of July 12, the highest level since August 2005, the Energy Information Administration said today. Domestic production plus imports totaled 15.2 million barrels a day, and 6.9 million barrels were withdrawn from storage, sending stockpiles to their lowest level since January. “The import number is actually too low, it’s still not enough to keep stocks from drawing,” said Andrew Lebow, senior vice president of Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “We really need about a million barrels a day more imports.” Rising output from oilfields including North Dakota’s Bakken shale and the Eagle Ford in Texas pushed U.S. oil production up 1.2 percent to 7.49 million barrels a day, the highest level since December 1990. Imports increased 2.4 percent from the previous week to 7.71 million barrels a day. That wasn’t enough to satisfy a surge in demand for crude amid a temporary shortage in supply because of flooding in Canada, the U.S.’s largest source of imported oil. Stockpiles have dropped 27.1 million barrels in three weeks to 367 million. Restarting Refineries “The Midwest is short crude following Canada flooding and refinery restarts,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Longson said in a note to clients this week. “Canada is slowly returning and the pace of draws should slow as early as next week.” Refinery utilization rates increased by 0.4 percentage point to 92.8 percent, the EIA said. That’s the highest level in almost a year.
