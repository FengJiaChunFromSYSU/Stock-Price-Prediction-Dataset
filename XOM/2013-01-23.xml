These facilities are part of a seven-project programme in wind energy totalising 1,003.2 MW. Based in Quebec province, the Massif du Sud wind power plant is located in the south of Quebec City in the Chaudière-Appalaches region, while the Lac Alfred power plant is located in the north-east of Quebec City in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. Each power plant is comprised of 75 wind turbines supplied by REpower and they will generate together sufficient electricity to supply approximately 70,000 average homes. Hydro Québec will buy the power under 20-year power purchase agreements. As part of an agreement between REpower and EDF Energies Nouvelles, the installed turbines include a significant amount of locally manufactured content. The towers, the blades and the converters were built in different regions of Quebec. Developed and built by EDF EN Canada, the projects together generated more than 600 jobs during the construction phase and will create 20 to 30 permanent jobs for operation and maintenance services, which will be provided by EDF Renewable Services Canada. Both companies are local subsidiaries of EDF Energies Nouvelles. Following the commissioning of Saint-Robert-Bellarmin wind power plant (80 MW) in October 2012, Massif du Sud and Lac Alfred represent the second and third wind energy projects of the seven awarded in 2008 and 2010 to EDF Energies Nouvelles in Canada through Hydro Québec wind energy calls for tenders. The Company will develop and build under this programme, which runs until 2015, a total of 1,003.2 MW in the province. edf-energies-nouvellesDOTcom/en/press/press-releases/edf-energies-nouvelles-commissions-300-mw-of-wind-power-in-quebec</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358962363872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:32:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358963383844-14</Id><Title>Wind farm towers: They're taller, slower with more power</Title><Msg>Wind farm towers: They're taller, slower with more power Article by: DAVID SHAFFER , Star Tribune Updated: September 10, 2012 - 9:09 PM Wind farm towers rise higher above the landscape to capture more wind. Yet their blades turn more slowly. It's not an optical illusion. The newest wind turbines gracing the nation's countryside actually are turning more slowly than their older cousins. The languid pace is the most visible consequence of new-generation wind turbines that are taller, have longer blades, capture more wind and produce more power. The first Minnesota wind farm with towers reaching 100 meters, or 328 feet, is now under construction by Juwi Wind near Worthington in southwestern Minnesota. The towers will be about three-fourths the height of Foshay Tower (not counting its pinnacle) in Minneapolis. Across the nation, the wind power industry is reaching higher into the atmosphere and adding bigger rotor blades to boost electrical output. Last year, nearly 5 percent of new U.S. wind turbines were 100 meters tall, and the push upward is expected to continue, according to the American Wind Energy Association. "That trend has been underway for 30 years, and really there is no reason to expect it to stop," said Fort Felker, director of the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Boulder, Colo. "Generally you get stronger winds at higher elevations above the ground." Most wind towers built in the last few years reached 80 meters, or 262 feet, at the blade hub. Older units can be half that height, with correspondingly smaller blades that capture less wind area even as they spin at a faster pace. Mortenson Construction, based in Golden Valley, is a pioneer in this industry trend, building 100-meter towers at five wind farms in Texas, New York, Illinois and Iowa. Taller towers in Minnesota Juwi Wind, a German renewable energy company whose U.S. headquarters is in Boulder, is installing 15 turbines on 100-meter towers at a 3,000-acre wind farm in the Buffalo Ridge region northwest of Worthington. The project is expected to be finished this fall. "We are farming more wind," said Aaron Peterson, a former state legislator who is now manager of community relations and regulatory affairs for Juwi, pronounced ''you-vee.'' Data from the Iowa Energy Center indicate that wind at a height of 100 meters flows 4 1/2 percent faster than at 80 meters, Peterson said. Because wind energy increases at a logarithmic rate to wind speed, the energy gain from the extra height should be about 14 percent, he said. The 30 megawatts of power generated by the Community Wind South project will be sold to Xcel Energy Inc., the Minneapolis-based utility, under a 25-year purchase agreement. That's roughly the power used by 10,000 homes. Juwi owns 95 percent of the approximately $55 million project. The remaining 5 percent stake is being offered to qualified landowners in or near the project site and transmission lines, Peterson said. The construction is winding up as the wind power industry faces the expiration of a key incentive. The industry has lobbied Congress to reauthorize the production tax credit, but while the Dec. 31 deadline looms, many future wind power projects are on hold. Current projects need to be finished this year, or lose out. Why so slow? The paradox of bigger wind machines rotating more slowly than older models illustrates the complex science of wind speed and efficiency. On the big, newer turbines, the blade tips are moving at nearly the same speed as the older, faster-rotating models -- about 160 miles per hour, experts said. If the long blades rotated much faster, experts said, the tips would go too fast, and be too loud. The bigger blades' advantage is that they cover a greater area, collecting more wind flow. "They are much more efficient because of the amount of energy they are capturing," said Mark Ahlstrom, CEO of WindLogics Inc., a St. Paul firm that assesses wind conditions for wind energy projects. Taller towers allow turbines to have longer blades. But they also offer a separate, related benefit -- wind tends to be stronger and steadier higher above the ground. "If you go up high enough," said Ahlstrom, "the winds are not influenced by the interaction with the Earth." Ahlstrom said the extra height can boost not only the average wind speed, but the percentage of time that a turbine is producing power. For wind farm developers, he added, the costs of building taller units, which require more concrete and steel, must be weighed against the long-term gain in output. Wind power, like other forms of power generation, also faces increased competition from natural gas, whose price recently hit a 10-year low thanks to expanded U.S. drilling using innovative extraction techniques. Even so, Peterson said he "cautiously optimistic" that wind power will grow increasingly efficient and competitive with fossil fuels. "The technology continues to improve," he said. "Developers just don't quit and manufacturers are always tweaking, improving and competing." startribuneDOTcom/business/169258976.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358963383844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:49:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358965900797-15</Id><Title>State Department delays Keystone pipeline decision</Title><Msg>State Department delays Keystone pipeline decision By Timothy Gardner and Andrew Quinn WASHINGTON | Tue Jan 22, 2013 5:31pm EST (Reuters) - The Obama administration has delayed a decision on TransCanada Corp's rerouted Keystone XL oil pipeline until after March, even though Nebraska's governor on Tuesday approved a plan for part of the line running through his state. "We don't anticipate being able to conclude our own review before the end of the first quarter of this year," said Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman at the State Department, which had previously said it would make a decision by that deadline. She said the department would take into consideration approval of the line by Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman. Interest in The fate of the $5.3 billion pipeline that would link Canada's oil sands to refineries in Texas has been heightened after President Barack Obama promised to fight climate change. Obama said in his inaugural address on Monday the United States will respond to the threat of climate change and that failure to do so would "betray our children and future generations. The Keystone pipeline is staunchly opposed by environmentalists, who say it will lock the United States for 50 years into dependence on fuel that has higher emissions than average crude oil refined in the United States. They want the State Department to re-examine the climate impact of the line after it previously said the project would not result in additional emissions because the oil would find its way to market even if Keystone were not built. It was the latest delay on the pipeline, which has been pending for more than four years. Last year Obama threw his support behind the southern section of the line, which is now being built and would help drain a glut of crude in the nation's midsection resulting from new oil drilling in North Dakota. The State Department will rule on a final permit for the northern section of the line because it would cross the national border. It expects to issue a draft environmental assessment of the Keystone line in the near future and before the end of March, a second official at the department said. That report will have a public comment period before the department makes a final decision on the line. NEBRASKA APPROVES PIPELINE SECTION Nuland's comments came shortly after Nebraska's governor approved a revised route in his state for the Keystone XL pipeline. Heineman, a Republican, sent a letter to President Obama on Tuesday that said TransCanada would adhere to 57 safety conditions. Those include rigorous pipeline design, testing and the reporting of leaks. It would also avoid Nebraska's ecologically sensitive Sandhills region. TransCanada had submitted a new route for the northern pipeline, expected to transport 830,000 barrels per day of oil, after the Obama administration had rejected an initial plan. Environmentalists had complained it would cross ecologically sensitive regions in Nebraska. Heineman said TransCanada would provide evidence that it is carrying $200 million in third party insurances to cover any cleanup costs from leaks. He approved the line even though his state's environmental regulator said this month it would still cross a section of the massive Ogallala aquifer, an important source of irrigation and fresh water to the Great Plains states. Nuland said Nebraska's decision was important but gave no clues about what the State Department's review would say. "Our processes move in parallel," she told reporters. "We obviously want to take the Nebraska environmental study, we want to compare it with the work that we've done." TRANSCANADA CONFIDENT TransCanada's CEO Russ Girling, who attended Obama's inauguration, said he was not worried by the president's latest comments, and that the Nebraska decision was "hugely positive step forward." Regarding the State Department's eventual decision, he added: "I'm still optimistic that this thing can be done in a relatively short period of time." Girling said work on the southern section of the pipeline, now called the Gulf Coast project, is on schedule. Robert Johnston, a risk management analyst at the Eurasia Group, however, has warned that the decision could be delayed until the summer as environmentalists push for public hearings and a review by the Environmental Protection Agency. Many Republicans in Congress support the pipeline for the jobs it would bring to their states. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota said he is making preparations to reintroduce legislation enabling Congress to approve the line if Obama does not. He could attempt to attach the measure to a must-pass bill. Similar attempts have failed in the past. reutersDOTcom/article/2013/01/22/us-usa-keystone-nebraska-idUSBRE90L0X220130122</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358965900797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:31:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358966377617-16</Id><Title>Iowa utility agrees to stop using coal at five generators</Title><Msg>Iowa utility agrees to stop using coal at five generators Article by: DAVID SHAFFER , Star Tribune Updated: January 22, 2013 - 8:51 PM MidAmerican Energy Co. ended a legal threat by reaching the settlement with Sierra Club. 0 comments An Iowa utility owned by Warren Buffet-led Berkshire Hathaway said Tuesday it would stop burning coal at five electric generators in a settlement that ends the threat of litigation by the Sierra Club over their smokestack emissions. MidAmerican Energy Co., that state's largest electric company, also agreed to install a solar array at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and to complete pollution-control upgrades on two other Iowa coal-burning generating units by the end of next year. The company said it will cease burning coal in the five Iowa generating units by April 2016 and hasn't decided whether to convert them to burn natural gas. The units, ranging in age from 40 to 63 years old, are at three power plants in Sergeant Bluff and Council Bluffs on Iowa's western side and Bettendorf on the eastern side. MidAmerican's decision comes as utilities across the nation are weighing whether to upgrade or retire aging coal-burning power plants in the face of deadlines to control mercury and other pollutants. In Minnesota, six older generators originally fired by coal in Rochester and Burnsville are being retired, and decisions on several others are expected this year. MidAmerican spokeswoman Tina Potthoff said during an interview that the company had been considering an end to coal at the five units, and that Tuesday's settlement made it official. She said upgrades to two coal units in Sergeant Bluff had been approved by regulators in December. The Sierra Club, as part of its "Beyond Coal" campaign, last year notified MidAmerican that it intended to file a federal lawsuit alleging violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act at the Iowa power plants. The company denied that it has violated the law, but decided not to go to court. A proposed consent decree was filed Tuesday with the U.S. District Court for Iowa's southern district. "The retirement of these plants means our campaign has achieved an important milestone: we have helped retire more than 50,000 megawatts of coal power," said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose Bloomberg Philanthropies has contributed $50 million to the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. In a statement, Bloomberg said Iowans join those "who are helping to end our nation's dependency on coal and move the U.S. toward a cleaner energy future." Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, acquired MidAmerican in 2000 and, since then, the utility has become the U.S. leader in company-owned wind power. The company serves 732,000 electric customers and 714,000 natural gas customers in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota. "More and more it is making economic sense for utilities to be retiring these units," Emily Rosenwasser, a Chicago-based spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, said of MidAmerican's decision. "They were already considering it, and they looked at the numbers and realized coal was not the path forward for them." startribuneDOTcom/business/187984691.html?refer=y</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358966377617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:39:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358967662189-17</Id><Title>White House starts review of revised gas ‘fracking’ rule</Title><Msg>White House starts review of revised gas ‘fracking’ rule By Ben Geman - 01/23/13 08:53 AM ET The Interior Department on Tuesday sent the White House a new draft of rules to govern oil-and-gas “fracking” on federal and Indian lands. The rules on hydraulic fracturing, the controversial oil-and-gas development method, have been delayed as Interior undertakes revisions. Interior plans to issue a new draft of the rules, which were first floated last May, in the first quarter of 2013 after review by the White House Office of Management and Budget. But officials have not provided a timeline for issuing final standards, which are slated to require industry disclosure of chemicals used in the fracking process, among other requirements.

This means that 6.6GW of offshore wind power is now either operational, under construction or consented in the UK. The two wind farms at Race Bank (580MW) and Dudgeon (560MW) in the Greater Wash could generate enough electricity to power around 730,000 homes. The projects represent around £3bn of investment. An application for a third project at Docking Shoal, also off the Norfolk Coast, has however been refused due to the potential impact on seabirds in the area. These birds (Sandwich terns) are specially protected by environmental legislation. Charles Hendry, Minister of State for Energy, said: "The UK is racing ahead of the global field and these two new offshore wind farms underline this momentum. "These two projects will not only bring us considerable amounts of clean energy, but significant investment and jobs too. "We have also shown that we are mindful of other consequences, such as the impact on bird populations, in deciding that it would not be appropriate to consent all three applications." buildDOTcoDOTuk/construction_newsDOTasp?newsid=157246</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1358968628258</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:17:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358970312771-19</Id><Topic><Title>XOM is bad.
