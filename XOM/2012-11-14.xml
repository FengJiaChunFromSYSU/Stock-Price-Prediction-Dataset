Upton: 'I'm not a carbon tax guy' - opened the door to discussing carbon taxes in fiscal talks if Republicans initiated the push</Title><Msg>Rep. Upton: 'I'm not a carbon tax guy' By Zack Colman and Ben Geman - 11/13/12 07:56 PM ET House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) threw cold water Tuesday on supporting a carbon tax, hours after a Treasury Department official said the administration could consider the idea if Republicans lead the effort. A tax on greenhouse gas emissions has won increased attentoin in recent weeks as a way to combat climate change and simultaneously raise revenues. But Upton (R-Mich.) said Tuesday he is “not a carbon tax guy.” The administration said last week it would not propose a carbon tax. But Gilbert E. Metcalf, Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment, reiterated that position Tuesday, opened the door to discussing carbon taxes in fiscal talks if Republicans initiated the push. Upton comments Tuesday underscore how unlikely that scenario is as talks about avoiding the "fiscal cliff" unfold. Asked if he would accept a carbon tax along with a tax cut elsewhere, Upton said, "I don’t like the idea." But Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said a carbon tax has the potential to win wider support. “There is a growing sense that this might be a lot easier way to raise revenue than some of the other alternatives that we have been facing over the last couple of years,” he said, noting support among some GOP economists and other Republicans, including Reagan-era Secretary of State George Shultz. He called it a way to raise revenues and help address the danger of climate change. “It seems to me that both problems could be solved together,” Waxman said. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/267753-upton-im-not-a-carbon-tax-guy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352875032016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:37:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352875847113-4</Id><Title>Obama to open talks with $1.6 trillion plan to raise taxes on corporations, wealthy</Title><Msg>Obama to open talks with $1.6 trillion plan to raise taxes on corporations, wealthy By Zachary A. Goldfarb and Lori Montgomery, Updated: Tuesday, November 13, 6:52 PM President Obama is taking a hard line with congressional Republicans heading into negotiations over the year-end fiscal cliff, making no opening concessions and calling for far more in new taxes than Republicans have so far been willing to consider. Obama plans to open talks using his most recent budget proposal, which sought to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy by $1.6 trillion over the next decade, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. That’s double the sum that House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) offered Obama during secret debt negotiations in 2011. Obama has been pressing to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year for the wealthiest 2 percent of the nation’s households, a tax hike adamantly opposed by Republicans. But Carney suggested that even the revenue generated by letting those tax cuts end would not be enough to tame the national debt and reenergize the economy. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy J. Geithner and other senior Democrats on Tuesday said Obama would not be willing to maintain the Bush tax rates in exchange for a cap on deductions for households earning more than $250,000 a year, a leading Republican alternative. “I don’t see how you do this without higher rates. I don’t think there’s any feasible, realistic way to do it,” Geithner said at a conference in Washington. “When you take a cold, hard look at the amount of resources you can raise from that top 2 percent of Americans through limiting deductions, you will find yourself disappointed relative to the magnitude of the revenue increases that we need.” Democrats said Obama is likely to maintain a tough stance Friday, when Boehner and other congressional leaders are due to gather at the White House for their first face-to-face discussions about how to avoid the fiscal cliff. Fresh off a resounding electoral victory in which they kept the White House and picked up seats in the House and Senate, Democrats said there is no reason to compromise now on a central plank of the president’s platform. “It was an intrinsic part of his campaign, and the public supports it. So what more do you want?” said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), the senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. GOP reaction Though Republicans have offered fresh revenue in a deal to avoid the cliff, they have not proposed a specific target. Boehner suggested that negotiations resume on terms discussed in 2011, when he offered to raise $800 billion over the next decade through a rewrite of the tax code. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) endorsed that general idea Tuesday but warned Obama not to overplay his hand, noting that the president’s $1.6 trillion tax request failed to receive a single vote in Congress in the spring. “We’re calling on him to lead, to take the initiative, propose a plan that’s actually designed to succeed,” McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. “I’m not asking the president . . . to adopt our principles. I’m simply asking him to respect our principles by not insisting that we compromise them. Because we won’t.” Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith declined to comment directly on the president’s opening bid. “The Speaker proposed a way both parties can work together to avert the fiscal cliff without increased tax rates, through a combination of entitlement reforms and revenue via tax reform,” Smith said in a statement. “Republicans believe this is consistent with the president’s call for a ‘balanced’ approach, and the Speaker looks forward to talking with the president about such a path.” The public is skeptical that a deal can be reached. By 51 percent to 38 percent, more Americans predict Obama and Republicans will not reach an agreement by the end of the year, according to a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. The survey found widespread anxiety over the consequences of failure. According to the poll, more than six in 10 Americans believe that missing the fiscal-cliff deadline would have an overall negative impact on the U.S. economy. Without a deal, taxes will jump for nine in 10 Americans, with the steepest hikes for top income brackets. But Republicans in Congress may face more public pressure to make concessions. Should negotiations break down to avoid the $500 billion of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts, 53 percent are inclined to blame Republicans in Congress while 29 percent single out Obama. Carney said Tuesday that Obama would reprise his plan from earlier this year to raise $1.6 trillion in taxes by raising tax rates, imposing a new special tax on millionaires and scaling back deductions and loopholes. “We know what a truly balanced approach to our fiscal challenges looks like,” Carney said. “The president has put forward a very specific plan that will be what he brings to the table when he sits down with congressional leaders.” Obama’s budget request Obama’s 2013 budget sought to reduce borrowing over the next 10 years by about $4 trillion, counting $1.1 trillion in agency cuts already in force. In addition to raising taxes, Obama proposed to slice $340 billion from health-care programs and to count about $1 trillion in savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His budget request did not include reductions to health and retirement benefits, but Obama did consider such changes in his 2011 talks with Boehner, including raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 and applying a stingier measure of inflation to Social Security. Senior Democrats, meanwhile, threw cold water on a competing proposal to scale back deductions that disproportionately benefit upper-income taxpayers while keeping the top tax rates at their present level. On Tuesday, former Clinton administration Treasury secretary Robert Rubin wrote in the New York Times that closing loopholes and deductions would not be an acceptable solution to the nation’s fiscal challenges. And Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who is set to become chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said she “has not seen how the math works to let you come up with the additional revenue.” In a meeting Tuesday, Obama offered no specific assurances to liberal leaders about what a final deal might look like and what entitlement programs might face cuts. But Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association and a participant in the session, said Obama did not have to make such assurances. “He hasn’t wavered through the whole campaign,” Van Roekel said. “He’s been consistent on [his] message, and I don’t think he’ll change it now.” Van Roekel described Obama and Vice President Biden as friendly, upbeat and attentive as the group leaders expressed support for the president’s firm campaign-trail promises to roll back the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy. Obama mostly listened, Van Roekel said, occasionally asking questions. “Everybody in that room had worked very hard for the reelection of President Obama, so there was a good feeling in the room from the very moment we walked in until the time we left,” Van Roekel said. washingtonpostDOTcom/business/economy/obama-to-open-fiscal-talks-with-plan-to-raise-taxes-on-wealthy/2012/11/13/9984cd78-2dc1-11e2-89d4-040c9330702a_story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352875847113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:50:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352876394554-5</Id><Title>California's cap-and-trade auction starts Wednesday</Title><Msg>California's cap-and-trade auction starts Wednesday By DALE KASLER The Sacramento Bee SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Despite fierce opposition from much of the business community, California's grand experiment in taming global warming begins in earnest Wednesday. State officials are set to auction tens of millions of dollars worth of carbon-emission allowances to scores of oil refiners, cement manufacturers and other large industrial polluters. The computerized auction marks the beginning of California's "cap-and-trade" market. The market is the centerpiece of AB 32, the state's 2006 law aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, and Wednesday's kickoff is being closely watched. "A lot of eyes are on us," said Harold Pestana, a senior manager at Pacific Gas and Electric Co., one of the companies affected by the state law. Cap and trade will force affected companies to scale back their carbon pollution - or purchase allowances to get into compliance. State officials and environmentalists say the market-based approach gives companies flexibility in how they reduce emissions. Many affected businesses call it a cleverly disguised tax that will cost them upwards of $1 billion in the first year. The expense will balloon in 2015, when refineries will have to buy more credits to cover greenhouse gases spewed by cars and trucks. "It's going to be a huge burden," said Shelly Sullivan of the AB 32 Implementation Group, a business coalition. "That turns into a multibillion-dollar energy tax on the state's economy." Her group, which includes the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers &amp; Technology Association, has petitioned Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown to abort the auction. But the auction is expected to proceed. "Everything is still on schedule; we're moving forward," said spokesman Stanley Young of the California Air Resources Board, the agency running the auction. Carbon trading isn't new. Polluters in the European Union have been subject to a greenhouse gas market since 2005, and a similar program covers power plants in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. But until Wednesday, when carbon trading comes to California, it's never been tried on a large scale in America. More than 62 million allowances - each representing the right to emit a ton of carbon - will be offered for sale in a three-hour window starting at 10 a.m. PST. The minimum bid price is $10 a ton. The auction will be a low-key affair. It will be run electronically, with a half-dozen staffers monitoring the bidding behind closed doors at agency headquarters in Sacramento. "This happens in a sealed room with no windows," said David Clegern, another agency spokesman. The agency says potential buyers aren't allowed to publicly discuss their purchasing plans, out of fear that disclosure could skew the market. Results of the auction, including pricing and volume, won't be revealed until next Monday. Some analysts believe many potential bidders will sit out Wednesday's auction. Another auction is set for February, and there will be regular auctions each year. Besides, companies needing carbon credits will be able to buy them on the open market and don't have to go through the state. Uncertainty could dampen bidding in the first auction as well. Jon Costantino, head of the Association of Carbon Market Participants, said bidders might be dissuaded by rumors circulating that an industry group could file a last-second lawsuit to block the auction. Analysts say the uncertainty has caused prices to drop on private futures markets where California carbon credits have been traded for months. The per-ton price, which had been around $20 over the summer, has fallen to around $12, according to Bloomberg business news. Low prices could undermine the state's goal of curtailing emissions. If carbon is cheap, there's less incentive for industries to reduce their pollution. That's why the Air Resources Board has set a $10 minimum on bidding in the state's auction. While businesses complain about costs, environmentalists say a strong carbon price will pay dividends for the economy: It will give polluters an incentive to invest in green technologies to clean up their smokestacks. The market will work like this: California has set an overall ceiling on the amount of carbon that can be emitted. The cap will decline by 2 percent to 3 percent a year. By 2020, emissions are supposed to fall to 1990 levels. The affected companies include more than 400 of California's industrial heavyweights. They will get 90 percent of their emission allowances free in the first two years, but the percentage of freebies will decline in future years. Business groups say California could achieve its goals of curtailing carbon without holding an auction. The state, they say, could simply give away all of the emissions allowances for free, and then enforce the cap. As companies move toward compliance, they will buy and sell the allowances among themselves and a price will emerge for carbon. But state officials reject that argument. The Air Resources Board says an auction is needed to jump-start the market and make sure a competitive price for carbon is established. California was hoping the market would cover multiple Western states. But only the Canadian province of Quebec is linking its carbon with California's, starting next year. As a result, businesses in California say this go-it-alone approach leaves them at a cost disadvantage against companies in other states. "Our California operation is certainly exposed to out-of-state competition that does not have to comply," said Bruce Ray of Johns Manville, which runs a fiberglass insulation plant in Willows. Bill Klesse, the chief executive of Valero Energy Corp., owner of two California refineries, ripped the upcoming auction during a recent conference call with investors. "They're coming up with regulations that are totally not workable," he said. The big utilities are being treated differently than most participants. The state has crafted a complicated scheme designed to buffer their customers from major rate shock. How well the buffer works isn't yet known, however. "We can't really say what the cost impact to our customers is going to be," said Lynsey Paulo, spokeswoman for PG&amp;E, which supports the auction plan. "We know there's going to be one." Cap and trade should be pain-free for customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD said it has enough hydroelectricity and renewable energy that it won't need to buy any carbon allowances for at least several years, meaning there will be no cost to customers. kansascityDOTcom/2012/11/13/3915184/californias-cap-and-trade-auction.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352876394554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:59:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352878140533-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to open talks with $1.6 trillion plan to raise taxes on corporations, wealthy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352875847113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:50:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Carney said that the revenue from letting tax cuts expire wouldn't be enough?

The complaint, filed in a Sacramento state court on Tuesday, argues that California's landmark emissions reduction law AB 32 does not authorize the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to raise money beyond what is needed to cover its administrative costs through the sale of carbon allowances. The state expects to raise between $500 million and $1 billion through the sale of carbon allowances over the next fiscal year, largely through the sale of permits to cover 2015 emissions. But in the lawsuit, the business group calls those sales an "unconstitutional tax." "The current CARB proposal is the most costly way to implement AB 32, and it will hurt consumers, the job climate, and the ability of businesses to expand here," the chamber said on its website, where it posted a copy of the complaint. (Complaint filed by California Chamber of Commerce: rDOTreutersDOTcom/jyg93t ) The state on Wednesday is planning to sell 39.5 million allowances to cover emissions in 2015 and put those revenues into a new government account, where the funds are to be used for clean energy and energy efficiency programs to help the state drive down emissions further. Stanley Young, a spokesman for the resources board, said they are confident the cap-and-trade program will withstand any court challenge. "We are going forward with tomorrow's auction," Young said. That money is expected to be used to help the state further reduce its emissions, although the details of its use have still to be hammered out. California plans to give away 90 percent of the allowances for free at the outset of the program, a percentage that will diminish over time. California businesses including oil refineries and large manufacturers have complained that having to purchase 10 percent of their compliance obligation at the start of the program will put them at a competitive disadvantage to their out-of-state competitors. If the challenge succeeds, the state would be required to give all of the program's allowances for free to covered entities, an action that could pad the bottom lines of the very companies the program seeks to regulate, said Erica Morehouse, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. She said the challenge was more about injecting uncertainty into the market than about raising legitimate legal claims, and said she doesn't expect it to succeed. California manufacturers voiced their support for the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying that the Air Resources Board was in the wrong in trying to turn the auction into a money raiser. "There is a distinct difference between a good cap-and-trade program that helps reduce greenhouse gases with minimal costs and an auction that is designed to extract billions from industry," said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers &amp; Technology Association. "We support any legal action to ensure that California gets what it was promised - a cost-effective, technologically feasible, and legal regulatory plan to reach our emission goals," he said. reutersDOTcom/article/2012/11/14/us-california-carbon-lawsuit-idUSBRE8AC18B20121114 -------------------------------------------------------------- California takes big step in limiting greenhouse gases By Rory Carroll SAN FRANCISCO | Wed Nov 14, 2012 3:00am EST (Reuters) - California is set to unveil a new weapon in its fight against global climate change on Wednesday when it holds its first sale of carbon emissions permits - a landmark experiment that it hopes will serve as a model for other U.S. states and the federal government. The state's carbon auction is a key step in the initiation of its "cap-and-trade" program, a policy where the state sets a limit, or cap, on the amount of heat-trapping gases released by manufacturers, oil refineries, electric utilities and other large emitting businesses. Those companies can then either reduce their emissions or purchase carbon permits, also known as "allowances," on the open market from companies that have extras - the "trade" part of cap and trade. The number of allowances in the system will decline over time. Environmentalists have long advocated cap-and-trade as a market-based means of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Thirty European countries have been using it since 2005, and markets are operating or in development in Australia, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Quebec and South Korea. With Superstorm Sandy drawing attention to climate change and a strong Democratic showing in last week's election, carbon emission limits could again be on the national political agenda in the United States. But past efforts to implement cap-and-trade nationally have faltered in the face of opposition from congressional Republicans and others who say it will increase energy costs. The California Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday filed a lawsuit to stop the California auction of emissions permits, contending that the state had exceeded its authority in making the program a revenue-generator. Sale of carbon allowances is expected to generate at least $1 billion a year. The cap-and-trade program, which initially covers 350 businesses, is a key component of AB 32, California's landmark 2006 law, which called for the state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020. That's a reduction of about 15 percent. "The cap-and-trade auction is a huge milestone for California because it kick-starts a program that is the strongest and boldest move yet in the U.S. to protect public health and the environment from climate change," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. INFLUENCE California is responsible for about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, so influencing others to follow suit and eventually link to the California market will be critical to the program's success. "Our overall impact is small," said Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, the agency implementing the program. "What we do will not solve the problem. But we want to demonstrate that this type of system can work." Cap-and-trade supporters believe California's market is launching during a favorable time politically. Environmentalists were buoyed by the re-election of state Senator Fran Pavley, the author of AB 32 who survived a tough challenge in a redrawn Southern California district. Democratic electoral gains last week, which are likely to give the party a super-majority in the state legislature, also may bolster support for the program. The re-election of President Barack Obama ensures the federal government will not interfere with the program. And it is possible that legislation creating a carbon tax or national cap-and-trade program could be introduced in the coming years. But California's market is still highly controversial and lawyers on all sides expect the state Air Resources Board to face challenges in court. The companies that operate California's 13 oil refineries have been vocal opponents of the program, arguing that it could lead to the closure of five to seven refining facilities. Oil company opposition is likely to increase when the program expands in 2015 to cover emissions from distributors of transportation and home heating fuels. Wednesday marks an important day for the new market, but it may take years before its success or failure can be truly measured. "It's a very long-term effort," said Richard McNeil, an attorney with Snell &amp; Wilmer, which represents California electric utilities. "I think you'll see some tumultuous times market-wise and I think you'll see additional legal challenges. The big question is - will we ultimately see the benefits? It will be a while before anyone can answer that." reutersDOTcom/article/2012/11/14/us-california-carbon-auction-idUSBRE8AD0F220121114</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352891641524</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:14:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352891666076-12</Id><Topic><Title>wahleee boy?</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352840751976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 16:05:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wahlee has a pea brain after failed lobotomy's.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1352891666076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:14:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352894545809-13</Id><Title>SHORT GM , ITS GOING BROKE !!</Title><Msg>66666666666666</Msg><Username>lookkkkinggooddddd</Username><Timestamp>1352894545809</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 07:02:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352897141450-14</Id><Title>Live Long and Prosper</Title><Msg>But Obama does not like it.</Msg><Username>hillarys_hole</Username><Timestamp>1352897141450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 07:45:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352906267351-15</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to open talks with $1.6 trillion plan to raise taxes on corporations, wealthy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352875847113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:50:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No increasing taxes does in fact bring in more revenue. The English have nearly 1000 years of experience in this area, the French nearly 500, the Dutch 400... Increasing taxes will bring in more money to the Treasury. No country ever tried the experiment of cutting taxes and trying to "grow" its way out of a deficit and lived to tell the tale. Countries that lacked the institutional power to tax to fund its obligations - like Russia - collapsed in Revolution. France faced many difficulties when it tried to collect all its taxes from the poor. Then it raised taxes massively during the Revolution and Napoleon and the economy did much better - its credit rating was restored, it state bonds started to have value, and industry revived via military contracts. The USA tried an idiotic experiment in no taxation, and money printing to run itself during its Revolution and that failed too. It took taxes to establish the credit of the country.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352906267351</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 10:17:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352906396124-16</Id><Title>Idiots giving away free money...</Title><Msg>Every time in jumps in to the green, like this morning, just short it.

The U.S. Healthcare system will need to be nationalized to put an end to the rising costs, which if they are not contained would throw the Federal Budget into deficit again. Corporations cannot afford to pay the rising costs either and will eventually abolish most health plans... So its time for the Feds to take over healthcare. It would have been better if this was implemented more slowly, such as under HillaryCare, but that option is no longer available.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352906756641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 10:25:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352906947361-18</Id><Topic><Title>wahleee boy?</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352840751976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 16:05:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wahleee is very disappointing.

Ancien Régime: high military spending, financed by borrowing, funded by taxes on the poor &amp; middle class Republican Party: high military spending, financed by borrowing, funded by taxes on the poor &amp; middle class Ancien Régime: education conducted by various religious orders or academies of, by, and for the elite. Republican Party: education agenda focused on private schools and vouchers to support the same and/or cuts to public education funding. Ancien Régime: social polices based on religion and tradition Republican Party: social policies based on religion and tradition And people wonder why they lost?

From chemicals, to drugs, to transportation, to steel, to fuels, to retail, to banking, to insurance, electronics, to electrical equipment, to utilities, to machinery, to brokerage, big business dominates the economy. Big Business is responsible for most R&amp;D in the economy, as are Universities which are the equivalent of Government Sponsored Big Businesses. Technology and R&amp;D is a key driver of economic growth and small business has almost nothing to do with it at all. #2 Lower marginal tax rates, supposedly to support small businesses, lead to faster economic growth. Reality: The fastest economic growth rates in American history occurred during World War I when the income tax was rapidly increased, and during the New Deal till the Carter administration when it 70%-90%, and again under the Clinton administration. Economic growth rates during the 1920s, inclusive of the crash which followed the small government tax cutting 1920s, were horrible. Economic growth rates during the Reagan administration were barely passable compared with the periods with higher tax rates, below growth rates in Europe in Japan during that period, and bought at the cost of trillions in debt. Economic growth rates during the Bush administration were poor, too, and Obama's record, yet another administration marked by low taxes, have been poor too. #3 Free trade and banking deregulation is good for the economy Reality: Free trade has not led to faster economic growth since it was foisted on the economy, and has served only to increase the instability of the financial markets as foreign exchange earned abroad is recycled into purchases of American assets via Wall Street. The orgy of mortgage and credit card debt that followed the various banking deregulation pushes, from Reagan to the Republican Congress of the 1990s, have proven to be a disaster for the economy, especially when combined with rising energy prices and declining disposable incomes for the very people the financiers are counting on to repay the rising debt.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1352914271952</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:31:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352927582810-23</Id><Title>Atlas Shrugging...</Title><Msg>In Rockefeller Center.

Could it be power rates are 3 times what they were only a decade ago? Or perhaps $10-$11/gallon for petro has something to do with it. China's economy is a house of cards built on phony construction numbers, and infrastructure investments that requires cheap oil to generate a rate of return. They've destroyed their environment with coal fired power plants and industrial pollution. The cheap oil will come, but it will be too late for them... Of course there are these discussions about the "fiscal cliff." Obama and the GOP couldn't manage their way out of wet paper bag. There's no way that will end well for anybody.

What does that mean? 1. Outlawing the ownership of gold and mandating it be sold to the U.S. Treasury at the price it is still carried at on the books of the Federal Reserve (about $38/$39/oz). 2. Taxing individual incomes up to 91% as they did during World War II. 3. Abolishing nearly all deductions in the tax code from home interest to charitable. 4. Raising taxes on corporations worldwide profits to at least 50%. 5. Nationalizing key industries as Great Britain did during and after World War II, and which the U.S. did during World War I. You cannot expect the price they pay to in anyway represent the value they trade at now. The taxes they will impose will dramatically lower their value and what they have to pay when they finally do nationalize them. I find your view that the dollar will become weak unconvincing. They can make it very strong, indeed, by wiping out much of the credit in the economy with taxes in a desperate attempt to maintain control. Most of the economy is credit, about $60 in credit per dollar of actual currency.
