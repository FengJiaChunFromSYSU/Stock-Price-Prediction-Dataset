The profit will help the dear fräulein I mentioned previously who I can’t exactly just send back to the wolves in the USA in fall to be eaten by debt collectors – not after she honestly admitted she wants to be one of us, and at the most sincere and intimate level. Queen bee wants her stay in this house for a year on an au pair visa with health care and salary. That will be easy. She can fix the coffee and collect whoever else’s money it was I made for her the other day in compensation for her coffee fixing services. She can receive suitors whenever she wants and learn German to a level suitable for graduate school. My friend from Düsseldorf helped with her self-esteem. She needed to feel that there was nothing wrong with her and that she was very desirable and sexy. One more professional, after she completes graduate school couldn’t hurt either. . Germany could put her to work in the war on fossil fuels. Making pretty, smart little babies with good genes, is a good occupation too, which I think she will apply herself to eventually. It is just shameful the way the USA lets such good genes go to waste in favor of welfare, and cheap low taxed oil for lower class people. But then the USA is run by Big Oil interest and n;: e;: g;: r;: o interests so this is not surprising.... Just dreadful.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373170210869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 00:10:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373216218526-2</Id><Topic><Title>hansesteelyard &amp; bluecheese have serious OCD</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371420582357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 18:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Back to the top !</Msg><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1373216218526</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 12:56:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373253756555-3</Id><Title>Where the C.S.A. flag and grey army uniform came from &amp; War on Fossil Fuels recruit training</Title><Msg>Both were designed by Nicola Marschall, a German educated at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. This little piece of information was brought to my attention by my fräulein houseguest (Nicole), originally from Charleston, South Carolina. She was so sweet to tell me. I didn’t even know this piece of info. It is surely worth relaying. More too on this exciting theme: the ladies bought a couple copies of Gone with the Wind yesterday afternoon and I’ve started reading every last word of it to them in German from the English text – with my Freyja in my lap reading along silently, and Nicole stretched out on the sofa in the opposite direction with me rubbing her feet occasionally. My new recruit in the war on fossil fuels must be tutored thoroughly in German to complete her mission and this is a pleasant way to start. The Guns of the South is fanciful read but well charged with good themes. It’s fitting too that the future date the author picked for travel backward -150 years to undo the disaster of multiculturalism was 2014 – not far off. The geriatrics, traitors, and oil runts can rant and rave as they always do.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1373253756555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 23:22:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
