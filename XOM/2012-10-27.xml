Mitt is a fraud. Anyone who votes for this say anything liar is a fool who deserves the failed state he will bring you and future generations. So far Obama is winning the electoral map. Revealing Mitt as the Lying Corporate scab that he is and how he'll gladly ship your job to China for higher executive pay is how Obama can win. It's all they have to do. Just remind people Romney's a liar and that Obama's policies are working.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1351343138664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:05:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351346531174-3</Id><Topic><Title>So Far Ohio Not Taking Romney Bait and Switch</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1351343138664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:05:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's policies are working????

Bush's failed policies were proven to be the sham they were. And here we are today slowly grinding FORWARD and growth in both the "markets" and jobs has returned.
