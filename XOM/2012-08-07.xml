By contrast, 67% of American wealth is direct investments in real estate or financial assets based on real estate. The value of real estate depends critically on the transportation cost gradient, and energy prices. The only times stocks have returned more than bonds over 10 year periods is when energy prices fell relative to labor costs and other goods.

In the era of the typewriter, telephone, and file cabinet it was much more difficult to set up production facilities in low labor cost areas, and areas without the protection of advanced legal regimes and regulations. Commodity type production or plantations type enclaves could be set up, as they had been for centuries with even more primitive technology, but for more advanced intermediate and final goods such things were much more difficult - corporate management simply did not want to live in such places, and without its physical presence there were severe limits to what could be outsourced. Modern information technology has removed most of those limits... Now ownership can be nested in the advanced economy with its advanced laws and regulations, much of the upper and middle level management can be remain in the advanced economy and keep in touch with corporate units overseas....

By Kris Bevill | August 06, 2012 In a margin environment with high corn prices, relatively low oil prices and stagnant consumer demand for gasoline, the ethanol industry has borne witness to razor thin margins. The crunch has caused everything from slowdowns to temporary full shutdowns as producers wait for prices to even out and attempt to pinpoint where they can squeeze even the smallest of profit increases out of each gallon of fuel they produce. It wasn’t always that way for the ethanol industry. A decade ago, ethanol producers may not have considered that type of incremental changes, but these days, a boost of even half a cent per gallon could make the difference between an operational or idled ethanol plant. Enter Mascoma Corp. While widely known for its proposed cellulosic ethanol production plans, Mascoma is a technology development firm with a few more tricks up its sleeve. Its specialty is a proprietary consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) platform. CBP is a conversion process in which microorganisms are used to hydrolyze and ferment sugars in one step, as opposed to traditional processes, which require enzymes to hydrolyze sugars and separate microorganisms to carry out fermentation. By definition, CBP requires the use of engineered microorganisms because natural organisms are not capable of simultaneously performing both functions, according to Mascoma. As Mascoma developed its CBP process, it engineered a yeast that can be applied in corn ethanol plants and has been proven to cut operating costs by reducing the plant’s enzyme requirements. The Mascoma Grain Technology yeast product, commercially known as TransFerm, is the first commercial application of the company’s CBP technology and is a drop-in, bioengineered substitute for conventional yeasts used in ethanol fermentation. Because the yeast itself expresses glucoamylase enzymes, it significantly reduces the amount of enzymes that would otherwise need to be purchased for ethanol production, according to the company. The reduced need for enzymes translates to a gross savings of 1 to 2 cents per gallon, says David Arkowitz, chief financial officer at Mascoma. “We’re replacing a significant amount of dollars that it costs to produce ethanol because the yeast makes its own enzymes,” he says. TransFerm was introduced to the market during the first quarter of this year but the product has already been used in more than 1,000 fermentations to produce more than 90 million gallons of ethanol at 15 ethanol plants, according to Mascoma estimates. That total includes six commercial customers as well as additional potential customers who are conducting trial runs to test the product at their facilities. The yeast is manufactured and distributed by Lallemand Ethanol Technology, which entered into a multiyear partnership with Mascoma in December to commercialize the product. Mascoma and Lallemand jointly market and sell TransFerm. As part of the agreement, Lallemand pays Mascoma a technology license fee and receives a portion of the net sales based on the market price of conventional yeast, as well as ongoing incentive payments based on sales performance. This is the first bioengineered yeast Lallemand Ethanol Technology has marketed at a commercial level, according to Craig Pilgrim, Global Marketing and Product Development Manager. “We’ve been involved in a lot of small incremental changes in the past,” he says. “You can only push biology so far and then you have to take the next step. For us, it’s great to see this product out there. It really is quite a step-change from what it was before in terms of savings and performance, so it’s very exciting for us to be involved, not only in partnership with Mascoma, but for the industry overall.” http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/9000/pinching-pennies</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344360827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:33:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344360860000-25</Id><Topic><Title>first ethanol producer to sign up to use the engineered yeast product</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344360827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:33:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Arkowitz says the product is still in the early days of availability, so it’s difficult to predict how many ethanol producers will be using the product by years end. For now, the companies are content to grow sales in a manageable fashion and continue to optimize the product. ICM Inc. signed on as Mascoma’s technology development partner in October and provided scale-up assistance and industry expertise to bring the product to market. Now that it has been introduced, the engineering firm is continuing to run lab tests and conduct other related work, Arkowitz says. The first few months of commercial operations have been positive, and the companies are very pleased with TransFerm’s performance thus far. “We’ve seen significant interest in this product,” Pilgrim says. “Margins are very, very tight so any kind of savings—especially in the 1 to 2 cents per gallon range—is a pretty good deal for them.” Valero Renewable Fuels Co. LLC, a Mascoma investor, was the first ethanol producer to sign up to use the engineered yeast product. The company signed a multiyear agreement with Mascoma in November that provides Valero with terms and pricing for TransFerm’s use at any or all of Valero’s 10 corn ethanol plants. Bill Day, Valero’s executive director of media relations, declined to elaborate on the specifics of the agreement but he confirmed that Valero has trialed the product at several of its facilities and will continue to work with Mascoma and others to optimize the results. In March, Pacific Ethanol Inc. also signed an agreement to use TransFerm at its 40 MMgy Columbia plant in Boardman, Ore., with the option to extend that agreement to include the company’s three additional ethanol facilities. Paul Koehler, Pacific Ethanol vice president, says the Columbia plant has experienced positive operational and financial results in the months since incorporating the new yeast into its process. “It has lowered our ingredient costs for production and is consistent in its performance,” he says. “Pacific Ethanol is pleased with the product and with the team from Mascoma and Lallemand.” Koehler says Pacific Ethanol does indeed plan to use the product at all of its facilities, pending trials at each plant to confirm the expected benefits. Operational Considerations Bioengineered yeasts require users to complete a bit more paperwork as compared to natural yeasts and Mascoma needed to garner a favorable review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before distillers grains produced at facilities using the yeast product could be used as animal feed, but the actual production process is unchanged. The FDA gave the product a favorable review in February. “For use in trials or commercial use, the facility itself doesn’t have to do anything differently,” Arkowitz says. “They don’t have to invest in any capital equipment or change their processes. We mean it when we say ‘drop-in.’ They can just use it instead of using a conventional yeast.” Mascoma intends to continue using its CBP technology platform to improve TransFerm as well as roll out additional products. The next step will be to introduce MGT 1.1, which is designed to express glucoamylase enzymes as TransFerm does but with the additional capability of generating additional yield for corn ethanol producers, according to Arkowitz. Mascoma is awaiting regulatory approval for MGT 1.1 and anticipates launching the product in the not too distant future, he says. In the meantime, Pilgrim assures there’s no need for producers to wait for the new and improved version to become available. “You could wait,” he says, “but you’d be leaving money on the table.”</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344360860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:34:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344362956000-26</Id><Title>true hydrocarbon fuel, with the same energy density as petroleum or diesel</Title><Msg>KiOR CEO: Registration is a 'Green Light' Kristin Mamrack July 26, 2012 10:02:47 AM Tuesday's Environmental Protection Agency announcement that KiOR was granted registration as a renewable gasoline product is "great news" for the company and the Columbus KiOR facility, KiOR CEO Fred Cannon said Wednesday. KiOR was granted Part 79 registration by the EPA, which is required by manufacturers of motor vehicle fuel and must be completed prior to sale of the product. "It is essentially a green light for KiOR to bring the renewable gasoline it produces in Columbus to the market," Cannon said. "Even before construction began, KiOR had agreements in place to sell the fuel from the Columbus plant to Catchlight Energy, Hunt Refining, and FedEx. Yesterday's milestone clears the path for these sales to occur once Columbus begins producing fuel." In the KiOR process, biomass -- non-food products, like bark, leaves, wood chips, switchgrass, and other plant material -- are converted into renewable crude oil in one-second reactions. The product then is converted to renewable fuel, which is the same as petroleum. The finished product is not biodiesel and not ethanol, but rather a true hydrocarbon fuel, with the same energy density as petroleum or diesel, company officials said, noting the finished product easily drops into today's infrastructure and is compatible in all engines, cars and trucks. The expected product -- 11 million gallons of fuel a year -- from the Columbus facility already was sold out before ground was broken on the $222 million Columbus plant. "As for the facility itself, KiOR announced that it had completed construction last quarter," Cannon said. "The facility is now in the commissioning phase and is on schedule to begin producing fuel in the second half of this year. As soon as the production begins, KiOR will be selling its fuel to its customers, who will add KiOR's cellulosic gasoline and diesel into their fuel supply."

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter increased 31% to $1.01 from $0.77 in the prior-year quarter. Diluted EPS for the nine-months ended June 30, 2012 was $2.44 compared to $1.93 in the prior-year period. “We had a phenomenal third quarter, delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company,” said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company. “Earnings per share were up 31% over last year, driven by growth in every one of our businesses. We also delivered record earnings per share for the first nine months of our fiscal year, and we believe our results clearly demonstrate Disney’s unique value proposition and great potential to deliver long-term growth.” The following table summarizes the third quarter and nine-month results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except per share amounts): http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/sites/default/files/reports/q3-fy12-earnings.pdf</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344382890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:41:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344382937000-36</Id><Topic><Title>THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344382890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:41:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DIS Chart http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&amp;insttype=Stock&amp;symb=dis&amp;time=6&amp;startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&amp;enddate=1%2F8%2F2012&amp;freq=1&amp;compidx=aaaaa%3A0&amp;comptemptext=&amp;comp=&amp;ma=4&amp;maval=9+15+50&amp;uf=7168&amp;lf=1&amp;lf2=4&amp;lf3=2&amp;type=4&amp;style=320&amp;size=3&amp;timeFrameToggle=false&amp;compareToToggle=false&amp;indicatorsToggle=false&amp;chartStyleToggle=false&amp;state=11&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Analyst Estimates http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dis/analystestimates</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344382937000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344384872000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Social Security not deal it once was for workers</Title><Username>infernal.equinox</Username><Timestamp>1344215977000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 21:19:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have no issue with someone who can not take care of themself. In fact, I believe we need to treat "them" much better than we do. (Any of us could become a "them".) I do believe it is very difficult for the gov't (esp. from a national/federal level) to actually determine who really can not take care of themself. That truly is something that is much easier and better to do at the lowest possible level. I have a big issue taking care of someone who chose not to take care of themself.

But take an honest look at who is working for minimum wage. Very few people make a 'career' working for minimum wage. If minimum wage is the 'best' someone can actually achieve, then when it comes time for them to retire (or even just 'slow down'), we need to help. That is what a social safety net is about. Those that could not prepare for retirement on their own. Keep in mind, this would be a HUGE change to the current system. And there are many people who have planned on and are counting on the current system to provide for them at the levels they have been promised. Many of them no longer have the time to properly prepare for maybe 20+ years of retirement. So this change would have to be implemented over a long period of time. But if we start now, we have 20 years until SS is projected to go broke. We can start with small changes now that will extend that 20 years by when people will have had time to adjust to and prepare for a different paradigm.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1344385248000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 20:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344385846000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Social Security not deal it once was for workers</Title><Username>infernal.equinox</Username><Timestamp>1344215977000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 21:19:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Before you tax capital gains, you need to find out who really gets those gains you want to tax. Sure 'the rich' do. But there are PLENTY of non-rich who through IRA's, 401K's, 403's, etc are 'in the market' and get capital gains also. Another point to consider it 'are those capital gains already taxed'? A person rich or not, works hard and makes a little (or a log) extra. That extra is taxed at his highest marginal rate. He then invests it in company XYZ. Company XYZ, uses that capital to make something and makes a profit. This profit is then taxed. The market sees that XYZ is making money (that is taxed) so the market increases its valuation of XYZ so the stock of XYZ increases. Our hard worker now decides to sell his XYZ at a gain. So the investment was taxed when the hard worker made it. It was taxed again (implicitly) when XYZ used it to make money to increase the value of XYZ. And now you want us to tax it again. How many times would you like for us to tax the same underlying core earnings of our hard worker. Two or three times is not enough? Low cap gains taxes are NOT a tax break. Any taxes on capital gains is a tax on underlying capital that has already been taxed multiple times.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1344385846000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 20:30:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344387013000-41</Id><Topic><Title>The Vast Potential For Renewable Energy In The American West</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344296738000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:45:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>500,000 green jobs across 6 states.

Plus the BLS estimates that up to 2% of the jobs in the US are green. Doing some simple math estimates this 500K across six states is close to that 2%. So in the end what is being hypied is 2% of the jobs.

If the gov't was involved such that the price of the insurance did not adequately account for the risk being insured (and when isn't that the case where the gov't is involved in 'insurance') it is not the farmer's fault. He saw a good business deal and too advantage of the opportunity. Good capitalistic business move; not socialism nor charity. The farmer did not make the rules.
