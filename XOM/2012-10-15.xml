In addition, the stock got up to the important intra-week high made in Jul07 at 93.62 with a rally this past week to 93.36 suggesting that the upside objective was reached and that a correction, much like the one seen in 2007 when the stock got up to 93.36 and then fell to 78.76 3 weeks later will be seen now. It should also be mentioned that XOM has not built any kind of support of consequence on the way up and other than the area of support between $80 and $83 that was built back in the 2007/2008 time frame, the only support seen recently is at 86.52 and that support is considered minor at best. Some psychological support will be found at the $90 level but it is not supported by previous buying at that level except for a very minor low seen in Oct07 at 90.16. XOM is also a company that may be affected should Obama be re-elected as this is a company that he has often mentioned in the past as one that needs to pay more. With the election just 4 weeks away and the probabilities favoring an Obama win, it is difficult to believe that new all-time highs would even be a possibility. XOM did get close to the most recent low and psychological support at 90.09 on Friday with a drop down to 90.51 and a bounce to close near the middle of the day's trading range suggesting that the stock might generate a small rally at the beginning of the week. Having dropped straight down from the 53-month high made on Tuesday there is a decent chance the stock will retest the high before going further down. Decent resistance is found between 92.40 and 92.57. A rally up to that level will be used to enter into a short position. Sales of XOM between 92.39 and 92.56 and using a 93.46 stop loss and having a 78.78 objective offers a 15-1 risk/reward ratio. My rating on the trade is a 3.75 (on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest).</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1350302108811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 07:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350309156801-3</Id><Title>Report: Feds probe Rep. Jackson Jr. over use of campaign funds</Title><Msg>Federal investigators are probing allegations that Democratic Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. illegally used campaign funds to redecorate his house, according to a media report. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, D.C. have spearheaded the inquiry and are close to completing their investigation. The report says that Jackson’s attorneys requested that authorities not seek an indictment before the election, a call that Justice Department officials rejected. The report said that neither Rep. Jackson’s spokesman or lawyer would comment on the matter. The probe is separate from another inquiry by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington into former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s (D) attempt to sell President Barack Obama’s former Senate seat. Jackson has denied wrongdoing in that matter. The criminal probe into misused campaign funds was launched before Jackson’s resent absence from Capitol Hill for health related reasons. Jackson left Washington in mid-June and revealed two months later that he was being treated for bipolar disorder at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. The nine-term lawmaker returned to Washington in September and is seeking reelection for a tenth term. But he has not appeared on Capitol Hill or campaigned in his district. His prolonged absence and low profile since his return may have cost him an endorsement from the Chicago Tribune, influential in his district. The paper last week said they would prefer to endorse him in his race against GOP challenger Brian Woodworth, but said it was an “open-ended question” if Jackson would ever be able to return to Congress. Jackson is on the ballot and expected to win in his heavily-Democratic district. Last month, Jackson also put up his Washington, D.C. home for sale, saying he needed to raise money to pay for his continued healthcare treatment. Jackson’s home, a four-bedroom rowhouse in Dupont Circle, is listed for $2.5 million. It is uncertain if that property is the subject of the reported federal probe.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350309156801</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 09:52:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350312609530-4</Id><Topic><Title>XOM is too superior to skip right now.

In a joint statement, EU ministers voiced "serious and deepening concerns" over Iran's nuclear program and the expansion of its uranium-enrichment capacities, and they called on the regime to cooperate with international nuclear inspectors. Iran says its nuclear activities are for peaceful, civilian purposes. The sanctions, seen as the toughest measures against Tehran since the EU's embargo on Iranian oil imports in July, is the latest effort by the 27-member bloc to bring Iran back to the negotiating table after a half-year of deadlocked talks. The measures target financial institutions, trade, energy and shipping. "The restrictive measures agreed today are aimed at affecting Iran's nuclear program and revenues of the Iranian regime to fund its program and are not aimed at the Iranian people," the statement said. The U.S. welcomed the new EU sanctions Monday. "Rallying the world to isolate Iran and increasing the pressure on its leadership so that they stop pursuing a nuclear weapon has been a top priority for the president since the day he took office," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama. One cornerstone of the latest measures is a ban on all financial transactions between European and Iranian banks, unless they relate to humanitarian aid. Iran's central bank will face fresh restrictions, and the export of materials and metals used for industrial or military purposes will be prohibited. New rules will seek to curb the movement of Iranian oil tankers and cargos and impede the country's ship-building capacities. "The sanctions…are all part of a twin-track approach," French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters. "We continue to both negotiate and to maintain the pressure." His German counterpart, Guido Westerwelle, accused Tehran of "playing for time," and said the EU sanctions were having an impact on the regime's ability to fund its nuclear activities. As she arrived for the talks in Luxembourg, the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who represents six major nations at international negotiations with Tehran, said: "I hope we will be able to make progress very soon." However, no new dates for talks have been set, according to European diplomats. Syria was also hit with a new round of sanctions Monday, as the EU took more steps to curb the import of arms into Syria and prohibit any EU involvement in the transport of Syrian weapons. In addition, two companies and 28 individuals involved in the violent repression against the civilian population will face an asset ban and a travel freeze, bringing to 181 the number of people and 54 the companies on the EU's Syria blacklist. As ministers endorsed this 19th round of sanctions since the conflict in Syria began in March 2011, they urged strong language to call on President Bashar al-Assad to end the bloodshed in his country and condemned the shelling across the Turkish border by Syrian forces. "The EU warns against further militarization of the conflict," Ms. Ashton said. "We call on all states to refrain from delivering arms to Syria and to follow the EU in stopping the supplies that fuel the fighting." The EU is also looking into ways to provide military training to an African-led mission to Mali, to restore rule of law in the north of the country after the military coup this year. wsj</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350324194777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 14:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350325711043-11</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want a teabagger for a neighbor ?</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350253008471</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:16:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You appear to need both an English lesson and a history lesson. 1. Read the words as written and use proper grammer and you will find that the "well regulated" modifies the miliitia. Not the right and not the person exercising the right. And the "militia" clause itself is used as an introductory justification for enumerating the right. The RKBA clause is the main clause could stand alone and is not subjugated to the introductory clause. The FF included the militia clause to show the great need for such an admendment to be included. I realize the FF were educated and were not writing a document for a 4th grade edumicated person, but that is obviously lost on you. 2. But even IF your lack of grasp of English grammar were the correct reading, the fact is that the US code has a specific definition of "militia". And unless you want to practice sex or age discrimination, pretty much all adults citizens of the US have the RKBA. 3. Additionally, you may want to argue either of the above ponits, but your/my "opinions" do not matter. The US federal courts are the arbiters of the meaning of the US Constitution. And the US federal courts have ruled that the RKBA is an individual right. That is the right of each non-disqualified (e.g. convicted felon) individual. Until overturned by the same or superior court, this judicial decision is binding precedent.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1350325711043</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 14:28:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350326074037-12</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want a teabagger for a neighbor ?</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350253008471</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:16:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As to Limbaugh and "W", why don't you ask your party's 2nd in charge VP BiteMe, who recieved 5 deferements w/o ever mentioning "his condiditon" before magically getting medically exempted from the draft?

Boone Pickens sells off stake in wind farm</Title><Msg>T. Boone Pickens sells off stake in wind farm By Zack Colman - 10/15/12 03:25 PM ET Billionaire oil-and-gas tycoon T. Boone Pickens is abandoning his long-planned wind farm, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Pickens has in recent years changed his eponymous “Pickens Plan” for reducing oil imports to emphasize natural gas rather than wind power for electricity generation. The Star Tribune reported Pickens sold his stake in the Goodhue County, Minn., farm, but that the 50-turbine, $180 million project will go forward. In the original plan he rolled out in 2008, Pickens pushed for increasing domestic wind power capacity to help wean the nation off oil imports. Pickens backed his talk with his bank account, securing a large plot of land in Texas for a proposed wind farm. But the recession hit, permitting problems ensued and Pickens moved the farm to Minnesota. Then natural gas tumbled to record-low prices, causing Pickens to shift to that energy source in his plan as the main driver for domestic electricity generation. That market dynamic also has spelled trouble for a crucial wind energy incentive. The 2.2-cent per kilowatt-hour incentive for wind power production, known as the production tax credit (PTC), is set to expire Dec. 31. A significant bloc of Republicans, along with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, opposes extending the incentive. They call the PTC an example of unnecessary government intervention into energy markets, and argue that the uptick of natural gas for electricity generation shows energy production is best left to free markets. President Obama as well as many Democratic and Republican lawmakers representing sizable wind energy sectors want to extend the incentive, and Obama has tried to turn the issue into an election vulnerability for his opponent. Supporters of the tax credit cite industry-backed estimates that failing to extend it would cost 37,000 direct and indirect jobs. Many wind energy firms, such as Siemens and Vestas Wind Systems, have cited the uncertainty surrounding the incentive’s future to explain recent layoffs. Supporters also say the incentive is working and helping the wind industry catch up to legacy energy technologies such as oil and coal. For proof, they point to wind electricity accounting for 35 percent of all newly installed generating capacity in 2011. Though he has not endorsed a presidential candidate, Pickens said in August that Obama has thwarted increased oil-and-gas production by restricting drilling on federal lands. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350343168467</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:19:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350344277258-21</Id><Title>_____ANYBODY ELSE but SCOTTRADE_____</Title><Msg>sunny beaches</Msg><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1350344277258</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350345168900-22</Id><Title>one of the first and one of three cellulosic biofuel plants to start up this year</Title><Msg>BDC Members Tour American Process Inc.'s Cellulosic Ethanol Facility in Alpena, MI, Which Started Up in June 2012 Source: Marketwire Oct. 15, 2012 ALPENA, MI -- (Marketwire) -- 10/15/12 -- BDC held its 2012 Fall Symposium in Alpena, MI on September 18 &amp; 19, capping the event with a tour of the new cellulosic ethanol plant owned by American Process Inc. (API), a BDC member. API's facility is one of the first and one of three cellulosic biofuel plants to start up this year, along with KiOR and INEOS. The API process utilizes the hemicellulose extract from the adjacent DPI hardboard mill, which beforehand was treated and discharged as a waste stream. The arrangement provides benefits to both DPI and API. This technology has replication potential in pulp mills and biomass power plants across the industry. The low-cost feedstock stream utilized by API is hydrolyzed and combined with a special yeast to break down the sugars. When the plant reaches design production, it will generate about 1 million gallons per year of cellulosic ethanol. Theodora Retsina, CEO of API, said, 'This commercial project will prove the economics of using cellulosic biomass as the feedstock for ethanol and other products, which have previously come from petroleum. The Alpena commercial plant will provide us knowledge that we will apply to future projects.' Cellulosic ethanol has become a reality over the past few years due to the development of special enzymes that can covert cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars that can then be fermented. The progress of competitive cost cellulosic ethanol and other products will take the pressure off the use of food grains for needed ethanol volumes. Bioprocesses that utilize cellulosic materials to produce alternatives to petroleum products are essential to helping reduce the nation's carbon footprint and green house gases. Mark Alderfer, Project Manager for the Alpena biorefinery, said, 'We were happy to have the BDC group come to Alpena for their Fall meeting and to see the facility that we're extremely proud to show off. I personally appreciate the opportunity to spend time with my peers in the industry at their semi-annual meetings and tours.' API is a global leader in the development of technologies for the commercial production of sugar and ethanol from non-food based biomass such as woodchips. The Alpena biorefinery, one of the first U.S. cellulosic ethanol plants, is a model for other facilities that can take advantage of wood waste streams to produce fuels and higher value products, beforehand produced from petroleum. BDC is a non-profit 501(c)(3), fact-based, trustworthy, and results oriented national organization that is dedicated to educating industry leaders on leading edge technologies, processes, and policies. BDC's focus is on brokering partnerships to promote the bioeconomy by deploying sustainable processes that do not rely on government subsidy. Today BDC has about 25 member companies that are actively working to recognize the potential of a bioenergy industry. ... environmental-expert</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350345168900</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350352005126-23</Id><Topic><Title>So is the State of Florida</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350332334355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 16:18:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like you are going insane as well.

Claiming she spent a marathon 12 consecutive days in Albany on “legislative business,” Queens Assemblywoman Vivian Cook pocketed $171 for each reported overnight stay — a total $2,197 in taxpayer money from March 21 to April 1, 2010. The Legislature was in session just three of those days — and Cook was absent for all three, records show. “Me? You’re kidding! No! I didn’t do that,” she told The Post. “I don’t lie, I don’t cheat, and I don’t steal,” said Cook, whose nonprofit Rockaway Boulevard Local Development Corp. prompted an investigation for allegedly misusing taxpayer funds. In 2010 and 2011, Cook collected a total $17,035 in daily and overnight stipends, plus other travel expenses — on top of her $79,500-a-year state salary. During the 2010 legislative session, she missed 51 meetings of the Assembly, 63 percent of the sessions. “I was sick for a very long time,” she said of her absences, but could not recall the dates. She’s one of scores of legislators who claim more than $10,000 a year in “per diems” — a daily payment lawmakers can collect if they sleep over in Albany or travel more than 50 miles from home on legislative business. The sleepovers add up. The Assembly and the Senate have socked taxpayers with more than $32 million in travel-related expenses in the past decade"</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350354513218</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350355123904-27</Id><Topic><Title>All the Tides Rise Exxon Mobil Corpo - Get on it Before it runs Aground...</Title><Username>martinraphael388</Username><Timestamp>1350309352485</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 09:55:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Consider it done.

Not you so called husband. He just stood up at a Democrat Party National Convention and told the nation that no one "not even me" could have done anything about the economy as it stood in 2008. LIE. Then he stated that the Obama administrations "plans" for the next four years are somehow comparable to what was done during HIS administration. Only in the sense of "They are doing almost exactly the opposite of what we did". Why would he say the opposite? YOU were married to him and YOU KNOW the answer. Sorry, I just STUDIED the personality type for 6 years, but we BOTH know the answer: Because he would SAY ANYTHING. Whatever is convenient at the time. OK, as far as THAT goes, yes, he and President have some things in common, BUT.... As far as ECONOMIC POLICY? HA HA. There is another reason, you know. He, Bill Clinton, NEVER wants to see you become President. You just took care of that one, Hillary. WHY?? Remember when you started? College? Those first campaigns? Gonna change the world?? Change it into THIS, Hillary? Don't you remember the most IMPORTANT THING?? Your life having a PURPOSE? Serving the People of America?? The COUNTRY?? The WORLD. Whatever else you are, I know something about you. Remember my field of study. YOU, Hillary, are NOT a sociopath. You may be a politician, but you DO have the ability to consider the feelings and the worth of people besides yourself. Here's comes the tough part of that. Falling on your sword to save the political career of Barrack Obama is NOT "the right thing to do." You know that "the right thing to do" is NOT referring to "the most effective politically". It means the moral thing, the action that fulfills your OATH to serve, to protect the Constition of the USA. It is going to take someone like you, maybe even TWO or THREE people at your level to look in the mirror and say "NO. NO. NO, I will NOT lie and cheat and destroy the country I love to serve the ambitions of a man who plays Angry Birds, or listens to rap or God only knows what on his I-Pad while the daily security assessment PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND or sometimes just records silently. In case there's something important on it. That way he can check it later. It has to stop now. YOU can make it stop. YOU, like Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, Queen Elizabeth I and only very very few other people in the history of the world...YOU can SAVE your COUNTRY. The Times make the man, or the woman, but only if she stands up to them. May God give you the strength.</Msg><Username>asu_eht_evol_i</Username><Timestamp>1350356675336</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350356968501-29</Id><Topic><Title>FACT RYAN ASKED JOE BIDEN FOR 2009 STIMULAS MONEY !!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1350327195385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 14:53:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OH NO SPIN RIGHT WING MAGGOTS !!!

The unprecedented price spike that added more than 50 cents a gallon to California pump prices ended as quickly as it began, market analysts said, and consumers should see prices fall dramatically. Political outrage, however, was still heating up as Senator Barbara Boxer joined calls for a federal investigation into possible market manipulation. Prices started pulling back slightly on, according to online filling station tracker Gas Buddy, after the American Automobile Association website reported they had hit a record of $4.668 per gallon. California Governor Jerry Brown's decision to allow an immediate switch to "winter-blend" fuel was a big factor in driving wholesale prices down by 60 cents a gallon, market participants said. "Retail prices will come down as hard as they went up," said David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, an energy consultancy in Irvine, California. "It went up 56 cents in a week, it will come down that fast." The price spike alarmed consumers and politicians across a state that is famous for its love of the automobile. Senator Barbara Boxer called for a Department of Justice investigation into possible price manipulation in gasoline trading markets. Senator Dianne Feinstein made a similar request to the Federal Trade Commission. Reuters reported that oil traders said the price spike had "many hallmarks of a classic short squeeze." Multiple trading sources said that refiner Tesoro Corp. was caught short of supplies and forced to scramble to buy fuel from other companies. equities</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350359505472</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
