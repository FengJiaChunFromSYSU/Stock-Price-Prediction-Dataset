Beard - 10/23/12 03:31 PM ET The United States could overtake Saudi Arabia as the world’s No. 1 oil producer by 2020, The Associated Press reports. The United States is in the midst of an oil boom thanks to high prices and new drilling methods. U.S. production of hydrocarbons is rising for the fourth year in a row, and 2012 could very well be the biggest single-year gain since 1951, around 7 percent. By 2020, the United States could produce somewhere between 13 and 15 million barrels per day. This would reverse declining U.S. production since 1985, when Alaskan oil fields helped the United States produce 11.2 million barrels per day. If the U.S. does overtake Saudi Arabia, it will be the first time since 2002, when the Saudis cut prices due to depressed demand in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. While ­­the United States might become the biggest producer of oil, that doesn’t mean Americans will no longer import oil. Indeed, Americans will still see relatively high prices due to growing worldwide demand. The boom has surpassed even the rosiest predictions from experts and is driving economic growth in states that have been open to new drilling methods such as North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. Hydraulic fracturing, a method of extracting oil and gas by cracking open long, thin layers of shale with water, sand and chemicals, has been key to the boom. High prices have incentivized exploration for these sources. This is not the first time that some have predicted the United States becoming the world’s top oil producer. John Freeman, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates, has previously predicted just that. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351052401839</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:20:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351052562858-2</Id><Topic><Title>If all these stupid liberal posts were true, why is it most polls have hoe bammy and romney tied?</Title><Username>jessanoldeman</Username><Timestamp>1351047575717</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:59:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UNINSTALLING OBAMA.....……………. █████████████▒▒▒ 90% complete.</Msg><Username>cancel190</Username><Timestamp>1351052562858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:22:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351052599824-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is anti energy and anti middle class</Title><Username>weightbayou</Username><Timestamp>1350930944422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:35:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UNINSTALLING OBAMA.....……………. █████████████▒▒▒ 90% complete.</Msg><Username>cancel190</Username><Timestamp>1351052599824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351052635386-4</Id><Title>Sen. Wyden: Energy Dept. must explain gas export review criteria</Title><Msg>Sen. Wyden: Energy Dept. must explain gas export review criteria By Ben Geman - 10/23/12 03:17 PM ET The Democrat slated to lead the Senate’s Energy Committee is pressuring Energy Secretary Steven Chu to describe how the agency will make decisions about whether to approve natural-gas export proposals. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), in a letter Tuesday, asked for an “all-inclusive description” of factors the department will consider as it weighs an array of export applications. “It is important that DOE include in its description how it considers current and proposed exports’ impact on domestic natural gas supplies, air pollutant emissions, domestic natural gas prices, electricity prices, U.S. employment and manufacturing, and economic growth,” the Oregon Democrat writes. Wyden is expected to become chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee if Democrats retain their majority in the upcoming elections. Current chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) is retiring from the Senate. Record U.S. natural-gas production is fueling an array of applications to export liquefied natural gas from Oregon, the Gulf Coast and elsewhere; a list of projects under review is here. Wyden has expressed skepticism about the proposals, citing concerns that a surge in exports could raise natural gas costs for manufacturers and other sectors of the economy. An Energy Department contractor is still working on a closely watched economic analysis of the proposed exports. But Wyden’s letter says the department must also explain how it will “establish the actual decision-making criteria” to be used for specific applications. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351052635386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351053155962-5</Id><Title>Obama LIED for weeks:</Title><Msg>It was September 11th -- WHAT IS WRONG WITH OBAMA??? duhhh Everyone knows it was an attack by Islamofascist terrorists AND WE ALL KNEW IT FROM THE SECOND WE HEARD OF THE ATTACK AND DEATHS.

The reason? Opportunities with bagasse, the leftover from crushed cane stalk after sugar is extracted at biorefineries. The goal? Closing the gap between ethanol targets and current production — given the bull market in sugar prices and a desire by producers to maximize sugar production. The potential expansion of capacity? [b]Guidance being given by the projects is that capacities could increase by up to 35 percent at existing mills, by adding on units to process bagasse. In Brazil, that would add up to 2.5 billion gallons (9.45 billion liters) in production capacity – more than enough to close the 1 billion liter ethanol gap that exists in Brazil of late, and open up substantial ethanol export opportunities in Brazil.[/b] In India, additional production would likely contribute towards Indian renewable fuels targets, where industry has struggled to develop sufficient capacity given sugar demand, limits on use of food-based feedstocks, and policy uncertainty. 5 Trends We see five trends driving the development of bagasse. 1. Technologies maturing. There’s been a lot of talk around bagasse, but cellulosic technologies initially targeted wheat straw and corn stover. Now, companies like Blue Sugars, Cobalt Technologies, Novozymes, Iogen, Beta Renewables, DSM and Codexis have developed technologies that are ready for commercial scale-up. 2. Partnership. So far, there have been few go-it-alone projects announced. Instead, technology companies from the US and the EU have generally teamed up with large aggregators of bagasse — Raizen and Petrobras amongst them. Copersucar in Brazil hasn’t announced a partnership yet — nor have the bigger players in India or other sugarcane centers such as the US, Cuba, or Pakistan. An outlier in this repect? BP Biofuels has been building first-generation capacity in Brazil — and has been developing next-gen cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol technologies in the US. They are expected to me a major player in next-gen fuels in Brazil, later in the decade. 3. Brazil now, India later. Deployment work is far ahead in Brazil – a combination of policy certainty, strong ethanol demand. Plus, the planned mechanization of the Brazilian sugarcane harvest will aggregate more waste biomass in the form of tops and leaves, and that will offset the role that bagasse plays as a feedstock for power generation to run the sugar mills. 4. Multi-feedstock. For all the excitement around bagasse, some of the most significant projects will target other feedstocks, including straw. GraalBio and Praj are, notably, going in this direction. 5. Co-location. To date, there have been no greenfield projects announced. It’s considered, economically, a must-have to access already-aggregated bagasse. For now, there are plenty of sites left to partner up with – but generally the most prized sites have been in Sao Paulo state, so far – closer to R&amp;D support and downstream markets. Over time, more projects will develop in Minas Gerais and states father to the north and west. 7 Key projects to watch 1. Iogen and Raizen — Brazil’s largest ethanol producer gets underway with advanced biofuels. Last week, Iogen Energy was chosen by the Raizen Group, a large-scale sugarcane ethanol producer, to use its technology to convert biomass to ethanol at a new facility in Brazil. Iogen will develop and engineer the front-end design of a facility at Raizen’s existing factory near São Paulo. Iogen’s technology will allow Raizen to produce ethanol from sugarcane bagasse. 2. Novozymes — new enzymes project for Brazil is key to supplying several proposed projects. Last month, Novozymes said that it will announce by the end of 2012 plans to construct a plant in Brazil to supply enzymes to convert sugarcane into ethanol. The company is currently in discussion with potential Brazilian sugar and ethanol partners to evaluate the local market’s needs. Brazilian sugarcane millers hope to be able to process cane bagasse and other crop leftovers into fuel. 3. Petrobras and Blue Sugars — Brazil’s state oil company keys its advanced biofuels plans on a partnership with the first company to register cellulosic ethanol RIN credits in the US. In June, KL Energy changed its name to Blue Sugars, following extension of its long-term co-development agreement for cellulosic ethanol with Petrobras. Blue Sugars CEO Peter Gross noted that the company’s scale-up factor from our demo plant to full-sized industrial units is in the range of 10-15, and that Petrobras is already working on its first industrial cellulosic ethanol plant slated for start-up in 2015, after licensing Blue Sugar’s technology for use in its Brazilian sugarcane mills. Gross told Bloomberg that it expects to produce cellulosic ethanol from bagasse at a cost of 40-50 cents per liter, and will supply technology to three Brazilian mills, by 2015. 4. GraalBio Investimentos, Beta Renewables, DSM and Novozymes — five projects starting in 2013. In May, GraalBio Investimentos revealed plans to invest $724.5 million in five cellulosic ethanol plants during the next few years. The first 21.6 million gallon facility in Alagoas that will use sugarcane bagasse as feedstock is expected to come online in December 2013. Novozymes, a world leader in enzymes, will provide an advanced generation of enzymes. DSM will supply genetically modified yeasts that will ferment the second-generation ethanol. Beta Renewables and Chemtex, both part of Italian chemical group Mossi &amp; Ghisolfi (M&amp;G), will provide other process technologies and engineering. The first plant will produce cellulosic ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and straw. 5. Cobalt Technologies and Rhodia — biobased chemicals in Brazil, from bagasse, by 2013. In August, Cobalt Technologies and Rhodia announced they will begin joint development and operation of a biobutanol demonstration facility in Brazil. The Cobalt/Rhodia plant will utilize sugarcane bagasse to make n-butanol; bagasse is used at sugar mills to provide process energy to drive the mill and to supply power to the local grid; the Cobalt project will utilize that fraction of the bagasse that generates power for the grid, or any residual biomass that is burned as waste. Work will begin in August 2012 and will move to a mill site in early 2013 for integration testing. Operational testing at the demonstration plant is expected to be completed by Mid-2013. 6. Chempolis targets India. Last month, Finland’s Chempolis said that it expected to have a deal on bagasse and ethanol, in India, by the first half of 2013. The company is in discussion with several mills but hasn’t revealed identities. 7. Praj, Novozymes projects in India. In June, Praj and Novozymes announced plans to set up an advanced biofuels demonstration plant this year In India. According to the reports, Novozymes will supply enzymes to the India-based project, which will work on a variety of feedstocks including wheat straw, rice straw, corn cobs and sugarcane bagasse. biofuelsdigest</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351054940250</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 01:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351055434646-9</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is anti energy and anti middle class</Title><Username>weightbayou</Username><Timestamp>1350930944422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:35:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is anti-American.

The company said the decision was purely based on economics, which may signal trouble for other nuclear power plants at a time when cheap natural gas and the slowly recovering economy are holding down electricity prices in many parts of the country. Dominion President and CEO Thomas Farrell gave two main reasons for the move in a statement today. One is that Dominion, which bought the Kewaunee plant in 2005 for $192 million, doesn't have enough reactors in the Midwest to defray the cost of running a nuclear fleet in the region. Also, the purchase agreements for Kewaunee's electricity are going to expire at a time when Dominion won't be able to command as much money on the wholesale power market. "The combination of these factors makes it uneconomic for Kewaunee to continue operations," Farrell said in the statement. Dominion, which also owns one nuclear power plant in Connecticut and two in Virginia, announced last year that it would try to sell the Kewaunee plant, which came online in 1974 and has a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to run until 2033 (Greenwire, April 29, 2011). The reactor will shut down in early 2013, so long as the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, or MISO, finds that the electric grid can handle losing Kewaunee's 556 megawatts of power. A nuclear power plant hasn't been shut down for good since 1998, when the Zion power station in Illinois was retired and one of the three reactors at the Millstone power plant in Connecticut was decommissioned. Dominion still operates the other two reactors at Millstone, which has more favorable economics because Connecticut has some of the most expensive electricity in the country. Some plants 'on the edge' Marvin Fertel, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement today that nuclear power will remain a major power source in the United States. For example, there are five new reactors under construction in the United States. He said Dominion's decision was based on local economic factors. But others say Dominion's plan is a sign of broader problems for the industry. Building a reactor has become so costly that none has come online in the past decade, although existing plants have rarely run into financial trouble because of their low fuel costs. However, low natural gas prices have recently caused dozens of coal plants to be retired or idled, and today's announcement suggests some nuclear plants could end up bowing to the same pressure. Lake Barrett, the former head of the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, said Dominion's decision highlights the many challenges facing the industry, including stiff competition from natural gas, costly repairs for aging units, uncertain regulations and a lack of congressional interest in putting a price on carbon emissions. "You add it all up and it weighs heavily on nuclear to go forward versus simple natural gas," Barrett said. Barrett said some utilities are weighing costly upgrades. He pointed to Southern California Edison Co.'s possible expenditure of millions of dollars to fix leaky tubes at its San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in California. Duke Energy Corp. may need to spend up to $1.3 billion -- the most expensive nuclear repair in U.S. history -- to fix the cracked concrete shell around its Crystal River plant in Florida (Greenwire, Sept. 11). Reactors with a design similar to the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan may also need upgrades to protect against the type of damage the plant incurred during a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami last year. Regulators are considering whether to require pressure-relief vents at power stations such as the Vermont Yankee plant, owned by Entergy Vermont Yankee LLC. "When you look at the upgrade costs post-Fukushima, you might find Vermont Yankee and other plants like that on the edge," Barrett said. Economics aside, the Kewaunee facility appears to be in good working order. Nuclear safety regulators at the NRC have not released any notices of violations since 2008 for the plant, which is running at 100 percent of its capacity today, and no citizen groups are loudly calling for its closure, as with Vermont Yankee and San Onofre. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) released a statement today lamenting the planned closure of the Kewaunee plant. He blamed the decision on "unnecessary federal regulations," which he said are "slowing the process for companies like Dominion to take advantage of economies of scale and keep their businesses profitable and open." The rules he cited were a set of draft U.S. EPA standards for the cooling water intake structures at nuclear power plants. The rules that the Obama administration has proposed to protect bodies of water are not yet final, and they may well change if Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney wins next month's election. Dominion spokesman Richard Zuercher told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel today that he didn't have information on the effect of those regulations, insisting that economics were behind the company's decision. "The plant has run very well," he told the newspaper, but "it produces electricity at too high a cost." eenews</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351056950053</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 01:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351076902394-11</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Each and Every One of You Demoncraps</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1351041119185</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 21:11:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe everyone is too afraid to speak the truth on this matter but, honestly, this guy should have been put to death immediately after his act.

By ANDREW RESTUCCIA | 10/24/12 11:50 AM EDT How's this for some election-year timing: The East Coast faces the real possibility of taking a battering next week from a “perfect storm” roaring in from the Atlantic — right at the tail end of a campaign in which President Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and their debate moderators have all drawn criticism for avoiding discussion of climate change. The brewing, blustery mess could affect the same region that was already knocked around by this summer's derecho and soaked in 2011 by Hurricane Irene. And it could come just two months after Hurricane Isaac forced the GOP to cancel the first day of its convention in Tampa. This time, the meteorological mayhem would be courtesy of Hurricane Sandy, which is forecast to barrel northward across Jamaica and Cuba during the next 24 hours before slicing toward the Bahamas. While much of Florida's east coast and the Upper Florida Keys are already under a tropical storm watch, some forecasting models — particularly one from the European weather agency — have hinted that the real trouble could come early next week, after Sandy ceases to be a tropical cyclone. It then could merge with other atmospheric patterns over the Atlantic and possibly get whipsawed back to the U.S. coast, somewhere from Virginia to Maine. Other models suggest the storm will curve out to sea. But the more dramatic possibility is getting some attention in weather-watching circles. “What seemed like a fluke of an idea — a hurricane-like system hitting the northeastern U.S. — is gaining credibility,” wrote Weather Channel hurricane forecaster Bryan Norcross in a blog post Wednesday morning. “Originally the European model was on its own with the spectacular but somewhat bizarre idea that Sandy would be injected with jet stream energy and curve back toward New England as a stunningly strong storm. Now one model after the other, including the ensembles, are favoring a swing back toward the East Coast after the storm goes by Cape Hatteras.” Meteorologists at NOAA's National Hurricane Center near Miami were more cautious, saying it's too early to know whether the scary scenario will play out. “There are some models that are showing that, and there are also some models that show it will go out east toward the ocean. It’s really too early to tell,” said NHC hurricane specialist Robbie Berg. Berg said the agency makes official forecasts going out for only five days, and the storm wouldn’t likely travel that far north for six or seven days. (As of 11 a.m. today, the NHC's five-day forecast ended with Sandy's center well off the coast of North Carolina, Virginia or Maryland's eastern Shore on Monday morning.) Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for the Weather Channel-owned company Weather Underground, echoed Berg’s sentiments. “We have the same number of models going one way that are going the other way. It’s as clear as mud,” he said. But if the storm banks toward the East Coast, residents could be in for a wild ride. Masters said the scenario would be similar to the “Perfect Storm” of 1991 on which the book and movie of the same name were based, which arose from a merger between a dying Hurricane Grace and an already brewing disturbance near eastern Canada. “If this storm hits, it would probably be a billion-dollar storm,” Masters said. The timing of a major storm hitting right before Election Day is not lost on the environmental community, which has taken both presidential candidates to task for not adequately communicating the threat of climate change on the campaign trail. “Sandy is yet another reminder that the candidates should stop competing over who can poison the weather faster with increased oil, gas and coal production,” said Brad Johnson, campaign manager at ClimateSilence.org, a website aimed at getting the candidates to make climate change a major part of the election-year debate. “If they fear that honesty about global warming could cost them votes, they should instead be more concerned that climate silence costs lives.” Many scientists warn that climate change will cause hurricanes and other storms to become more intense, although they are usually hesitant to connect any one weather event to global warming. Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, a climate-change advocacy group that has criticized both Romney and Obama, said he sees little hope that a storm like this would turn climate change into a major issue in Washington. “These guys will never notice. They've been treated with some kind of special weatherproofing,” he said in an email. “They didn't notice the hottest month in U.S. history [July 2012], nor the drought of their lifetimes — they've got some kind of special coating. A hurricane would roll right off their backs.” politico</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351104597354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351109055364-26</Id><Topic><Title>Hurricane Sandy: The next climate wake-up call?</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351104597354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not ask, if an earthquake can move New Zealand 15 feet in one direction is the earth changing true North?

Women Review Debate 3 : First, Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the President Test, Ready to Lead USA. By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Great Impression: Mitt Romney's Stunning Turnaround in Past 3 Debates after Huge Negative Ads. The Reasons for Change is Obama has Lost the Support and Respect with Women Voters and Others. People Notice: Most Men and Women are Turned Off Against Barack Obama most everywhere and Across All 50 States, Here is the the Review of Debate 3 on October 22, 2012 By a Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 Women Connecticut Across America Our Strong Plea for Change in the White House, Why? The following reasons listed bellow. Note: This review is a agreement amongst a Group of almost 8000 Women watching debates. During the Debate 3, President Barack Obama was Arrogant, Disrespectfully, Angry, Rude and Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney. Obama did not Act or Look Presidential. We Feel Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the Presidential Test and is Ready to Lead USA We Support Mitt Romney, found him to be a Smart, Respectable and Decent Gentleman. Governor Mitt Romney Looked Much More Presidential, Ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Mitt Romney said America Needs a Strong Economy in order to have a Strong Military for our National Security right now and the Future. ...... We All Agree. Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America. Vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan Before It's to Late. Do it Now ....ASAP Public Notice: We Feel Strongly that President Barack Obama is No Longer Fit to Lead USA.</Msg><Username>political_gangsters</Username><Timestamp>1351119335019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 18:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351126271878-34</Id><Topic><Title>Donald Trump's gone over the edge..........</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1351112584159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 17:03:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Proof of nobumba knew about the ambassador attack.
