Since they have no useful value to you why do you read them? ....because you are obsessed with them. Or perhaps you fear them and strike at what you fear. If you were in Germany you would have good reason to fear me too, considering your penchant for ad hominem attacks, ascribing the persona of ID of others to me, all of which I could use to punish you severely with the power of money &amp; law if done in real life. This is not the only ID you've produced to demonstrated your obsession either. You should be obsessed with the word of God in your Bible, as per your own logic, as He and It is the only source of Truth for you. Your mind is so weak (flawed, as I surmise, racially) you cannot sustain any rational line of thinking though....</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371462654839</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 05:50:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371463063032-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOP set to embrace Obama Amnesty under the guise of "immigration reform"</Title><Username>lyubasha2004</Username><Timestamp>1371259895375</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 21:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Israel seems important to you.

The facility will produce 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A causeway extends 1.3 miles from the plant, located on Barrow Island off of Australia's west coast, with foundation structures for the plant's liquefied natural gas jetty (bottom left) rising from the water. (Photo: Chevron) Chevron Corp. (CVX)’s $10 billion Angola LNG plant shipped its first cargo today after an 18-month delay prompted by fires, labor shortages and U.S. shale drilling that erased demand for African fuel in the world’s largest gas market. The shipment of gas that was cooled to -256 degrees Fahrenheit (-160 degrees Celsius) to shrink its volume was sold to state-owned Sonangol EP for transport to Brazil aboard the ship Sonangol Sambizanga, Artur Pereira, chief executive officer of Angola LNG Marketing, said in an e-mailed statement today. A “large number” of LNG sales from the plant have been signed or are in negotiation, the London-based company said. Chevron, the world’s third-largest energy company by market value, has made LNG a linchpin of its goal to raise its worldwide output by 20 percent through the end of 2017 to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude a day. The company is spending more than $77 billion on two LNG projects in Australia, and in December acquired a 50 percent stake in the proposed Kitimat LNG terminal on Canada’s Pacific Coast. “First gas at Angola LNG is an important milestone in support of our strategic plan to grow our production,” George Kirkland, vice chairman of San Ramon, California-based Chevron, said in a statement distributed by Business Wire today. “This project will commercialize natural gas resources in western Africa to meet growing demand in the region and internationally.” Shipments Planned Production</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371474379790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:06:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371475723208-4</Id><Title>Obamanomics vs. German economics…</Title><Msg>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German wages rose at their fastest pace in almost four years at the start of 2013 and euro zone exports jumped in April, giving the bloc a basis for a recovery from its long recession. Nominal hourly labor costs rose 3.9 percent in Germany in the first quarter, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said on Monday, faster than the overall euro zone rate of 1.6 percent. It was Germany's biggest jump since the first three months of 2009. Payroll taxes have been cut as well so workers even better off than the report shows. Germany’s total post World War trade surplus is now $4 trillion a figure worth many times that in assets purchased around the world with the money and control of foreign GDP that flows from the assets. A good portion of those assets have been accruing value steadily from the 1970-1990s in the accounts and balance sheets of individuals and corporate entities, and their value is many times the original investment - had it been invested in gold (as some was) it would be sufficient to buy the entire world's supply. Meanwhile US economic figures show steep falls in wage income thanks to a large tax increase, and continuing budget and trade deficits. This sort of economic mismanagement is to be expected, considering that the US does not run its economy by means of planning while Germany has and does. The principle of military order, an expression of noble order and values, which runs through hundreds of year of German history did not stop in 1945. The officers in charge of the economy simply took the mantle of corporate officers and government leaders. The machine of Germany AG has kept right on functioning with sons and grandsons replacing fathers and grandfathers...</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1371475723208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371478267680-5</Id><Title>Time for oil to spike again.

Germany is your main logistical hub. I’m certain the Luftwaffe would allow US military jets to land and use German airspace but that would not do you much good without control of the bases. My family has consistently pushed for a bigger military budget. I would love to see Germany double its military outlay. The Luftwaffe has a good number of B61 nuclear weapons that supposedly belong to the US. I think ballistic missile submarines are really ideal. We should build some. I think Germany should fit out air fleets of thousands of military drones as well with the best laser weapons our scientists can produce. Why bother with pilots? I agree entirely with your post.

At closed-door fundraisers held over the past few weeks, the president has been telling Democratic party donors that he will unveil new climate proposals in July, according to people who have attended the events or been briefed. Obama’s promise frequently comes in response to pleas from donors to reject TransCanada Corp (TRP).’s proposed Keystone XL project, a $5.3 billion pipeline that would carry tar-sands oil from Canada to U.S. refineries. Opponents of the pipeline say it would increase greenhouse-gas emissions by encouraging use of the tar sands. While Obama has not detailed the specifics of his plan to the donors, pipeline opponents anticipate the package will include final rules from the Environmental Protection Agency to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from new power plants. In April, the EPA delayed issuing the rule after the electric-power industry said the initial proposal was unworkable. Since then, the agency has been revising the rules, and environmental groups are urging the EPA not to scale back its initial plan. Power Plants The White House plan may also include pledging to issue a standard for limits on existing power plants, something EPA officials have said they expect to propose in the next 18 months. Final decisions about the specific policies included in the president’s package are still being made, according to a person close to the White House. Speaking to donors in Palo Alto, California, last week, Obama called the need for action on climate change one of the “most important decisions” facing the country. “We’re not going to be able to make those changes solely through a bunch of individual de</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1371494069200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:34:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371497531084-15</Id><Topic><Title>USDA considers banning bluecheese !!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371242397997</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:39:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course !</Msg><Username>jojomax411</Username><Timestamp>1371497531084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371498693545-16</Id><Title>Endless Printing + Endless Mideast Wars</Title><Msg>are *Bullish* for XOM.
