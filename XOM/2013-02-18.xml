Its price index is broken down by region, and from what I’ve gathered, it’s the best source for solar PV prices in Australia. Solar Choice has a network of over 100 solar installers. The comparison shopping firm just recently released its February price index. As you can see in the table below, the median price for a 5kW solar PV system is now under $2/watt in Australia — $1.98/watt, to be specific. (I think that must be in AUD, though. At the current transfer rate, that would be USD $2.04/watt — still a great deal less than solar in the U.S.) For a little more context on how things are changing in Australia, Solar Choice writes: “Following on from the January PV Price Index, prices remain higher than previous months as a result in the decrease in available Federal Solar Rebates but despite this, the cost of solar PV continues to decrease.” To read much more and see other tables on the price of solar and solar incentives in various regions of Australia, check out Solar Choice’s full post: Solar Choice Price Index – February 2013. Presumably, Australian solar prices are much lower than U.S. solar prices for several of the same reasons German solar prices are much lower than U.S. solar prices — U.S. permitting regulations (or shackles) are much more costly; the U.S. market isn’t as mature or competitive; and U.S. incentives may be keeping solar prices higher. But this all requires much more research to be more than an educated guess. Anyway, it’s great to see the price of solar dropping below $2/watt in Australia!

Known as Democratic Rep. John Bradley’s bill, it is expected to be shaped by months of discussions that have taken place among environmental and industry leaders and legislators. Last year, legislation that started with support from both environmental and industry groups died after undergoing various permutations, including the addition of a two-year fracking moratorium. “We’re 85 percent there in terms of where the environmental groups, industry and the Attorney General’s office want it to be,” said Tom Wolf, executive director of the Energy Council of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. “But the last 15 percent can sometimes be very difficult.” On Feb. 6 Illinois state senator Mattie Hunter, from Chicago, introduced a bill like last year’s calling for a two-year moratorium to allow further study of the possible impacts of fracking the state’s New Albany Shale for natural gas. Experts said Hunter’s bill, an amendment to the Illinois Oil and Gas Act, is unlikely to pass given the failure of last year’s moratorium bill and the fact that industry and environmental leaders have been involved in crafting the Bradley bill. Gas companies have leased about a half million acres and spent at least $100 million preparing for exploration in central and southern Illinois. But they have been slow to proceed while there is uncertainty over regulations, and it is still unknown whether the shale deposits will prove commercially viable. “There’s a de facto moratorium in Illinois” until regulations are passed, Wolf said. “Companies aren’t willing to do test wells until they know what the regulatory landscape will look like. The Albany Shale has promise, but it’s not a guaranteed success.” Some landowners and national advocacy groups say they will only be satisfied with an outright ban on fracking. Other environmental leaders say a regulatory bill is necessary. “We support the moratorium – taking time to develop strong safeguards and analyze the new scientific information becoming available is definitely smart policy,” said Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club’s Illinois chapter. “At the same time we realize not everyone feels that way, so in the event we’re not able to establish a moratorium we understand we’ve got to get the strongest protections in place that we can. It’s a two-pronged approach.” A strong regulatory bill? Though specifics remain to be seen, both Wolf and environmentalists involved in the discussions said that as the draft bill stands now, it will be one of the most stringent–or perhaps the most stringent–in the nation. “When you have a lot of different interests and people at the table, it’s hard to reach complete consensus on everything,” said Nick Magrisso, policy advocate for the Midwest Program for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which has been involved in the regulatory discussions. “But we have reached consensus on a lot of important issues…We are very optimistic that this process has been as successful as we could have envisioned and the protections we’ve been able to advocate have defined a new floor for Illinois and other states to follow.” The NRDC and Sierra Club are members of RE-AMP, which also publishes Midwest Energy News. Disposal of contaminated water is one of the prime concerns in fracking, involving both the “flowback” water that–combined with grit and chemicals–is pumped in to fracture shale; and the “produced water” already in the earth that is contaminated by the process. Those close to the negotiations expect the law to contain requirements that all contaminated water be stored in closed tanks or, in emergency situations, in lined pits. “Water management is a huge question we want to see addressed,” said Magrisso. The bill is expected to require companies to make public the chemicals they are using, but it likely will allow them to invoke trade secrets to avoid disclosure–a common practice nationwide. The bill introduced last year, which contained language from the American Legislative Exchange Council, was controversial in part because it narrowly defined the parties with standing to sue to challenge trade secret privileges (an issue that’s also come up in Ohio). This year’s bill may allow a wider range of people to sue to force disclosure. Wolf said disclosure is among the areas where companies are more willing to work with environmental groups than they were in the past. “In the big picture, the industry has matured and changed over the years, it’s not the industry it was in 2005,” Wolf said. He said environmental groups have also become more knowledgeable about the technology and the improvements that have been made. The bill is also expected to mandate baseline water testing, making it easier to determine if water is polluted by fracking. And the bill is expected to include a presumption of liability that fracking has caused any pollution that occurs. “Without a presumption, a fracking company could suggest all sorts of explanations for contamination that turns up near their operations–they could say space aliens did it–and enforcement authorities would be stuck having to try to prove none of them were true,” Magrisso said. The bill is also expected to include strong provisions for citizen enforcement, meaning citizens who suspect violations can sue to spur government agencies to step in. Safe fracking? Jessica Fujan, a Midwest organizer for the national group Food and Water Watch, said the group is opposed to fracking across the board. They have worked with Illinois Citizen Action to call for a statewide ban on fracking. “We think regulating fracking is an impossibility and a joke,” Fujan said. “Our stance is that there is no such thing as safe fracking–pollution and damage to underground water sources cannot be undone. We are adamant that any moratorium present no pathway to fracking.” She added that the group is “actively opposed” to the regulatory bill, though she believes its crafters include “people with good intentions.” The group SAFE (Southern Illinois Against Fracturing our Environment) is made up of landowners and other residents in areas where companies have already leased large swaths of farmland and forest. SAFE executive director Annette McMichael, who has been approached by “landmen” seeking to lease her property, said the group supports the moratorium bill. On March 1 all three groups will hold a town meeting in Carbondale. McMichael said SAFE members have scheduled several lobbying days in early March, and they plan to hire professional lobbyists. She said she knows some environmental leaders say a moratorium bill “will never pass,” but she sees that as a “defeatist attitude.” “With experienced people who know how to make this happen, I think we have–I don’t want to say a 50-50 chance, but–an opportunity well worth pursuing,” she said. She added that SAFE will “never support anything that doesn’t have a moratorium.” And she is upset that SAFE was not involved in the discussions that are expected to lead to the regulatory bill. “We have not been invited to participate at all,” she said. “We in southern Illinois feel like we should have a voice because we will be most affected.” States fending for themselves Without new industry-specific legislation, state agencies like the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Natural Resources don’t have the power to adequately monitor and regulate fracking, environmental leaders say. That’s because the agencies get much of their authority under federal laws which don’t apply to the oil and gas industry or hydraulic fracturing. As the Environmental Working Group explained in a 2009 report, the oil and gas industries have exemptions from federal laws including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 specifically excluded hydraulic fracturing from provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act related to underground injection of fluids. “No other industry would be able to come to Illinois and threaten our water and our communities like this,” said Darin. “We’ve got to have adequate national regulation, but we can’t really have that until Congress closes the loopholes created in 2005. I don’t think anyone expects the U.S. House to do that anytime soon, so states are on their own, facing these threats as best they can.” midwestenergynewsDOTcom/2013/02/18/illinois-fracking-rules-could-be-strictest-in-the-nation/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361211252956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 13:14:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361211297896-28</Id><Topic><Title>[EXCLUSIVE] XOM CEO on MAD MONEY!

But, beyond simply pushing for it, WWF has also helped map out plans for how to reach a renewable energy future. A new report from WWF, Putting the EU on Track for 100% Renewable Energy [1], “shows where Europe needs to be by 2030 in order to reach a fully renewable energy system by 2050,” as WWF writes in an article about the report. Here’s more from WWF on these matters: By 2030, the EU could be reducing its energy use by more than a third and generate almost half of the remainder from renewables. The post-2020 climate and energy policies needed to deliver this vision would help the EU to reduce its €573bn external fossil fuel bill and cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half. Coming amid an increasingly active debate over what should follow current EU climate and energy legislation (the 20-20-20 package[2]), WWF’s report adapts the WWF Global 2050 Energy Scenario[3] to the EU27 level and shows that by 2030 the EU could. use at least 38% less energy compared to a business as usual projection, generate more than 40% of its energy from renewable sources, by doing both, reduce its energy related greenhouse emissions by 50% compared to 1990 levels. As Europe’s economies struggle to recover, renewable energy and energy savings are beacons of hope. Almost 8 out of 10 Europeans agree that fighting climate change can boost the economy and create jobs[4] and 70% of Europeans believe investment in renewable energy should be prioritised over the next 30 years, compared to alternative energy sources including shale gas, nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants[5]. “Improving on Europe’s 2020 climate and energy targets by introducing an ambitious package of post-2020 measures is a win-win situation for everyone. It would not only help reduce the impact of climate change [6], including huge health and environmental costs, but it would also help to generate up to 5 million jobs [7], significantly boosting the economy,” said Jason Anderson, Head of Climate &amp; Energy at WWF European Policy Office. However, to keep Europe on track, on-going effort and strong political will are needed. The timely adoption of a coherent package of ambitious and binding post-2020 targets for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions reductions is key. “We must now decide how our energy system will develop after 2020, so that current benefits are maximised, not squandered”, added Jason Anderson. “Our report clearly shows that the EU has untapped potential for cutting energy use, taking full advantage of renewable sources that could deliver cheaper and more secure energy, and ensuring that a 100% renewable European energy system by 2050 remains within reach.” 1.

Photo: , Star Tribune Star Tribune photo galleries 2 comments The only battery in Minnesota large enough to store electricity from wind turbines is going back into operation after a 15-month shutdown and overhaul to reduce the risk of fire. Xcel Energy Inc. installed the $4.7 million battery in 2008 next to a Luverne, Minn., wind farm and operated it safely for more than two years. The sodium-sulfur battery was shut down in October 2011 on the advice of its Japanese manufacturer after a similar unit caught fire there. Now, the Minneapolis-based utility says, the Luverne battery has been rebuilt by manufacturer NGK Insulators of Nagoya and is likely to be back in service by February. "It is a brand-new battery at this point," Albert Choi, Xcel's Denver-based manager of next-generation research, said during an interview. The one-million-watt battery can store enough electricity to provide power to 500 homes for 7.2 hours. Researchers who analyzed output of the "Wind-to-Battery Project" in 2009-11 found that it successfully stored electricity and released it as needed. "It wasn't like we had problems," added Mark Willers, CEO of MinWind III, which owns the adjacent wind farm and substation and sells the output to Xcel. "It ran perfectly." Utilities like Xcel, which has the most wind power on its system of any U.S. utility, are looking at energy storage because wind farms often generate power at night and at other times when demand is low. Pike Research of Boulder, Colo., estimates the world market for grid storage, including batteries, could exceed $30 billion a year by 2022. When the Luverne unit began operating in 2009, it was the nation's largest wind-farm battery. On Wednesday, Duke Energy said a new, 36-megawatt system is storing power at its Notrees Windpower Project in Texas, making it the nation's largest wind farm battery. The project received a $22 million U.S. Energy Department grant that the Charlotte, N.C.-based power company matched. Risk of fire One shortcoming of some new battery technologies is the fire risk. After the September 2011 battery fire in Japan, NGK halted production of the batteries and advised customers, including Xcel and 19 other customers in North America, to stop using them. NGK later determined that a faulty cell had leaked molten material, triggering a short circuit and fire. While NGK has addressed issues with its sodium-sulfur technology, new battery worries have grounded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. U.S. and Japanese safety investigators are looking at lithium-ion batteries and related electrical components after two incidents in which the batteries caught fire or overheated aboard Dreamliners. Those batteries are made by Japan's GS Yuasa Corp. NGK said it has redesigned its grid-scale batteries, adding fuses and insulation. Aki Sawafuji, a company spokesman, said the company completed replacing or refurbishing all of its North American customers' batteries in January and has resumed production. "We believe that the measures we have taken are sufficient to allay uncertainties about the future safety of the technology," Sawafuji said in an e-mail. When Xcel's battery in Luverne goes back online, it again will store power from the farmer-owned wind farm and release it to the grid as needed, said Xcel's Choi. Besides this so-called load-shifting, the batteries also help regulate and smooth power on the grid, according to a 2011 research report. Choi said the price of batteries will have to drop before they become a better investment than power plants fueled by natural gas, for example. He said Xcel remains interested in the technology and is testing two other bulk-storage batteries in Colorado. "We don't see battery technology as a viable solution in the next few years," Choi said. One U.S. manufacturer says lower-cost, utility-scale batteries are here. Zinc Air of Columbia Falls, Mont., said Wednesday that it signed a deal to sell its first large battery to Flathead Electric Cooperative in Kalispell, Mont. Craig Wilkins, Zinc Air's executive vice president, said the company hopes to sell six units this year. They're about half the price for the same wattage as NGK units but with less backup time, Wilkins said. Dan Juhl, CEO of Juhl Wind, a Pipestone, Minn.-based wind-farm developer, said his company is considering installing a Zinc Air battery at a Minnesota site, possibly this spring. Juhl said he likes the company's "Zinc Redox" technology, which promises to be nontoxic and nonexplosive. Wilkins confirmed that Juhl and Zinc Air have been talking but have not reached a deal. "Storage has always been the Holy Grail of renewables," Juhl said. "What we are working on is combining renewable energy with a little bit of storage to become a fully functioning power plant." startribuneDOTcom/business/188416921.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361215654884</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 14:27:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361217468482-34</Id><Topic><Title>Quantum Chemistry Application - Methanol to gasoline</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1361216459694</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 14:40:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With sufficient knowledge of quantum chemistry there is no difficulty synthesizing gasoline from air using carbon dioxide, a source of water, and an external power source (like unusable power in power grids or from solar and wind) Ammonia is produced from the air thanks to chemistry, in particular German chemistry...

It will take to time to devise a process that makes gasoline from air and water cheaper than Exxon Mobil accomplish it from crude oil. The time factor is a function, basically, of simulating trillions upon trillions of reactions, something can be achieved iteratively with brute force computing techniques. In the meantime efficiency can be squeezed out of systems on the use side by engineering materials and systems with similar analytical techniques. You had better how these improvements progress slowly because they certainly me the annihilation of the oil &amp; gas industry.
