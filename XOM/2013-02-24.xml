AWEA notes 66 U.S. utilities bought or owned wind power by the start of this year – nearly half for large amounts over 100 MW – up from 42 last year. In fact, since the extension of the PTC in January, utilities have continued to show interest in buying a wind project's output or owning the wind farm outright. "From Xcel Energy in Minnesota to OG&amp;E in Arkansas, electric consumers are racking up the savings as a result," says Rob Gramlich, AWEA's interim CEO. "The wind energy industry looks forward to our continued partnerships with utilities across the country to lock in the economic development, rate stabilizing and environmental benefits of more wind power." As evidence, AWEA cites the following utilities, which are making major wind power purchases and reporting consumer savings: Xcel Energy, the No.1 wind energy provider in the U.S., is considering adding more wind generation in Minnesota and Colorado because of the PTC extension; MidAmerican Energy, the No. 1 company in the U.S. in terms of utility ownership of wind capacity, announced Dec. 31, 2012, that it had completed three more wind projects totaling 407 MW in Iowa. MidAmerican is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company controlled by investor Warren Buffett; Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which, citing the recently extended PTC and ongoing renewable portfolio standard requirements, is moving forward with a request for proposals for up to 100 MW of renewable energy; DTE Energy's ECHO Wind project, slated for 2013, will have a combined levelized cost of approximately $52.50/MWh, down substantially from power purchase prices several years earlier, according to the Michigan Public Service Commission. DTE says its investment in the wind farm - and two others - will contribute $150 million in economic benefits to Michigan; and Consumers Electric Power, which estimates that Macon County and the state of Michigan received an economic boost of nearly $10 million from the development of Lake Winds Energy Park, the company's first wind farm, AWEA notes. nawindpowerDOTcom/e107_plugins/content/contentDOTphp?content.11155#DOTUSnXWyy9KK0</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361696783699</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 04:06:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361700992996-4</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is a sniveling weasel</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340708573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:25:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxi coward commie #$%$.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1361700992996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 05:16:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361701094403-5</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxidopey is leaving soon.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1361701094403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 05:18:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361701217956-6</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve &amp; donald trump</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1361323379512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 20:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>all u poor commie slobs be prepared to starve cause the rich are moving their $ out of america and ur reach.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1361701217956</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 05:20:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361704589381-7</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>sanromanwiliam</Username><Timestamp>1361547275275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:34:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>diconkris</Username><Timestamp>1361704589381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 06:16:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361716341824-8</Id><Topic><Title>ref_steve is mentally unbalanced</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1360340478325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maxipad, no new alias.. we are united againt wahlee and morons like you. we deport those that have your mentailty. united we stand. bye bye maxipad</Msg><Username>max_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1361716341824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 09:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361716942372-9</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

Part of the quid pro quo is we want people to understand what our record,” on environmental protection, the premier said. “We think it’s important to be leaders and demonstrate some leadership and we’ve done that.” Dozens of U.S. power brokers are receiving a version of that message this weekend in Washington. Ms. Redford and her environment minister, Diana McQueen, are in the American capital to hang around the margins of the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, which attracts the leaders of the 50 states and a countless number of officials, staffers and lobbyists with influence in the White House and on Capitol Hill. Ms. Redford called her trip “organic,” and said she wasn’t in Washington to advocate for any particular project. Ms. Redford said she met Saturday with Maine Governor Paul LePage to discuss her efforts – with New Brunswick Premier David Alward – to clear the way for a pipeline that would stretch east from the oil sands. Yet the Alberta premier made no attempt to suggest that Keystone XL wasn’t the primary topic of conversation. TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.’s proposal to ship Canadian heavy crude from northern Alberta to refineries in Texas must win the approval of the Obama administration. The president’s supporters in the environmental movement want the project blocked, arguing the energy-intensive transaction process used in the oil sands emits too much carbon. Mr. Obama temporarily stalled the pipeline last year, and is expected to make a final decision in the spring. The fervent opposition to Alberta oil caught Canadian officials off guard. Ms. Redford visited Washington within a few weeks of first becoming premier in October, 2011. She says she soon learned that the old arguments in favour of Canadian oil – a safe, friendly supplier; jobs, jobs and more jobs – were no longer enough. “We heard very quickly that they don’t want to hear anymore the security argument or the jobs argument. We get that,” Ms. Redford said, remarking on the response she got to Alberta’s traditional pitch. “Really, this is about environmental stewardship and sustainable development of the oil sands. We were quite happy to talk about that, [but] that was a shift in the kinds of conversations that Alberta was having.” The two Alberta politicians arrived in Washington a week after thousands of environmentalists rallied against the Keystone pipeline on the National Mall, a show of force that poses a political dilemma for Mr. Obama, who used his State of the Union speech to pledge a fresh assault on climate change. Tens of thousands of the people who helped elect him say he should start by refusing TransCanada’s request to build a pipeline across the border, and strike a blow against “dirty oil.” Ms. Redford is countering that message by insisting her government is as committed to fighting climate change as any in North America. Following a separate meeting with the Washington Post’s environment reporter, Alberta’s premier and environment minister insisted their province gets too little credit for its green agenda. The province plans to set aside millions of hectares for conservation, including 1.2-million hectares that already has been put off-limits for exploitation in the oil-sands region. It has put limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and is one of the few jurisdictions in the world that has put a price – $15 a tonne – on carbon emissions that exceed provincial limits. Receipts from that penalty are used to stock a new technology fund. “It’s a strong record,” Ms. Redford said. “We’re ahead of a lot of places in the world, and people tend not to know that.” theglobeandmailDOTcom/news/politics/redford-stumps-for-oil-sands-keystone-xl-pipeline-in-washington/article9007811/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361752915589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 19:41:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361765671891-20</Id><Topic><Title>Currency reallocation...</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1361558634067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:43:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sold € for £ @ 0.8760 £/€ € basis 0.8654 £/€ (1.1555 €/£).
