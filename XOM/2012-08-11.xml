Phillip Moeller, one of five commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees electric reliability, said in a letter to Governor Jerry Brown that California's prohibition of and lack of clarity about "resource shuffling" may disrupt its electricity market. "I respectfully request that you direct ARB to suspend enforcement of the prohibition of resource shuffling until such time that the ARB clarifies rules surrounding compliance with, and enforcement of, the provision," Moeller wrote in the letter dated August 6. Resource shuffling occurs when a regulated plant that delivers electricity to California modifies its contracts to import lower-emission electricity to the state while sending its more carbon-intensive electricity to other states without greenhouse gas curbs, giving the impression that it has reduced its emissions. By redirecting their dirty power to other states, they could receive additional emission allowances under the state's cap-and-trade program, potentially creating a windfall for firms that have still emitted carbon outside of the state and undermining the state's goals to cut carbon emissions. California requires power importers to pledge in writing every year that they are not shuffling their resources. Moeller and some power producers have criticized the ARB rules, saying that the regulator's definition of resource shuffling is too broad. They are also concerned that because power trading across state lines is complicated and fast-paced, out-of-state power producers may sometimes run afoul of the rule without knowing it. "By failing to clearly define "resource shuffling" but nevertheless prohibiting it, and by requiring energy importers to affirm, under penalty of perjury, that they have not engaged in resource shuffling, the ARB is creating uncertainty and great concern among entities that sell into California," Moeller wrote. He added that California relies on imported power for nearly one-quarter of its electricity supply and would not be able to maintain electric reliability if those power producers opted not to participate in the California market to avoid the regulatory uncertainty. Of the 25 percent of electricity that California gets from outside its borders, a significant amount comes from more carbon-intensive sources and accounts for about 50 percent of the state's total electricity sector emissions. The ARB said it will continue to pay "very careful attention" to the issue in the design and enforcement of its cap-and-trade program. "The state will continue to work closely with FERC and other agencies to guard against any adverse impacts to the economies of California and other western states," said Stanley Young, a spokesman for the ARB. http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/08/us-california-carbon-idINBRE8770C320120808</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344705338000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:15:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344705349000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Regulator urges change in California cap-and-trade program</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344705338000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:15:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The regulator has said previously that it will not change the provision of its cap-and-trade regulation because it believes it will prevent fraud. Moeller added that despite its good intentions, California regulators run the risk of repeating the kind of chaos that occurred during the state's energy crisis in 2000-2001, when electricity prices soared and there were frequent intermittent power shortages. "Regardless of any laudable intentions the ARB has in developing its approach to these issues, the potential ramifications to the economies of California and the Western states require extreme caution to prevent market and supply disruptions." Jon Costantino, a senior advisor on climate change and environmental policy at law firm Mannat, Phelps &amp; Phillips, said it is unlikely that the warnings of one commissioner will sway California regulators. "It is only one commissioner, so until we hear that a majority feel the same way, it is just one voice," he said, adding that there has been no indication from the Brown administration that it will change direction.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344705349000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:15:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344706031000-4</Id><Title>Lawmakers urge faster OK of LNG exports</Title><Msg>Lawmakers urge faster OK of LNG exports By Jennifer A. Dlouhy Published 9:58 p.m., Tuesday, August 7, 2012 WASHINGTON - Nearly four dozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers from oil patch states implored the Obama administration Tuesday to fast-track permits for export of liquefied natural gas. The bipartisan push comes as a glut of domestic natural gas keeps prices low and has sent energy companies scrambling to find new markets for the fossil fuel. In a letter to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the lawmakers said exports are necessary to continue fostering development in Texas, Louisiana and other states that long have shipped gas via pipelines to other parts of the country that didn't produce it themselves. A boom in extracting natural gas from dense shale rock formations nationwide means that those areas historically served by pipelines and far-flung resources now can get the fuel much closer to home. "Large portions of the country which were previously served by our region via pipeline now have a closer commodity at hand," said the 44 lawmakers, led by Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, and Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla. "As such, without the ability to market to international customers, this could have a severe impact on production in our states." "Our region and our country need an outlet for natural gas production," the lawmakers added. Signers consisted of 10 Democrats and 34 Republicans from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Besides Gene Green, the Texans were Houston Democrats Al Green and Sheila Jackson Lee and Republicans Joe Barton of Ennis; Kevin Brady of The Woodlands; John Carter of Round Rock; John Culberson of Houston; Blake Farenthold of Corpus Christi; Bill Flores of Waco; Kay Granger of Fort Worth; Ralph Hall of Rockwall; Pete Sessions of Dallas; and Pete Olson of Sugar Land. The lawmakers suggested the Energy Department is moving too slowly in vetting applications from at least seven companies to begin exporting liquefied natural gas, including a proposal from Texas' Freeport LNG Development. Postponed verdicts Federal regulators recently approved Houston-based Cheniere Energy's plans to begin exporting LNG from its Sabine Pass terminal in southwest Louisiana, but the Energy Department has postponed verdicts on similar proposals until it gets the results of a study evaluating how selling more American-harvested natural gas overseas would affect prices for U.S. consumers. The study is expected to be out this summer. "In our collective view, it is time to bring a renewed sense of urgency to the approval process," the lawmakers told Chu. Sharing the bounty The administration is struggling to decide whether - and how much - the U.S. should share its new natural gas bounty with foreign countries. It already sells a relatively small amount of natural gas to Mexico, Canada, Brazil and other countries, but pending proposals could put the U.S. on track to export about 16 billion cubic feet daily. "As part of the department's statutory responsibility to determine whether natural gas exports are in the public interest, the Energy Department is assessing the economic impacts of increased natural gas exports," spokeswoman Jen Stutsman said. http://www.chron.com/business/article/Lawmakers-urge-faster-OK-of-LNG-exports-3770545.php</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706031000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:27:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344706041000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Lawmakers urge faster OK of LNG exports</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706031000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:27:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prices in U.S. White House energy and climate change adviser Heather Zichal has said that a major concern is ensuring that if natural gas is exported, it won't send prices too high inside U.S. borders - hurting American consumers and manufacturers who use natural gas as a building block to make other products. Foreign rivals In their letter, the oil patch lawmakers insist that if U.S. regulators drag their feet, American producers could lose out to foreign competitors. Most of the companies pursuing export licenses want to convert terminals for receiving natural gas imports that were built before today's drilling boom. The liquefaction process involves cooling natural gas to 256 degrees below zero, transforming it into a liquid that can be transported by tanker ships. The liquefied natural gas can be converted into a gas form at its destination.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706041000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344706427000-6</Id><Title>Vilsack: No reason to panic over crop yields</Title><Msg>Published Saturday, August 11, 2012 at 1:00 am / Updated at 4:56 am Vilsack: No reason to panic over crop yields By David Hendee and Leslie Reed WORLD-HERALD STAFF WRITERS The nation's No. 1 crop may be withering in parched fields across the country, but there's no reason to panic, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Friday in Omaha. The corn crop — which feeds cattle, pigs and poultry, produces ethanol fuel, plastics and sweeteners, and is exported around the world — has been clobbered by heat and a lack of rain this summer. The crop could be 13 percent smaller than the amount harvested in 2011, which would be the smallest crop since 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday in its monthly crop production report. The soybean crop would be 12 percent less than last year. “We're going to get through this,” Vilsack said. “The key here is ... that we don't panic, that the rest of the world doesn't panic and that we don't jump to conclusions about what we need to do or not do because we're going to have a little less corn and a little less soybeans than we thought a month or two ago.'' Vilsack said it was no surprise that the historic drought has affected production. Still, the corn crop this year is forecast to be the eighth-largest in history. Vilsack said it will take time for retail food prices to reflect any impact from the drought and a smaller-than-expected corn crop. Beef, poultry and pork prices may stabilize or decline as more meat goes to market in the short term. Livestock producers are expected to cut back their herds and flocks in the face of more expensive corn-based feed, he said. “Longer term, we obviously may see some increases, but put it into perspective,'' he said. “Farmers only get 14 cents of every food dollar. Somebody else gets 86 cents.'' After an initial surge Friday morning, corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade closed near $8 a bushel, in part because the USDA report was less pessimistic than traders expected. Vilsack said increases in the price of corn and other commodities don't necessarily translate into dollar-for-dollar increases in food prices. USDA economists expect food inflation to be between 3 percent and 4 percent next year, just a bit more than the historic 3 percent. The drought might be responsible for a half percentage point to 1 point of the increase, Vilsack said. Vilsack was in Omaha to address about 250 members of the American Coalition for Ethanol. He also met with Nebraska wind energy and rural development officials in two other private sessions. The crop report verified what most Nebraskans and Iowans see when driving down country roads. “This may be the worst year I've had,” said Carl Sousek, who raises dryland corn near Prague, Neb. “I've been farming since '81 and we've had some tough years, but I don't know that it's ever been this bad.” Some farmers said the prediction was better than what they're seeing in their fields. Bob Bartek, who farms near Ithaca, Neb., harvested non-irrigated corn last week. It yielded a scant 30 to 80 bushels per acre. But it's not a disaster everywhere. Darrel McAlexander, who raises dryland corn near Sidney, Iowa, said he had worried the report would be even worse. He declared the projection about right. “We're going to have more corn than what I thought,” he said, anticipating a harvest of between 100 bushels and 130 bushels per acre, though others in his region will suffer bigger losses. http://www.omaha.com/article/20120811/NEWS/708119929/1685</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706427000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:33:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344706438000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Vilsack: No reason to panic over crop yields</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706427000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:33:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Irrigation may be a saving grace for many farmers in heavily irrigated Nebraska. Though corn prices are at record highs, irrigation farmers also have higher expenses. “Our irrigated corn looks good — it's not going to be a bin-buster, but it's going to run 180 to 220 bushels per acre,” said Scott Houck, who raises corn and soybeans near Strang, Neb. About 80 percent of his crop is irrigated. The corn forecast worsened — compared with projections issued a month ago — and is expected to increase pressure to relent on a federal mandate for the United States to use more ethanol fuel, which is derived mostly from corn. In a pep talk to the ethanol coalition, Vilsack said the industry must push back against opponents who are organizing a well-financed campaign against the fuel rule. Vilsack said livestock, export and ethanol markets quickly reacted to the reality of the drought and that ethanol's benefits to the rural and national economies are too important to risk losing if the fuel mandate is waived. Ethanol producers say they have adapted to the drought by reducing corn consumption and slowing production. Steve Nelson, an Axtell farmer who is president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, said consumers should not worry too much about the drought's impact on food prices or the overall economy. “One of the things we have in Nebraska is a lot of irrigation,” he said. “The yields won't be off as far or down as much on irrigated land as it is on non-irrigated land. From an overall economy perspective, Nebraska is fortunate to have the irrigation we have.” Vilsack said the relatively large projected harvest this fall is an impressive feat during a historic drought. “That speaks volumes to the resilience of American producers and their willingness to adopt new technologies that make it a little easier to get through a tough period.”</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344706438000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344709423000-8</Id><Title>Stephen Harper treading carefully on Enbridge in face of growing pipeline opposition</Title><Msg>Stephen Harper treading carefully on Enbridge in face of growing pipeline opposition By MICHAEL SMYTH, The Province August 8, 2012 When it comes to prying juicy quotes out of Stephen Harper, the prime minister proved during his Vancouver visit that he’s no Christine Sinclair. The big-hearted captain of our soccer team had plenty to say after Canada got robbed at the Olympics. In contrast, Harper had his lips zipped when asked about the Enbridge pipeline here at home. A lot of people think B.C. is getting robbed on the share of benefits from the proposed pipeline — just an eight-per-cent cut for taking the vast majority of environmental risk of an oil spill. The proposed terms triggered a nasty spat between B.C. Premier Christy Clark and Alberta counterpart Alison Redford, but Harper made it clear he won’t get involved in the fight — at least not in public. “I’m not going to get into an argument or a discussion about how we divide hypothetical revenues,” Harper said. But how committed is Harper to getting the pipeline built, the bitumen flowing and the supertankers sailing? After all, Harper’s ruling Conservatives have said the pipeline is in the national interest and shouldn’t be hijacked by environmental naysayers. Would Harper ram the pipeline though over B.C.’s objections? The prime minister’s tone was again less than provocative. “The only way governments can handle controversial projects of this manner is to ensure that things are evaluated on an independent basis scientifically, and not simply on political criteria,” Harper said. Harper’s carefully measured words follow Conservative MP James Moore’s comment that Christy Clark is right to stand up for B.C., and Enbridge can’t be allowed to use the province like a “doormat” in pursuit of profits. Is this the first signal that the Conservatives are willing to fold their hand on the Northern Gateway pipeline they want so much? It stands in contrast to their announcement last week that Harper’s cabinet will make the final call on the pipeline, no matter what that National Energy Board recommends after public hearings conclude. But it seems certain the Conservatives are carefully evaluating the level of opposition to the project, and the potential political price of pushing ahead with it. Here’s what the pipeline is up against: Public opposition is rising, according to polls. Christy Clark is talking tough. She could be replaced next year by the NDP’s Adrian Dix, who is staunchly anti-pipeline. And First Nations are vowing to fight any pipeline through their traditional territories. If you want to know how estranged First Nations are from Enbridge, consider this incredible story: Last January, an Enbridge official attended a public hearing in Burns Lake, only to get a face full of feathers from a native elder. “A Wet’suweten elder blew a myriad of tiny feathers over a Northern Gateway representative,” the company reported in a document submitted to the National Energy Board. “These feathers covered the hair and clothing of the Northern Gateway representative targeted by this feathering incident.” The company said a native speaker warned that trespassing on Wet’suweten land was “punishable by death.” But the First Nation later explained the “myriad of tiny feathers” was eagle down, and the “feathering incident” was actually a traditional sign of peace, not a death threat. Whether a sign of peace, or a sign of war, the Harper government surely knows First Nations could fight any pipeline with blockades, or years of litigation in court. In this high-stakes battle of wills, pipeline opponents appear to be winning. http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Harper+treading+carefully+Enbridge+face+growing+pipeline+opposition/7060693/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1344709423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 14:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
