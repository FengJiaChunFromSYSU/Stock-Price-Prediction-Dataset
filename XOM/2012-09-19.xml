I think it’s done so 3 times in the past year and a half. Its initial 2015 target of about 5 GW has been quadrupled to 21 GW in that time (see the link above for more info on that). Now, Giles Parkinson and Sophie Vorrath of Renew Economy indicate that China’s doubling its solar PV target yet again: China &amp; Solar Panel via Shutterstock China is about to double its targeted installation rate for solar PV for the second time in as many months, and now expects more than 40GW to be installed by 2015. According to Deutsche Bank, this target was confirmed by a source “familiar with the matter”, and added that an officer at the National Energy Administration, who also confirmed that there will be no caps on the new added capacity, as had been speculated elsewhere. The new forecast is in fact the fourth upgrade of the target for solar PV for China’s 12th five-year plan, the country’s official economic blueprint. Just 18 months ago, it was set at 5GW, but that is expected to be the rate of installation in calendar 2012 alone. It was doubled to 10GW, then to 20GW, and now 40GW. The upgrade to China’s 2015 forecast means that its 2020 forecast will also have to be lifted, most likely to at least 100GW from its current level of 50GW. That would represent a more than three-fold increase in its forecasts for 2020 made just a year ago, but it reflects the fact that the cost of solar PV continues to fall sharply, and is now a cheaper option in China than peaking power plants, and at the retail and commercial level. Chinese government officials have said that solar PV will offer cheaper wholesale prices – and energy security – than coal or gas by the end of the decade. The higher forecast for 2015 shouldn’t come as a surprise. China’s installation rate is estimated by some to be around 7GW this year. If that rate was continued until 2015, that would mean at least 30GW by then, even without an increase. The Deutsche Bank report, quoting the same sources, said that China will focus on large-scale on-grid solar plants, which will be mainly constructed in the Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia regions. Some projects have already been canvassed that could comprise facilities of 1,000 megawatts or more.

Enbridge gives a much rosier picture of growth in oil production in Canada in its pitch for the pipeline than it gave to its investors at a shareholder meeting last fall, Hana Boye told the Joint Review Panel conducting hearings in Edmonton Tuesday. The higher growth forecast, in public documents filed with the National Energy Board, results in a higher calculation of benefits to the oil industry from the proposed $6 billion pipeline, said Boye. Boye said the lower growth forecast given to investors at a meeting in Toronto means as much as 500,000 fewer barrels per day by 2020 and therefore much less benefit to the oil industry from the pipeline that aims to carry 525,000 barrels a day of bitumen from the Edmonton area to Kitimat, B.C. If Enbridge had used the internal, lower forecast it gave to investors, the much touted “price lift” for bitumen that gives oil companies their benefit would not be as robust, said Boye. Enbridge argues the proposed pipeline will secure higher prices for bitumen by opening up new markets in Asia. Enbridge officials dismissed the difference in the two forecasts as not substantial. The higher forecast comes from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. The numbers will vary depending on when the forecast is done but the difference is too small to have an impact on whether the project is economically viable, said John Carruthers, top manager of the separate company building the Northern Gateway pipeline. “There could be differences as forecasts change over time, but they all show substantial growth in oil supply from the western Canadian basin,” said Carruthers. At the October 2011 investors meeting, an Enbridge executive described that forecast as “bullish” and told investors the company’s growth forecast is lower at 4.4 per cent growth in oil production over 20 years. Boye also said the company has ignored another major cost that comes with the project — the cost of importing large amounts of condensate needed to dilute the thick, sticky bitumen so it will flow in the pipeline. Until 2008, Canada produced enough condensate to meet demand in this country, said Boye. But it now imports 60,000 barrels a day and that will increase significantly to support the increase in bitumen exports in the Northern Gateway pipeline. Each barrel of bitumen shipped in the pipeline must be diluted by about 30 per cent. Some producers may also use light crude oil to blend with bitumen, says an Enbridge report. In its cost-benefit analysis, Enbridge did not calculate the cost of importing condensate because that is a cost borne by companies that ship the bitumen, said Paul Fisher, Enbridge executive. “We anticipate a need to import condensate but that decision will be made by shippers,” said Fisher. Enbridge also confirmed it did not do a separate study on the impact of Canada’s growing dependence on condensate imports from the U.S. Meanwhile, Enbridge told the panel that the company has reversed a pipeline that in the past carried crude oil into the U.S. The Southern Light pipeline will now ship 180,000 barrels a day of condensate to Canada. Enbridge also confirmed it is applying for two separate permits at the hearing, the export pipeline to ship bitumen and the import pipeline to import condensate into Canada. Each pipeline could go ahead separately depending on what the review panel board rules. The $6 billion price tag includes construction and operation of both pipelines. The hearings continue until Sept 28.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348061950912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:39:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348063167396-8</Id><Title>survey respondents also overwhelmingly believe that the country’s Oil Majors will play a supportive role in developing and investing in new biofuels technologies, rather than sitting on the sidelines waiting for a technology to win out</Title><Msg>Based on responses from industry stakeholders from across Brazil, the survey showed an overarching industry belief that cellulosic ethanol, particularly made from sugarcane bagasse, will be the most heavily invested in, widely produced, and used next generation fuel in the country over the next decade.

Historical volatility measures how much prices have varied in the past, and implied volatility uses options prices to measure how market participants believe prices will vary in the future. In the Brent crude oil market, implied volatility is currently higher than historical volatility because of continuing market uncertainties (Figure 1). Implied volatility is expected to remain high until these uncertainties are resolved. Historical volatility is calculated from the daily price movements of the front month futures price, typically for a 30-day period. It provides a snapshot of the magnitude of recent up-and-down price movements, but by definition is a backwards-looking metric. Implied volatility is calculated from the prices of call and put options traded on futures contracts. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is widely used to price crude oil futures options based on a number of factors: the current trading price of the crude oil futures contract; the strike price of the option contract; the time until the option contract expires; and the expected future volatility of the price of the underlying crude oil futures contract. The only one of these variables that is not immediately observable is expected future volatility. By using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the known values of the crude oil futures contract, the strike price of the option, the time until the option expires and the current trading price of the option contract, it is possible to calculate the future volatility that is implied by the relationship of the known values, hence "implied volatility." Historical and implied volatility can diverge when expectations about future price movements differ from recently observed price trends. Historical volatility increased in late June and early July reflecting the rapid drop in crude prices before July 1 and the rapid increase after July 1. Since that time, Brent futures prices have traded in a relatively narrow range, because there have been few significant surprises in crude oil markets over the past month, and historical volatility has reverted to its level over the March-through-May period. Implied volatility did not spike along with historical volatility, implying that market participants did not change their view of longer-term risks, despite the short-term price changes. As the sudden price changes during the middle of the year dropped out of the historical volatility calculation, the two volatility measures returned to their earlier relationship. Over the last four weeks, economic data, policy actions, and oil market balances have generally been consistent with market expectations. The period began with hopes of stimuli from governments and central banks around the world that improved expectations for economic growth and increased oil prices. More recently, the European Central Bank announced details for a new bond-buying program. In addition, the Chinese government formalized plans for $157 billion in infrastructure-improvement spending, and as many analysts had expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve System announced a new round of treasury bond and mortgage-backed security purchases, otherwise known as quantitative easing, at the conclusion of the September 12-13 meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee. After moving higher on improved expectations for economic growth through mid-August, crude oil prices settled into a narrow trading range. That trading range has persisted, causing the decline in historical volatility during the second half of August and the first half of September, with historical volatility reaching a 2012 low on September 13. While historical volatility has declined sharply, implied volatility has fallen only slightly and more gradually on perceptions that geopolitical, technical, and economic risks to future market conditions are largely unchanged. Uncertainty about Iran's nuclear ambitions and surprise production outages from outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are sources of potential upside price risk. A slowdown in China's economic growth and fears over the stability of the euro, even with the recent government and central bank interventions, pose potential downside risks to future crude oil prices. As a result, the market's expectation about future crude oil price volatility has remained relatively high despite the recent downward trend in historical volatility. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices increase again The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased about three cents last week to $3.88 per gallon, 28 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The largest increase came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the average price rose more than seven cents to $3.77 per gallon. The East Coast price added more than a nickel to reach $3.88 per gallon. In the Midwest, the average price increased more than three cents to $3.89 per gallon. The Gulf Coast price was up more than one cent to $3.66 per gallon. Moving in the opposite direction, the West Coast price shed almost a penny, but remains the highest average price in the country at $4.07 per gallon. The national average diesel fuel price increased three-tenths of a cent to $4.14 per gallon, 30 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. The largest increase came in the Rocky Mountain region, where the price increased more than one cent to $4.26 per gallon. The East Coast price was also up more than a penny, to $4.13 per gallon. On the Gulf Coast, the average price added almost a penny to $4.03 per gallon. The Midwest diesel price was almost flat for the week, remaining at $4.08 per gallon. The West Coast saw the only decrease for the week, with its average price falling more than two cents to $4.40 per gallon. Propane inventories show a large build last week Last week, propane stocks experienced a large late-season build, adding 1.3 million barrels to end at 74.0 million barrels, 8.7 million barrels (34 per cent) higher than the same week last year. Big gains happened in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions, which grew by 0.6 and 0.5 million barrels respectively. The East Coast and Rocky Mountain/West coast regions each added 0.1 million barrels to their total stocks. Propylene non-fuel-use inventories represented 6.4 percent of total propane inventories. eia</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348078531086</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348078928756-17</Id><Title>'Death to America' -- how did Obama's 'new beginning' get so old, so quickly?</Title><Msg>The pictures are jarring.

To many, it is difficult to guess why wind farms would make it more difficult to construct gas power plants. Let’s dive in. Wind Farms Generating Cheap Electricity Modern wind farms generate electricity at a low-cost of $0.097 per kWh (9.7 cents) without subsidies. (This is an average — as wind speeds at wind farms increase, the cost of wind power decreases because the ratio of power generated to the cost of developing the wind farms decreases. Some wind farms, of course, produce electricity much more cheaply than others.) Add in subsidies for this young technology, and the price drops further. Now, additionally, it’s worth noting that, while winds are blowing, wind farms can bid to sell their electricity for about as cheap as they need to — because their fuel is free, so it doesn’t really cost anything extra to produce electricity once the wind farms are built. For this reason, we’ve seen wind farms bring the wholesale cost of electricity down to $0 some nights (yep, $0.00). In the most recent Fall, Spring, and Winter, wind farms generated such a large amount of cheap electricity in Doyle’s region that they undercut natural gas power plants during all three seasons (although only 2.5% of the time). At wind speeds of 21 mph, the average cost of wind power drops to as little as 2.6 cents per kWh. Texas is a Wind Power Behemoth According to Gov. Rick Perry’s officials report (page 10), wind energy growth has been tremendous in Texas and it would rank 6th in the world if Texas was a country, with a total wind electricity generation capacity of 10,394 MW (10.4 GW). That is almost a quarter of the United States total, which is 46,919 MW. Wind Farms Don’t Need Much Land For those concerned about wind farm “sprawl” wasting land, the study also made some good points about that (also on page 10). Wind farms require as much land as they do because their blades need to be substantially spaced to permit efficient turbine operation. This is why wind farm ground space is mostly unused or farmland, and the blades are literally hundreds of feet above the ground — this is also why wind turbines are fairly quiet. Most (if not all) wind farms can be used for farming, so the land does not have to be wasted. When the land is put to use, wind turbines end up using the least space of all types of power stations because the only space they actually occupy on land is equal to the width of their towers, which are not very wide. In other words, most of the mass of a wind turbine is well above ground and out of the way, so the size of wind turbines does not have to be a space issue at all. Conclusions The basic conclusions are that wind is so cheap that it is even driving natural gas production out of some areas, and it is extremely efficient when it comes to land use.

Especially regulations – the kind that keep power companies from poisoning your kids with mercury, keep oil companies from running unsafe rigs that blow up and dump millions of gallons of crude into our oceans and rivers, and keep coal companies from running unsafe mines that kill workers. Climate Progress reports that, in newspapers alone, use of the phrase has actually jumped 17,550 percent since 2007, But the GOP’s wind energy policy – the policy of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan – is an actual job-killer – an estimated 37,000 jobs – and it’s already costing them support in the battleground state of Iowa. So why are they doing it? At issue is the wind energy tax credit, a subsidy that has helped the wind energy industry surgeed 123% in the past four years, created 200,000 jobs, and helped to move manufacturing of wind turbines from China (which also has subsidies to help its infant industry compete) to places like Iowa and Michigan. Wind currently provides 20 percent of the electricity in Iowa, and with a little help could grow to provide 20 percent for the whole country by 2030. This was once a bi-partisan issue – when the credit was passed in 1992, Iowa’s GOP Senator Chuck Grassley was a sponsor (who now calls Romney’s opposition to renewal “A knife in my back”). But the law that created the tax credit expires at the end of this year, and while the extension is moving forward in the Senate, with full support from President Obama, the GOP-run House has been blocking it - on ideological grounds. They claim it’s unfair for the government to “pick winners and losers”, and that only the free market should be allowed to decide whether wind power makes it. There are a few minor quibbles with that philosophy, though: ■Industries in America have always gotten subsidies to help them get started, from the railroads (which got huge land grants) to the auto industry (which would never have survived if the government hadn’t paid for the smooth roads that cars need, plus a host of other infrustructure). Without government support, there would be no internet, no aerospace, no human genome… ■China and Europe subsidize the hell out of their wind industry, which has helped it grow xxxxx. So they’re no level playing field, and chopping off the subsidies here will just kill the US industry and ship those jobs to China and Germany. ■Energy industries in America continue to get huge subsidies, including oil and gas, coal, and especially nuclear, which was born out of a government program and wouldn’t survive at all without the government backing it up. And of course, there’s ethanol, a government-backed boondoggle that’s hugely popular in the farm states. Several times over the past few years, Democrats have tried to eliminate the billions of dollars in subsidies for big oil, only to be beaten back by the GOP howling “This will kill jobs!”. So much for the philosophical commitment to pure unadulterated capitalism. It seems pretty clear that the only GOP philosophy that applies is “Pork for me, and nada for thee.” You’ll also hear the GOP complaining on a regular basis that we need to eliminate uncertainty for businesses so that they will be comfortable creating jobs, a not-unreasonable argument. It’s played out pretty well in the wind industry, where billions of dollars in projects have been delayed or cancelled over the past few months as the deadline for renewal looms. Writing in the Iowa’s Sioux City Journal, Sheila K. Tipton points out that, “Because Congress hasn’t extended the production tax credit for wind generation owners, no turbine sales are projected in the U.S. for the next year. None. Without extension of the tax credit, the wind industry will not grow. Investors are waiting to see what Congress does.” If the tax credit dies, it throws their business plans into turmoil… but that doesn’t seem to bother the GOP. Again, their only commitment seems to be “Business certainty for our friends, and nada for the rest of you.” Tipton adds, No state stands to benefit more than does Iowa should the tax credit be extended. And no state economy will suffer more should Congress allow the credit to expire. Today there are approximately 400 wind turbine component manufacturers and wind-related businesses in 43 states across America— companies that design and create parts for, and construct, operate and maintain the 260-foot tall windmills dotting our cornfields. Of those 400 businesses, the Iowa Wind Energy Association (IWEA) reports that 200 companies have locations in Iowa. Every one of those 200 businesses employs Iowans; credible estimates report up to 7,000 full-time jobs. That means paychecks for families who buy locally to put food on tables and gas in cars and pay mortgages and taxes and send children to neighborhood schools. …This isn’t a narrow issue and it isn’t stupid. It is about our economy. What can you do? Call your member of Congress and tell them to renew the Wind Energy Tax Break!

Author: Dorothy Kosich Posted: Wednesday , 19 Sep 2012 RENO (MINEWEB) - The largest coal producer in Appalachia, Alpha Natural Resources Tuesday announced a "strategic repositioning plan" which immediately idled eight mines and eliminated 400 jobs in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Alpha is America's second largest coal producer by revenue and third largest by production, as well as the largest U.S. supplier of metallurgical coal used in steel-making. The company plans to focus on two key priorities: enhancing Alpha's metallurgical coal position in both the domestic and international markets; and establishing a durable core of cost-competitive thermal coal assets "better suited to supply structurally shifting power markets in the United States and tap into new thermal markets overseas." "We're taking a long-term view of the thermal coal market, and we believe there are solid opportunities for diversified suppliers like Alpha to produce and sell thermal coal profitably into a smaller domestic market and to customers in new markets overseas," said Kevin Crutchfield, Alpha Resources CEO. "At the same time we have a big opportunity to advance Alpha's position as a premier supplier of metallurgical coal," he added. "Forecasts point to more than 100 million tons of increased seaborne metallurgical coal demand by the end of this decade, and persistent structural supply limitations exist of sources of high-quality metallurgical coal." A combination of mine and equipment idlings, production cuts and mining out reserves will take place through early 2013, reducing annual coal production and shipments for Alpha by 16 million tons. Forty percent of the reduction will come from higher-cost thermal coal mines in the East that are perceived as unlikely to be competitive in the foreseeable future. Half of the reduction will come from production curtailments in Wyoming's Powder River Basin in order to match currently committed sales volumes. The balance will come from reduced production of lesser quality metallurgical coal. Between now and early 2013 approximately 400 positions will be eliminated with some employees finding jobs elsewhere in Alpha Natural Resources. The company also will consolidate four existing operating regions into two "to reduce overheads while enhancing effectiveness." "Executive and administrative support for the smaller number of operating properties within these units will be consolidated and proportionally scaled between now and early 2013, resulting in permanent overhead savings," said Alpha. Overhead cost savings from the streamlining of field and corporate support functions are now targeted to be $150 million, including $50 million to $60 million of cost reductions Alpha announced on June 8. With 130 mines and 13,100 employees, Alpha is the world's third-largest supplier of met coal with 25 million to 30 million tons of export capacity through the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, which is partially untapped. "With approximately 1.5 billion tons of quality metallurgical coal reserves, and a number of significant organic growth projects in various stages of development, Alpha is well positioned to scale up quickly as demand from steelmakers around the world warrants," the company said. United Mineworkers spokesman Phil Smith told the Washington Post, "These are the best paying jobs in their communities and whatever these people find will pay half or less than what they were getting." He estimated that coal mining companies have laid off 3,000 to 4,000 people this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that every major U.S. coal producer has announced production cutbacks this year. Patriot Coal filed for bankruptcy protection in July. Analysts predict that U.S. coal demand will decline 10% this year by 100 million tons. Rep. Shelly Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, co-founder of the Congressional Coal Caucus said, "The Obama Administration's War on Coal has already claimed over 2,000 jobs in West Virginia, and now we've learned that Alpha Natural Resources will lay off 1,200 workers companywide.' "There is no question that a number of contributing factors, such as the decline in the price of natural gas, lead to mine closures, and there is also no question that the EPA's extreme rules and regulations played a major role," she said. mineweb</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1348080229185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348080641673-23</Id><Topic><Title>'Death to America' -- how did Obama's 'new beginning' get so old, so quickly?</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348078928756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:22:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>reminds me of the Marine barracks bombing while Reagan was president--lotta talk/no action you thought that worked great the "W" was the 1 that took terror money from Libya for the panam bombing (remember the tough line "we don't negotiate with terrorists") and set diplomatic relations up in Libya after their $$ payment (blood money) and while you try and get your lil mind around the tough talk and #$%$ diaper tell us WHY did the 9/11 victims get FEDERAL tax dollars as compensation of a disaster -- was that for the NYC tragedy or the "W" presidency disaster ??</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1348080641673</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:50:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348082654876-24</Id><Topic><Title>'Death to America' -- how did Obama's 'new beginning' get so old, so quickly?</Title><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348078928756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:22:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Death to America?

Most would be in the middle class. The new estimate amounts to an inconvenient fact for the administration, a reminder of what critics see as broken promises. The numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office are 50 percent higher than a previous projection by the same office in 2010, shortly after the law passed. The earlier estimate found 4 million people would be affected in 2016, when the penalty is fully in effect. That’s still only a sliver of the population, given that more than 150 million people currently are covered by employer plans. Nonetheless, in his first campaign for the White House, Obama pledged not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 a year and couples making less than $250,000. And the budget office analysis found that nearly 80 percent of those who'll face the penalty would be making up to or less than five times the federal poverty level. Currently that would work out to $55,850 or less for an individual and $115,250 or less for a family of four. Average penalty: about $1,200 in 2016. ‘‘The bad news and broken promises from Obamacare just keep piling up,’’ said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who wants to repeal the law. Starting in 2014, virtually every legal resident of the U.S. will be required to carry health insurance or face a tax penalty, with exemptions for financial hardship, religious objections and certain other circumstances. Most people will not have to worry about the requirement since they already have coverage through employers, government programs like Medicare or by buying their own policies. A spokeswoman for the Obama administration said 98 percent of Americans will not be affected by the tax penalty — and suggested that those who will be should face up to their civic responsibilities. ‘‘This (analysis) doesn’t change the basic fact that the individual responsibility policy will only affect people who can afford health care but choose not to buy it,’’ said Erin Shields Britt of the Health and Human Services Department. ‘‘We’re no longer going to subsidize the care of those who can afford to buy insurance but make a choice not to buy it.’’ The budget office said most of the increase in its estimate is due to changes in underlying projections about the economy, incorporating the effects of new federal legislation, as well as higher unemployment and lower wages. The Supreme Court upheld Obama’s law as constitutional in a 5-4 decision this summer, finding that the insurance mandate and the tax penalty enforcing it fall within the power of Congress to impose taxes. The penalty will be collected by the IRS, just like taxes. The budget office said the penalty will raise $6.9 billion in 2016.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348101684925</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:41:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348101805581-41</Id><Title>Report: Cost of regs $1.8 trillion, 20-times Obama's estimate</Title><Msg>Current federal regulations plus those coming under Obamacare will cost American taxpayers and businesses $1.8 trillion annually, more than twenty times the $88 billion the administration estimates, according to a new roundup provided to Secrets from the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute. And it could grow, warned the author of the report, Clyde Wayne Crews, a CEI vice president. Complying with Health and Human Services Department requirements alone, he revealed, costs $184 billion a year, yet regulators are still drafting the rules for the 2,400-page Obamacare law that kicks into gear in 2014. Crews has made a working project of his "Tip of the Costberg" report which he regularly updates. In it, he compares the cost of regulations estimated by federal agencies to a much broader list of estimates from multiple federal and independent sources. And even then, he said, it doesn't include hard-to-calculate costs associated with antitrust intervention, regulation of electricity networks, or the cost of constrained access to natural resources. "While OMB officially reports amounts of only up to $88.6 billion in 2010 dollars," said Crews, "the non-tax cost of government intervention in the economy, without performing a sweeping survey, appears to total up to $1.806 trillion annually." But, he added, "according to back of the envelope surveys and roundups, with gaps big enough to fit the beltway through, that up to $1.806 trillion annually and in many categories perhaps even considerably more, is a defensible assessment of the annual impact on the economy." His estimate is close to the $1.7 trillion estimate from the Small Business Administration which the White House distanced itself from. For comparison, the total U.S. GDP is $15 trillion. The wave of Obama regulations has become a huge sore point in the business world with groups as large as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce down to the International Franchise Association crying for fewer rules.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348101805581</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:43:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348102086012-42</Id><Title>Obama says he can’t remember the national debt</Title><Msg>In his interview with David Letterman last night, President Obama admitted that he didn’t know the amount of the national debt. “Now, do you remember what that number was?

The national debt, of course, was $10 trillion when President Obama took office, but is now currently at 16 trillion and counting. “If this is me, I got the credit card guy calling me every day, I start to get scared,” Letterman responded. “As Americans should we be scared that we owe that kind of money? Who do we owe that money to?” “Well a lot of it we owe to ourselves,” Obama explained. “Because if you invest in a treasury bill or something like that, essentially you’re loaning the government money.” Obama added that a “majority” of the debt was held by “folks who live here.” “We don’t have to worry about it short term,” added Obama. “Right now interest rates are low, because people still consider the United States the safest and greatest country on earth, rightfully so.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348102086012</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:48:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348102230703-43</Id><Title>CRS report: number of able-bodied adults on food stamps doubled after Obama suspended work requirement</Title><Msg>Obama administration officials have insisted that their decision to grant states waivers to redefine work requirements for welfare recipients would not “gut” the landmark 1996 welfare reform law. But a new report from the Congressional Research Service obtained by the Washington Examiner suggests that the administration’s suspension of a separate welfare work requirement has already helped explode the number of able-bodied Americans on food stamps. In addition to the broader work requirement that has become a contentious issue in the presidential race, the 1996 welfare reform law included a separate rule encouraging able-bodied adults without dependents to work by limiting the amount of time they could receive food stamps. President Obama suspended that rule when he signed his economic stimulus legislation into law, and the number of these adults on food stamps doubled, from 1.9 million in 2008 to 3.9 million in 2010, according to the CRS report, issued in the form of a memo to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. “This report once again confirms that President Obama has severely gutted the welfare work requirements that Americans have overwhelmingly supported since President Clinton signed them into law,” Cantor said in an emailed statement. “It’s time to reinstate these common-sense measures, and focus on creating job growth for those in need.” Under the rule adopted in 1996, food stamps for able-bodied adults without dependents were limited to three months in a 36-month period unless the participant in the program “works at least 20 hours a week; participates in an employment and training program for at least 20 hours per week; or participates in a (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) ‘workfare’ program for at least 20 hours per week.” Obama’s economic stimulus legislation suspended the rule for all states starting April 2009. Delaware continued to enforce the rule anyway, along with New York City and parts of Colorado, South Dakota, and Texas. This suspension expired at the end of the 2010 fiscal year (Sept. 30, 2010) and Congress rebuffed Obama’s requests to extend it in his fiscal years 2011 and 2012 budgets. However, Obama used his regulatory authority to effectively extend the waivers to nearly all states over the past two years. (The law grants the executive the authority to do this in states where the unemployment rate is above 10 percent or there’s a “lack of sufficient jobs.”) Though the weakening of the economy would have led to an increase in food stamp usage with or without a waiver, the doubling of the use of food stamps by the able-bodied population without dependents exceeded the 43 percent increase in food stamp usage among the broader population over the same 2008 to 2010 time frame. This gives more weight to the idea that the waiver fueled the food stamp growth among the population it affected, beyond where it would have been even in a weak economy.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348102230703</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:50:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348105858542-44</Id><Topic><Title>PLEASE GIVE OS A REAL AMERICAN PRESIDENT !
