Jesus wanted people to give of themselves. Taxing and redistributing wealth is not personal giving. 2) If a woman were pregnant ( even if it were a result of rape ) and went to Jesus and asked if she should have an abortion, ask your heart "What would Jesus say"? It doesn't a priest to tell you that Jesus would not support abortion. 3) If a pair of homosexuals wanted to be married, what do your think Jesus would tell them? Man and Woman were created with genitalia for a purpose. Maybe liberals don't understand and need some books and drawings to figure it out. God's intention was for 1 man and 1 woman to mate, not 2 men or 2 women. So, if I have to judge which party is more in line with the teachings of Jesus, it isn't the Democrats.</Msg><Username>yankeeddandy</Username><Timestamp>1346327835000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346327997000-16</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. Gasoline a Bargain as Motorists Pay 63% Less Than Norway</Title><Username>Low_Mac</Username><Timestamp>1346323542000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 06:45:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when the U.S. Dollar loses it's status as the World Reserve Currency, that will change.</Msg><Username>ten_meaux77</Username><Timestamp>1346327997000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:59:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346329011000-17</Id><Title>Missing out on this info on Exxon Mobil Corporation is like missing out on a lot of money</Title><Msg>How can trading be so simple?

Most of them are merely words taken out of context. What is far more concerning are the words of Obama himself. When he says if you've got a business, you didn't build that. That someone else made that happen. When he says that it would be better if we spread the wealth around. These are revealing statements. Statements that reveal what Obama thiks the government's role in our everyday life is. Obama is clearly someone who thinks that the government is responsible for everything and that no one can be responsible for their own lives, their liberty, or their own prosperity. In his mind those things all belong to the government. What concerns me most is that there are so many Americans willing to risk their liberty and freedom to support someone with such an obvious leftist mentality.

Diversification, if it is complete enough, removes all firm specific risk, and leaves only systematic risk. Systematic risk comes from the economic outcomes, and is determined by such things as politics. What matters for global systematic risk is risks to resource flows and flows of capital. WAR OR IT THREAT IN PLACES THAT PRODUCE OIL OR OTHER COMMODITIES PRODUCES SYSTEMATIC RISK. WARS THAT RISK RUNNING ALONG LINES OF RELIGION IN THOSE SAME PLACES ARE DANGEROUS TOO. WAR IN THE CORE OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY LIKE YOU HAD IN DURING WORLD WARS PRODUCES SYSTEMATIC RISK. Wars and conflicts in irrelevant areas like Vietnam, and Korea when that war was going on, or Rawanda mean nothing to systematic risk.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346338620000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346338798000-31</Id><Topic><Title>SPEAKING of MITT ROMNEY!</Title><Username>smithharry943</Username><Timestamp>1346267862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:17:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These socialist lemmings deserve what awaits them.

He has no deep conviction of what our Founding Fathers had to fight to have the right to give us individual freedoms to act as individuals to better our lives. Obama is mired in a poor individual self-thinking. He does not believe in individuality, but of a socialistic mindset where nobody deserves to be better than anybody else. You don't deserve what you earn, and it should be spread out to everybody by a government who knows best for you. Romney on the other hand knows that being successful demands hard work by individuals and using their intellect they can make future plans and increase their livelihood for themselves and for society in general. You reap what you sow. Capitalism is the best thing for everybody in the long term.

New Democratic Party House leader Nathan Cullen of northern British Columbia outlined his concerns in a letter to the Joint Review Panel considering the environmental risks of Enbridge’s proposed $6-billion project. Cullen was responding to federal attempts to deny his request for 10 hours of cross-examination time when hearings resume Sept. 4 in Edmonton. One of his requests to the panel is that he be allowed to question Fisheries and Oceans Canada staff about how the newly amended Fisheries Act will affect construction and operation of a pipeline that will cross hundreds of rivers and streams. The federal government, which said Cullen’s planned line of questioning on fisheries matters “undermines fairness” in the review process, wants to avoid having fisheries officials cross-examined, according to internal documents obtained by Postmedia News. The federal government is asking the review panel to “adopt overly restrictive procedures that would compromise the integrity of the proceedings,” wrote Cullen, whose northern B.C. riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley includes a significant portion of the 1,177-kilometre pipeline route and the Kitimat terminal. Cullen said he needs time to question Transport Canada about the department’s willingness to accept voluntary commitments from Enbridge Inc. to fund safety measures such as requiring loaded tankers to be escorted to and from Kitimat with tugboats. Earlier this month, the review panel wrote to Transport Canada asking the department to consider ways to make those pledges mandatory. The justice department wrote to the review panel last week arguing that some of Cullen’s planned questions — such as how the project impacts the government’s climate change plan— goes beyond the scope set out in the May 2011 review panel order issued to launch the hearings. Other areas of questioning are unrelated to evidence already filed by government participants, or to their mandates as federal departments, according to the letter. Finally, Cullen’s plan to question fisheries officials about matters related to the Fisheries Act are “overly broad and in the nature of a blanket request,” the department of justice wrote. “Such a request provides no guidance to the government participants to assist in witness preparation; it undermines fairness to the witnesses and has the potential to delay the proceedings.” A month before the May 2011 hearing order was issued federal fisheries officials discussed the department’s role in the hearings, according to internal documents. One email that month recommended that the department register as a “participant” rather than “intervener” because the department “might not have to be subject to cross-examination if we demonstration reasonable cause,” according to analyst Ivan Stefanov. “This might allow us to testify about a narrow area of expertise/involvement and avoid being cross-examined on broader Government of Canada or departmental policies and practices.” Fisheries and Oceans Canada ended up following that recommendation and is registered, like other federal departments, as a participant. http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Democrat+wants+cross+examine+officials+Gateway+hearings/7162733/story.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346349091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346349960000-42</Id><Title>Gulf Oil Opens E85 Fueling Stations</Title><Msg>Gulf Oil Opens E85 Fueling Stations CSD Staff | Aug 30, 2012 | 0 Comments New locations expand availability of alternative, affordable, and environmentally friendly fuels across the Massachusetts. In partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Gulf Oil has announced the grand opening of its E85 fueling station at the Charlton East Service Plaza on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), ready to service travelers with Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFVs). This station is one of four new Gulf E85 fueling stations planned for the Turnpike and represents an important milestone here in Massachusetts to provide alternative, affordable, and environmentally friendly motor fuels. As of today, Gulf has three E85 fueling stations open at Service Plazas on the Turnpike—Charlton Eastbound, Charlton Westbound and at the Westborough service plaza. Massachusetts drivers are on the leading edge of alternative fuels today. There are more than 100,000 FFVs registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. “We are proud to be among the first to open alternative fueling locations, and we look forward to the day when we can offer more choices, primarily from our domestic sources, such as E85, biodiesel, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). No longer does one form of energy serve all of our needs; it is the combination of varied sources with environmental impact in mind that together will frame a stronger foundation for our new energy future,” says Gulf Oil President and Chief Operating Officer Ron Sabia. “We look forward to remaining a market leader in alternate fuel development and are proud that our home here in Massachusetts is in the forefront of this transformation.” According to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, there are more than 2,400 E85 ethanol-fueling stations in the U.S. E85 is more affordable and environmentally friendly than conventional gasoline: for instance, in June, any U.S. drivers who filled up with E85 paid on average 45 cents a gallon less than those who used conventional gasoline, according to E85Prices.com. Environmental benefits are another bonus: E85 reduces ozone-forming pollution by 20% and green house gases by 30%, according to the Argonne National Laboratory. “MassDOT is committed to meeting the needs of its customers. Our residents and visitors are choosing to purchase flex fuel vehicles. By working with our partners at Energy and Environmental Affairs and Gulf Oil, we are able to now offer travelers three fueling locations along the Massachusetts Turnpike and also advance our GreenDOT goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said MassDOT secretary and CEO Richard Davey. “We are excited E85 is now available on the Massachusetts Turnpike,” said Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Rick Sullivan. “With this opening, access to alternative, domestic fuels is increasing; and that’s an important step in achieving energy security and protecting our environment.” “This partnership is an important example to the nation of how the public and private sectors can work constructively to solve one of the most important issues of the 21st century: our nation’s energy security. Energy security and environmental improvement can be simultaneously achieved,” explained Sabia. “We wish to thank all of the Federal and State officials and private industry executives for having the vision and foresight to help make our E85 fueling stations on the Massachusetts Turnpike a reality.” Gulf opened its first E85 fueling station in Massachusetts at 100 Service Road in Boston, at Logan Airport in October of 2008. Gulf Oil distributes motor fuels through a network of more than 2,500 branded gasoline retail centers, 12 proprietary oil terminals, and more than 130 other supply points. http://www.csdecisions.com/2012/08/30/gulf-oil-opens-e85-fueling-stations/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346349960000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346350279000-43</Id><Title>How do you know when a Rpublican is lying?</Title><Msg>His mouth is moving, and he's making promises he want's you to believe.</Msg><Username>fss13</Username><Timestamp>1346350279000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:11:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346350750000-44</Id><Title>Obama sets new energy efficiency goal</Title><Msg>Obama sets new energy efficiency goal By Zack Colman - 08/30/12 12:21 PM ET With comprehensive energy efficiency legislation cooling on the congressional back burner, President Obama issued an executive order Thursday to spur energy efficiency upgrades at manufacturing facilities. The administration said reaching the goals outlined in the order will reduce energy costs by $10 billion annually and attract between $40 billion and $80 billion in private investment. “Today, we are taking another step to strengthen American manufacturing by boosting energy efficiency for businesses across the nation,” Obama said Thursday in a statement. “This action will cut costs, increase efficiency, and help our businesses create strong, middle class jobs. We’ll continue to do everything we can to put more people back to work and build an economy that lasts.” The directive aims to boost combined heat and power capacity to 40 gigawatts by 2020, an increase of 50 percent compared with today. The order said agencies will craft best practices and work with states to encourage combined heat and power implementation, adding the technologies will help keep industrial facilities compliant with emissions regulations. Combined heat and power technology produces heat and power simultaneously on-site from one fuel source, thereby making energy generation less wasteful. By burning less fuel, combined heat and power technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers energy costs. And by having the fuel source on-site, manufacturing facilities are shielded from electricity outages. Energy efficiency advocates have been stymied on Capitol Hill. Republicans have held off passing energy efficiency bills because they want to take a look at federal tax reform, and many energy efficiency initiatives are funded through tax incentives. But President of the Alliance to Save Energy Kateri Callahan said Wednesday during a Politico-hosted panel at the Republican National Convention that Obama has taken charge on energy efficiency. Phyllis Cuttino, director of the Pew Clean Energy Program, praised the administration’s order on Thursday. She called it a “common-sense strategy” for adding jobs, lowering energy costs and enhancing electricity reliability. Cuttino cited studies by the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory that said doubling the nation’s industrial efficiency could create 1 million skilled jobs and bring in $234 billion of investment. Deploying more combined heat and power technology is an important step in achieving that mark, she said. “Industrial energy efficiency is a pragmatic policy with broad support from members of both political parties,” Cuttino said in a statement. “Harnessing energy efficiency technologies benefits manufacturers, workers, and the environment alike.” http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/246673-obama-sets-new-energy-efficiency-goal</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346350750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346350823000-45</Id><Topic><Title>SPEAKING of MITT ROMNEY!</Title><Username>smithharry943</Username><Timestamp>1346267862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:17:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I vote the American ticket, Flag,Apple pie,Mom and Medicare.</Msg><Username>fss13</Username><Timestamp>1346350823000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346350833000-46</Id><Title>Ethanol production in July shrank 2.7% to a 17-month low of 1.055 billion gallons</Title><Msg>Ethanol production in July shrank 2.7% to a 17-month low of 1.055 billion gallons http://www.stockhouse.com/Bullboards/MessageDetail.aspx?p=0&amp;m=31446879&amp;l=0&amp;r=0&amp;s=XOM&amp;t=NYSE</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346350833000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:20:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346351293000-47</Id><Topic><Title>THEY GOTTA BE KIDDING!</Title><Username>smithharry943</Username><Timestamp>1346335047000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 09:57:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.alternet.org/print/hot-news-views/gop-platform-suggests-billionaires-should-be-able-give-unlimited-donations-mitt</Msg><Username>smithharry943</Username><Timestamp>1346351293000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346351977000-48</Id><Title>EAT THE POOR!

Who has advocated stopping welfare? Reducing or controlling is not stopping. And yes, IF welfare were stopped (your position not mine) or reduced/limited and that revenue were returned to where it was 'confiscated', charitable donations very likely would increase. And I have history on my side. When did welfare become/expand, before or after Great Depression? What happened during Great Depression? Ans, all kinds of charities popped up to help people. Americans have proven that we can and will take care of those in need. If those needs are great, so will our charity. Note, I am NOT advocating we go back to a system we had in place pre or during the Great Depression. But a system where the gov't provides a true "safety net" and private charities can function with and above that safety net as a private safety net. But if you are confiscating excessive amounts, those with the means will likely reduce that they have or are willing to part with for private efforts.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1346355814000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:43:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346356313000-58</Id><Topic><Title>Funny how</Title><Username>investing_is_a_game</Username><Timestamp>1346282863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:27:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny how you are too ignorant to realize this forum is not provided by a gov't entity.

As of August 29 at 11:30 a.m. CDT, 505 oil and natural gas platforms (almost 85 percent of manned Gulf of Mexico platforms) had been evacuated, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). BSEE reports that about 3.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of natural gas production was shut in, about 72 percent of total Gulf of Mexico natural gas production. Approximately 95 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production was shut in. Gulf of Mexico natural gas production from Louisiana has fallen the most, predictably, as the storm made landfall near New Orleans, according to BENTEK Energy LLC (Bentek). Bentek reports that some offshore and onshore production has continued in Texas. The Department of Energy (DOE) is providing ongoing situation reports on the status of production, power outages, and oil and natural gas infrastructure in the affected area. As of August 30 at 8:00 a.m., 8 companies had declared force majeure on their natural gas pipeline systems due to production shut-ins, and several others had reported curtailments. DOE also reported that 22 natural gas processing plants are shut down due to Isaac; these plants have a combined capacity of 11.8 Bcf per day. Overview: (For the Week Ending Wednesday, August 29, 2012)•Natural gas prices generally registered overall decreases for the report week (Wednesday to Wednesday) at many of the country’s trading locations. The Henry Hub price, which remained fairly steady through much of the week, dropped 8 cents per million British thermal units (MMBtu) on Tuesday and an additional 9 cents per MMBtu yesterday, closing at $2.63 per MMBtu (down 17 cents per MMBtu for the week). •The natural gas futures market trended significantly downward throughout the week before rebounding at week’s end. At the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the September 2012 natural gas contract lost 19.2 cents per MMBtu to close at $2.634 per MMBtu yesterday. •Working natural gas in storage rose last week to 3,374 Bcf as of Friday, August 24, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR). An implied storage build of 66 Bcf for the week positioned storage volumes 429 Bcf above year-ago levels. •The natural gas rotary rig count, as reported by Baker Hughes Incorporated on August 24, increased by 2 to 486 active units. Meanwhile, oil-directed rigs dropped by 17 to 1,408 units. more summary data Prices: The Henry Hub day-ahead price registered a moderate decrease for the week, shedding a combined 17 cents per MMBtu on Tuesday and Wednesday, closing the week at $2.63 per MMBtu, down 6.1 percent. In the Northeast and Midwest, generally above-normal temperatures helped generate moderate price increases earlier this reporting week, although increases were typically temporary, with prices finishing the week lower in most locations ahead of forecasts of cooler weather. At the NYMEX, the September 2012 contract (which expired yesterday) ended the week down significantly, declining from $2.826 per MMBtu last Wednesday to $2.634 per MMBtu yesterday, a decrease of http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346358377000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:26:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346358916000-69</Id><Title>New Analysis on Exxon Mobil Corporation Suggests Drop</Title><Msg>Wow!

The video, entitled “Wrong for the Middle Class,” leads off with Ryan’s claim – one that has been used by the Romney camp for a few weeks now – that President Obama “funneled” more than $700 billion out of Medicare to help pay for the health care overhaul. That claim has been considered misleading by several fact-checking sites, which note that Ryan assumes those cuts in his own budget. The video collects talking heads batting down the claim. The Obama camp put out a second video, called “An Unshakable Record,” that uses the infamous “Etch-a-Sketch” line uttered by a Romney campaign aide earlier this year in order to attack Romney on topics like outsourcing and Bain Capital, Romney’s line about being a “severely conservative Republican” and his offshore accounts.</Msg><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1346360355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:59:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346360487000-74</Id><Topic><Title>YES RYAN TELL VOTERS IGNORE FACT CHECK !!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1346360355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:59:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EAT THE POOR!

The Washington, D.C.-based ARBTA said the administration's proposal to require cars to get 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025 will cost the highway trust fund, which traditionally pays for a large portion of road and transit projects, $71 billion. The new emission rules were finalized by the departments of transportation and environmental protection earlier this week. The federal gas tax, which has been 18.4 cents per gallon since the early 1990s, currently generates about $35 billion per year. The recently approved $105 billion highway bill spent more than $50 billion annually, which transportation advocates argue is barely enough to maintain the existing road and transit systems. The Obama administration has argued that the stricter mileage rules will save drivers about $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by 12 billion barrels through 2025. Lawmakers already used a package of tax loopholes and fee increases to provide the cover than $10 billion shortfall in gas tax revenue in the current transportation bill, which is set to expire in 2014. Advocates and observers say Congress will likely have to consider other revenue sources for transportation funding, with or without higher mileage standards. At least one idea that is often floated among dedicated transportation supporters, a tax on miles traveled by a vehicle (VMT), has been disavowed by both the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress. The GOP included an anti-VMT plank in the platform it approved during its convention this week in Tampa, Fla. "We oppose any funding mechanism that would involve governmental monitoring of every car and truck in the nation," the GOP platform says of the VMT proposal. http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/highways-bridges-and-roads/246741-road-builders-higher-emission-rules-will-drain-highway-money</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346365315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 18:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346365615000-83</Id><Topic><Title>RYAN'S A SOCIALIST!!!!</Title><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1346360622000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 17:03:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coming from the DailyKos, a self admitted Dem and Lib site (some might even characterize it as communist), Ryan will likely where this as a badge of honor.</Msg><Username>fore6996</Username><Timestamp>1346365615000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 18:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346368881000-84</Id><Title>Where is the growth message?</Title><Msg>Ryan has Kudlow worried.

Stock still nearly 10 points below level in the spring of 2008 (while its closest peer CVX remains within a couple of points of recent all time high). XTO deal remains as huge ongoing drag. That deal stands as probably one of the worst management decisions ever. Current shareholders can't live off of stock performance 10 to 20 years ago under much better management. Very difficult to see any catalyst for improvement in performance at this point.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1346378698000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 22:04:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346384140000-91</Id><Title>Romney - Energy Front &amp; Center</Title><Msg>The Romney energy plan will right the ship, just as surely as Obama's plan (or lack of a plan) will sink it.

We are not there yet. The fools still may spurn the chance to elect a good manager who can help them. Time will tell, but prospects are positive. The race is even and odds favor the candidate with the deepest pockets.</Msg><Username>torycoalition</Username><Timestamp>1346384369000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:39:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
