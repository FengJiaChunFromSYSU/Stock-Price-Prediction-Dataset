The biofuel’s price has dropped 8.5 percent this month, headed for the worst monthly performance since May, as inventories in the week ended Dec. 14 were 20.8 million barrels, up 18 percent from a year earlier. Imports have averaged 28,000 barrels a day this year, up from 6,000 in 2011. “There are supplies in the front because of Brazilian imports,” said Jordan Stern, a trader at SCB &amp; Associates in Chicago. “There’s just a lot of supply.” Ethanol’s discount to gasoline expanded to 61.83 cents a gallon based on January contracts, the widest since Sept. 28, from 60.98 cents yesterday. It was 18.79 cents Dec. 6. The differential has averaged about 61 cents this year. Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.3 cent to settle at $2.203 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are unchanged this year. In cash market trading, ethanol in New York fell 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.285 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.215, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Ethanol in Chicago was unchanged at $2.185 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.35. U.S. producers have faced increased competition from Brazilian manufacturers that use sugarcane instead of corn, Stern said. Gasoline Gains Gasoline for January delivery rose 0.55 cent to $2.8213 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s petroleum and ethanol inventories at 11 a.m. tomorrow, two days later than usual because of the Christmas holiday. Corn for March delivery decreased 1.75 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $6.915 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from 29 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to data collected by Bloomberg. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-27/ethanol-s-discount-to-gasoline-expands-to-widest-since-september.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356673625829</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:47:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356673954363-3</Id><Topic><Title>I look for Boehner and McConnell to push America over the cliff.</Title><Username>king_mooch_a_lot</Username><Timestamp>1356661728789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:28:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't really care. It will be entertaining to see the Wall Street gamblers get hosed if there is no deal, as they are most certainly betting on their being one. However, it will make 0 difference to the economy one way or the other, and I've placed no bets on it and wont. The US deficit will still be totally out of control, with or without a deal, and with no prospect of it being addressed till 2015 at the earliest. The entire concept of a "cliff," and "stimulus" via borrowing and spending, and economic decline in its absence, is nothing but Keynesian theoretical garbage, which is nothing but a fraud. If such theory was right the economy would have collapsed just after World War I, World War II, and gone into recession after 1993, which of course it did not. The 2008 collapse never should have happened as per such theory either. The media reports it because it is simplistic, and is on the level a politician or journalists can understand. The economy is headed for a major recession no matter what happens. Policy has been tailored to suit speculators for far too long, and the parties in America are nothing but tools of lobbyists. Whether they are even capable of governing at all remains to be seen.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1356673954363</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:52:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356674061110-4</Id><Title>British offshore wind farm near completion the complete array could power as many as 750,000 homes</Title><Msg>British offshore wind farm near completion Published: Dec. 27, 2012 at 7:48 PM LONDON, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- The last wind turbine has been installed in one of the world's largest offshore wind farms located in Britain's Thames Estuary, officials said. The London Array, with 175 wind turbines, is on schedule to begin full operation in spring 2013 and is expected to produce enough power for almost half a million homes, the BBC reported Thursday. Begun in March 2011, the project first began producing power in October. Fifty-five turbines are online and producing power for the national electric grid. A second phase, with another 166 turbines, is yet to be approved. Once it is approved, the complete array could power as many as 750,000 homes, London Array officials said. The array covers an offshore area of 38 square miles in the Thames Estuary on the east coast of the county of Kent. upiDOTcom/Science_News/Technology/2012/12/27/British-offshore-wind-farm-near-completion/UPI-38891356655718/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356674061110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:54:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356674914325-5</Id><Topic><Title>British offshore wind farm near completion the complete array could power as many as 750,000 homes</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356674061110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:54:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>England is governed in a far superior manner to the United States.

Scientific American reports that researchers have observed a principle similar to that of Moore's law which governs the pace of advances in solar energy. Where Moore's Law dictates that chip processing power doubles every 18 months, researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the US Department of Energy have found similar logarithmic efficiency growth in the area of solar energy, with the dollar cost per watt of photovoltaic cells falling by 7% per annum on average over the past 30 years. The price per Watt of solar modules excluding installation has fallen from $22 dollars in 1980 to $3 at present, and data from 2010 indicates that solar prices are currently ahead of the three decade trend. These changes are driven primarily by ongoing cost reductions by experienced manufacturers and continual improvements in solar cell efficiency. Scientists have achieved solar efficiencies as high as 41% in lab settings, which were inconceivable at the start the 1980's. The implications of this continued growth trend for both the renewable energy industry and the global environment are potentially staggering: The exponential trend in solar watts per dollar has been going on for at least 31 years now. If it continues for another 8-10, which looks extremely likely, we’ll have a power source which is as cheap as coal for electricity, with virtually no carbon emissions. If it continues for 20 years, which is also well within the realm of scientific and technical possibility, then we’ll have a green power source which is half the price of coal for electricity. miningDOTcom/exponential-gains-in-solar-efficiency-could-make-it-half-the-price-of-coal-by-2030-84738/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356675561559</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 01:19:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356691644939-7</Id><Topic><Title>I look for Boehner and McConnell to push America over the cliff.</Title><Username>king_mooch_a_lot</Username><Timestamp>1356661728789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:28:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bunch of #$%$ rat traitors here.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1356691644939</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 05:47:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356691703648-8</Id><Topic><Title>Fire Congress</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356625411278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:23:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bunch of #$%$ sewer rats here.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1356691703648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 05:48:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356697769272-9</Id><Topic><Title>In debate over oil tax breaks, facts get slippery</Title><Username>nanniegerkevmiznmcn3885</Username><Timestamp>1306167614000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-05-23 12:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck to everyone!</Msg><Username>evangelinesara786</Username><Timestamp>1356697769272</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 07:29:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356698323214-10</Id><Title>Low Information Voters</Title><Msg>as a popular talk radio hosts calls them. I just call them low IQ voters - obviously Wahleee (and his numerous aliases) and Maxwizard fall into this category. These low information/IQ voters really believe the Republicans have power left to negotiate with Reid and Obama on the "fiscal cliff" when in reality it is Obama and Reid running the show and they will never accept anything the GOP Congress proposes. In fact Obama, Reid, and the Demoncraps actually want us to go over the cliff and the Bush tax cuts to expire for all levels of income. Why would this be you ask? Well it is because they will reinstall the Bush tax cuts in the future but they will now be called the Obama tax cuts. In essense the Demoncraps, who have total control of Washington DC and the US media and the low information/IQ voters will implement a transfer of credit of tax cuts, from the old Bush Republican tax cuts to the new Obama Demoncrap tax cuts and the low IQ sheeple will cheer even though their has been no effective change, except perhaps increased taxes on "the rich", who will then stop giving to more charities and who will then stop employing more people. Then the Demoncrap controlled federal government will give out more welfare to more low IQ sheeple, who will continue to vote for Santa Claus Demoncraps forever and forever Amen.

It's always "that nasty GOP caused this and won't let us fix it." Would it ever occur to you that the Senate has been controlled by Democrats for over 8 years? That the Democrats controlled the House and Senate for the last two years of Bush's presidency? For the first two years that Obama was President Democrats controlled the House and Senate? But in all of those YEARS that Democrats controlled the legislative bodies, nothing was done to address the issues of debt and taxes. In fact, during those years spending went wild and debt increased faster that it ever has in history, setting the stage for the fiscal cliff to even exist. But you continue to blame Republicans. If anything you should be able to comprehend, it is the meaning of the phrase "the buck stops here". Obama has used that phrase in the past. If there is not deal to avert the fiscal cliff, then the responsibility for that failure falls sqarely on Obama. It is his responsibility to bring about compromise and agreement between the house and senate to reach legislation that everyone can agree with. If a deal is not reached, it is Obama's fault. He clearly is not doing his job.</Msg><Username>yankeeddandy</Username><Timestamp>1356702288589</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 08:44:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356703369632-12</Id><Topic><Title>I look for Boehner and McConnell to push America over the cliff.</Title><Username>king_mooch_a_lot</Username><Timestamp>1356661728789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:28:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If a deal is not reached, it is Obama's fault.

Posted: December 28, 2012 - 12:46pm By JOSH FUNK and MATTHEW BROWN ASSOCIATED PRESS BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Energy companies behind the oil boom on the Northern Plains are increasingly turning to an industrial-age workhorse — the locomotive — to move their crude to refineries across the U.S., as plans for new pipelines stall and existing lines can't keep up with demand. Delivering oil thousands of miles by rail from the heartland to refineries on the East, West and Gulf coasts costs more, but it can mean increased profits — up to $10 or more a barrel — because of higher oil prices on the coasts. That works out to about $700,000 per train. The parade of mile-long trains carrying hazardous material out of North Dakota and Montana and across the country has experts and federal regulators concerned. Rail transport is less safe than pipelines, they say, and the proliferation of oil trains raises the risk of a major derailment and spill. Since 2009, the number of train cars carrying crude hauled by major railroads has jumped from about 10,000 a year to a projected 200,000 in 2012. Much of that has been in the Northern Plains' Bakken crude patch, but companies say oil trains are rolling or will be soon from Texas, Colorado and western Canada. "This is all occurring very rapidly, and history teaches that when those things happen, unfortunately, the next thing that is going to occur would be some sort of disaster," said Jim Hall, a transportation consultant and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Rail companies said the industry places a priority on safety and has invested heavily in track upgrades, provided emergency training and taken other measures to guard against accidents. There have been no major oil train derailments from the Bakken, according to federal regulators. Union Pacific Railroad CEO Jack Koraleski said hauling oil out of places like North Dakota will be a long-term business for railroads because trains are faster than pipelines, reliable and offer a variety of destinations. "The railroads are looking at this as a unique opportunity, a game-changing opportunity for their business," said Jeffery Elliot, a rail expert with the New York-based consulting firm Oliver Wyman. BNSF Railway Co., the prime player in the Bakken, has bolstered its oil train capacity to a million barrels a day and expects that figure to increase further. To accommodate the growth, in part, the railroad is sinking $197 million into track upgrades and other improvements in Montana and North Dakota. BNSF is also increasing train sizes, from 100 oil cars per train to as many as 118. Larger trains are harder to control, and that increases the chances of something going wrong, safety experts said. State and local emergency officials worry about a derailment in a population center or an environmentally sensitive area such as a river crossing. Rail accidents occur 34 times more frequently than pipeline ones for every ton of crude or other hazardous material shipped comparable distances, according to a recent study by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. The Association of American Railroads contends the study was flawed but acknowledges the likelihood of a rail accident is double or triple the chance of a pipeline problem. The environmental fears carry an ironic twist: Oil trains are gaining popularity in part because of a shortage of pipeline capacity — a problem that has been worsened by environmental opposition to such projects as TransCanada's stalled Keystone XL pipeline. That project would carry Bakken and Canadian crude to the Gulf of Mexico. Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for the Sierra Club, described rail as "the greater of two evils" because trains pass through cities, over waterways and through wetlands that pipelines can be built to avoid. "It's an accident waiting to happen. It's going to be a mess and we don't know where that mess is going to be," Schafer said. For oil companies, the embrace of rail is a matter of expediency. Oil-loading rail terminals can be built in a matter of months, versus three to five years for pipelines to clear regulatory hurdles and be put into service, said Justin Kringstad of the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Although more pipelines are in the works, Kringstad said moving oil by rail will continue. The surge comes at the right time for railroads: Coal shipments — a mainstay of the rail industry — have suffered because of competition from cheap natural gas. In the eastern U.S., CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads haven't seen as much growth because oil from the Marcellus Shale area of Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York is close enough to refineries that trucks haul the crude. Yet BNSF is beginning to haul Bakken crude east to Chicago, where it hands off the tank cars to CSX or Norfolk Southern for delivery to Eastern refineries. It has also sent oil to the West Coast, a trend that could increase if Alaska crude production falters, as some industry observers are predicting. The growth will require significant upgrades to already congested rail lines, industry analysts said. Overall, crude oil shipments still represent less than 1 percent of all carloads. And there are far more dangerous materials aboard the nation's trains, including explosives, poisonous gases and other industrial chemicals. But emergency officials are increasingly wary of major accidents involving oil trains, which carry far more cargo than some other hazardous-material trains. While oil is not as volatile as some other products, a rupture of just one car can spill 20,000 to 30,000 gallons, said Sheldon Lustig, a rail expert who consults with local governments on accidents and hazardous materials. Recognizing the risks, Houston-based Musket Corp., an operator of oil train terminals in North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Oklahoma, has donated spill equipment and provided training to fire officials. "You want to be a good steward in that community," said Musket managing director JP Fjeld-Hansen. Federal Railroad Administration officials said they have coordinated hazardous-material training seminars and sought more law enforcement patrols for rail crossings to increase safety. Federal law requires railroads to select hazardous-material routes after analyzing the potential for accidents in heavily populated areas and environmentally sensitive spots. Those analyses are confidential for security reasons. Lustig said the railroads have considerable sway over the process. "Under federal guidelines, the railroad makes the analysis, the railroad decides what they want to do, and the railroad does it," he said. "There is no public accountability." lubbockonlineDOTcom/filed-online/2012-12-28/trains-carrying-more-oil-across-us-amid-boom</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1356721273831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 14:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356723074110-34</Id><Title>Breaches 3 month Low</Title><Msg>would not be surprised to see the whole US market tank...</Msg><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1356723074110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 14:31:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356725702206-35</Id><Title>Why FRIDAY....DEAL will be confirmed by Mon...Market UP</Title><Msg>Just the way they do it.</Msg><Username>gdnz14u</Username><Timestamp>1356725702206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 15:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356725776535-36</Id><Title>Nothing can save this market - SELL ALL, sell it ALLL</Title><Msg>buy real estate</Msg><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1356725776535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 15:16:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356728029969-37</Id><Topic><Title>Fire Congress</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1356625411278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:23:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, they told their money backers, no tax increase...They dont give a damn about the country, ony about getting reelected for another two years to do nothing.....</Msg><Username>djack148</Username><Timestamp>1356728029969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 15:53:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356730207111-38</Id><Topic><Title>Nothing can save this market - SELL ALL, sell it ALLL</Title><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1356725776535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 15:16:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's not much volume this time of year either.
