Jerry Brown of the US state of California has signed a bill into law establishing a framework for identifying and removing statutory impediments to the use of geothermal heat pump and ground-loop technologies. The systems in question rely on mixture of heat from the Earth and sun to power a wide range of residential and business activities. The measure, Assembly Bill 2339, was unanimously endorsed by both houses of the state legislature last summer. The new law requires the California Energy Commission, in consultation with the state's Air Resources Board and Public Utilities Commission, as well as cities, towns and other stakeholders, to recommend policies to overcome barriers to adoption of geothermal systems. The Commission is also required to study the quantitative benefits for ratepayers to be derived by deploying geothermal power. All of these activities are expected to be in the agency's Integrated Energy Policy Report next year. California is the third state to pass such legislation. The other two states are Maryland and New Hampshire. renewableenergymagazine</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350534242007</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 00:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350536766705-3</Id><Topic><Title>XOM purchase of Celtic Exploration:</Title><Username>semiequipmentgodoftheyear</Username><Timestamp>1350502713667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:38:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lone pine resources (lpr)</Msg><Username>zilablue</Username><Timestamp>1350536766705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 01:06:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350548212884-4</Id><Topic><Title>Obama gains 4% on Intrade</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350504608578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:10:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow's a school day, junior, so get off the computer right now or no Twinkie in your lunch bag tomorrow.</Msg><Username>circumlocutionator</Username><Timestamp>1350548212884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 04:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350554372798-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama gains 4% on Intrade</Title><Username>maxwizard68</Username><Timestamp>1350504608578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:10:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey commie cheat thats what nobumba did he cheated.

The sum of the components may not equal the total for the Producing Region, because of independent rounding. Summary Working gas in storage was 3,776 Bcf as of Friday, October 12, 2012, according to EIA estimates. This represents a net increase of 51 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 181 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 249 Bcf above the 5-year average of 3,527 Bcf. In the East Region, stocks were 51 Bcf above the 5-year average following net injections of 24 Bcf. Stocks in the Producing Region were 155 Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,071 Bcf after a net injection of 19 Bcf. Stocks in the West Region were 44 Bcf above the 5-year average after a net addition of 8 Bcf. At 3,776 Bcf, total working gas is above the 5-year historical range. Working gas stocks in the Producing Region, for the week ending October 12, 2012, totaled 1,226 Bcf, with 271 Bcf in salt cavern facilities and 955 Bcf in nonsalt cavern facilities.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) warned Thursday that EPA’s testing practices in Pavillion, Wyo., used too small a sample size to determine whether hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, contributed to groundwater contamination. The group said that could have far-reaching implications for EPA's national study on that linkage. “If EPA thinks its investigation at Pavillion has produced scientifically useful information, then it may proceed in the same inexpert way at other testing sites, assume it is getting additional useful information, and employ that information to justify changes in public policy,” Erik Milito, API director of upstream, said. Fracking injects a high-pressure mixture of water, chemicals and sand into tight rock formations to unlock hard-to-reach natural gas deposits. Pavillion has served as a flashpoint for the fracking debate, as EPA made the first government connection between fracking and contaminated groundwater there in 2011. A U.S. Geological Survey study last month found much of the same elements in Pavillion's groundwater as the EPA study. However, it invalidated one of EPA's two monitoring wells for yielding too small of a water sample. The EPA has said the U.S. Geological Survey’s study is “generally consistent” with its own. Milito said the U.S. Geological Survey study “did a better job,” adding that many of the elements EPA did discover occur naturally and are not the result of fracking. Environmentalists contend fracking pollutes groundwater and incites seismic activity. But industry and states say the practice is safe and that regulations have done an effective job monitoring fracking.

This is another stock that’s been hammered by the sellers so far in 2012, with shares off by 75%. 5 Takeover Targets to Buy Before Wall Street Finds Out If you take a look at the chart for Lone Pine Resources, you’ll see that this stock bottomed at a low of $1.09 a share in August after falling from over $5 a share from the previous months. Following that low, shares of LPR have started to rebound strong to a recent high of $1.86 a share. During that rebound, shares of LPR have been making mostly higher lows and higher highs, which is bullish technical price action. That move has now pushed LPR within range of triggering a near-term breakout trade. Market players should now look for long-biased trades in LPR once it manages to trigger a break out above some near-term overhead resistance levels at $1.68 to $1.86 a share with high volume. Look for a sustained move or close above those levels with volume that hits near or above its three-month average action of 802,580 shares. If that breakout triggers soon, then LPR will have an excellent chance of re-testing or possibly taking out its next major overhead resistance levels at $2.43 to $2.80 a share. Any high-volume move above $2.80 will put $3.50 to $3.80 into range for LPR. Traders can look to buy LPR off any weakness as long as it’s trending above its 50-day at $1.48 a share with strong upside volume flows. You could also buy off strength once LPR takes out those breakout levels with volume, and simply use a stop just below its 50-day at $1.48 a share.</Msg><Username>greatdayforinvestments</Username><Timestamp>1350588771086</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350589510840-27</Id><Topic><Title>XOM - Time to Make Some Gains!</Title><Username>clarkdane821</Username><Timestamp>1350560612443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:43:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Major volume and break-out, today.</Msg><Username>baldwinhines800</Username><Timestamp>1350589510840</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350592131714-28</Id><Title>Aren't You Tired of Paying For Maxwizard and Wahleee and their Relatives?</Title><Msg>A significant increase in taxpayer dollars during the Obama reign are being spent on these #$%$. "Welfare spending has grown substantially over the past four years, reaching $746 billion in 2011 — or more than Social Security, basic defense spending or any other single chunk of the federal government— according to a new memo by the Congressional Research Service. The steady rise in welfare spending, which covers more than 80 programs primarily designed to help low-income Americans, got a big boost from the 2009 stimulus and has grown, albeit somewhat more slowly, in 2010 and 2011. One reason is that more people are qualifying in the weak economy, but the federal government also has broadened eligibility so that more people qualify for programs. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, who requested the Congressional Research Service report, said it underscores a fundamental shift in welfare, moving away from a Band-Aid and toward a more permanent crutch. “No longer should we measure compassion by how much money the government spends but by how many people we help to rise out of poverty,” the Alabama conservative said. “Welfare assistance should be seen as temporary whenever possible and the goal must be to help more of our fellow citizens attain gainful employment and financial independence.” Overall, welfare spending as measured by obligations has grown from $563 billion in fiscal 2008 to $746 billion in fiscal 2011, or a jump of 32 percent. The CRS numbers tell a complex story of American taxpayers’ generosity in supporting a varied social safety net, ranging from food stamps to support for low-income AIDS patients to child-care payments to direct cash going from taxpayers to the poor. By far the biggest item on the list is Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor, which at $296 billion in federal spending made up 40 percent of all low-income assistance in 2011. That total was up $82 billion from 2008."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1350592131714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:28:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350594867647-29</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!

My memory functions well. In the last US Presidential election, gasoline prices declined a month before the election, and immediately after the election gas prices returned to the price they were before the artificial decline. In this election, the decline is not at the beginning of October, but after half the month has passed. Again after the election has ended, gas prices will immediately return to where they were in each geographic area. I think the delay in reducing prices compared to 4 years ago is due to the massive greed of the people controlling the daily price. Without this election, gas prices are higher than they were in May, 2008 when they spiked just before Memorial day when Goldman Sachs issued a PR announcing the price would go to 105 - 110 / barrel. Since there was a target, the futures speculators made it real and the price per barrel closed that Friday at 107. The price of gasoline was not as high then as it has been since last year, with lower per barrel oil prices. Then the end of June, 2008 T Boone Pickens announced the price per barrel was headed towards 150 / barrel. Just before the 4th of July, I think it peaked at 144 / barrel. Only because he had to open his mouth. The futures speculators did the rest. T Boone Pickens, has been called the "oil Barron". I recall reading on Yahoo Finance either last year or this winter that he LOST more than $1 billion in oil last year. Greed prevails. The prices are fixed and the Presidential elections are fixed. Bush 2 at his Texas ranch announced to his guests at a party that he would be the next President.

Climate change is altering the Arctic terrain and nations are jockeying for access. Arctic sea ice coverage reached its lowest level on record in September. Clinton touted the Obama administration’s work with the multilateral, eight-nation Arctic Council. “We are working to strengthen the Arctic Council ... so that it can promote effective collaboration,” she said.

The groups want to keep the renewable fuel standard (RFS) intact. The rule requires refiners to blend 13.2 billion gallons of corn-based biofuel into transportation fuel this year. The biofuels industry has geared up for a short-term skirmish on the RFS. It wants to defeat a request for a one-year waiver from the rule by a handful of state governors who say it is untenable under drought conditions. “With so many Americans in distress from the 2012 drought, it may be difficult to accept that the flexibility provisions built into the RFS and the market itself are working to minimize the consumer impact of lower grain yields. But that is exactly what is happening,” the groups said in a Thursday letter to Senate and House leaders. The traditionally fragmented industry has united in preparation for a protracted battle over the RFS. They say the drought and ensuing waiver requests have raised the rule’s profile. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers have backed the governors’ waiver request. They say the RFS has choked off corn supplies during the drought, in turn contributing to record-high prices that have raised operational costs for livestock and poultry producers. The biofuels industry contends that the drought, not the RFS, is what has pushed prices higher. They say a waiver is unnecessary because refiners already have curtailed biofuel production in response to corn prices, and that enough renewable fuel credits exist to cover the remaining blending requirements. Industry groups have said honoring the RFS waiver would cool investment in “advanced” biofuels made from non-edible feedstocks. The industry has amplified its outreach to lawmakers to spread that message. Jim Greenwood, president and CEO of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, told attendees at a Washington, D.C., renewable energy conference on Thursday that supporters must “convince our political leaders that renewables are ready, reliable and competitive.” “This is not the time to kick the legs out from under renewable fuels. And we should not turn our backs on the 400,000 Americans whose jobs are supported by the biofuels industry. As the advanced biofuel industry grows, good employment opportunities will be within reach for many more Americans,” Greenwood said. the hill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350604945089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 20:02:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350605226795-39</Id><Topic><Title>Biofuels industry presses congressional leaders to maintain fuel rule</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350604945089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 20:02:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EU releases proposal to alter biofuel policy By Erin Voegele | October 17, 2012 The European Commission has released a proposal that aims to make significant changes to the EU’s biofuel policy. According to the commission, the proposal will limit the global land conversion for biofuel production and increase the climate-related benefits of biofuels consumed in the EU. The proposal also seeks to limit the use of food-based feedstocks for biofuel production. “This is to stimulate the development of alternative, so-called second generation biofuels from non-food feedstock, like waste or straw, which emit substantially less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels and do not directly interfere with global food production,” said the commission in a statement. “For the first time, the estimated global land conversion impacts—indirect land use change (ILUC)—will be considered when assessing the greenhouse gas performance of biofuels.” The proposal seeks to amend the RED in several specific ways. First, it sets a 60 percent minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) saving threshold for new production. The commission said this change is designed to improve efficiency of biofuel production processes and discourage additional investments in production facilities that have low GHG reduction performance. Second, the proposal includes ILUC in the reporting of GHG savings of biofuels and bioliquids by fuel suppliers and EU member states. Estimated ILUC emissions published in the proposal assign a 12 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (gCO2eq/MJ) for cereals and other starch rich crops. The relative ILUC for sugars and oil crops are estimated to be 13 gCO2eq/MJ and 55 gCO2eq/MJ). Third, the proposal aims to maintain the target that calls for 10 percent of transportation fuel to be renewable by 2020, but sets a 5 percent limit on the use of crop-based biofuels and bioliquids. Finally, the proposal would establish incentives for biofuels that result in little or no ILUC emissions. Feedstocks that do not create additional demand for land, including algae, straw and waste, are those targeted for incentives in the proposal. Representatives of the European biofuel industry are speaking out against the proposal, saying that it will decimate the region’s biofuel industry in the midst of the European economic crisis. A joint statement released by Coceral, Copa-Cogeca, the European Biodiesel Board, the European Oilseed Alliance, the European Renewable Ethanol Association (ePURE) and Fediol stresses that the groups strongly oppose plans to limit crop-based biofuels and include ILUC emissions in RED. “A proposal based on unfounded and immature ILUC science and a 5% cap in 2020 would destroy the biofuels industries and related sectors such as crushing and sugar facilities,” said the group in a statement. “It would also cut off European farmers from a key market, reducing the crops diversification. Any change in policy must safeguard the investments made and ongoing toward fulfilling the commission’s initial objectives of 10 percent renewable energy for transport production in the EU. Fundamental problems remain in the EC proposal which will have devastating impact on the biofuels industries and diversification of farmer’s revenues.” The biofuel groups also stressed that it was totally unacceptable of the commission to use the International Food Policy Research Institute report to introduce ILUC values, as the report has not been peer reviewed. “The model used for the report is not suitable for precisely estimating the extent of land use change and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, due to critical data errors and important methodical problems,” said the biofuel organizations. “As such, any ILUC figures especially as high as 55g for oilseeds are arbitrary. The review clause in 2017 leads to more regulatory uncertainty, discouraging investments in advanced biofuels plants.” The biofuels organizations have criticized several other components of the proposal, including the 5 percent cap on crop-based biofuels, which they said could bring development in the sector to an abrupt halt, and lead to a slowdown in industrial and agricultural activity and job loss. In addition, the biofuel organizations said that multiple counting is not going to boost the advancement of advancement of biofuels, and that reversing policy decisions made two years ago will diminish investor confidence. Finally, the groups noted that phasing out biofuels made from certain crops will not increase food security or bring down prices. “The EU farmers and biofuels industries look forward to working to ensure that an industry that plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gases, enhancing Europe’s energy independence; and creating sustainable jobs, remains viable,” said the organizations in the joint statement. “Today’s proposal fails to recognize what the EU farmers and biofuels industries have achieved to date. It will jeopardize investments, jobs in rural areas and prevent development of advanced biofuels. We strongly urge the European Parliament and the Council to incorporate changes to rectify these problems and look forward to working with them to that end.” ethanolproducer</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350605226795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 20:07:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350605608580-40</Id><Topic><Title>UNEMPLO.... 8.1 %..46,000 more people filed for 1- time</Title><Username>michael9mdva</Username><Timestamp>1350578403702</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:40:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Obama was president for 25 years, our National Debt rose to 300 Trilliion, 75% of the population were driven to Welfare and Food Stamps, the global financial system wourld collapse and people were fighting in the streets......you'd still blame everything on the Republicans party and vote the muslim Obamatoid back in office.......wouldn't you?

ORLANDO, Fla. – Mitt Romney, who often grouses that he is simultaneously running against President Obama and the mainstream media, will be greeted upon his arrival in Florida on Friday by a headline with which he cannot quarrel: The Orlando Sentinel is endorsing him. Four years after The Sentinel, central Florida’s largest newspaper, endorsed Barack Obama’s candidacy for president, the newspaper’s editorial page said Mr. Romney is the better choice this time. “We have little confidence that Obama would be more successful managing the economy and the budget in the next four years,” the editorial in Friday’s edition said. “For that reason, though we endorsed him in 2008, we are recommending Romney in this race.” A little more than two weeks before the election, newspaper endorsements are steadily trickling in across the country. Both campaigns have spent considerable time trying to win endorsements, particularly from newspapers in battleground states, like The Sentinel. The Obama campaign has assigned top advisers to talk with editorial boards, trying to win endorsements from the newspapers that supported his candidacy in 2008. Mr. Romney has also been meeting with some editorial boards during campaign trips. The campaigns are bracing this weekend for several newspaper endorsements to be released in key states. The recommendation of Mr. Romney by The Sentinel, whose readers live in a battleground area within a battleground state, stopped short of being a ringing endorsement. But the editorial page firmly declared that it was time for a change in the White House, arguing that Mr. Romney’s business experience and record of leadership prepared him for the Oval Office. “Romney is not our ideal candidate for president,” the editorial said. “We’ve been turned off by his appeals to social conservatives and immigration extremists. Like most presidential hopefuls, including Obama four years ago, Romney faces a steep learning curve on foreign policy.” He is expected to tout the endorsement on Friday when he arrives for a campaign visit in Daytona Beach. He will stay in Florida until Monday, when he meets Mr. Obama for the third presidential debate in Boca Raton. Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is the biggest battleground state in the nation. The editorial made clear that its endorsement was for one campaign cycle at a time.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1350617661523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:34:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350618179148-45</Id><Title>Genuine Bio-Fuel Produces Biodiesel in Seconds</Title><Msg>Genuine Bio-Fuel Produces Biodiesel in Seconds Comment on this post Posted by Joanna Schroeder – October 18th, 2012 Florida-based Genuine Bio-Fuel says it has developed a new production process that refines biodiesel fuel in seconds using ultrasonic shearing technologies. Traditionally, it takes several hours to produce biodiesel using batch reactors and the result, says the company, is varying qualities of biodiesel, by-products, water consumption and contaminated water discharge. Genuine Bio-Fuel says using this technology limits future technological advancement. “Batch reactors are too cumbersome and limiting, said Executive Vice President Jeff Longo. The batch process is time consuming, taking anywhere from a couple of hours to days to complete. Plus, it is not conducive for using a variety of alternative feedstocks of variable quality.” The company invested in developing a new technology that would reduce operational costs, reduce energy usage and produce high quality fuel. The result was to use ultrasonic shearing that uses sound waves to bond a catalyst to feedstock, which creates a chemical reaction. During the ultrasonic process, according to the company, the feedstock and catalyst are simultaneously added to the tank and passed through a chamber of ultrasonic sound waves. These sound waves jumble the elements so violently that they become instantly bonded together. After this reaction, the mixture flows into another tank where any remaining raw components will be expelled through a centrifuge – unlike the batch process, which uses water. From there the fuel is passed through an ion exchange polishing tank to polish the final product. Longo says today Genuine Bio-Fuel is the only plant that truly uses continuous-flow, ultrasonic, shear-mixing technology to product biodiesel. In the process, the company also cut production time and costs, it energy use is about 60 percent below industry average, and there is no need for excessive heat and pressure. domesticfuel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350618179148</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:42:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350618774555-46</Id><Title>86M gallons of US biodiesel produced in Sept., 843M gallons YTD - US ethanol production in Sep drops to lowest recorded level: EPA</Title><Msg>86M gallons of US biodiesel produced in Sept., 843M gallons YTD By The National Biodiesel Board | October 18, 2012 The U.S. EPA said today that 86 million gallons of biodiesel were produced in September, reporting year-to-date production of nearly 843 million gallons through the end of the month. Biodiesel production is reported under the EPA's biomass-based diesel category in the renewable fuel standard (RFS). The EPA numbers show a total of 96.5 million gallons of biomass-based diesel for the month of September, but that figure also includes renewable diesel production. Last year, the biodiesel industry set a new production record of nearly 1.1 billion gallons, supporting more than 40,000 jobs across the country. Made from an increasingly diverse mix of resources such as recycled cooking oil, soybean oil and animal fats, biodiesel is the first and only EPA-designated advanced biofuel that's produced on a commercial scale across the U.S. It is produced in nearly every state in the country and is used in existing diesel engines without modification. biodieselmagazine -------------------- ------------------- ---------------------- US ethanol production in Sep drops to lowest recorded level: EPA Houston (Platts)--18Oct2012/353 pm EDT/1953 GMT US ethanol production in September plunged 102.2 million gallons from August to 983.9 million gallons, its lowest level since the federal Environmental Protection Agency started recording monthly biofuel production in July 2010, according to data released Thursday through the EPA Moderated Tracking System website. The previous monthly low for ethanol production -- which is tallied under the EPA's renewable fuel (D6) category consisting of corn-based ethanol, the main type produced in the US -- was in February 2011, when it was at 1.051 billion gallons. The record-low production figure, sources said, was most likely the result of numerous ethanol plant rate cuts and shutdowns. One such shutdown was a plant of Abengoa's, which confirmed in early October that it had temporarily shut its 88 million gal/year ethanol plant in Madison, Illinois, for maintenance. Monthly biodiesel production for September, indicated in the biomass-based diesel (D4) category by the EPA, fell for the fourth consecutive month as it shrank 8.638 million gallons, or 5.5%, to 147.02 million gallons. Monthly biodiesel production has not been this low since February, when it was at 116.9 million gallons. The slowing biodiesel production caused biodiesel Renewable Identification Number, or RIN, prices to shoot up recently, sources said. The Platts assessment for 2012 biodiesel RINs was at $0.70/RIN Wednesday, the highest level since October 2. Since being assessed October 10 at a 2012-low of $0.4250/RIN, 2012 biodiesel RIN assessments rose 27.5 cents/RIN, or 65%, over the course of a week. A RIN is a number issued by the EPA for the purpose of tracking renewable fuel usage throughout the supply chain; refiners, importers and blenders, called "obligated parties," use them to show the EPA they have fulfilled their mandated government use of renewable fuels. If the obligated party has not used enough physical product, such as ethanol, it can satisfy the quota by purchasing RINs. For biodiesel, the RIN serves the same purpose, but is biodiesel-specific. Monthly advanced biofuel (D5) production -- mostly comprising ethanol derived from feedstock sugarcane -- for September eased off of the previous month's record high, dropping 8.197 million gallons, or 9.5%, to 78.012 million gallons. platts</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350618774555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
