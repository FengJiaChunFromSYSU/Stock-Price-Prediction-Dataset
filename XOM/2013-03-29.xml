At 3:45, Reuters reported an XOM order imbalance on the sell side of 718,300 shares. In the last 3 minutes of trading, the volume spiked to 5,000,000 shares according to the Schwab volume graph. I've seen no news. After-hours trading was tame, as if people weren't confident enough to trade because they were too busy trying to make sense of the drop. Maybe some baby whale suddenly remembered that the markets are closed on Friday and had to clean up some positions before the end of the first quarter. Maybe there's a little window dressing going on. Exxon rose only half as much as the rest of the Dow in this bountiful quarter. Nothing has changed for the long-term outlook, as far as I can see.</Msg><Username>danielaxtell</Username><Timestamp>1364571978108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 11:46:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364577578434-4</Id><Title>North Korea</Title><Msg>The North Koreans may well provide the U.S. a good opportunity to demonstrate the full magnitude of its military power. Iran's behavior would improve if the U.S. demonstrated a willingness to use its power. This would be control by the intimidation principle. The size of the North Korean military provides a "target rich" environment, so it would provide a very good example. The U.S. should not be timid. It is good news to hear that they it has moved B-2 bombers to the Pacific area.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364577578434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 13:19:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364597122319-5</Id><Topic><Title>Jim Rogers: 'Run for the Hills,' I'm Doing It</Title><Username>spcrash</Username><Timestamp>1364494537871</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 14:15:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jim Rogers is a draft dogging puzzy, whats the odds he is moving to Saudi Arabia, Like Haliburton?</Msg><Username>besttoyou1</Username><Timestamp>1364597122319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364599359069-6</Id><Topic><Title>North Korea</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364577578434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 13:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>North Korea's leader (Mr. Potato Head) is too stupid and way too ugly to attempt to be a leader of any country. Of course the rest of the country's citizens are just as ugly. You just got to love a country that has a "hand-me-down" president like Korea. I can hear it now; Daddy, can I be President after you die? I've been practicing war games with my toy soldiers and bottle rockets. Meanwhile NORAD is probably prepping Nutron silo doors.....

Since the market bottomed out in early 2009, Exxon stock has drastically underperformed. Dow up around 8000 points and XOM barely higher than it was in early 2009. Stock buy backs only make earnings per share look better because of fewer shares not higher earnings. Given the consistently awful performance of the stock over the last several years, this financial engineering has not fooled anyone. Shareholders need a higher dividend to get at least some return from this stock.</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1364602362352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 20:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364612815668-9</Id><Topic><Title>North Korea</Title><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364577578434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 13:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>North Koreas rocket program is like my golf game.

The toy soldier, bottle-rocket boy knows his rockets don’t work, and he must enjoy his power and women enough not to commit suicide. In Germanic high culture one is courtly and mannerly around women. Considering his realm, his courting routine is mostly likely to be crude and bellicose. I think that is what this whole thing is all about - he needs to be a convincing lord of his harem. Thor’s lightening will most likely not be required.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1364615052644</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 23:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364615102659-11</Id><Topic><Title>Jim Rogers: 'Run for the Hills,' I'm Doing It</Title><Username>spcrash</Username><Timestamp>1364494537871</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 14:15:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A puzzy is no good on a battlefield anyway.
