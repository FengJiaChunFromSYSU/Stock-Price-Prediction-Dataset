As far as Obama and Romney not voluntarily serving in the military; Obama hates the US as it was founded and the Romneys love the US as it was founded; Obama is my enemy and Romney is not. I agree with Ron Paul's policies more than Romney's policies but Obama's policies are clearly worse than either Paul's or Romney's. Since I love the US as it was founded, the Presidential voting choice is very clear to me. But I do understand that there are many black people who hate the US as it was founded since it was founded by a bunch of rich white people, many of whom were slave owners. So many black people would rather vote for the destruction of the US, even though they will suffer just as much, if not more so, than the rest of us will suffer at this destruction; so Obama is clearly their choice. Some of the original founders may have been racists but the black voters voting for Obama because "he looks more like them" is also racist, and two "wrongs" do not make a "right".</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1346688239000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 12:03:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346691710000-25</Id><Topic><Title>SPEAKING of REALITY!!</Title><Username>smithharry943</Username><Timestamp>1346602056000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:07:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>exactly what the movie nobama 2016 showed.

Rogers’s claim comes amid a GOP political offensive to place the “Are you better off today?” question squarely before voters this fall. “Well, from an energy-sector [standpoint], we're better off today than we were four years ago. Think about it. President Obama pursued an all-of-the-above strategy. Are we better off in terms of efficiency? We see per-home usage of electricity declining. That's a good thing,” Rogers said on CNN, according to a transcript. “The second thing is we [have had] two license for nuclear plants issued. We have abundant supply of natural gas at low prices. And so as you look at the various ways to generate electricity in this country, we're better off today than we were four years ago,” added Rogers, the co-chairman of the Charlotte in 2012 Convention Host Committee. As the Democrats’ convention opens, Republicans are making the “Are you better” question a major campaign focus, and seizing on Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s (D) comment on the question Sunday. O’Malley was asked by CBS host Bob Schieffer on “Face the Nation” if he could “honestly say that people are better off today than they were four years ago.” “No,” replied O’Malley, a prominent Obama surrogate, “but that’s not the question of this election. “Without a doubt, we are not as well-off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses,” O'Malley added. O’Malley walked back the comment Monday, but Republicans have run with the remark. The GOP vice presidential candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), plans to highlight the “Are you better off” question Monday as Republicans seek to keep the campaign focused on the struggling economy. Rogers, when pressed on CNN to address the topic more broadly than its relation to energy, including Americans’ feelings about their jobs and home values, said President Obama inherited big problems. “I think one of the things I would simply say is the president started in a deep hole. And he's worked his way out,” said Rogers, CEO of the utility that’s now the nation’s largest thanks to its recent merger with Progress Energy. “The more relevant question is, are we on the right trend? Are we moving in the right direction? And maybe more importantly is, where will we be in 2016? Th[ose], to me, are the relevant questions Americans should be asking,” he said. http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/247181-duke-energy-ceo-country-better-off-with-obama-on-energy</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346702902000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:08:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346703994000-32</Id><Title>Storm could turn on Obama if oil stocks are released</Title><Msg>Storm could turn on Obama if oil stocks are released Robin Mills Sep 4, 2012 A sitting American president does not normally welcome a storm tearing through the Gulf of Mexico But in Barack Obama's case, Hurricane Isaac may give valuable cover for a move desired for political reasons. Disruption caused by the storm could be a convenient excuse for a release of strategic oil stocks - a release not justified by market logic. Petrol prices in the United States have been rising steadily towards US$4 per gallon, reaching $3.82 on Thursday. This was partly blamed on Isaac, which shut down about 12 per cent of US refining capacity; and a massive explosion at Venezuela's largest refinery, Amuay. A small amount of oil was loaned to one refinery to cover disruptions. But Isaac, a category 1 storm, was nothing like as strong as 2005's infamous Katrina, a category 3 hurricane that inundated New Orleans and drove oil prices to record highs. The US oil industry has changed dramatically since then. Inland oil production is rising sharply because of shale oil developments, so offshore output and imports via the Gulf of Mexico are less important. And refinery utilisation is low because of falling domestic demand, giving more back-up if some plants are shut down. The blame for high prices lies much more with global demand, which although tepid is still rising, and with sanctions on Iran. Iranian exports seem to have recovered slightly last month, but are still only about half of normal levels as customers attempt to work around bans on insurance, shipping and financial transactions. Just as energetically, the US seeks to block loopholes. The statement from the G7 finance ministers last Wednesday read: "The current rise in oil prices reflects geopolitical concerns and certain supply disruptions. We encourage oil- producing countries to increase their output to meet demand, while drawing prudently on excess capacity." This implicitly blames Saudi Arabia and other Arabian Gulf countries for failing to keep their side of the bargain - to increase production sufficiently to offset losses from Iran and hold prices below $100 per barrel. With Brent oil prices reaching $113, the US has been pushing harder for emergency oil stocks to be brought into use. But the International Energy Agency (IEA) is reluctant, as are Germany and Italy. It is important for Mr Obama to avert a damaging spike in petrol prices before November's election. http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/energy/storm-could-turn-on-obama-if-oil-stocks-are-released</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346703994000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346704004000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Storm could turn on Obama if oil stocks are released</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346703994000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:26:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keeping prices down also helps to encourage wavering US allies to continue enforcing sanctions. But strategic stocks are a dangerous tool. There is no obvious supply disruption - losses from Iran are inflicted by the US itself, and in any case mainly compensated by other Opec members. The IEA considers the release during last year's Libyan revolution a success. But that crisis was short-lived. The situation now is different. Who knows how long the Iran crisis may drag on? Conversely, if the US anticipates war with Iran soon, strategic stocks should be held back, not squandered early. Its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) could replace total US imports only for about 100 days. The SPR was designed as an emergency buffer, not a tool for market management. If used routinely to reduce temporarily high prices, commercial storage will simply adjust and companies will hold lower inventory, rendering the SPR redundant. And, because the rules for emergency release are not clear, ad-hoc use exacerbates volatility in prices. The Republicans must be pleased with this outcome. They can attack Mr Obama over high petrol prices and weakening economic confidence. Simultaneously, they can bash him for being "soft" on Iran, when the very sanctions they have enthusiastically championed, and he has implemented, have caused these high prices.

Romney has often described his initial departure from the firm—which happened very suddenly—as a “leave of absence,” and it wasn’t until 2002 that his formal ties with the firm were dissolved. (And even after 2002, he reaped the benefits of a sweetheart severance agreement that gave him stakes in Bain’s investment funds.) Given that, and given the fact that Romney was the sole stockholder in the firm, it’s plausible that he kept his titles at Bain even if he wasn’t actually doing anything there until it was clear that he wouldn’t be returning to it. In other words, he might well have been in charge on paper while having no real responsibility at the company. Indeed, Fortune reported yesterday—thanks, one wonders, to a leak from the Romney campaign?—that the offering documents Bain provided to potential investors in 2000 in its next private-equity fund did not list Romney as part of the fund’s management. All this may mean that the [Boston] Globe’s report doesn’t really show what Romney’s critics (and the Obama campaign) would like it to show: namely, that he was in fact of charge of Bain long after February, 1999. Yet the fact that it doesn’t quite show this doesn’t mean that it’s not politically damaging, because what this constant drip-drip of revelations about S.E.C. filings and tax returns and overfunded I.R.A.s underscores is how adept Mitt Romney has been at gaming the system, and how easy it’s been for him to play by rules that most Americans simply can’t play by. http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/07/the-real-scandal-of-romney-and-bain.html#ixzz25RVIDdco</Msg><Username>lc298h</Username><Timestamp>1346706347000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 17:05:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346708236000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Duke Energy CEO: Country better off with Obama on energy</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1346702902000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:08:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"While many of the president’s local supporters were excited about Charlotte, N.C., being selected as the host city for the 2012 DNC, no one was jumping for joy more than James Rogers, the CEO of the Charlotte-based energy conglomerate Duke Energy. Rogers was a major proponent of many of the administration’s efforts on energy and environmental policy, and a deafeningly vocal advocate of Cap and Trade legislation. But there are always two sides to the coin. Economist Bruce Yandle referred to it as “Baptists and Bootleggers”. Baptists and Bootleggers both supported Prohibition, but did so for very different reasons. Baptists pushed prohibition for the greater moral good (as they saw it), while Bootleggers supported it because they made their money on illegal booze. When it comes to energy and environmental policy and the economic recovery, Rogers isn’t the Baptist here. He and Duke Energy are Bootleggers. For many of the same reasons the Bootleggers favored the government-created black-market for liquor, Duke Energy and its CEO have been unequivocal supporters of the Obama administration’s war on affordable energy. Rogers and Duke lobbied heavily for regulations, Cap and Trade, and “green” energy grants. For example, the company accepted $204 million in stimulus funds for “smart-grid projects”. Duke has become dependent on this kind of crony-capitalism. Without these sweetheart deals and regulations that favor their portfolio, they wouldn’t be able to compete. This, and the failure of cap-and-trade early in Obama’s term, explains Duke’s and Rogers’ latest move. At Rogers’ direction, Duke has extended a $10 million line of credit to the DNC ahead of the convention, as well as providing prime office space to convention staffers. Duke, Rogers, the DNC, and Obama haven’t fooled some of Duke’s shareholders, as many are wise to the company’s game of looting and mooching in Washington. Tom and Deneen Borelli, two-limited government activists currently with FreedomWorks, attended the shareholder meeting at the time of Rogers’ announcement regarding the DNC credit line. They were livid at the fact Rogers had lobbied for President Obama’s Cap and Trade policy that would have forced electricity prices higher and he was using shareholder money to curry favor with the president and the Democrats. They made that point clear to Rogers at the Duke shareholders meeting in 2011, while hundreds of FreedomWorks activists protested outside."
