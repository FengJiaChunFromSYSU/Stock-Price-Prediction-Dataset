"Gang members are tweeting plans for looting during Hurricane Sandy, as it hammers the New York region Monday and Tuesday, according to reports. The Twitterverse is flooded with threats to pillage during the weather phenomenon known as "Frankenstorm." There was unrestrained looting of homes in the wake of Irene last year, although the press underreported the story. Also, miscreants plundered New Orleans for weeks after Hurricane Katrina, so this current situation has the potential to spiral completely out of control."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1351598116227</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 07:55:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351602915523-5</Id><Topic><Title>NYSE has 3 ft of water on the exchange FLOOR !

A new survey of physicians has found that 28 percent of doctors in Virginia intend to place new or additional limits on accepting Medicare patients, with 23 percent altogether refusing to accept new Medicare patients, because of Obamacare’s impact on the fees that Medicare pays to providers of health-care services. In addition, Obamacare will deeply cut Medicare Advantage for 174,000 Commonwealth seniors who are enrolled in the program, and drive up the cost of private health coverage, especially for those who buy insurance on their own. Read on for more details. Obamacare cuts Medicare by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022 in order to pay for part of the law’s $1.9 trillion in new health-care spending for younger people over the same time frame. My co-blogger Robert Book and Michael Ramlet have published a paper for the University of Minnesota showing that Virginia’s share of those Medicare cuts is $11.7 billion. This year, Virginia has 1,203,462 Medicare enrollees, which means that these cuts amount to $9,737 for every senior in the state. Robert Book published another paper, this time with former White House budget official James Capretta, detailing Obamacare’s cuts to Medicare Advantage on a state-by-state basis. Robert and Jim found that, in 2017, Obamacare will cut $3,804 in Medicare Advantage services for every Virginian enrolled in the program: a 29 percent cut. 14 percent of Virginia’s seniors—173,844—are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Survey: 28 percent of Virginia doctors to limit their acceptance of Medicare Last month, the Physicians Foundation published one of the largest physician surveys ever conducted in the United States, with 13,575 respondents. They asked physicians a broad range of questions, including several about their views on Obamacare. 56 percent of Virginia physicians said that the Affordable Care Act made them “less positive about the direction and future of healthcare in America.” Only 19 percent said it made them feel more positive. If Medicare fees decrease by ten percent or more—as the Affordable Care Act will require—28 percent of doctors in the Old Dominion say that they will place “new or additional limits” on accepting Medicare patients. 23 percent say they’ll stop accepting Medicare patients altogether. The survey also has bad news for Virginians on other forms of insurance. 20 percent of Wisconsin physicians say that they’ll place new or additional limits on Medicaid patients as a result of the Medicare cuts; 14 percent also say they plan to raise fees on those with private insurance in order to compensate for the cuts. Individual-market premiums could increase by 19-85 percent One of the most under-appreciated aspects of Obamacare is the degree to which the law drives up the cost of health insurance, especially for people who buy it on their own. While there are no published estimates for how Obamacare will affect non-group premiums in Virginia, we do have estimates from a number of analysts—including those from a key adviser to President Obama—for other states. Obama adviser Jonathan Gruber has estimated that, by 2016, the cost of individual-market health insurance under Obamacare, relative to what it would have been under prior law, will increase by an average of 19 percent in Colorado, 29 percent in Minnesota, and 30 percent in Wisconsin. A highly regarded actuarial firm, Milliman, has estimated that individual-market premiums in Ohio could increase by 55 to 85 percent. Because Obamacare forces insurers to cover a buffet of benefits that they don’t have to today, the cost of insurance will go up. Another driver of higher premiums is the fact that insurers will have to cover everyone, regardless of previous health status, a change that will attract sicker enrollees at the expense of healthier ones. Some Obamacare defenders try to argue that these cost increases don’t matter, because a slice of the low-income population will benefit from the law’s subsidies. But if you’re not eligible for subsidies, or only partially eligible, you will be exposed to the law’s dramatic increases in the cost of insurance. And remember that Obamacare has an individual mandate, which will force most Americans to absorb these higher costs.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351627879235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 16:11:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351635893365-9</Id><Topic><Title>Blackout in the Northeast</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1351353752721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we need "brownie" in charge--he does a heckuva job more of the "w" putting the best people in charge where lives are at stake (think Iraq) good job "w"--good job brownie I wonder if guv Christie called brownie --I wonder why he didn't appoint him to a state position/emergency response--I wonder why?? brownie now has a job at fox news--"consultant" a la sarah palin "consultant" at fox means unqualified at any profession--disqualified from elected position--but expert/authority for fox "news" what a joke</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1351635893365</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351637354936-10</Id><Topic><Title>Blackout in the Northeast</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1351353752721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does brain death qualify you for, wahleee boy?</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351637354936</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:49:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351637565415-11</Id><Title>In Florida, Obamacare to Cause 27% of Doctors to Stop Accepting Medicare Patients</Title><Msg>Obamacare to cut Medicare by $12,584 per Florida retiree Obamacare cuts Medicare by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022 in order to pay for part of the law’s $1.9 trillion in new health-care spending for younger people over the same time frame.

The third-grader had good news: She was doing great on her standardized tests, she proudly told a teacher at the school. How did she know? the instructor asked. "My teacher points out the answers that I need to correct," she said. With that, the fate of Westside Elementary in Thermal was sealed. State officials have stripped Westside and 22 other schools of a key state ranking for cheating, other misconduct or mistakes in administering the standardized tests given last spring. The offenses ranged from failing to cover bulletin boards to more overt improprieties, including helping students correct mistakes or preparing them with actual test questions. The details were included in school district reports obtained by the Times through a public records request filed with the California Department of Education. The state defines such episodes as "adult irregularities," and if they affect at least 5% of students tested at a school, the campus loses its annual rating on California's Academic Performance Index, which was released this month. The API is a scale by which schools are officially measured in California. Top rankings are celebrated and contribute to high property values. Low scores can label schools as failures and trigger penalties. The number of schools with invalidated test scores remains relatively small: about two dozen each of the last three years in a state with more than 10,000 schools. Some teachers may have thought they were within bounds when in fact they weren't. A fifth-grade teacher at Short Avenue Elementary in the Del Rey neighborhood told her students in advance to jot down such helpful clues as multiplication tables, fraction-to-decimal conversions and number lines on scratch paper prior to starting the tests, according to a Los Angeles Unified report. On exam day, she allegedly walked around the classroom making encouraging remarks to make sure students followed through. That sort of test-day coaching is against the rules and cost Short Avenue its ranking. The teacher has since retired, according to the district. Short Avenue also lost its API score last year for alleged testing mistakes, improper coaching or outright cheating by three popular teachers. All were pulled from campus and have since retired; at least two faced being fired if they didn't leave. A teacher this year at Baldwin Lane Elementary in Big Bear City, stopped just short of handing out answers, but only just, a school report said. She used "facial expressions" to cue students on right or wrong answers: "smiles, blank stares, etc.," the report said. She also allegedly would direct students to redo problems or place dots beside incorrect answers. She even "corrected student tests and sent students back to their desk to fix incorrect responses" and "helped set up math problems where students couldn't themselves," the report said. Later, the teacher, who also was the school's testing coordinator, "informed parents that their student had done well on portions of the test," which is something that, according to the rules, the teacher would have no knowledge of at that point, the report said.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351644081976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 20:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
