A new poll released today by Public Policy Partners (PPP) shows than an overwhelming percentage of New York voters favor clean, renewable energy sources to power the state. The poll comes out just as the Long Island Power Authority is deciding on new energy contracts that could include offshore wind, and just after NYISO released their “Reliability Needs Assessment” report showing New York could safely retire its remaining coal plants and reliably meet energy needs with clean energy and efficiency. The telephone poll reached 601 voters statewide and 383 voters on Long Island by telephone from September 18th-21st. “The results of this poll are remarkable,” said Lisa Dix, Senior New York Campaign Representative for the Sierra Club. “We know that across the nation support for clean energy is high, but here in New York, nearly 9 out of 10 voters support expanding use of clean energy resources like wind and solar. New York’s leaders and utilities should take note: New Yorkers want clean energy.” According to the poll an overwhelming majority of voters, nearly 9 out of 10, support expanding the use of clean, renewable energy like wind and solar power (87% statewide and 90% on Long Island) and the majority support the state’s utilities investing in new clean energy rather than building new fossil fuel plants to meet future energy needs (76% statewide and 78% on Long Island). Next week the Long Island Power Authority is expected to announce plans for how to proceed with contracts for future power generation. The poll showed that the majority of voters statewide and in Long Island would support an offshore wind farm 12 to 15 miles off the coast of Long Island (82% statewide and 85% on Long Island). Furthermore, 8 out of 10 Long Islanders would be willing to pay more for clean energy from offshore wind if it meant transitioning away from dirty energy sources like coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Similarly, the majority of voters (68%) said they would rather see New York invest in clean energy than provide a bailout for the state’s aging and uneconomical coal plants. “On Long Island and throughout New York, we know we can do better than dirty, polluting power plants. We’re ready to start building the clean energy economy right here. We need Governor Cuomo and LIPA to listen to Long Island residents and voters and show actual leadership by choosing clean energy for our homes and businesses,” said Peter Gollon, volunteer Energy Chair with the Long Island Sierra Club. Currently, both LIPA and the State of New York are failing to meet the state’s renewable energy goal of obtaining 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2015, even though the poll shows meeting these goals is important to 84% of voters. Investing in local offshore wind would align with what voters would like to see; 70% say it is “very important” that the state meets their renewable energy goals using in-state clean energy projects. New Yorkers clearly want their state to gain the economic benefits of new energy industries and new clean energy jobs. PPP also asked people about fracking, and their results show that 80% of voters polled are concerned about fracking’s implications for water quality and a majority (52%) would oppose lifting the current moratorium on high volume fracking. “It is clear that New Yorkers want a clean energy future where our kids will grow up with healthier air to breathe, clean water to drink and exciting new jobs in the clean tech industry. Now, it’s up to Governor Cuomo to make that clean energy vision a reality, seize the opportunity to move our state beyond dirty energy like coal and fracking and make New York a national clean energy leader that we can be proud of,” said Dix.

James Inhofe (R-Okla.) thanked a green group on Friday for recognizing his skepticism of climate science with an award that is meant to be disparaging. The Center for Biological Diversity bestowed Inhofe with its “Rubber Dodo Award,” which it doles out annually to people the group says have done the most to drive endangered species extinct. It has previously been given to The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, former BP chief Tony Hayward and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R). Inhofe, who has made curbing environmental rules one of his top legislative goals, said he's honored to be the latest recipient. “I am truly honored that yet another radical environmental group has given me an award for my efforts to put a stop to President Obama’s far-left global warming agenda,” Inhofe said in a statement. Inhofe is busy stumping with GOP Senate candidates in Missouri, Montana and Ohio who oppose forthcoming and proposed environmental regulations considered detrimental to the coal industry. All three candidates are facing Democratic incumbents who voted against Inhofe's bill to block Environmental Protection Agency rules that limit mercury pollution and other toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. That bill failed in June by a 46-53 vote. Flipping the Senate to Republicans would improve the chances of that bill passing next Congress. It also would likely make Inhofe chairman of Environment and Public Works, enabling him to set the committee’s agenda. It is that very possibility that earned Inhofe the award, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement on Friday. “Senator Inhofe’s pet theory that climate change is an elaborate hoax would be hilarious, if only he weren’t an elected representative of the American people. If he were, say, a performance artist, it’d be really funny. But sadly he has the power to affect U.S. climate policy,” he said. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351277433019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:50:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351278777216-15</Id><Title>Will people wake up on Sun and run to gas station fill up all the cars !

Finneran, the former House speaker who pleaded guilty to obstructing justice in 2007, is not entitled to a government pension. The board ruled that Finneran, who was speaker from 1996 to 2004, forfeited his pension rights because he was convicted of a criminal offense related to his public position. Finneran pleaded guilty in US District Court to providing false testimony in a redistricting lawsuit. In its unanimous vote today, the board endorsed the conclusions of a hearing officer who examined the prosecution of Finneran and state retirement law. “The facts show that the the link between Mr. Finneran’s position and the offense for which he was convicted is both direct and clear,” the hearing officer wrote. “It is irrefutable that Mr. Finneran was acting in his official capacity when he took the actions that gave rise to this conviction.” Finneran, a former Democratic state representative from Mattapan, would have collected a pension of about $32,900 a year. Under the board’s ruling, Finneran will be able to recoup about $89,000 he contributed from his own pocket to the pension plan, but he is not entititled to $32,000 in accumulated interest. Finneran’s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351283189851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:26:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351283498073-17</Id><Topic><Title>Need for Keystone XL Shrinking as Industry Looks to Export U.S. Crude Oil</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351222581187</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:36:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correct - biofuels move primarily by truck or rail, which is far more expensive than utilizing a pipeline.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1351283498073</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:31:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351286644917-18</Id><Topic><Title>Obama should nationalize oil and all private retirement accounts in 2nd term</Title><Username>demsenate4obama</Username><Timestamp>1351245172565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 05:52:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another brilliant idea - just what Kirschner did in Argentina.

And there is a huge contrast in this campaign between myself and Governor Romney. I am surprised it didn’t come up in one of the debates,” the president said. However, while there were no questions on the topic, Obama never raised it himself during the debates despite engaging in several exchanges with Romney over energy policy. The silence in the debates disappointed many environmentalists, who wanted a more muscular stance from Obama. CNN’s Candy Crowley said after moderating the Oct. 16 debate that she had a question ready but didn’t get to it. Bob Scheiffer of CBS, who moderated the final debate Monday, similarly told Politico that he had questions on climate and other topics but “obviously there are only so many you can get to.” Obama used the Friday MTV interview to knock the views of Romney and other Republicans on climate science. “Governor Romney says he believes in climate change. That is different than a lot of the members of his own party who just deny it completely,” Obama said. “But he says he is not sure that man-made causes are the reason.” “I believe scientists, who say that we are putting too much carbon emissions into the atmosphere and it is heating the planet and it is going to have a severe effect,” Obama said. Climate policy has been tough sledding at times for Obama. Major climate change legislation fizzled on Capitol Hill in 2010, and Congress didn’t touch his proposal for a nationwide “clean” electricity standard. On MTV he touted the climate change benefits of his administration’s big increases in auto mileage standards, and also highlighted rising generation of renewable electricity, a sector that has benefitted from substantial funding through the stimulus and other programs. “The next step is to deal with buildings and really ramp up our efficiency in buildings,” Obama said, noting that if the U.S. had the same energy efficiency as Japan, the U.S. would cut energy use by about 20 percent. He said such efforts are a recipe for progress, but that much remains to be done. “If we do those things we can meet the targets that I negotiated with other countries in Copenhagen to bring our carbon emissions down by about 17 percent even, as we are creating good jobs in these industries,” Obama said Friday. The U.S., at the fractious United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2009, pledged to cut its emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. “In order for us to solve the whole problem though, we are going to have to have some technological breakthroughs, because countries like China and India, they are building coal-fired power plants, they feel that they have to prioritize getting people out of poverty ahead of climate change, so what we have to do is help them, and help ourselves by continuing to put money into research and technology about how do we really get the new sources of power that are going to make a difference,” Obama said. While Obama has mentioned climate change in a number of stump speeches, Friday’s comments represent his most expansive remarks on the topic in recent memory. But Obama did not discuss specifics of a second-term agenda. Green groups are pushing for a number of steps including establishment of carbon emissions standards for existing power plants. Romney, meanwhile, opposes emissions-capping legislation, and has called for stripping the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to regulate greenhouse gases. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351308494108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 23:28:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
