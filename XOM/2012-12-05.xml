A whopping 163 people signed up to testify at the hearing, which was attended by two representatives of the U.S. State Department, which will weigh whether to approve the international pipeline. It was a sometimes rowdy crowd, as many opponents to the pipeline booed or applauded speakers – despite admonitions not to — while supporters of the project were less vocal. Many people wearing boots, caps and jeans – farmers, ranchers and other landowners – testified against the pipeline while many pro-business and free market advocates and people who would help build the pipeline testified in favor of it. It is the final public hearing on the Keystone XL Pipeline that TransCanada has been working for years to get permission to build across America. The testimony is being taken by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, which is tasked with reviewing a new route for the pipeline through Nebraska – where the project ran into a wall of opposition. Nebraska landowners have loudly protested the 1,700-mile project, primarily out of concern that oil could leak into the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world’s largest aquifers, covering parts of eight states. The DEQ final report will go to Gov. Dave Heineman for review in January, and he has the final say on whether to approve it in Nebraska. Then the State Department will decide on a federal permit for the pipeline, since it crosses the border with Canada. Landowners’ concerns prompted TransCanada to revise its route through Nebraska, but the new route hasn’t allayed the concerns of many of the people who testified Tuesday night. Landowners, representatives of Native American tribes and members of the anti-pipeline group Bold Nebraska testified against the project. People such as Bonny Kilmurry of Atkinson said the pipeline would threaten her land and water supply if the pipeline leaks into the aquifer. “Water is our lifeblood,” she said. “We can live without oil. We cannot live without water.” Corey Goulet, a TransCanada vice president responsible for Keystone projects, was the first person to testify, saying the new route avoids the ecologically fragile Sandhills – one of the major concerns of Nebraskans. He said the pipeline will carry tar sands oil from Alberta – similar to heavy crudes transported across the nation daily – and also light crude oil from North Dakota. He said the oil is no more corrosive than any other crude oil. “We take our responsibility to build and operate a safe pipeline with the utmost seriousness,” he said, noting that TransCanada will invest $1 billion in Nebraska infrastructure and Nebraska counties will receive significant property tax revenue to build schools or lower taxes. J. Paul McIntosh, an 88-year-old Norfolk man who grew up in northeast Nebraska, said he was dismayed by both sides of the controversy, because they seem more interested in discrediting their opponents and making emotional appeals than making sound, logical decisions. To say a 100-gallon crude spill could contaminate an entire aquifer, for example, is disingenuous when farmers, ranchers and cities have been spreading “untold thousands of gallons” of oil to control dust on roads for years. Danny Hendrix, a pipeline constructor from Tulsa, Okla., said he would be nervous if the pipeline were going to be built across his land, but he said TransCanada is the most stringent client he’s ever worked for. But several people questioned why TransCanada didn’t just build the second pipeline parallel to the Keystone One pipeline that already crosses eastern Nebraska. Brigham McCown, former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration who now is a transportation and energy consultant, said the pipeline industry is one of the most highly regulated in the nation. He called oil pipelines “unsung heroes of our economy” because they are “underground energy highways” in delicate locations such as the Everglades. He said much of the opposition to the project is not about safety, but about environmental opposition to fossil fuels. “Holding a pipeline hostage is not the way to go,” McCown said. One of the most passionate voices of the night was Susan Luebbe, a Holt County rancher whose land was in the original pipeline route. “There’s a reason they call it flyover country, because the Midwest does not matter until everyone #$%$ enough,” she said loudly. She criticized the DEQ’s $2 million environmental review on the revised route as disorganized, a shamble and embarrassing. By 9:30 p.m., people were leaving and Bold Nebraska head Jane Kleeb was disgusted, saying the DEQ indicated it might end the hearing tonight, even though it was clear there wouldn’t be time for 163 people to testify. DEQ spokesman Brian McManus said a decision would be made at about 10:30 p.m. as to whether to continue the hearing tomorrow, or close it tonight. watchdogDOTorg/63233/passions-run-high-at-keystone-oil-pipeline-hearing/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354683630720</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 00:00:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354704960564-2</Id><Topic><Title>JUST SAY "NO" TO ALL UNION PRODUCTS !

(see recent Paris School of Economics study for particulars) FACT: % of wealth/income was is 600-700% in Europe today depending on the country. FACT: % of wealth/income declined to 200-300% in Europe from 1913 to 1945 (from World Wars) FACT: for the hundred years before 1913 European stocks &amp; real estate returned about as much as savings accounts/bond (sometimes 1% more or so, and sometimes less) FACT: as per the law of diminishing returns you can expect a higher return to a fixed factor (like capital) if it is more scarce (like it was after World War II) and a lower return if it is abundant (as it is now and as it was before World War I) The wealth/income trends are basically the same for the U.S. except that the U.S. has had a lower level of national wealth/ income throughout, except after the world wars. Reasonable Conclusion: The extraordinary and historically atypical return to capital enjoyed by stocks and real estate since World War II is nothing more than a one-off outcome caused by the economy transitioning from a low level of capital and investment to a high one. Given this situation, the rate of return of stocks and equity will be bounded by the rate of economic growth, which, at this point, is close to 0% without endless government and consumer borrowing, something which is impossible to sustain.</Msg><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1354735395707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:23:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354736568018-13</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal fist</Title><Username>manylumen</Username><Timestamp>1354708844805</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 07:00:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It promises to be quite severe.

Germany has a balanced its budget through such measures, and the spendthrift south is taxing its way out of its mess, lowering consumption and boosting savings as it does so.

There is no question that world wealth, international trade, and the rate of economic growth collapsed between 1913 and 1945, due to war and the financial turmoil caused by it. The leap in economic growth rates from 1945 to the 1970s (the only time in the past 200 years when stocks/real estate really outperformed bonds by much) was nothing more than rebound off a low. If you burn a forest down and then watch it grow back you will see a quite similar phenomenon in board feet of timber per square kilometer over time until it approaches maturity. Since the 1970s there has been no excess return on stocks relative to long term bonds worldwide, and economic growth has been slowly decelerating as the level of debt rises. The increasing tendency of growth to be debt driven has been widely noted, and deplored by many and for good reason. I could care less if you attach some emotional connotation to what are quite simply facts. Such a bizarre interpretation, on your part, of what is quite obviously a bland and bleak reality, says more about what you would like the world to be than what it is. I've already been through your manifold errors on society and the economy before. It is not worth reciting them again.

Moreover, for every one of the market scenarios examined, net economic benefits increased as the level of LNG exports increased,” states the report from NERA Economic Consulting released Wednesday. The study says the benefits outweigh the impact of price increases and small declines in wage incomes that would occur in several industries. “In all of these cases, benefits that come from export expansion more than outweigh the losses from reduced capital and wage income to U.S. consumers, and hence LNG exports have net economic benefits in spite of higher domestic natural gas prices." DOE has been waiting on the study as it weighs more than a dozen applications to export gas from the Gulf Coast, Oregon and other areas to nations that do not have free-trade agreements with the U.S. The proposals are politically controversial. Some senior lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the incoming chairman of the Senate’s Energy Committee, have warned that expanded exports could drive up costs for consumers and manufacturers that have benefited from low costs amid the U.S. gas drilling boom. Wyden said last month that he wants to examine all natural-gas exports, including ones the administration readily approves to free-trade nations. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who serves as the ranking member on Energy and Natural Resources, told The Hill last week that she is working to sway Wyden to favor natural-gas exports. “He didn’t say it needs to be stopped. He just is taking, I think, a cautionary approach. And knowing Sen. Wyden, I think he will be thoughtful about where he goes with it. I think that is something that, again, as the chairman and ranking, we’ll be talking through, holding hearings and really digging into the issue,” Murkowski said. Murkowski, an advocate of the exports, applauded the study Wednesday. “The conclusions in this report on the benefits to the economy should inform the DOE approval process regarding exports,” said Murkowski, the top Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, in a statement. “This is a really good report and it really does provide guidance as we move forward.” A number of other lawmakers also have endorsed expanded exports. Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who represents an eastern Colorado district that he said has “seen a tremendous uplift” from natural-gas drilling, said the report’s release should clear roadblocks for exports. He said with the report out of the way, Congress can apply pressure on the administration to sign off on export permits. “A number of permits have been waiting because of the report. And so Congress’s role in oversight, and Congress’s directives to the administration to make sure that we go forward with responsible energy development — that can result in responsible exports,” Gardner told The Hill on Wednesday. Wyden, for his part, highlighted findings showing that some price increases are expected if exports go forward. And he said it’s important for DOE to weigh the specifics of each application. “Regardless of this study’s conclusions, Senator Wyden will continue calling on the Energy Department to ensure that unfettered natural gas exports don't harm U.S. consumers and manufacturers,” his office said in a statement. “Forecasts and scenarios are worthwhile, but the department has an obligation to consider the impacts of each of the actual applications before it.” DOE said it would take public comment on the study, and that the report will inform its reviews of 15 export applications. “Following the closing of the reply comment period, the Department of Energy will begin to act on the 15 applications on a case-by-case basis. The study released today will be one of the inputs considered during evaluation of those applications,” the department said. While it's bullish on exports overall, the report finds that some manufacturers could be affected, noting “serious competitive impacts are likely to be confined to narrow segments of industry.” But it nonetheless finds that these energy-thirsty industries as a whole are not projected to undergo a loss in employment or output greater than 1 percent in any year. The report finds that exports are not likely to affect the overall level of U.S. employment. “There will be some shifts in the number of workers across industries, with those industries associated with natural gas production and exports attracting workers away from other industries,” it states. However, while finding net benefits, the study also notes there are winners and losers. It finds that “impacts will not be positive for all groups in the economy” as prices increase and wage income in industries outside the natural gas sector are affected. “Households with income solely from wages or transfers, in particular, will not participate in these benefits,” the analysts said. Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), a senior Democrat who has criticized export plans, highlighted findings on wage incomes in arguing the report shows that a surge in exports would lead to a “massive wealth transfer from working Americans to oil and gas companies.” He also questioned the accuracy of the study. “I am also concerned that the negative impacts on American workers and manufacturing could be vastly underestimated in this analysis because it is based on old data that may understate industrial demand by 30 percent.” The report drew quick praise from an industry group that’s advocating in favor of increased exports. The report appears to satisfy the measuring stick DOE uses for decisions on natural-gas export permits, Bill Cooper, president of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, told The Hill.   Under the Natural Gas Act, DOE can refuse to honor export applications if it deems them contrary to the public interest. That means exporting natural gas cannot have an adverse effect on the domestic need for that gas.   “This report is evidence that there will not be adverse impacts on the domestic need on the gas that is proposed to be exported. Therefore, the applications are in the public interest and should be granted,” Cooper said.   Overall the report finds little effect on prices in the initial years of exports, but notes a growing impact as years go by and exports grow. From the report: U.S. natural gas prices increase when the U.S. exports LNG. But the global market limits how high U.S. natural gas prices can rise under pressure of LNG exports because importers will not purchase U.S. exports if U.S. wellhead price rises above the cost of competing supplies. In particular, the U.S. natural gas price does not become linked to oil prices in any of the cases examined. Natural gas price changes attributable to LNG exports remain in a relatively narrow range across the entire range of scenarios. Natural gas price increases at the time LNG exports could begin range from zero to $0.33 (2010$/Mcf). The largest price increases that would be observed after 5 more years of potentially growing exports could range from $0.22 to $1.11 (2010$/Mcf). The higher end of the range is reached only under conditions of ample U.S. supplies and low domestic natural gas prices, with smaller price increases when U.S. supplies are more costly and domestic prices higher. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/271233-long-awaited-study-says-gas-exports-would-boost-us-economy-</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354755030830</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 19:50:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354755288139-22</Id><Title>Long-awaited study says gas exports would boost US economy</Title><Msg>Long-awaited study says gas exports would boost US economy By Ben Geman and Zack Colman - 12/05/12 02:55 PM ET A major study commissioned by the Energy Department (DOE) concludes that expanding natural-gas exports would be an economic win for the U.S., a finding that provides a political boost to lawmakers and companies pushing for approval of several applications. “Across all these scenarios, the U.S. was projected to gain net economic benefits from allowing [liquefied natural gas] exports.

Read his own words in his first book "Dreams from My Father". Obama, the Demoncrap Party, and the World Press are cheering while the USA deconstructs.

As the "executive" speaks, viewers see images of extreme weather, such as violent storms and wildfires, that scientists say climate change will intensify. The ad buy is slated to begin next week, but the locations and scope will depend on the online fundraising campaign, said Steve Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International. His group is backing legislation that would strip billions of dollars of tax deductions, royalty incentives and federal fossil fuel research programs. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) offered the legislation but it has not been brought up in committees or on the floor of either chamber. The lawmakers say the bill would save an estimated $113 billion over 10 years. But oil-and-gas companies are pushing back against various Democratic-led efforts to strip the industry’s ability to claim various deductions, such as a lucrative deduction on domestic manufacturing income. The industry has been highly successful in recent years at defeating proposals to nix its tax incentives. The industry’s biggest trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, last month launched new advertisements that say higher taxes would stymie production and hurt the economy. The new ad campaign against Exxon and other oil companies arrives as activists are also pushing colleges and universities to divest their holdings in fossil fuel companies.

EPA, D.C. Cir., No. 12-1238, brief filed 11/30/12). EPA cannot wait for scientific certainty before it sets an air quality standard, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Clean Air Council, and the National Parks Conservation Association said Nov. 30 in an opening brief filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The agency has acknowledged the existing secondary national ambient air quality standards, which were set in 1971, do not adequately protect the environment from the indirect effects of acid rain and other forms of acid deposition. However, in an April 3 final rule at 40 C.F.R. pt. 50, it retained the existing standards, saying it did not have enough information to set new standards and is planning a five-year field pilot program to collect data to help in the future development of a multi-pollutant standard (77 Fed. Reg. 20,218; 55 DEN A-1, 3/22/12). “The statute does not limit EPA's standard-setting duty to situations where data are complete and uncertainties eliminated,” the petitioners told the D.C. Circuit. “Rather, EPA must use its best judgment to specify, based on its review of the relevant factors and advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee, a standard that meets the statutory mandate despite remaining uncertainty.” The petitioners asked the court to vacate the final rule and remand it to the agency to set a new standard within 14 months. Standards Protect Against Direct Effects. EPA sets primary national ambient air quality standards to protect public health and secondary standards to protect the environment and public welfare. The 1971 secondary standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are intended to protect the environment against the direct effects of the pollutants, not the indirect effects of acid rain and other forms of acid deposition. Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are the primary precursors to acid rain. The petitioners said the Clean Air Act requires EPA to set secondary standards that protect against any known or anticipated adverse effects on public welfare. The brief said the agency retained standards that it “concedes do not provide requisite protection against acknowledged harm from deposition of air pollutants. The agency's violation of the statute could not be clearer.” The secondary standard for nitrogen dioxide is 0.053 part per million, averaged annually. The standard for sulfur dioxide is 0.5 ppm, averaged over three hours and not to be exceeded more than once annually. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson signed the final rule March 20 under the terms of a 2007 consent decree that resolved a lawsuit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity over EPA's inaction on reviewing the standards (Center for Biological Diversity v. Jackson, D.D.C, No. 05-1814, notice filed 8/30/12). Reasoning Not Explained. In a 2011 policy assessment, EPA staff recommended that revisions to the secondary standards be based on maintaining an acid-neutralizing capacity in the environment between 20 microequivalents and 75 microequivalents per liter. The petitioners also argued that EPA did not adequately explain why data gaps and modeling uncertainties are so profound to prevent it from setting a standard. The brief said neither EPA's staff nor its independent science advisers, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, recommended against setting a new standard. “Put simply, the Administrator's excuses cannot be squared with the fact that the Scientific Advisory Committee and EPA's own staff explicitly laid out, in great detail, an ample basis for setting a standard providing requisite protection from aquatic acidification,” the brief said. The brief said EPA staff analyzed acid-sensitive regions at various forms and levels in a range of the possible standards and found between eight and 25 regions would not meet the standard.

The Outpost in Minden, however, will still sell fuel—E10 (regular gasoline), E85, #$%$ B20 and B50 in the winter months and B99 in summer months. Clients will be able to use credit or debit cards to pay at the pump 24/7. Come next year, the company will focus on wholesale biodiesel sales to its six retail outlets: Bently Biofuels Outpost in Minden, Nev.; Allied Washoe in Reno, Nev.; Sacramento Biodiesel Network in Sacramento, Calif.; The Biofuel Oasis in Berkley, Calif.; and Dogpatch Biofuels and People’s Fuel Cooperative, both in San Francisco. Bently Biofuels is also offering delivery of B20 home heating oil. Off-road red dye B20 and B50 will continue to be available, the company said. In other company news, Donald E. Bently passed away this October and his son Christopher Bently has taken the helm of the Bently family of companies. Christopher has led the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Designs (LEED) certification of several buildings in the company’s portfolio, and he looks forward to increasing involvement in the Minden, Nev., area in 2013. Bently Biofuels has been producing biodiesel from seed and recycled cooking oil since 2005. biodieselmagazineDOTcom/articles/8834/bently-closes-retail-store-to-focus-on-wholesale-home-delivery</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354757629555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:33:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354767316630-28</Id><Topic><Title>Tulip Mania Market</Title><Username>romanismrules</Username><Timestamp>1354735395707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:23:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have it your way............................................</Msg><Username>rewindstevens</Username><Timestamp>1354767316630</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354768803185-29</Id><Title>Why 2013 will be a good year for biodiesel</Title><Msg>Why 2013 will be a good year for biodiesel Six reasons why the U.S. biodiesel industry should have a monumental year in 2013 By Ron Kotrba | December 05, 2012 Much sensationalized chatter has circulated in recent news reports about biodiesel demand slowing down this quarter, despite production volumes released by the EPA indicate that 83 million gallons of U.S. biodiesel was produced in October. While this is a decline from earlier months, it’s not in my mind the makings of sordid tales by misinformed journalists overzealously ringing the alarm bells about the so-called downfall of the biodiesel industry. It is, rather, simple market-based economics driving the temporary slowdown. We are still looking at strong year-to-date totals of 925 million gallons with two months left in the calendar year. While it is possible, if not likely, demand and production will remain unimpressive until the end of the reporting year (Feb. 28), I list below six reasons why 2013 could be a very good year for biodiesel. 1) RFS intact. The renewable fuel standard (RFS) has been under attack all year as several states backed by very strong lobby organizations petitioned EPA to waive the RFS. After serious consideration, EPA denied those requests, leaving the RFS intact—even if it’s only “for now”—providing certainty to the renewable fuel markets. 2) Biodiesel RVO increase. Before the EPA ruled on the RFS waiver requests, it had finalized the 2013 biomass-based diesel volume obligation at 1.28 billion gallons, up 28 percent from the floor (and this year’s volume requirement) of 1 billion gallons. The move was lauded by the industry but as EPA’s decision on the RFS waiver requests loomed, the excitement was buffered. Now that the RFS is to remain intact with the significant increase in the biomass-based diesel category, the industry can perform at greater capacity under the additional certainty. This increase is both unprecedented, and sets a new precedent. To put this in perspective, the 2013 biodiesel RVO is 130 million gallons more than that for the combined 2009-‘10 program years, and 280 million gallons more than this year’s. If you forgot where we started from in RFS2, in 2009 the RVO was 500 million gallons; in 2010, 650 million gallons; in 2011, 800 million gallons; this year, 1 billion gallons; and next year, 1.28 billion gallons. By anyone’s estimation, that is significant growth. 3) RIN integrity. After a year filled with reports of renewable identification number (RIN) credit fraud culminating in congressional hearings prompting EPA to restructure its RIN program, with input from all parties involved, progress is being made to provide the necessary tools to prevent fraud, providing obligated parties, RIN traders and biodiesel producers more marketplace certainty and stability in 2013. EPA recently released its draft quality assurance plan guidelines, and the agency is expected to release its proposed rule by year’s end. Knowing it is on an expedited path, there is good reason to believe that the agency’s final rule will be released by the 2012 reporting year deadline, or shortly thereafter. 4) Pathways. EPA is expected to make decisions on feedstock pathways under RFS2 in the coming year, the next most likely being palm oil. It’s been under consideration by the agency for some time, and any decision it makes—to approve or disapprove palm oil biodiesel based on greenhouse gas emissions reductions compared to petroleum diesel—will reduce some of the unknowns that currently exist. 5) 2014 RVO proposal. EPA is expected to come out with its 2014 RVO proposal at some point in the near future (if the agency is on time with its release); will we see another big increase? Despite the fact that the oil lobby is suing EPA to reverse its 2013 RVO, you can bet the National Biodiesel Board, backed by sound feedstock and economic data, is working even harder to achieve another milestone jump in the biodiesel carve-out for the 2014 calendar year. 6) Tax credit? And lastly, it is still possible, although maybe not probable at this point, that the $1 per gallon biodiesel tax credit will pass in an extenders package by end of year, retroactively as it did in late 2010. biodieselmagazineDOTcom/articles/8831/why-2013-will-be-a-good-year-for-biodiesel</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354768803185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:40:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354768894125-30</Id><Title>Stock</Title><Msg>Why does this dog of a stock crump every day at 3:30?</Msg><Username>dlavine78</Username><Timestamp>1354768894125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:41:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354769665713-31</Id><Topic><Title>You Can Always Tell a German</Title><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1354618001145</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 05:46:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You might consider visiting Germany and see for yourself which is the richer. I think the stats show Germany is at this point, although for the Germanic &amp; Anglo population of America it is probably a tie. This winter I'm on a mission to see how much an American girl can spend when unleashed in Bavaria and the der Schwarzwaldt in winter - it will be fun. Maybe she will want to become German for good and then I won't have to go back to America so often. I don't think you really need to bother about your German skills, as the Fatherland takes special care to educate its youth, much more thoroughly than American schools. You would fit in fine.
