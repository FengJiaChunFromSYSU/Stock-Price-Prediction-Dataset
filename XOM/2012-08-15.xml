Premier Christy Clark and provincial NDP Leader Adrian Dix are both talking tough on the subject of dashing the Northern Gateway oil pipeline, notably, without saying how they’d do it. This, when the how of the matter surely is every bit as relevant as the what. After all, Clark and Dix are contemplating putting in peril something the federal government has designated as a vital strategic imperative for Canada. Northern Gateway would enable oil exports from Canada’s West Coast for the purposes of trade diversification. Yet, the premier has merely offered the prospect of “no pipeline” should Alberta refuse talks on sharing the project’s spoils. And Dix says: “We’re looking at all of the options the province might use to deal with the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline.” B.C.’s NDP leader reportedly has a legal team working on strategies. But to date, no details. Neither leader wants to level a threat they legally can’t carry through on. Hence, the vagueness around what precise course of action they’d follow. There are those who maintain B.C.’s bluster is just that, that the province in fact lacks legal authority to thwart the 1,200-kilometre pipeline and tanker port at Kitimat should it be approved by regulators and the feds next year. Ottawa does appear to have a big say on Gateway; following an omnibus budget bill last spring, the cabinet can go so far as to overrule a negative decision on the project by the federal regulators. Moreover, as Calgary political scientist and former Stephen Harper operative Tom Flanagan wrote recently, by virtue of Section 92(10), subsection (a) of the Constitution, Ottawa has power over railways, canals and “other works and undertakings” — which Flanagan interprets, in modern times, to include pipelines. This, he asserts, gives Ottawa authority to overrule any B.C. bid to thwart Northern Gateway. Flanagan writes the feds also could use the “declaratory power” of subsection (c) to declare a work necessary for the general advantage of Canada. The Constitution’s federal powers potentially are “quite all-encompassing,” agrees former senior B.C. bureaucrat Tex Enemark. But, note, the feds never used such powers back in the 1960s to help Newfoundland route its hydro power through Quebec. Ottawa demurred for political reasons, relating to Quebecois sensitivities. And politics always are at play in such matters. Let’s not forget, the prime minister wins a lot of Conservative seats in B.C.

But that “does not necessarily mean the federal government has the unconditional right to impose those projects on the provinces.” She believes, based on past decisions, the Supreme Court probably wouldn’t uphold a federal attempt to impose Gateway on northern B.C. residents, “given that numerous alternatives exist” by way of other routes. Then there’s the added legal complication of aboriginal groups being among those northern B.C. residents. “It is dumb to suggest that Harper would so unnecessarily use political capital trying to ram Gateway through, especially when there is such a low probability that the Supreme Court would uphold any such federal decision,” she said. Further, Donnelly notes that B.C. can impose on Enbridge a variety of daunting measures — requirements for permits, licences and taxes — that might discourage or economically defeat the $6-billion project. What’s becoming clear is even those in the know do not concur on the legalities surrounding the possibility of Ottawa forcing Gateway on B.C. Although Harper recently insisted the ultimate determinant will be purely the science involved, that’s a pipe dream. Politics and court rulings will prevail.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345043717000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345044664000-8</Id><Topic><Title>XOM Flopping like a Fish out of Water.

Since then, retail prices have increased more than 36 cents to reach $3.72 per gallon on August 13 (Figure 1). The major driver behind this increase is the strength in the global crude oil market; the price of Brent crude oil, the crude price linked most closely to U.S. product prices over the past 18 months, has climbed more than $25 per barrel since late June. However, crude oil price increases are not the only factor behind the rise in gasoline prices. Outages at several U.S. refineries have caused tightness in gasoline markets and led to regional divergence in retail prices. As crude oil is the major cost component of retail gasoline, crude oil price changes are typically reflected in price changes at the pump. Since reaching a year-to-date low of $89 per barrel in late June, the spot price of Brent has steadily increased, settling at $114 per barrel on August 14. Crude oil prices have risen since the start of July on expectations that policymakers in the European Union, China, and the United States would provide additional economic stimulus to counteract slowing growth. Additionally, the imposition of sanctions on Iran, threats by that country to block oil from transiting the Strait of Hormuz, the possibility that Israel might act unilaterally against Iran's nuclear facilities, and other continuing conflicts in the Middle East have triggered market anxiety and prompted upward price pressure. More recently, concerns about reduced production in the North Sea (where Brent crude is produced) due to maintenance activity, along with some stronger-than-expected economic data releases in the United States, have also supported higher crude oil prices. Refinery outages in the United States have also contributed to tightness in the wholesale gasoline market. In late July, issues at several refineries in the Midwest increased pressure on Chicago wholesale gasoline prices. This situation was exacerbated when a spill on Enbridge's Line 14, which delivers crude oil from Canada to refineries in the Chicago area, caused a closure of the pipeline. Spot prices for conventional gasoline in Chicago spiked from $2.69 per gallon on July 25 to $3.29 per gallon on August 1. While wholesale prices since have retreated somewhat following Line 14's reopening, retail prices in the Midwest (PADD2), as of August 13, remain 27 cents per gallon above July 30 levels. The increase in Midwest prices from July 30 to August 6 is the third largest one-week increase in the region since the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) began tracking those data in 1992, exceeded only by increases that coincided with hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. An August 6 fire at Chevron's 245,300-barrel-per-day (bbl/d) Richmond, California refinery pushed wholesale prices higher on the West Coast. On news of the fire, Los Angeles spot prices increased more than 32 cents per gallon from $2.88 per gallon on August 6 to $3.21 per gallon on August 7. However, reports that gasoline-producing units at the Richmond refinery could possibly continue to run, along with market slack due to recent export flow from the West Coast, tempered increases in the Los Angeles spot market. By week's end, prices in Los Angeles had shed about 7 cents per gallon from the peak on August 7. Retail gasoline prices in California jumped 23 cents per gallon from August 6 to hit $4.10 per gallon on August 13. http://www.eia.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345056289000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:44:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345056315000-10</Id><Topic><Title>This Week In Petroleum August 15, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345056289000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:44:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trade press reports currently indicate the crude distillation unit at the refinery could be down four to six months. The impact on gasoline prices will depend on the extent to which the refinery's secondary gasoline-producing units continue to operate, the flexibility of other West Coast refineries (including Chevron's El Segundo refinery) to produce additional gasoline, and the availability of gasoline supplies from outside the region. Absent additional refinery outages, and once current outages are addressed, EIA expects average retail gasoline prices to ease through the end of 2012. In its August Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA projects the average U.S. retail gasoline price will be $3.48 per gallon in September and continue to fall, reaching $3.25 per gallon by the end of the year. With Brent projected to fall from its current price level to average about $102 per barrel over the last four months of the year, lower crude oil costs are expected to pass through to retail gasoline prices. However, regional disparities in gasoline prices are expected to remain, with December retail prices expected to range between an average of $3.52 per gallon on the West Coast (PADD 5) and $3.09 per gallon on the Gulf Coast (PADD 3). Forecasting prices involves a high degree of uncertainty. The price structure of futures and options traded for New York Harbor Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) gasoline provides an indication of the uncertainty expected by futures market participants. The November 2012 RBOB futures contract averaged $2.56 per gallon for the five trading days ending August 2 and has a probability of exceeding $2.80 per gallon (equivalent to a retail price of about $3.50 per gallon) at expiration of approximately 26 percent (Figure 2). The same contract as of the five trading days ending June 1 had a 23 percent probability of exceeding a retail price of $3.50 per gallon. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices increase for the 6th consecutive week The U.S. average retail price of regular gasoline increased eight cents this week to $3.72 per gallon, 12 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time. This is the first time since April 16, 2012 that the average U.S. retail price is higher compared to the same time last year. The largest increase came on the West Coast, where the price is up 19 cents to $3.95 per gallon. The East Coast and Gulf Coast prices are both up eight cents to $3.68 per gallon and $3.49 per gallon, respectively. The average Rocky Mountain price is $3.50 per gallon, an increase of four cents from last week. Rounding out the regions, the Midwest price saw the smallest increase, at two cents, to reach $3.79 per gallon.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345056315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345056323000-11</Id><Topic><Title>This Week In Petroleum August 15, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345056289000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:44:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The national average diesel fuel price increased 12 cents to $3.97 per gallon, 13 cents per gallon higher than last year at this time.

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) completed its review of the rule last week, setting it up for the Interior Department to release. Industry has already started implementing the “emergency” safety measures, which Interior put in place after the 2010 BP oil spill. But a provision in that interim rule might let Interior interpret safety actions that “should” be undertaken into those that “must,” an American Petroleum Institute (API) official told reporters Wednesday. Though Interior has said it would resolve that issue when it finalizes the rule, API Group Director of Upstream and Industry Operations Erik Milito said that remains to be seen. Milito noted that the word "should" occurred 14,000 times in the rule. Changing it to "must" would add risk in some cases, he said, by requiring oil and gas companies to perform unnecessary tasks. Forcing drillers to unnecessarily repeat tasks that involve heavy lifting is one of those potential harms, Milito said. Gratuitous pressure testing requirements could also weaken safety measures, he said. Milito said he does not expect many differences between the interim and final rules. But remedying the “should to must” provision, as Milito called it, is essential. “I’m confident, but until we see the final language we’re going to have outstanding concerns,” he said. The interim rule, first issued in late September 2010, includes new standards for well designs, requires third-party verification that subsea “blowout preventers” can close off drill-pipes and many other measures. http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/243847-api-drilling-safety-rule-might-increase-risk-in-some-cases</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345081323000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:42:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345084670000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending August 10, 2012</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345041646000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:40:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Weekly U.S. Fuel Ethanol/Livestock Feed Production 8/10/2012 http://ethanolrfa.org/pages/weekly-ethanol-feed-production ------------------------- Ethanol production rises for the third consecutive week, Ethanol stocks sink for the second consecutive week and Ethanol demand drops to just 8.80% of gasoline demand.</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345084670000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 22:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345085130000-14</Id><Title>Enbridge depiction of clear tanker route sparks outrage</Title><Msg>Enbridge depiction of clear tanker route sparks outrage Judith Lavoie, The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2012 6:58PM PDT Last Updated Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2012 7:34PM PDT VICTORIA -- About 1,000 square kilometres of islands have disappeared from Douglas Channel in an animated depiction of Enbridge Inc.'s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline and tanker route. The project would send bitumen by pipeline from Alberta's oilsands to Kitimat, where it would be loaded onto tankers for export to Asia. A video on the Enbridge website shows Douglas Channel as a wide open funnel leading from Kitimat to the Pacific, omitting the narrow channels, islands and rocky outcrops that make up the potential tanker access route. The view of Douglas Channel sprang to public attention after Lori Waters, a Vancouver Island researcher and owner of a biomedical communications company, created overlays and maps showing the real Douglas Channel and posted the images on Facebook. Reaction against Enbridge - which is fighting an image problem because of recent pipeline spills - was swift. "I find the pictures shocking. It's reprehensible behaviour," said University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver. "These images are disturbing enough to make me no longer trust anything coming from Enbridge. It's utterly shameful," he said. However, Enbridge said the video is an obvious animation and contains a disclaimer that says it is "broadly representational." "That video is meant to be for illustrative purposes only. It's not meant to be to scale. It's meant to illustrate the pipeline route, not the marine aspects of the operation," said Enbridge spokesman Todd Nogier. "There's a disclaimer at the end because it's really clear this is meant to be illustrative," he said. The video is meant to be pleasing to the eye, but viewers would not mistake it for a detailed map, Nogier said. A tanker safety video showing Douglas Channel in detail and to scale, together with technical reports on every aspect of the marine route, are on the Enbridge website, he said. "If they are trying to conclude that we are trying to mislead people, nothing could be further from the truth. There's lots of information there. It's all there and it's all for public viewing," Nogier said. However, groups opposed to the proposed pipeline and tanker project believe the video is an attempt to mislead. The Enbridge view of Douglas Channel would make anyone who knows the area chuckle, said Eric Swanson of the Dogwood Initiative. "In reality, it's a twisting path through rocky islands and granite outcroppings, including 90 degree turns, but it's shown as a sparkly, open channel," he said. "They are certainly painting a rosy picture of a very complicated and dangerous waterway." The video fits with recent Enbridge advertising campaigns, Swanson said. "It's more hyper-positive imagery because they know they have a problem because of the spills," he said. Josh Paterson, a staff lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law, said the promotional video skirts the line on fair advertising. "That image really misrepresents the reality, which is that that channel is jam-packed with islands," Paterson said. "You are really not supposed to omit big pieces of information like that and British Columbians should look at the images and decide how far they are willing to trust the company, regardless of what disclaimer they put on the video, Paterson said. "A comparison of their images with the actual really raises questions about the trustworthiness of what they are telling people in B.C.," he said. http://bc.ctvnews.ca/enbridge-depiction-of-clear-tanker-route-sparks-outrage-1.916234</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1345085130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 22:45:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
