No more huge sums of money spent for contractors in Afghanistan or any place where we are in an armed conflict. These contractors get huge salaries while our service men and women earn barely enough to survive. $30 Billion yr 4. Why not negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D? $100 Billion yr 5. Get out of the Wars NOW. 100 billion year 6. Raise the cap on FICA/SS. The cap is now $113,000. it could be raised to $500,000. $10 Billion yr 7.CUT THE MILITARY Bring back our service men and women from places like Japan, Germany and other WW II locations. 20 Billion a year. 8. Stop the huge pensions for our Senators and Representatives. Most are quite wealthy in their own right, and if they are not, let them go back to their previous professions. Being an elected official is a privilege. Perhaps THEY should depend upon Medicare and SS as we do. $ ? but would SAVE MONEY !!! 9.Let us have a Medicare for ALL type of medical care in this country. In that way both the frail elderly and those who are younger and in better health, requiring less medical/surgical care would be under that plan. It would eliminate the waste that occurs with our present insurance based health care. Medicare has a 2% cost whereas insurance companies have a 20% cost of operation. $100 Billion a year About like 450 Billion in cuts give or take then add 100 billion a year for jobs you have like $350 in CUTS in 10 years thats about over 2.5 Trillion in cuts. I'm sure we could do more cuts to save. LONG TERM COST of just $100 Billion a year to solve our job crisis. JOBS JOBS JOBS !!! A stimulus package so that we can repair our crumbling infrastructure. Lets make a deal with natural gas companies that we can create jobs safe also we should hire more teachers, fire fighters,and police officers.

The new facility based in Dandenong, located just outside of Melbourne, will see waste cooking oil converted as biodiesel to fuel McDonald’s vehicle fleet right across Victoria. The State Government of Victoria’s Minister for Innovation, Services and Small Business, Louise Asher, officially launched the site in conjunction with representatives from McDonald’s Australia and Karl W. Feilder, CEO and Chairman of Neutral Fuels. Minister Asher welcomed Neutral Fuels’ investment and innovation into Victoria, saying: “Neutral Fuels originally developed this process in the Middle East where it has been very successful and it is now expanding into Victoria. This investment will create new jobs and add to the vast range of innovative companies we have in Victoria.” “Neutral Fuels has been working very closely with the Victorian Government Business Office in Dubai after I met with the company as part of a trade delegation that I led to the UAE earlier this year. “The Victorian government has also assisted Neutral Fuels with site identification, planning and regulatory requirements to assist in bringing this innovative project to Victoria. “The realisation of Neutral Foods investing in Victoria is a clear example of the benefits of our International Engagement Strategy which focuses on seeking investment opportunities into Victoria from international markets, such as the UAE, that have been identified as having further interest in Victorian investment. “I congratulate McDonald’s in supporting innovative clean technology in Victoria, and I hope this example encourages other companies to think of these types of innovations and investment into our State,” she added. Neutral Fuels now has waste collection sites at 106 McDonald’s restaurants across Victoria with plans in place to service the remaining 105 restaurants by early 2013. The Victorian Government Business Office has worked closely with Neutral Fuels to help facilitate the partnership with McDonald’s Australia. In July last year, Neutral Fuels undertook a pilot program with McDonald’s Middle East to test a process for converting waste cooking oil collected from McDonald’s restaurants into biodiesel for use in McDonald’s delivery vehicles. The first facility was located in the Dubai Investment Park, with the capacity to produce one million litres per annum. Following the success of the pilot program, Neutral Fuels has now been commissioned to roll out 16 additional bio-fuel production facilities over the next three years. Three of these facilities will be in Australia, with the first now established in Dandenong, Victoria. Melbourne has been chosen given it is a strong market for McDonald’s in the geographical region of Asia Pacific, Middle East &amp; Africa (APMEA). John Butler, Commissioner to the Middle East and North Africa for the State Government of Victoria, said: “Victoria offers a competitive and dynamic business environment, along with a skilled and innovative workforce. We have worked very closely with Neutral Fuels to help make their investment into the State a seamless one and we are proud to be welcoming them to Victoria.” “There has been a lot of hard work and investment from both sides to make this happen and we now look forward to watching the growth of Neutral Fuels and supporting their future trade and investment plans in our State.” emirates247DOTcom/business/economy-finance/dubai-firm-neutral-fuels-expands-to-australia-2012-12-18-1DOT487827</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355842495759</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 09:54:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355842564734-7</Id><Topic><Title>McDonalds Fleet Traveled 800,000 Miles With Recycled Biofuel</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355728995469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 02:23:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Expansion!

It is falling in the United States, and oil is coming in quantity now with millions more in capacity coming... It is much lower in Iraq than other places It is low in Libya and that is opening up Brazil's oil is closer to $50 and there will be several million more barrels per day coming there Saudi Arabia can bring oil on for around $30 per daily barrel. Russia and Europe have enormous oil resources when shale-gas/oil comes The Sahara has vast resources which oil companies will be moving in to... The premise that oil production costs are "rising" is wrong. They are rising in the oil depleted fields companies like Exxon Mobil have invested heavily in, but that is not the case in other places of the world. Technology is barreling ahead too and will only lower costs even more. You should keep in mind, too, that the US uses over twice as much oil as a country like Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark.... The reason that occurs is simply poor governance. The US has been subsidizing rural and suburban living for over half a century with Fannie, Freddie, Farm Aid, and other waste. An urbanized society does not require as much oil... Estimates for China's potential are wildly exaggerated too. The Chinese will trend toward the German/French model of urban planning, not the American model of wholesale waste aka free market development.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355843821376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:17:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355844757233-10</Id><Topic><Title>Obama panic Attack</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1355666029062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 08:53:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are the true meaning of a #$%$ #$%$</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1355844757233</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:32:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355844782481-11</Id><Topic><Title>HERE ARE SOME SPENDING CUTS WE CAN START !!!!</Title><Username>pra11pra11</Username><Timestamp>1355830738512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 06:38:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those are good goals.

An Energy Department report last week showed ethanol stockpiles gained 687,000 barrels to 20 million in the seven days ended Dec. 7, the highest for this time of year since at least 2010, when the department began collecting data. As of Dec. 6, corn sales for delivery before Sept. 1 dropped 46 percent to 12.488 million tons from a year earlier, the Agriculture Department reported. “Ethanol inventories are oversupplied on a seasonal basis and this is putting slight downward pressure on the front of the ethanol curve,” said Mike Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.277 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price since Sept. 27. The difference between ethanol and gasoline widened to 37.76 cents based on settlement prices, the largest gap since Oct. 17 and up from 36.41 Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slid 3 cents to $2.43 cents a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive declined 1.5 cents to $2.335, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1 cent to $2.275 a gallon and in New York the biofuel gained 3 cents to $2.40. Gasoline for January delivery slumped 0.75 cent to settle at $2.6546 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Corn for March delivery declined 0.9 percent to close at $7.24 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest drop since Dec. 10. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-17/ethanol-falls-to-widest-discount-to-gasoline-in-2-months.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355844816972</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:33:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355845132279-13</Id><Title>Ethanol Falls to Widest Discount to Gasoline in 2 Months</Title><Msg>Ethanol Falls to Widest Discount to Gasoline in 2 Months By Christine Harvey - Dec 17, 2012 2:39 PM MT. 0 Comments Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened to the largest gap in two months as inventories of the fuel additive rose to a seasonal high and corn prices slumped on slowing demand.

I mentioned how when I spoke with her that I could hear her weeping throughout the discussion. I tried to comfort her by saying that I understand she would never want what happened in CT to occur then went on to state the reason for my call. I wanted to tell her that I as a Progressive did not want to take anyone's guns but I thought that the sales of assault weapons were unnecessary in a civilized society. I asked her to advise the ILI that their lobbying efforts in favor of these weapons is wrong. Now we all know the NRA is just another corporate profit machine but they are largely responsible for a great deal of the fear that has been pushed on our society in the past 30 odd years which has led to our current state of enormous violence in the USA. They are not solely to blame but they hold a huge responsibility. It's time to crush them with a popular and yes democratic uprising that forces our cowardly media not to allow their opinions to be aired as equivalence but pushes their opinions into the realm for which they are truly meant. Which is nothing more than profiteering by using fear. By propagating death and destruction then claiming only more death and destruction is the answer. They are wrong. We have proof of just how wrong they are every day. The media needs to stop cowering to these weasels and hold them up as the psychopaths that they are.</Msg><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1355848161962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 11:29:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355852025112-21</Id><Topic><Title>Every NRA Member Is A Coward!

The Northerners who visited and studied with Bismarck, and traveled in the circles he traveled in, and read what he read, and saw the truth, were good students, and knew how to handle their own difficulties at home, difficulties encountered in setting up a powerful Federal government - one that could ensure the rights of all and not just the select few who preferred the status quo.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1355858616774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 14:23:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355858669807-29</Id><Topic><Title>Every NRA Member Is A Coward!

The point is to show that it is possible to enforce gun control, something some think cannot be done. That is the point of the example. And no the confiscation of a bunch of obsolete weapons after a war, something that is quite common in wars, did not cause World War II. The problem came from the reparations provisions that destroyed the German currency, and turned Europe into a economic and political madhouse after the war. Creating a bunch of artificial weak states out of a once ordered economic zone in central and eastern Europe also did not help much either. All manner of revolutionary groups came to power thanks to those problems. One could just as easily blame American meddling in the war, and turning the losers of the war into the winners, as a cause of the Versailles Treaty and repeat of the war a generation later...

The industry group, in a complaint filed yesterday in state court in Greeley, Colorado, claims the resolution deprives land owners of property-development rights and conflicts with state law allowing the practice. “The hydraulic fracturing ban in Longmont effectively stops oil and gas development,” COGA President Tisha Schuller said in a statement yesterday announcing the filing. “There is clear legal precedent in Colorado that the ban is illegal and we expect it to be overturned by the courts.” The group provided a copy of the complaint to Bloomberg News and the court’s clerk confirmed that it was filed. Rigo Leal, the city’s public information officer, said in a phone interview today that the municipality doesn’t comment on pending litigation. ‘Whatever It Takes’ “The city council is on record as being committed to defending this lawsuit, whatever it takes,” he said. Longmont voters approved the resolution on Nov. 6. The city, with a population of 86,270, according to 2010 U.S. Census figures, is about 37 miles (59 kilometers) north of Denver. Its oil and gas minerals are valued at $500 million, according to Denver-based COGA. Because the city owns 90 percent of the mineral rights within its boundaries, its taxpayers are losing access to an estimated $90 million in potential royalties, the group claimed. The case is Colorado Oil &amp; Gas Association v. City of Longmont, 2012-cv-960, Weld County, Colorado, District Court (Greeley). bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-18/colorado-city-sued-by-oil-industry-group-for-fracking-ban.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355879408903</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 20:10:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355879956108-44</Id><Title>Sen. Boxer firms up plans for weekly ‘climate change clearinghouse'</Title><Msg>Sen. Boxer firms up plans for weekly ‘climate change clearinghouse' By Ben Geman - 12/18/12 04:08 PM ET Senate Democrats — and any interested Republicans — will huddle weekly on climate change in the next Congress in an “open forum” to help craft and support legislation, the plan’s architect said. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) told The Hill on Tuesday that the “climate change clearinghouse” will also focus on working with the Obama administration and keeping members of abreast of the latest science. Boxer said she will co-chair the clearinghouse alongside the chairmen of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Boxer first announced the idea earlier in December, and it crystallized further at a meeting Tuesday, she said. “We are going to review the latest information, we are going to work on supporting a major bill, we are also going to work on various smaller provisions that we think will move us forward and focus on green jobs, energy efficiency and making sure that we get the carbon out of the air, and work with the administration on some executive stuff,” she said in the Capitol. “So I think it is going to be a very major and important clearinghouse because as the science comes in, we are going to take a look at that science so that we are all up to date,” Boxer added. She said it would be an “open forum” that will provide lawmakers a chance to raise topics of interest to them — such as reports from their states and actions in state legislatures — and ask questions too. “It is a place where people can come to give information, to get information, to ask questions of staff. We will have a good staff presence there,” Boxer said. Asked about the plan to develop a “major bill,” Boxer said it would address both curbing carbon emissions and ways to “harden our infrastructure to protect our people against extreme weather,” and include energy efficiency provisions and other measures. But she did not provide details about how provisions to cut emissions might be crafted. Cap-and-trade plans have collapsed on Capitol Hill, and carbon tax proposals, while generating buzz in policy and media circles, have not gained traction there either. Boxer said she hopes that some Republicans will take part in the clearinghouse. Boxer said she has spoken with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) about whether Collins will reintroduce the climate bill that she floated in late 2009 with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). The Collins-Cantwell plan would place a declining limit on the amount of carbon from fossil energy sources in U.S. commerce, and</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355879956108</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 20:19:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355885713001-45</Id><Title>first Arab ethanol will be produced &amp; exported to Europe &amp; North America</Title><Msg>15:11 December 18, 2012 Saudi firm to invest $650m on sugar, ethanol in Sudan Sinnar state signed a partnership with the Saudi Tala Company to produce sugar, ethanol and bio-fuel in Sinnar state from the Jatropha tree to be cultivated in an area estimated at 165,000 acres at a cost of $650 million. Terhab Company for production of brick blocks was also launched in the presence of the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Urban Development Dr. Babikir Mohamed, Saudi Ambassador to Sudan and several state officials. Khalid Al Deyaee, manager of Tala Company, said that the company’s Sinnar subsidiary is made up of a sugar factory, ethanol factory and bio-fuel factory. The Jatropha plant is cultivated in 156,000 acres at a cost of $650 million. It is the biggest factory where the first Arab ethanol will be produced and exported to Europe and North America, he said. The project will also benefit local communities. Dr. Esameldine Khidir, manager of Terhab Company for Agricultural and Animal Production, said the machine for brick blocks is the first of its kind in the Middle East. The machine represents a “turnkey factory” that produces more than 6,000 brick blocks per day, he said. It does not require professional operators and it is not costly, he added. He said in future the company will further improve its production to slowly replace kilns through cooperation with banks, graduate employment projection and workers unions. Dr. Babikir lauded the Terhab Company’s experience which will contribute a great deal toward resolving the problem of building materials in Sudan and will enable rural and vulnerable communities to overcome the impact of climate change.

It’s thanks to three television commercials airing to promote the benefits of Bioheat. Bioheat is heating oil blended with biodiesel, a renewable fuel. The National Biodiesel Board has worked to encourage consumers and oilheat dealers alike to adopt Bioheat in place of traditional home heating oil for years, but the new television commercials aim to speed up that process by generating more consumer demand. The commercials began running throughout the Northeast in late November, and will run for the next few months during local newscasts and football pregame shows in markets such as Boston, New York City and Hartford, Conn. The ads highlight the benefits of Bioheat, including greater energy independence, supporting American Jobs, and “making the air in your home and town cleaner.” In New York City, one of the commercials congratulates the city on using 2 percent biodiesel in all of its heating oil, thanks to a law that took effect in October. The ads proclaim New York City “Proud 2B2,” a play on the B2 requirement. This is the first advertising campaign involving television commercials for Bioheat. “Strong imagery supporting our message is an biodieselmagazineDOTcom/articles/8845/new-television-campaign-shows-the-cool-side-of-bioheat</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355886031535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:00:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355886283332-47</Id><Title>Brazil Said to Plan Higher Ethanol Blend as Early as May</Title><Msg>Brazil Said to Plan Higher Ethanol Blend as Early as May By Mario Sergio Lima - Dec 18, 2012 8:03 AM MT. 0 Comments Brazil, the world’s biggest sugar- cane grower, is considering raising the amount of ethanol mixed with gasoline as early as May as millers are forecast to process a record crop next year, a government official familiar with the plan said. The mandatory ethanol blend in fuel sold at Brazilian service stations would rise to 25 percent from 20 percent now, said the official, who asked not to be named because he’s not authorized to discuss the plan publicly. Mills in the country process most of the sugar-cane crop into sweetener and fuel between April and November. Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil’s state-run oil producer, has been importing gasoline and selling it below cost this year after fuel demand in the world’s second-largest emerging economy exceeded domestic supplies. Brazil lowered the ethanol blend to 20 percent from 25 percent in October 2011 after rainfall delayed sugar-cane harvesting and reduced crop yields. Brazil’s finance and energy ministries declined to comment in e-mailed responses to questions. A record sugar-cane crop next year means ethanol production in Brazil’s Center South region will rise to a three-year high of 23.7 billion liters (6.3 billion gallons), Pedro Mizutani, head of sugar and ethanol at Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Cosan SA Industria &amp; Comercio’s Raizen venture, said in a Dec. 13 interview. Raizen is the world’s largest sugar-cane processor. Record Crop Sugar-cane output in the region will rise to a record 580 million metric tons, while production of the sweetener made from the tropical plant will increase to an all-time high of 36 million tons, Mizutani said. The Center South produces about 90 percent of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol. Sugar futures have slumped 40 percent in the past two years after Brazil and India, the largest producers, increased output of the sweetener. The contract for March delivery fell 1.1 percent to 19.20 cents a pound at 10:01 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. bloombergDOTcom/news/2012-12-18/brazil-said-to-plan-higher-ethanol-blend-as-early-as-may.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355886283332</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:04:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355890054762-48</Id><Topic><Title>Every NRA Member Is A Coward!
