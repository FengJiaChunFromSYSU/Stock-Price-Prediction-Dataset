The United States is already Alberta's biggest customer for our oil. The Keystone XL pipeline will further cement the strong bond between Alberta and the U.S. and is important in developing a safe, secure North American energy partnership. We know there are questions about Alberta's oil sands and the heavy oil they produce, which already fills pipelines supplying America as well as proposed new pipelines like Keystone XL. I'm proud to say Alberta applauds and shares the president's strong desire to address climate change and we're already taking action. The president's comments during his recent State of the Union address are fully in sync with Alberta's commitment to strong environmental policy, clean technology development, a healthy energy sector, economic growth and plentiful job opportunities for the middle class. The challenge for policy and decision makers on both sides of the border is striking the right balance and moving our countries forward, together. We stand ready to demonstrate our strong track record on responsible oil sands development. And we are prepared to work with our federal government and our American friends to push the bar higher in addressing climate change. Through our policies and our actions past, present and future, Americans should feel confident that Alberta is the safest, most secure and responsible energy supplier to the U.S. The same cannot be said for the other foreign countries and regimes that currently feed U.S. energy demand. Americans should also understand that Alberta, and specifically projects like Keystone XL, are not looking for a free pass. Far from it. We want to be an enabler of good solutions that achieve the outcomes that all Americans and Canadians are looking for. I'm proud to say, Alberta is already leading the way. We were the first place in North America to require by law all large industry across all sectors to take action on greenhouse gas emissions. We have a $15 price per ton on carbon for those who do not meet legislated limits. We take the revenue generated from this levy and direct all the money into a clean technology fund. To date Alberta has collected $312 million and has already invested nearly $167 million into 43 clean energy projects. This fund has also allowed our province to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32 million tons. Over the past several months Alberta has taken a number of strong environmental actions. These include an unprecedented commitment to openness and transparency of energy development through an on-line oil sands information portal, a world-leading oil sands monitoring program, an arm's length governance system and a comprehensive land-use plan for the oil sands region that sets out vast swaths of protected land. Total conserved land within the oil sands region in Alberta is larger than the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island and the District of Columbia, combined. Expectations are high for Alberta to continue to push the bar on greenhouse gas reductions and this is why our environment minister is reviewing options to renew our climate change strategy. As a neighbor and as a friend, let me conclude by saying I will not be satisfied with my province only being a world leader in energy development. Through our actions, we must also be a global leader in environmental management. Projects like Keystone XL only reinforce our commitment to responsible oil sands development. We can have it both ways. And we will.

The problem is cultural and can be linked back to the generations that were born during World War II and during the decades after the war. They were imbued with an anti-establishment, counter-cultural attitude on both sides of the Atlantic. Notable aspects were a loss of the notion of chivalry. Feminism, base equality, democracy, and free market attitudes, anti-order were the thing to strive for. Censorship of movies and other forms of media created a bizarre portrayal of women, and the loss of the foil of the "fallen woman" removed the lesson for girls of what not to do, and for men, what they should do, for society to function well. Things have changed, however, since beginning after about 1975. The movies and media portray much more heroic, chivalrous societies and male-female roles. "Star Wars, "Indian Jones," "Pretty Woman," "Demolition Man," the "Die Hards," and other movies of the 1970s-2000s consistently portray heroic male characters rescuing women from one predicament or another just as was common in media and literature before the World Wars. "Fallen" women are everywhere to be seen as models of how not to behave. The foil combined with the chivalrous themes makes them much for confident in what to demand from their men. This will be very helpful in reconstructing society along the lines of order. Wild free market attitudes, and social chaos from equality will give way to Order as Generations X, Y...replace the culturally chaotic older ones. Regulation of the economy to achieve environmental objectives is highly consistent with traditional notions of order such as could be found in Protestantism especially... The world will improve but it will take time. Northern Europe will survive and prosper, especially...The US should do much better when the Old Guard (GOP and its associated lobbyists) is gone and environmentalism is imposed...The taxes and order will help purify the environment and society.</Msg><Username>hansesteelyard</Username><Timestamp>1361896090930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:28:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361896376493-15</Id><Topic><Title>ITS time to nationalize big oil.</Title><Username>miaction380</Username><Timestamp>1361895549520</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why?</Msg><Username>suptupngo</Username><Timestamp>1361896376493</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:32:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361896564505-16</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

The total number of plants include one 2.5 MW solar thermal plant and 131 photovoltaic plants, of which 65 comprise locally made solar cells and modules. Meanwhile, the MNRE add that bids for photovoltaic tariffs under the first and second phases of India’s Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) averaged Rs. 12.16/kWh (around US$0.22, or €0.17) and Rs. 8.77, respectively. The table below presents the solar power capacity installed in the various Indian states over the last three years, according to MNRE: State Installed capacity (MW) Andhra Pradesh 23.15 Chhattisgarh 4.00 Gujarat 824.09 Haryana 7.80 Jharkhand 16.00 Karnataka 14.00 Madhya Pradesh 7.75 Maharashtra 25.00 Orissa 13.00 Punjab 9.00 Rajasthan 251.25 Tamil Nadu 17.05 Uttar Pradesh 12.00 Uttranchal 5.00 West Bengal 2.12 Delhi 2.52 Total 1.233.73 India’s solar industry has popped up in the news frequently of late. Earlier this week it was announced that the “municipal corporation of Anantapur in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is set to become the first municipality in the country to set up a solar power project to power its water pumping operations and street lights.” The impressive plan includes installation of 5 MW of a solar PV project in the city. The project will be connected to the state’s power grid and will power the water pumping and street lights of the entire municipality’s area. While earlier this month Lux Research released a report that contends the solar industry must now “target high-growth markets such as China and India in an attempt to transform in a cost-conscious environment.” “While some historically strong demand markets will continue to pay dividends, the real winners going forward will need to make a few well-informed bets,” said Matt Feinstein, Lux Research Analyst and the lead author of the report titled, Past is Prologue: Market Selection Strategy in a New Solar Policy Environment. The remaining 803 MW of solar power already assigned will hopefully start overlapping with new assignments and developments as 2013 proceeds and the solar industry starts investing in India’s growing population and need for cheap, renewable electricity. cleantechnicaDOTcom/2013/02/26/india-has-allocated-1172-gw-of-solar-power-in-three-years/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361905494700</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:04:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361905675423-32</Id><Topic><Title>India Has Allocated 1,172 GW Of Solar Power In Three Years</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361905494700</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:04:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GW or is that MW?</Msg><Username>moooooooooooooooooooooooo4u</Username><Timestamp>1361905675423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:07:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361906701335-33</Id><Topic><Title>Exxon Mobil Corporation Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>christianson.timothy</Username><Timestamp>1361451418447</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:56:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good job</Msg><Username>phillipvargas42</Username><Timestamp>1361906701335</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:25:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361906720046-34</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

Representatives from Shell, Marathon Petroleum and the American Petroleum Institute met Feb. 21 with White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) aides about the EPA’s planned “Tier 3” low-sulfur gasoline rules, records show. Industry groups contend the rules will create billions of dollars in compliance costs while providing little benefit, noting that existing standards have already required steep cuts in the sulfur content of gasoline. The EPA sent the proposed low-sulfur gasoline regulation to OMB in late January. Public health and environmental groups have urged the EPA to proceed with the delayed fuel and vehicle emissions rules, which the organization had earlier intended to finalize in 2012. “This is a crucial plan to cut smog levels nationwide. Every car on the road would immediately pollute less with lower-sulfur gasoline. OMB must not delay this important rule,” said Frank O’Donnell of Clean Air Watch when the EPA sent the draft rule to the White House for review. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/284889-oil-industry-at-white-house-makes-case-against-epa-fuels-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361909552369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:12:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361909674761-37</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!!!!!!

Further delay will continue to hurt job creation and may damage our relationship with Canada. We cannot afford more delay,” the senators, led by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.), wrote in a letter to Kerry. The State Department is currently reviewing Keystone for its environmental impact. The pipeline would bring oil sands, a dense fuel that takes more energy to process than traditional crude, from Canada to the Gulf Coast. The department has said it would complete its analysis by March 31 at the earliest. The resulting report would inform President Obama’s decision on whether to let Keystone go forward. The administration has final say because the pipeline crosses national borders. The senators pressed Kerry and Obama to, “remain committed to reaching a decision within the first quarter of this year.” A majority of the Senate supports the project, saying it would provide thousands of jobs. Green groups hope Kerry, who already has used his new Foggy Bottom perch to talk about climate change, will score Keystone’s environmental impact negatively. They also have pressured Obama to scrap the project, most recently through a Washington, D.C., rally that drew tens of thousands of protesters. But with Obama’s upcoming ruling come many considerations — one of which is rapport with Canada, to which the senators alluded. In recent weeks, Canadian officials have escalated their Keystone lobbying efforts within the United States. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird met with Kerry earlier this month to discuss a range of topics, including Keystone. And provincial officials from Alberta — home to the oil sands field Keystone would tap — pressed their case at last weekend’s National Governors Association summit in Washington. Other letter signatories include: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sens.

The move is in response to looming 'fiscal uncertainty' over Friday's sequestration deadline. (Photo: Mark Avery, AP file) STORY HIGHLIGHTS Worries over sequestration cuts prompted the mass release, ICE says Congressman calls decision "abhorrent" and says President Obama is playing politics ICE has the ability to hold 34,000 people in custody Republicans on Tuesday denounced the release of hundreds of illegal immigrants from federal detention centers as an attempt to frighten Americans into supporting President Obama's budget spending demands. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,said it was "abhorrent" that Obama would release lawbreakers "to promote his political agenda on sequestration." He suggested the release was merely a way to pressure Republicans to vote his way. "By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives," Goodlatte said. "It also undermines our efforts to come together with the Administration and reform our nation's immigration laws." Immigration and Customs Enforcement press secretary Barbara Gonzalez said the agency is not dropping deportation proceedings against "several hundred cases" of detainees who have been released. But because of the "fiscal uncertainty" hovering over the federal government, she said it was necessary to release them "to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget." "Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety," she said. The uncertainty Gonzalez referred to is the $87 billion in automatic spending cuts due to go into effect Friday. Known as sequestration, the spending cuts are part of a 10-year, $1.2 trillion automatic decrease in federal spending put into effect by Congress and agreed to by Obama during negotiations to raise the federal debt ceiling. Obama is demanding tax hikes to avoid sequestration. Republicans are generally in favor of cutting the budget but say sequestration hits the Defense Department too heavily, endangering national security. Obama has been denouncing the GOP this week for not being willing to raise taxes as well as cut spending. The move comes as Democrats and Republicans in Congress are negotiating over an immigration bill that could put the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship. Republicans insist that the border must be secured and immigration laws must be tightened before any such path is considered. Some say that the ICE release threatens to undermine negotiations to reform the nation's immigration laws. "The administration has further demonstrated that it has no commitment to enforcing the law and cannot be trusted to deliver on any future promises of enforcement," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that will handle an immigration bill. Advocates for illegal immigrants say the mass release shows that many of those incarcerated in ICE facilities don't need to be there. Carlos Garcia, executive director of the Arizona-based Puente Human Rights Movement, said they have long argued that people facing deportation proceedings should not be held in custody - apart from their families - while they endure long waits to have their cases decided. "They shouldn't stop at releasing hundreds," Garcia said. "They should close the entire unnecessary immigration detention system." ICE officials say the average daily population was about 30,773 people as of Feb. 23. People released from custody can be placed in a variety of supervised release programs, according to ICE. They can be fitted with a non-removable ankle brace that monitors their whereabouts electronically. They can also be required to show up at an ICE office at regular intervals, or routinely call ICE officials to update them on their status. The announcement came on the same day that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned that the sequester cuts would affect "all core missions" of the department, including the loss of 5,000 border agents. usatodayDOTcom/story/news/politics/2013/02/26/illegal-immigrants-released-sequester/1949151/</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1361923493356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 19:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361926175089-55</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Democratic Propaganda/Pollution on this Board?</Title><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1361922091332</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 18:41:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You continue to demonstrate complete idiocy.
