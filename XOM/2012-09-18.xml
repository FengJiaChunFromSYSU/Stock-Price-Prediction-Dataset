The article, by scholar Ayaan Hirsi Ali—a former Muslim who renounced the religion after the 9/11 terrorist attacks—argued that the Western tendency to apologize for offensive free speech only emboldens Islamic extremists. The magazine’s cover, which depicts two incensed Middle Eastern men screaming in the direction of the camera, drew sharp rebukes from liberal-leaning and Arab commentators, who accused Newsweek of stoking Islamophobic fires in America on heels of violent attacks on U.S. interests in the Middle East. The Center for American Progress’ ThinkProgress blog fumed that Ali and Newsweek had published the “Islamophobic ‘Muslim Rage’ cover in response to [the] embassy attacks.” The liberal blog, which itself has faced charges of anti-Semitism in the past, went on to accuse Ali of being an anti-Islamic crusader. The Atlantic also seized on the emotive cover photo, declaring: “Thoughtfulness has flown out the window at Newsweek this week, as [editor] Tina Brown traded in a little bit of integrity and placed her bets on Islamophobia being a big seller with the magazine’s screaming ‘Muslim Rage’ cover. Blogger Alexander Abad-Santos went on to charge that Newsweek is intentionally inciting the Muslim world. The publication “still went for the big, generalizing cover. And the team over there knows exactly what they’re doing,” he wrote on the Atlantic’s blog. Since hitting the Internet this morning, the cover has morphed into a meme, generating a Twitter hash tag, #MuslimRage, which is being used by the article’s critics to mock Ali and Newsweek. Al Jazeera picked up on the controversy as well, codifying a series of enraged tweets on the subject, including one from liberal provocateur Glenn Greenwald. “In its own ugly way, this Newsweek [sic] cover is almost as inflammatory as the Muhammad video itself,” Greenwald tweeted. In her piece, Ali meditates on how U.S. leaders are allowing Muslim extremists to limit free speech. “If the U.S. follows the example of Europe over the last two decades, it will bend over backward to avoid further offense,” she writes. “And that would be a grave mistake—for the West no less than for those Muslims struggling to build a brighter future.” She goes on to note that while the attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt, Libya, and elsewhere were originally thought to have unexpectedly occurred following the release of a low-budget anti-Islam YouTube video, they were actually “planned in advance.” “The riots in Muslim countries—and the so-called demonstrations by some Muslims in Western countries—that invariably accompany such provocations have the appearance of spontaneity,” Ali wrote. “But they are often carefully planned in advance.” The majority of Muslims in the Middle East endorse anti-U.S. hostility, Ali wrote. “The Muslim men and women (and yes, there are plenty of women) who support—whether actively or passively—the idea that blasphemers deserve to suffer punishment are not a fringe group,” Ali explained. “On the contrary, they represent the mainstream of contemporary Islam.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347940848535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:00:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347940974302-2</Id><Title>Warren’s Lineage Debunked Again</Title><Msg>William A. Jacobson of Legal Insurrection breaks down the many failings in the liberal Boston Globe’s 3,000-word article Sunday attempting to justify Elizabeth Warren’s claim to Native American heritage. The pro-Warren Globe cooperated with the Harvard professor’s Senate campaign to produce the story, in which Jacobson finds seven major flaws. According to Legal Insurrection: When the story broke that Warren might be 1/32 Cherokee, it was based on supposed ancestry on Warren’s maternal grandmother’s side, the so-called Crawford line. That 1/32 claim was completely debunked, and the Globe had to issue a retraction, although Warren being 1/32 Cherokee lives on in pop culture. The Globe focuses its examination on the maternal grandfather’s lineage, the so-called Reed line, and it is that family line which appears in the story to be the focus of Warren’s campaign. Warren’s story has switched sides. Jacobson also notes that no genealogical proof exists to substantiate Warren’s claims, forcing the Globe to devote a good portion of its efforts to pointing out that other self-identified Native Americans also do not have tangible genealogical proof to support their claims. This is not the first time the Globe has labored to aid the liberal Senate candidate: The Washington Free Beacon has previously reported on the Globe’s coordination with the Warren campaign.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347940974302</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:02:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347941138232-3</Id><Title>What is Romney IQ?</Title><Msg>I would like to see his college transcript.</Msg><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1347941138232</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:05:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347955220640-4</Id><Topic><Title>What is Romney IQ?</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1347941138232</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:05:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot higher then nobumba.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1347955220640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 04:00:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347955529738-5</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wingers Wrong Again and Again!</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1347936247984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 22:44:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wahleee the commie POS nut job forgets to take meeds again and again.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1347955529738</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 04:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347960975768-6</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wingers Wrong Again.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1347911191048</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:46:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The moral question of weather or not the coalition should be apologizing for getting rid of Saddam and the Taliban is debateable.

And now they're taking maximum advantage of it. This is what happened when Carter tried the same approach with the Ayatollah Khomeini.It actually provokes the opposite reaction they intended.They got more angry and started the hostage crises. What happened after LBJ passed all that civil rights legislation in the 60's? He labored long and hard to get that done.And it should have been a moment of great celebration,100 years in the making.Instead,he got RIOTS,from coast to coast#$%$??? Did that make ANY sense? Yes,in the world of the psychology of the oppressed that is a common reaction. Doesn't mean it's rational,but it is understandable.That legislation was seen as a huge,historical "apology" IE an admission of deep wrong doing.Black anger legitimized .New law wouldn't satisfy the anger that unleashed.Hence,the riots. Politcal radicals in the arab-muslim world are simply harnessing a similar mass psychology of anger hoping to ride it into power. At this point there is little any american president can do to directly influence these events.But at the least,he can show some backbone by standing up for american values - like free speech - and pointing out the hypocricy of rioting over that video when their own media has been rife with the ugliest,most bizarre and hateful programming in the world,every day,for decades.</Msg><Username>kyleusa1</Username><Timestamp>1347960975768</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 05:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347961560638-7</Id><Topic><Title>What is Romney IQ?</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1347941138232</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:05:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2002 the Salt Lake City winter olymic games wre in huge trouble.A national embarassment.300 million in the red,the victim of widespread graft and corruption.

And we have the low IQ Democrat sheeple focused on attacking Romney for all sorts of little nothing reasons while President Hussein's administration destroys the US. “The idea that this criminal and cowardly act was a spontaneous protest that just spun out of control is completely unfounded and preposterous,” Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif told the liberal National Public Radio network. Instead, the killing was a military-style attack, he said. That attack hit the poorly guarded group of diplomats, who had to be rescued by Libyan reinforcements. The Obama administration’s claim that the murderous Benghazi attack was a unpredictable byproduct of a spontaneous protest gives White House officials a short-term way to fend off media questions. Any investigation may create a damaging pre-election scandal for the president, who touted his ability in 2008 to build peace between the United States and conflict-prone Muslim countries. But accumulating media reports — and Libyans’ statements — suggest the administration severely underestimated the danger of jihadis in Libya, many of whom have seized weapons from the armory of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347962801140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 06:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347968768444-9</Id><Title>McCain with photo with gay ambassador Stevens in April 2012 in Banghazi</Title><Msg>McCain proclaimed to the world that the liberators the Obama administration enabled by having NATO bomb much of Libya into the stone age were freedom lovers and not al qeda.

The writer suggests our government's position on heavy-oil pipelines is only about financial benefits for B.C. That is only one-fifth of the picture. Our government has set out not one, but five requirements that will have to be addressed before we would consider supporting any proposal for a heavy-oil pipeline. These include successful completion of the environmental-review process; world-leading marine and land oil-spill response, prevention and recovery systems for B.C.'s coastline and ocean to manage and mitigate the risks and costs of heavy oil pipelines; addressing legal requirements regarding aboriginal and treaty rights, and providing First Nations with the opportunities, information and resources necessary to participate in and benefit from a heavy oil project; and lastly, a fair share of the fiscal and economic benefits, reflecting the level, degree and nature of the risk borne by the province, the environment and taxpayers. Our five conditions represent an integrated and comprehensive position of our government. We are advancing this position as intervener at the joint review panel that is responsible for the environmental assessment of the Northern Gateway pipeline. Premier Christy Clark has been adamant that if the environmental risk cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, no amount of compensation would be adequate. Based on recent surveys, many British Columbians appear to agree with this comprehensive approach which balances economic development and environmental and social sustainability. Terry Lake B.C.

But pipeline proponent Calgary-based Enbridge stressed Monday only a fraction of those emissions — about $4 million worth a year — come from the construction and operation of the pipeline. Peters, who runs an engineering in firm in Prince George, B.C., argued the public should be aware of the 37 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions that will result from “wells to-wheel “ life cycle of the Alberta bitumen that will end up in Chinese refineries and gas tanks. Using Enbridge’s figure of $20 a tonne for the cost of carbon emissions, that would total $724 million a year and should be included in the company’s cost- benefit analysis, Peters argued at the joint review panel run by the National Energy Board and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. Canada’s national climate change policy aims to reduce such emissions to by 2020, said Peters, and Gateway exports could take emissions in the opposite direction. That cost “should be recorded as a negative and a cost to the planet,” said Peters, though he noted that Canada is not responsible for emissions outside its boundaries. But Enbridge economist Robert Mansell responded that those carbon emissions will occur whether the Gateway pipeline goes ahead or not, as the bitumen is already being produced and will be converted to gasoline. The pipeline will not cause an increase in bitumen production. “Enbridge’s proposal is not changing the western crude supply,” said Mansell, nor is it changing the world supply of oil, the pipeline is just opening new markets. Meanwhile, Hana Boye, lawyer for Haisla First Nation, whose land lies around the Douglas Sound, tried to determine the extent of Chinese ownership in the $6 billion project. Enbridge will own about 50 per cent or slightly less of the pipeline and the remainder will be owned by 10 companies who want to ship bitumen. Called funding partners, they contributed $100 million to the cost of the hearings. Only six of 10 have been publicly identified. Enbridge’s Paul Fisher confirmed that one Chinese company, Sinopec, is a funding partner and a potential owner of about five per cent of the project. Nexen, another potential owner, is under a take over bid by a state owned Chinese company. MEG energy company, also among the potential owners, is 16.6 per cent Chinese owned, the panel was told. Boye asked if Enbridge would consider getting a release from the confidentiality agreement so that all potential ownership parties could be identified. Fisher said yes. Shortly after, the review panel shut down that Boyer’s line of questioning, saying the panel does not need the ownership information. Bone argued that ownership information is relevant: “If we don’t know who they are, we can’t tell if there are market forces are driving it, if they are financial viable and if it is in Canadian interest. ” Bone also hammered Enbridge on whether the company was following its own ethics policies when it released the contentious video portraying the Douglas Sound without small islands, rocky outcrops and other “dangerous” obstacles in the channel that lead to Kitimat. The video made the dangerous channel look clear and open, she said. Pipeline executive John Carruthers defended the video saying it was not meant to be an accurate portrayal of the coastal waters and that fact “was easily seen” by viewers. edmontonjournal</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347974524182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 09:22:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347975316690-15</Id><Title>Tranquility Base Here. The Crescentino project has landed.</Title><Msg>Tranquility Base Here. The Crescentino project has landed. Jim Lane | September 18, 2012 Once described as a “moon shot”, Beta Renewables’ commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol project hovers just over the lunar surface, weeks from completion. It’s transformative cost structure may well reignite the cellulosic rockets. The first thing you notice about the Beta Renewables cellulosic ethanol plant in Crescentino is the size and scope. Tucked away in the sprawling, agriculture-rich plain that lies just south of the Italian Alps in the vicinity of Torino, the towering columns dominate the surrounding landscape like the gantryways of Kennedy Space Center’s launch pads, lording it over the Florida flatlands at Cape Canaveral. After the long “five years away” era of cellulosic biofuels, where systems fit on benches, or in small shacks that held pilots, the Digest had recently profiled large-scale demonstrations started coming along at locations like Boardman, Oregon (ZeaChem), and Rome, New York (Mascoma), Kalundborg, Denmark (Inbicon) and Sherbrooke, Quebec (Enerkem). They were a startling expansion in size. This year, the 8 million gallon INEOS Bio facility in Vero Beach, Florida has been completed and is going through its commissioning process now. It is awesome in its own right. But to see a 20 million gallon cellulosic biofuels project, up close and in person, is like seeing the Saturn V rocket for the first time. The Titan that powered Project Gemini, the Redstones and Atlases that powered Project Mercury, look like midget rockets launched out of backyards by comparison. Crescentino is a project many thought would never get built. Several years of industry skepticism preceded a decision by Beta’s parent Chemtex (itself a subsidiary of M&amp;G, one of the world’s largest producers of PET for synthetic fibers and plastic bottling) to build the project off its own balance sheet. The controversy, over the past couple of years, has been whether it was actually possible to deliver cellulosic ethanol for $1.25 per gallon on an operating basis – by delivering 10-12 cent sugars – based on a design that would cost, on a capex basis, around $5 per installed gallon of capacity. IMAGE For a couple of years now, Beta Renewables CEO Guido Ghisolfi has been lighting up offices and conferences in and around the industry with his brand of genial optimism and the message that cellulosic biofuels was a near-term reality, not a moon shot. He got much of the same reception that Werner Von Braun got in DC when he first presented ideas about how to reach the moon. Of course, they also said that Edison would never get the light bulb working, only a fool would go looking for oil in Texas, and the lunar surface was made of cheese. Well, it’s definitely time to get past the nay-saying. Crescentino is nearing its final weeks of construction, they expect to be in operation by year-end, and it is expected that at least a half-dozen “if you build it, we will come” conditional commitments from partners will go live in the first half, and Beta Renewables will be off to the races with somewhere between 60 and 300 million gallons of capacity in construction projects. As we do in Digestville, let’s look at the data. A really, really low cost of ethanol The magical machine at Beta Renewables is its Proesa technology, and in particular its process for generating low-cost renewable sugars. Here’s the Proesa math. Beta projects that it can recover one unit of ethanol for every 4-4.5 units of biomass, or around 2 units of biomass for every unit of renewable sugars. It’s projected biomass cost is $40-$50 per tonne, or around $80-$100 per tonne of recoverable sugars, with around $150 per ton for the enzyme load. That’s $230 to $250 tonne, or around 10 cents per pound for the sugars – bump that up to 12 cents to account for other variable and fixed costs. Skeptical of getting, say, corn stover at $50 per tonne. So it Beta CEO Ghisolfi. “We think corn stover is going to cost $80-90 per tonne, and it has some big surprises. It’s not stable, it will ferment; you have to dry or you lose some sugars in the percentage that’s already fermented by the time you get to it.” One of the reasons that his projects are multi-feedstock. “Other crops are available,” he says. “For example, in North Carolina, there are the sprayfields. These are the lands where hog farmers are forced to put in biomass to absorb the waste streams. With those, you also get to do business with a corporation that is a single counterparty, as opposed to 100 farmers. The ethanol economics The ethanol numbers have a similar structure to the sugars data. $40-$50 for the biomass, or $160-$225 for the recoverable ethanol component per tonne. The yeast they peg at $10-$15 per tonne. $150 per tonne for the enzymes, and $50 for other fixed and variable costs. The total is $370-$440 per tonne or $1.11- $1.31 per gallon operating cost. They continue to guide based on a $5 per gallon capital cost per 20 million gallon project. IMAGE How did the capex go so low? You might have heard numbers of around $200 million for the Cresentino project thrown around. Since then, then exchange rate between Euros and dollars has changed somewhat – and 36 percent of the Cresentino project is in a boiler technology to produce green energy that was a unique feature of this location’s permitting process (and qualifies the plant for a lucrative incentive for green power available in Italy for plants completed before the end of 2012). The Digest’s understanding is that the cost was €90M for the cellulosic biofuels capacity itself, or around $5.60 per gallon for the capex this first time around. Why so low? It’s in the Proesa technology. As Ghisolfi explains, “At the time we bought Chemtex in 2004, they already had a first gen biofuels technology. This was before food vs fuel, in the middle of the ethanol boom, and we looked closely at it. What we saw was that there a number of players supplying technology. ICM, Fagen, Katzen, Delta T, Praj, Lurgi tand a number of smaller firms. “We thought the model that was generally around back then would not work in the EU in the long term. Here, recycling is important, mass balance is important, sustainability is important. Burning coal instead of gas, not re-using process heat or steam, as was the case in many designs, was not a sustainable technology. “We wanted a technology that was worldwide, non-food, subsidy-free, multiple feedstocks, that would work outside of the corn belt. But we didn’t want simply to go for cellulosic ethanol by throwing money at the problem of pre-treatment and extracting sugars. IMAGE “Our R&amp;D focus was a low temp, low steam environment, to disturb less. We knew that the acid bases can extract 70% sugars – but then you have an acid soup, and you need wonder enzymes just to survive the exotic PH conditions. “If you can change the nature of the processing conditions, you change the nature of all the equipment in the plant – because the processing conditions you have imposed on yourself also impose significant costs in the kind of engineering, the kind of systems and materials you need. “My father (M&amp;G founder Vittorio Ghisolfi) said his goal was to “banalize” what was rocket science technology, and that’s what we have worked on here.” You can see some of the ideas behind Proesa in this patent app. And more background on Proesa in this Cate Renewables presentation, here. The Big Spend and the Big Invest The company has bet big. It has 250 people working in its labs, which cost €30M per year just for the talent, and an additional €10M in R&amp;D-related expenses, annually. Now, Chemtex established Beta at a €250M JV with TPG. “With VC investors,” Ghisolfi recalled, “you talk to funds that invest $10-$15M. It’s hard for us to play with those because we had already built what they would look to fund – the technology and a pilot. So we focused on a handful of groups that were interested in and able to fund much larger investments. “For ourselves, we were forced to invest, because technology is like bread, you have to sell it when you have it, and we simply weren’t able to raise all the external funds because people were skeptical. The first mover has problems but advantages.” The business model The company is doing a North Carolina project. “We realized after Crescentino, that we had to have presence in the US,” observed Ghisolfi. “But for the next Project Alpha – we’ll guarantee the numbers but will take a partner.” The company expects to expand quickly, licensing 4-5 projects at the lower 20 million gallon capacity and 4-5 at the larger 35-40 million gallon size. Feedstocks are expected to vary – a mix of wheat straw, rice straw, bagasse, arundo donax, corn stover, or poplar depending on the costs and availability. “We have a number of conditional agreements in place that go forward when the first plant is fully commissioned,” Ghisolfi said. “As far as feedstocks, we’ll do whatever is possible and practical.” The biggest project area in the near term, with partners, will flow from the company’s partnership with Graal Bio. “The project will use 50 percent sugarcane tops and leaves, and 50 percent bagasse. We see this as an opportunity to add 30-40 percent more capacity at existing plants, by using bagasse, and the tops and leaves. The government has outlined an impressive program to expand sugarcane cultivation, but it will take several years to put in all the roads and infrastructure to open up opportunities in the west of Brazil, so working with existing plants offers more near-term opportunities, in our view.” The bottom line A friend of the Digest, reflecting on the chances for 10-15 cent sugars and the companies chasing those targets, described them as “Moon shots. I truly wish them luck, but they face significant tech and scale issues to be big players. If any of them can really be the cheap, why are they not producing cellulosic ethanol right now and making a killing?” Well, that was some time ago, but it applies in the here and now. Producing cellulosic ethanol right now and making a killing. That appears to be the path that Beta Renewables is marching down. It may well have been a moonshot to have built Crescentino.

The Republican presidential nominee assembled a brief and to-the-point press conference Monday night to address the tape, which had been posted online by liberal magazine Mother Jones. Romney, while saying his phrasing was not ideal, stood by the premise of his remarks, which reportedly came from a fundraiser in Florida. "It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way. I was speaking off the cuff in response to a question," Romney said, adding he wants to help "all Americans." But he continued: "It's a message which I am going to carry and continue to carry, which is that the president's approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes because frankly my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them. Therefore I'm not likely to draw them into my campaign as effectively as those in the middle."</Msg><Username>invest83838</Username><Timestamp>1347991506331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347992342767-24</Id><Title>Starbucks, Ben &amp; Jerry's join lobby push for wind credit - Congress is expected to grapple with the expiring tax provisions in a lame-duck session</Title><Msg>Starbucks, Ben &amp; Jerry's join lobby push for wind credit By Zack Colman - 09/18/12 11:33 AM ET Businesses that support wind power are turning up the pressure on Congress to extend a tax incentive for the industry before it expires at the end of the year. Nineteen businesses outside the energy sector signed a letter sent Tuesday to congressional leaders that argues the 2.2 cent per kilowatt-hour incentive for wind power production “lowers prices for all consumers, keeps America competitive in a global marketplace and creates homegrown American jobs." The letter was signed by 19 businesses, including Ben &amp; Jerry’s, the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, Starbucks, Symantec, Yahoo!, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Sprint. Many of the companies involved are members of Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy, an arm of the business sustainability firm Ceres. Wind power companies are lobbying furiously to save the wind credit and say they will have to lay off thousands of workers if it is allowed to lapse. The credit has become part of the battle over energy policy in the presidential race. President Obama wants to keep it alive, while GOP nominee Mitt Romney would end it as scheduled because he views it as meddling in the marketplace. Amy Hargroves, Sprint's manager of corporate responsibility, told The Hill that "progressive" businesses like the ones that signed Tuesday's letter believe in the benefits of green energy. She said the firms felt the need to weigh in to counterbalance companies that have spoken out against the incentive. "From my perspective, there’s been a greater organized effort against supporting this, so they’ve been far more vocal," Hargroves said. "We need our voices to be heard. We think it’s important to have more green energy choices in the U.S." She said axing the incentive would make it difficult for Sprint to reach its self-imposed goal of getting 10 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2017. Hargroves said Sprint and other businesses plan to escalate contact with lawmakers about passing an extension of the credit in the coming weeks. “I think corporations tend to have influence in politics, and we intend to help," Hargroves said. Room to maneuver on the incentive exists in both chambers, with the incentive stalled along with a mix of other tax provisions. The wind incentive, which expires Dec. 31, is included in a $205 billion tax extenders package that passed the Senate Finance Committee in August. Senate leadership, however, has yet to call the bill on the floor. The House Ways and Means Committee is set to meet this week to discuss expiring tax credits, which include the wind incentive. The final fate of the credit is unlikely to be decided until after the Nov. 6 election, when Congress is expected to grapple with the expiring tax provisions in a lame-duck session. thehill</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1347992342767</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:19:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347992352785-25</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wingers Wrong Again.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1347911191048</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:46:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax Romney's Cayman island fortune!

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that Russia sent a letter last week saying it didn’t need Washington’s help anymore. She didn’t cite a political reason for the closure, but President Vladimir Putin has long complained about U.S. democracy and human rights promotion efforts. The aid agency worked in Russia since the Soviet Union’s collapse 20 years ago, promoting “a more open and innovative society and a strengthened partnership between Russia and the United States” and spending some $2.7 billion. It planned $50 million in programs this year. USAID’s ordered departure comes amid a broader crackdown on Russian civil society groups after fraud-tainted parliamentary election last year prompted massive anti-government protests. Putin blamed Washington for trying to destabilize Russia and accused Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for signaling the start of demonstrations. NGOs receiving foreign funding and engaging in political activity must now register as “foreign agents,” which is likely to undermine their credibility among Russians. Another law sharply increases the punishment for taking part in an unauthorized protest rallies. State television has denounced the country’s only independent election-monitoring body. Putin and his circle have long exploited suspicion of foreign involvement in the country, but he has stepped up the campaign over the last year. Although he returned as president in March, he is under increasing criticism in Russian society and even in the once-submissive parliament. U.S.-Russia cooperation has suffered on a broad range of issues, from missile defense to ending Syria’s civil war. That has led to criticism from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and others about the merits of the Obama administration’s much-touted effort to patch up relations with the Kremlin, which yielded an agreement last year to reduce the U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons arsenals.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1347994198583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:49:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347994359965-28</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wingers Wrong Again.</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1347911191048</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:46:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>could be hard to do--won't release his tax returns even his father said it should be done--guess he does have things to hide if there is nothing to be ashamed of--I wonder why ?? sure you can explain the logic sure you understand why someone banks in other countries but will fix USA ?? sure you understand why someone goes to private schools/sends kids to private schools but understands public education ?? sure you understand why someone creates romneycare but says it is not basis for obamacare ?? sure you understand sure we all do do the pigs that fly wear the magic underwear ??</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1347994359965</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347994729893-29</Id><Topic><Title>COULD WE POSSIBLY WANT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347984962766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 12:16:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mrsure, I don't hate anybody, you have the wrong person, I don't know anything about the Trinity College in Chicago.</Msg><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347994729893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:58:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347998492782-30</Id><Topic><Title>COULD WE POSSIBLY WANT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347984962766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 12:16:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama would unlikely sacrifice a gay ambassador considering his background with the choir lads at trinity c of c in Chicago.

In November 2011, its offices in Paris were firebombed following the front page publication of a cartoon of the Muslim prophet Mohammad saying "100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter." At the time, the paper's then-editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier, told the BBC: "This is the first time we have been physically attacked, but we won't let it get to us." Perhaps being true to his word, the paper has planned another series of cartoons of Muhammad, including, according to Reuters, "nude caricatures." The paper is due to hit newsstands Wednesday. The timing of the cartoons may be especially worrisome for leaders in France, home to Europe's largest Muslim population. The recent discovery of an online trailer for an anti-Muslim film produced by a Coptic Christian in America has sparked violent and occasionally deadly protests all over the world in countries with large Muslim populations. It is forbidden in Islam to produce caricatures of Mohammad, and some conservative Muslim leaders have mobilized their outrage into aggressive protests in recent years every time a Westerner does so. Egypt seeks arrest of anti-Islam filmmaker U.S. Coptic Christians, Muslims denounce anti-Muslim film AP: U.S. destroying secret info amid Beirut unrest French leaders have given a mixed response so far to the announcement of the new Mohammad cartoons' publication as the try to balance a desire to respect their progressive ideals with avoiding violence at home. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault issued a statement, which Reuters translated as saying: "In the current climate, the prime minister wishes to stress his disapproval of all excess and calls on everyone to behave responsibly." French newspaper Le Monde reports that Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, on a visit to Cairo, condemned the cartoons, claiming to the French government is "against hostile provocations at this time." The Interior Ministry has announced plans to beef up security around the offices of Charlie Hebdo as a precaution, according to Le Monde. Dalil Boubakeur, the senior cleric at Paris's biggest mosque, told Agence France Presse he has appealed for France's Muslims to remain calm. "It is with astonishment, sadness and concern that I have learned that this publication is risking increasing the current outrage across the Muslim world," he said. "I would appeal to them not to pour oil on the fire." In 2005, a Danish paper, Jyllands-Posten, posted cartoons with Mohammad in them, including one featuring Mohammad wearing a bomb in a turban. At the start of 2006, Danish embassies around the world were attacked, several countries withdrew their ambassadors, and dozens died in rioting. In 2010, several men were arrested, accused of trying to attack and kill as many as possible at the Jyllands-Posten offices. At one point during the controversy, Charlie Hebdo republished those cartoons as an act of solidarity.</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1348026638823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 23:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348026700718-54</Id><Topic><Title>Conservatives are in "la la" land</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1348012575780</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:56:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow.Are you THAT dumb or just eternally THAT lazy.

Voting for a Obama is voting for putting the entire social safety net at risk.And that's why this election is a no brainer.We can vote for a guy cruising towards the fiscal cliff with no plan or another guy who actually has a plan.Whatever flaws folks think Romney is guilty of doesn't matter.The choice is that basic - one guy - no plan - other guy - plan. Good plan? Great plan?
