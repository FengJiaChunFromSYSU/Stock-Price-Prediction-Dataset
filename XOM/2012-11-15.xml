Government employees unions led by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) proposed two amendments to the state constitution that would have made collective bargaining a constitutional right (Proposition 2) and forced family members that care for disabled relatives into the union (Proposition 4). Despite the fact that the state’s workforce is 17.5 percent unionized—about 50 percent higher than the national average, according to a 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics study, the most recent available—Proposition 2 lost 58 percent to 42 percent and Proposition 4 lost 57 percent to 43 percent. “This was the number one union issue on the ballot aside from the president, but voters are resoundingly supporting labor reforms, even as voters are resoundingly accepting Obama,” said Vincent Vernuccio, a labor policy expert at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. Republican Gov. Richard Snyder began enacting public sector pay and benefit reforms when he assumed office in 2011 in order to curb a $1.7 billion budget deficit he inherited from Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm and the government retirement system set to run dry by 2023. Snyder backed a number of labor reform packages, including the elimination of “last-in, first-out” policies that forces school districts to lay off teachers by seniority regardless of performance. He also successfully raised teacher pension contributions to 3 percent from zero. This move is projected to save the state $15 billion over 30 years. Snyder even opposed the forced unionization of home healthcare workers unions set out to protect in Proposition 4—a practice that has generated more than $32 million for SEIU since 2005. “They [the unions] were responding to direct attacks to unions by the legislature and Republicans; they decided to do an end around the legislature,” said Bob McCann, spokesman for Michigan Senate Democratic Leader and prospective gubernatorial candidate Gretchen Whitmer. The amendments accounted for $60 million of the $141 million spent on ballot initiatives in 2012, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. That money helped fuel an onslaught of television advertising. Two of those ads were 30-second spots featuring firefighters and cops telling voters that their lives could be at risk without collective bargaining. “This air pack I’m wearing gives me 30 minutes to look inside your burning home and find you,” Lincoln Park Firefighter Mike Hendricks tells the camera through his air mask. “[Collective bargaining] means we negotiate for gear we need to protect your lives and ours.” Vernuccio says the unions overplayed their hand with such advertisements. The vast majority of collective bargaining is concentrated on securing higher pay and benefits to members. “Prop 2 would have made the unions a super-legislature, enabling them to supersede 170 laws,” Vernuccio said. “They conveniently left out the part of the amendment that read that any existing or future laws that affects wages, hours, employment terms or conditions could be repealed by CBA.” Proposition 2 opponents used sections of existing labor agreements against the union onslaught. “Here’s just one example: if Proposal 2 passes, teachers caught drunk on the job get five chances,” a Protecting Michigan Taxpayers ad said in reference to a Bay City, Mich. collective bargaining agreement. Some union allies see the amendments’ defeat as a reflection of voter distrust of change. “What you saw with the proposals was an overwhelming ‘No’ vote from the people—that was the dominant mindset,” Whitmer spokesman Bob McCann said. “There were so many proposals on the ballot and such large money spent on them that people tuned out, figuring that special interests were trying to buy the Constitution.” Michigan rejected all six ballot initiatives. Only Proposition 1, which would have extended Gov. Snyder’s power to appoint emergency managers tasked with cutting union contracts and controlling costs in failing cities across the state, lost by single digits. McCann said the presence of so many ballots hurt labor efforts. “If it’s just Prop 2 on the ballot, the numbers would have been fairly different,” McCann said. “Would it have passed? Not necessarily, but I think it’s going to close the door to further attacks.” A union survey taken after the election found that 70 percent of Michigan residents support the concept of collective bargaining. However, the wide margin of victory for Proposition 2 and 4’s opponents points to a Michigan electorate that is not nearly as union friendly as labor and Democratic leaders once assumed. “Traditionally, Michigan is a union stronghold; this election speaks strongly about waning power,” Vernuccio said. “The opposition was just so far reaching that you can’t ignore the crossover popularity of these reforms.” McCann agreed that the numbers cannot be ignored. “The thinking was that however strong Obama did in Michigan would correlate in how well Props 2, 3, and 4 were doing,” McCann said. “Obama did well in Michigan, but we didn’t see the carryover—even Democratic voters had that same level of distaste for proposals.”</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1352955815901</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 00:03:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352960226242-2</Id><Title>Massachusetts Offshore Wind Leases May Come By End Of 2013 - The area could produce 4 gigawatts of wind energy</Title><Msg>Massachusetts Offshore Wind Leases May Come By End Of 2013 Cape Cod Times, Hyannis, Mass. | By Patrick Cassidy Posted: 11/14/2012 4:05 pm EST Updated: 11/14/2012 12:26 pm EST BOSTON -- A vast expanse of ocean south of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket could be leased for offshore wind energy by the end of 2013, according to a timeline laid out by federal officials Tuesday. "We're going to shoot to have that lease sale in that fall time period," Maureen Bornholdt, renewable energy program manager for the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said during a public meeting in Boston. The estimated time frame for leasing means that selected wind energy developers would have until about the end of 2018 to submit construction and operations plans and potentially an additional 20 years to produce wind energy from the leased areas, Bornholdt said. The leasing plan does not affect Cape Wind, the proposed Nantucket Sound wind farm, which has already been awarded a lease by the federal government. For Massachusetts, which under Gov. Deval Patrick set an aggressive goal of having 2,000 megawatts of wind energy -- most coming from offshore -- by 2020, the timing of the leasing process is a potential, if necessary, setback. "It's hard to speculate whether this will impact our goals," Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs spokeswoman Krista Selmi said after Tuesday's meeting. Although Patrick has pushed for speed in leasing areas off the state's coast for wind energy, at other times he has called for a delay to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment on the process, Selmi said. Tuesday's meeting was the first of four scheduled to answer questions and take comments on an environmental assessment of survey activities in the proposed leasing area, which covers nearly 743,000 acres, or 877 square nautical miles. Other meetings are scheduled for today on Martha's Vineyard and Thursday on Nantucket. The area could produce 4 gigawatts of wind energy, which is enough to power 1.7 million homes in the state, Bill White, assistant secretary of federal affairs at the state's energy and environmental agency, said at the start of Tuesday's meeting. The environmental assessment found no significant effects from potential site assessment activities, which could include increased vessel activity and constructing meteorological towers to collect weather data, said Brian Kevor, environmental protection specialist with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. "We think it's an area that's eliminated a lot of the conflicts," Kevor said. The danger of ship strikes or acoustics on North Atlantic right whales and other marine mammals would be small and could be mitigated by monitoring and other standard operating procedures, Kevor said. Similarly, effects on commercial fishing during the site assessment phase of the leasing process would be minimal, he said. Based on comments about the proposed site assessment work, federal officials will decide whether to issue a finding of "no significant impact," revise the environmental assessment or determine that a more detailed environmental impact statement is required, Kevor said. Deciding on an auction format for leasing and going out for a final lease sale could take some time, Bornholdt said, adding that the process is further complicated by a high level of interest in areas off Massachusetts. Already 10 wind energy developers have expressed interest in the area and a half-dozen leases may be awarded, she said. Once leases are awarded, developers would be required to file environmental impact statements for specific projects, Bornholdt said. Only three of the two dozen people in attendance at Tuesday's meeting had questions or comments in favor of offshore wind energy. "This is an energy that's local, it's pollution-free, it's safe, and it's reliable," said Environment Massachusetts Research &amp; Policy Center energy associate Danielle Falzon. Ken Pruitt, managing director of the Environmental League of Massachusetts, argued that concerns over the potential visual effects of offshore wind turbines should be weighed against visual impacts from mountaintop removal to extract coal or the devastation that occurred during Hurricane Sandy, which many environmentalists say was a result of climate change. The entire area under consideration should be available to offshore wind energy, Pruitt said after the meeting, adding that it should be reduced in size only for a very good reason. ___ huffingtonpostDOTcom/2012/11/14/massachusetts-offshore-wind_n_2130071.html?utm_hp_ref=green</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1352960226242</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 01:17:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352972544640-3</Id><Topic><Title>It's So Nice To Be The Winner...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1352943416616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:36:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lies and cheat and voter fraud is how he won.

Item #2: Entitlement reform is a way to balance the budget Reality - the Democrat Party owns the issue and are not about to anger their base by cutting benefits in any meaningful way. The Democrat Party also controls the Executive Branch, half of the legislative branch, academia, and the media... Cutting entitlement programs is not a rational option to balance the budget given the constraints of reality. The Republican Party does not hold rational positions on either items #1 or #2. They are the problem in the negotiations over the "fiscal cliff." Obama holds a perfectly rational position and can be expected to stick to it. If the Republicans refuse to bend they will be responsible for what happens next... Indeed, the best strategy for Obama to pursue, assuming the Republicans refuse to bend, is to just expose the full irrationality of the position to the American people and demand his way... The GOP will cave then, and when they do he will be in a much stronger position to demand that they pass more and more of his agenda... What does he gain by compromising with them?

Japanese corporations now invest nearly all their profit in Japanese government bonds to finance the country's enormous budget deficits, leaving next to nothing for product innovation and expansion. So Japanese industry and technology has lagged the world over time, and has been driven out of market after market by foreign companies. The Japanese have followed the same monetary policy the U.S. Federal Reserve is following for the past two decades too: having the central bank borrow money from its member banks to manipulate interest rates to make the its deficits easier to finance. The result has been deflation, not inflation, as the Japanese economy staggers from recession to recession. There's no way the policy ever would create inflation, either, even if the economy grew, because the reserves the Bank of Japan creates to buy the bonds from the banks cannot be spent on anything, do not circulate, and do not boost the money supply. The solution to Japan's problem is massive tax increases, which should have been put in place well over a decade ago. If they had been Japan would not be in this mess now. The taxes when they finally do come will result in much lower Japanese consumption, and contribute to the gathering storm of global depression. What would emerge from the storm, though, would be a Japanese economy and business sector that is not hamstrung by the cost of financing a government that politically unable to balance its budget. The USA will share Japan's fate unless it reforms itself. Reform can only come one way: higher taxes.

As the 18th-century English diarist Samuel Johnson said, “the prospect of a hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully.” In the energy field, it was the oil shocks of the 1970s that first focused our attention on the peril of banking our future on fossil fuels alone. Since then, policy makers, industry leaders and consumers have accelerated development of all energy sources, such as wind power, that help reduce our dependence on foreign energy, create new jobs that can’t be outsourced, and boost local economies. The result? Voters in last week’s elections endorsed candidates who support an “all-of-the-above” energy policy that promotes a diversified portfolio of energy resources, specifically wind energy and the extension of its primary federal incentive, the Production Tax Credit (PTC). At the outset of the 2012 presidential campaign, the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) partnered with POLITICO to convene an event series called “Energy and the Presidency.” We brought lawmakers, energy experts and key reporters together to discuss how Americans benefit from an all-of-the-above energy strategy. We convened these panels in Washington, D.C.; in Iowa as the caucus season got underway; and at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, to ensure that energy policy was discussed at the highest level of the current policy debate. And unlike so much of what we heard and read about during the election, these discussions have been truly bipartisan. The wind industry’s primary incentive, the Production Tax Credit (PTC), has attracted as much support from both congressional Republicans and Democrats as any tax policy that’s come before Congress this year. As former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said at the Energy and the Presidency panel at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, “global clean energy is the future, and politics is not going to stop that.” Gov. Richardson shared some statistics to support this view. “By 2016, the global wind market will top $93.1 billion,” he said. “Since 2006, 36 percent of new electric capacity in the U.S. has come from wind energy. And the cost of wind is expected to fall 12 percent in the next 5 years.” That’s not politics—those are facts. It’s no wonder so many leaders on both sides of the aisle support vital steps towards energy and economic security such as extending the PTC. Among the dozens of Republican wind champions reelected to Congress, for example, were outspoken House supporters Reps. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), Steve King and Tom Latham (R-Iowa), and Senator-elect Dean Heller (R-Nev.). Independent Angus King, a wind project developer since leaving the governorship in Maine, won his race for the open Senate seat there. Swing states with numerous wind farms as well as wind factories went for President Obama, whose campaign took the position that the wind energy Production Tax Credit should be extended. They included Iowa and Colorado — where layoffs have struck wind energy factories because of uncertainty over when Congress will address the tax credit, which expires at the end of this year — and Michigan and Ohio, states important to the wind energy supply chain which also have untapped wind resources under development. Another key backer of wind energy is Governor Terry Branstad (R-Iowa). At the Energy and the Presidency panel during the Iowa caucuses, Branstad recalled that in 1983 he signed the first renewable energy standard into law, setting a precedent that has now been followed by 28 other states and the District of Columbia. “Renewable energy is real important to our state,” Branstad told us. “We’re proud to be the leader in wind energy. Wind energy has opened up some great new manufacturing opportunities and also great job opportunities not only in the building of wind farms but also in maintenance.” As everyone knows who attended our POLITICO panels, or watched them streaming online, wind power can no longer be called “alternative,” since it now is a mainstream source of American electricity. That’s why it’s so important we don’t turn back the clock on bipartisan support for investment in wind energy production. Why do so many Republicans and Democrats agree on extending the PTC? Because we all want the homegrown, affordable, clean and abundant energy that the power of wind offers. We also want the American wind energy jobs to continue to grow as they have over the past several years. Congress this week embarks on a lame-duck session that will include action to renew the PTC until all energy incentives are on the table during the corporate tax reform debate expected next year. Failure to extend the PTC would cost 37,000 jobs immediately, and put the brakes on the progress America has made to diversity its electricity portfolio. Wind should not be the only energy source without any federal incentive, as it would be if the PTC is allowed to expire. Elections are about choices, and it’s clear that in 2012, the American people have chosen candidates who support renewable energy. We don’t have to choose a single path towards our energy future. We can have it all — all of the above.

The rule requires refiners to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuel into transportation fuel by 2022. Currently, corn-based ethanol dominates the market, but “advanced” biofuels made from non-edible feedstock are just now coming online. Protecting the mandate is a chief concern for the biofuel community, which says changes to it would #$%$ investment in “advanced” biofuel technologies nearing maturation. Whitfield’s comment earned praise from biofuel groups, which have combined for a new lobbying effort aimed at securing congressional support for the fuel rule. “As there is an ethanol plant in Mr. Whitfield's district, he understands firsthand the importance of ethanol to local economic development, consumer gasoline prices and national energy security. We look forward to working with the chairman on protecting and promoting the RFS [renewable fuel standard] in the new Congress,” Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Bob Dinneen told The Hill in a statement. Whitfield’s prediction seems at odds with oil-and-gas lobby the American Petroleum Institute (API), which has said defeating the rule is one of its top legislative priorities for next year. An API spokesman told The Hill that the group is planning a media call on the topic this month, but did not comment on Whitfield’s remarks. API CEO Jack Gerard said in a July hearing held by Whitfield’s subcommittee that the rule unfairly forces refiners to buy credits for a type of biofuel that is not yet commercially available. Fiscal conservatives also criticized the rule in that hearing for institutionalizing government intervention in the energy market. And some Democrats oppose the rule on environmental grounds, saying incentivizing biofuel production drives up global food prices. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/268213-gop-house-energy-leader-does-not-expect-to-change-biofuel-rule</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353006916857</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353007209998-20</Id><Title>Lawmakers optimistic energy deals can get done</Title><Msg>Lawmakers optimistic energy deals can get done By ANDREW RESTUCCIA | 11/15/12 1:51 PM EST After two years of gridlock and endless campaigning, lawmakers from both parties are optimistic that the winds are finally favorable for progress on energy legislation. Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s energy and power subcommittee, said he hopes to meet soon with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to discuss areas of compromise. “I think we have a lot of areas where we have common interest, and I look forward to sitting down with the major players in the U.S. Senate on energy and work it out,” he said during POLITICO’s "Energy and the Presidency" policy discussion Thursday. Areas of potential agreement include boosting energy research and development, modernizing the electric grid and addressing the nation's booming natural gas production, Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) told the audience. Udall and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.) said they are especially optimistic that Wyden and Senate energy committee ranking member Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) can find common ground. “I have never been more optimistic than I am right now with Ron Wyden and Lisa Murkowski,” Manchin said. But Udall and Manchin clashed on EPA, signaling that a broad energy bill faces an uphill battle in Congress. “When you go out and punch the EPA without thinking it through, it just creates more gridlock,” Udall said after Manchin criticized the agency. politicoDOTcom/news/stories/1112/83922.html?hp=r7</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353007209998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:20:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353007535735-21</Id><Title>Sen. Murkowski floats five-year phaseout of wind credit</Title><Msg>Sen. Murkowski floats five-year phaseout of wind credit By Zack Colman - 11/15/12 10:53 AM ET Congress should extend a wind power tax credit for one year as a bridge to an eventual phaseout, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources’s ranking member, said Thursday. Congress has generally extended the credit for two-year periods since its inception in 1992. But investment fled when the credit lapsed in 2004, and planned projects for next year already are down because the incentive’s future is hazy. That formula “doesn’t make sense” because it fails to give investors “some level of certainty,” Murkowksi said at an event hosted by CQ. Murkowski suggested Congress should extend the 2.2 cent per kilowatt-hour credit for wind power production so long as tax reform discussions next year lead to a plan for its gradual end. And though Murkowski's committee does not have jurisdiction over the credit, her comments as the GOP's top energy senator could prove instructive if the credit comes up for a vote. “So what we need to look at critically is if we’re going to have a production tax credit for wind, maybe you’ve got to schedule that for five years, say. It’s in place but then it phases out slowly. There’s got to be some kind of a path rather than this yo-yo effect that I think really has hampered the industry,” Murkowski said. The credit is set to expire Dec. 31, and extending it for one year would cost about $5 billion. Republicans and Democrats alike have broached the phaseout subject this week. Wind industry trade group the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) has said it supports a phaseout, but has not elaborated on how it should be designed. Many lawmakers want the credit to survive into next year to be part of broader tax reform discussions. But fiscal conservatives say the deficit situation means things like the wind credit must be sacrificed. The credit’s proponents — a broad base of Democrats and Republicans from wind-heavy states — contend it brings in revenues to offset its cost. AWEA said the credit brings in about $15 billion of private investment annually. The group says ending the credit would eliminate 37,000 jobs. Congress has a chance to pass the one-year extension through a $205 billion tax extenders package. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said he expects the wind credit to pass because it enjoys bipartisan backing. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the Senate is waiting on “fiscal cliff” negotiations to move that bill. He said the nation’s top priority is getting President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to avoid those automatic spending cuts and income tax increases set to take effect Jan. 1. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/268181-sen-murkowski-floats-5-year-phase-out-for-wind-credit</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353007535735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:25:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353008614007-22</Id><Topic><Title>It's So Nice To Be The Winner...</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1352943416616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:36:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good Grief, this Wahleeeee seems to be an expert on everything even the demise of the Republican Party.

They're the nefarious sounding — but perfectly legal — perks in the tax code that House Speaker John Boehner says could dig up new revenue for the government without raising taxes. President Barack Obama has called that math bogus. It's a fight that'll continue through the end of the year as Congress scrambles to avoid tumbling over the fiscal cliff. Here are POLITICO's need-to-know questions on these pieces of the tax code: What are these "loopholes" and what are they worth? They're targeted perks in the tax system that help one group or another lower their tax bill every year. Think everything from the mortgage interest deduction to the write-off for charitable contributions and the protection of health care provided to workers by employers. There are also plenty of similar provisions on the corporate side of the tax code ranging from breaks for oil and gas producers to the special treatment of carried interest income paid to private equity managers. All told, these provisions cost the Treasury more than $1 trillion every year in uncollected revenue — more money than the government actually takes in from individuals. So what loopholes are on the table? It's unclear — for now. The question dogs lawmakers and the public alike. No one — from Boehner to Obama — is ready to say which provisions they’re willing to scrap to gin up the revenue that Democrats are demanding to avert the fiscal cliff. But the one advantage both sides have going into the fiscal talks is that no one is new to this game anymore. The Gang of Six has haggled over the deficit for several years, Vice President Joe Biden led a group focused on the issue last year, Boehner and Obama held their own talks and the supercommittee convened for several months last fall in a failed bid to resolve the fiscal crisis. “This is not new,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who sits on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. These talks invariably return to one small list of “loopholes” that could be repealed to raise revenue, including: the depreciation schedule for corporate jets, oil and gas breaks enjoyed by the five largest companies and an accounting technique known as last in, first out. Expect to hear a lot more about these over the next month. How much revenue would those generate? Not much — and that’s the problem. The big-ticket tax items that would really rake in revenue — like the mortgage interest deduction and the break for charitable contributions — are politically fraught. That leaves about $100 billion — maybe a little more, depending on how the math is calculated — on the table from scrapping provisions for corporate jets, oil and gas companies and the so-called LIFO accounting technique. That’s a drop in the bucket compared to the $1.6 trillion in revenue the Obama administration says it’s seeking. In the days after the election, the GOP focus on loophole closings to generate money was seen as a breakthrough — the party was finally willing to deal on revenue. But as the attention shifts to how little money some of those provisions net, the parties seem on the verge of returning to their old divisions. In his news conference on Wednesday, Obama was skeptical that loopholes could generate enough upfront revenue and rejected GOP efforts to get credit for money that might flow into the government’s coffers from economic growth. “The math tends not to work,” Obama said. Democrats on Capitol Hill are also skeptical. Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said he’s open to Republicans’ proposal to increase revenue by closing loopholes but doesn’t see how they can play that card now to avert the fiscal cliff and also next year to overhaul the tax code. “I think it could be done, but the challenge is they’re also talking about tax reform, so how do you do tax reform if you’ve taken all this revenue and put it toward the fiscal cliff?” the Senate Finance member asks. “I’m not saying it’s impossible. … But I’m not going to give up the rate [hikes on top earners] because I don’t know how you can substitute it. To me, you’re double-counting.” Though Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said there’s “a lot of room for negotiation” on taxes, he also believes higher rates have to be part of the equation. “Revenue is a large part of” why Congress can’t rely on loopholes alone, Baucus said. “Otherwise it would be very hard to make the math work.” And efforts to kill some of those breaks would have to overcome regional opposition. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) said she would fight any effort to tap revenue from oil and gas firms, which are vital to the Gulf Coast economy, to help solve the fiscal cliff puzzle. “The breaks that the industry gets will be considered during a rewrite of the tax code — not as part of just putting more revenues on the table,” she said. “They are not an ATM machine to solve the deficit problem.” What's the alternative to closing loopholes? On this one, ask Mitt Romney. While the former Massachusetts governor’s campaign may be over, his tax ideas live on. Romney generated buzz in October with suggestions that he could pay for a 20 percent tax rate cut with a cap on the total deductions and other tax benefits a person can claim. He said the cap could range from $17,000 to as much as $50,000. Such a cap would save lawmakers from the painful process of killing popular provisions like the mortgage interest deduction while curbing their value — especially at the top end of the income spectrum. That’s why Philip English, a former Pennsylvania Republican who served on Ways and Means, says the so-called “bucket” idea has legs and is — so far — the best idea for increasing revenues without hiking up rates. “The various tax preferences that are in the code each have passionate defenders from different directions,” he said, but the idea sidesteps them. “So my view is that the Romney bucket is not the alchemy of tax policy, but it does represent a place of compromise [where] a variety of people on the political spectrum could settle.” At least in theory, Congress could agree to a system of caps, pair that with the elimination of some loopholes and cobble together a fair amount of revenue. It’s an idea that is getting attention from Democrats on Capitol Hill. “I’m looking at it,” said Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), a member of the Finance Committee. But the most important question surrounding caps is where the threshold should be set. The lower the cap, the more revenue that could be generated. But it would also apply to more middle-class families. “You want to set it at an amount where you can gain some revenue, but you don’t set it low enough that you’re hitting a lot of low- and middle-income taxpayers,” said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). “That’s the beauty of this. There’s no ‘my way or the highway’ proposition.” What’s the bottom line here — and does it matter where I live? Both parties say they’re focused on tapping only the top earners for new revenue. But depending on how a fiscal cliff or tax reform package is structured, it’s not out of the question that taxes might go up on some in the middle class. It really depends on where you live. If you’re in a state like South Dakota where housing costs and state and local taxes are generally low, there’s little risk that your tax deductions would be limited by the caps being considered in Washington. If, however, you call California or New York home, the story may be different. Those are some of the most expensive housing markets in the nation and have relatively high state and local taxes. Residents in those states are much more likely to bump up against the caps and suddenly lose some of the value of their state and local tax deduction or the home mortgage write-off. politicoDOTcom/news/stories/1112/83942.html?hp=t2_3</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353018964526</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:36:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353019497328-29</Id><Title>House GOP leaders pledge to oppose climate change ‘tax’</Title><Msg>House GOP leaders pledge to oppose climate change ‘tax’ By Ben Geman - 11/15/12 03:16 PM ET The entire GOP leadership team has registered its opposition to climate legislation that raises revenue for the government. The entire House GOP leadership team has registered its opposition to climate legislation that raises revenue, underscoring the long odds that taxing carbon emissions has in negotiations on the fiscal cliff. The Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity greeted Wednesday’s election of the House GOP leadership team by pointing out that the lawmakers are among the signers of the group’s “no climate tax” pledge. Signers agree to “oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.” They include Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who all retained their leadership posts. But it also includes the lower ranks of the leadership squad, including new Republican Conference Chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.) and others. “Carbon taxes are once again being floated as a way to raise revenue so that Washington can skip the hard work of actually getting runaway entitlement spending under control,” said James Valvo, policy director of the group, which is backed by the Koch brothers, who are active in conservative politics. “Using a carbon tax to address the deficit would clearly be a violation of the pledge that the entire House leadership team for the 112th and now 113th Congress have already pledged not to do,” he said. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said this week that a carbon tax, even with offsetting reductions in other taxes, would violate his groups' anti-tax increase pledge that a majority of Republicans have signed, a further sign that influential conservative groups have mobilized against the idea. Taxing production of oil, gas and coal has gained increased attention in policy circles of late to help address climate change and raise revenue, and some current and former lawmakers say it should be on the table. But the White House says it’s not going to propose the idea. While a senior Treasury Department official said this week that a carbon tax might be considered if Republicans brought it forward, the AFP pledge is further proof that it’s unlikely to be in the cards. White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday reiterated that a carbon tax isn’t on the White House to-do list. “We would never propose a carbon tax, and have no intention of proposing one,” he said. President Obama said during Wednesday’s press conference that he wants to take more steps to address climate change, but suggested it's hardly at the top of his agenda, especially compared to the economy. Carney underscored that dynamic Thursday. “The point the president was making is that our focus right now is the same as the American people’s focus, which is on the need to extend economic growth, expand job creation,” he said aboard Air Force One, according to a transcript. thehillDOTcom/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/268289-house-gop-leaders-pledge-to-oppose-climate-tax</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353019497328</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:44:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353023537344-30</Id><Topic><Title>Permanent Warfare State</Title><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1353008840698</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:47:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We will be a welfare state until the the "poor" people who have become very accomplished at their unjustified trade (not talking about the disabled), the just plain poor politicians who enable their lack of work ethic and, our educators realize their task in the overall.
