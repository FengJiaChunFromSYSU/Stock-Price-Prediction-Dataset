What do Smeg Whitman and John "Ding #$%$" Donahoe have in common? Both came from Bain. As if one needs to wonder why Paypal tested their "in store" payment system at Home Depot. Staples and Toys'R Us ~ All companies vested by Bain.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1366470792218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 11:13:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366470941369-4</Id><Topic><Title>Living on a STOck board for "life"!</Title><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1366455463626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 06:57:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The pot calling the kettle back.

Bain doesn't care they're broke because they're ignorant enough to wreck their "lives" for free. They only expose their poverty, mental illness, and Ripples ridden z50com failures as pumpers. Endless circles has owned them for 12 years. ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

John Osborne z50com and my imposter have lived here for 12 miserable, wasted, crime committing years. They can't hurt any real people with their misinformation but only out their own misery.
