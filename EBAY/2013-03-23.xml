Ebay is not raising any fees at all. Just simplifying them. Not all sellers will see the same decreases or increases. Each seller's sales are unique and some will see decreases in their fees and some will see increases, but the vast majority of Ebay sellers will see a decrease in their overall fees. The feedback that we have received from our sellers about the new fee stucture has been overwhelmingly positive.</Msg><Username>jeffatebay</Username><Timestamp>1364051085181</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:04:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364051376633-8</Id><Topic><Title>128% fee increase.

You may pay a very slightly higher fee on some of your items, but overall your total fees will decrease because your listing fees will decrease. If you contact us, we can run your actual business results in a model that takes into account the store subscriptions, final value fees, and the insertion costs and show you how your actual sales would have played out in the new fee structure. You will see that your overall fees will decrease, just as they will for just about every Ebay seller.</Msg><Username>jeffatebay</Username><Timestamp>1364051376633</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:09:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364054131984-9</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Bounce Report !!</Title><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363629476162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report , thank you !</Msg><Username>weber.rhonda</Username><Timestamp>1364054131984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364054271372-10</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Bounce Report !!</Title><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363629476162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The report says I have AIDS</Msg><Username>any_bush_will_do</Username><Timestamp>1364054271372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364061723629-11</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From Always Sunny Philadelphia.

There is no way my overall fees will go down. The current fee for a $2,200 item is $62.50 for the first $1000 and 2% for the amount over $1000. That means 6.25 percent for the first $1000 and 2 percent for the rest. How can 9 percent for the entire amount be less. Oh yes, the listing fee. That is currently 50 cents. Is the new listing fee going to be negative $112? That is the only way that I would even break even.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364093560336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 22:52:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364094326291-16</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY RAISING FEES AGAIN UNDER GUISE OF LOWERING THEM</Title><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1363714244981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 13:30:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can the vast majority of sellers see a fee decrease. Only sellers selling large quantities of cheap items will see a decrease. Anyone selling items for more than $80 will see a fee increase, and the fee increase percentage goes up with the price until the sale price is $2,778. It is simple math, which ebay thinks its customers are not capable of doing. Everything sold for between $80 and $2,778 will see a fee increase.
