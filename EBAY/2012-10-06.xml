His analysis was really good and be being new I got a lot out of them. I watched his older videos and his calls were accurate as well. I know there are a bunch of guys that pick stocks and send alerts but the contrarian trader puts himself out there to prove himself unlike other so called pros. Does anyone know of his paid services?</Msg><Username>jackrob720</Username><Timestamp>1349543805984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 13:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349550171268-4</Id><Title>Obviously Robme's Many Uncontested Lies In His "Debate" Caused Ebay To Tank Again Because Investors Smell Another Rich Lying Meg Whitman In The Works.</Title><Msg>Just saying many investors smell a Meg Whitman like stench up in here.

Figure out what categories represent the greatest risk of return to you, then sell those items out and do not sell in those categories any more. Ultimately, you will carve a niche out for yourself. You just can't sell anything and everything on Ebay any more with out take big risks, some people can handle a category with less risk than you while you may be able to handle a category better than others. Find your niche, and Ebay will probably do something to screw that up too, but try to anticipate they're next move.</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1349564771124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 19:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
