No other words describe it. My beautiful wife, wonderful children and grandchildren, and all my thriving students. It couldn't get better! A pair of idiots think they know me when they don't and never did. No one with the names they harass were ever here. If Pat Mitchell, the Marin bean counter and John Osborne, the road kill failure z50com and VW, hadn't deleted my old posts, and other ID, they would see that many times I called John a "troll". That is what he is, and that word is in the public vernacular. But, they'd rather chase their tales in sullied hate, while it destroys them, then be enlightened whatsoever, or earn a living to look after their children and grandchildren. We see why these trolls were never allowed into college or high school. Bottom line, they can't do a thing to the people they hate. They have hate but no facts. I bet another day of their public spinning continues, showing us all that suckers never learn anything. I hope that helps, but in John's 12 years of trolling, nothing ever has. Maybe the hard hard road will cure that illness.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1368183511407</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 06:58:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368192913409-3</Id><Title>Ebay should close Friday (today) above $56.00, I was looking for $57.00 on Friday, I missed this one.</Title><Msg>Friday, most of the time is a up day for Ebay and if the market is up also Ebay should go up to 56+ and close there today.
