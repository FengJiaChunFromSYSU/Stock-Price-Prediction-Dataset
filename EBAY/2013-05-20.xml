I am a top rated powerseller and ALSO an ebay shareholder. Here is the latest incident that happened to me. I accepted a best offer on an item from a buyer in Germany for $1,200. The item cost me $1,000. I had it listed for $1495 or best offer, with free world wide shipping. I figured that I would sell it for the $1200, and would come out with a small profit after the fees, and at least turn over some merchandise. The final value fee was $108. The shipping cost me $48, international express, which is the cheapest international shipping with tracking, and the international paypal fee was $38.70. Total fees=$194.70. When the customer received the package, they informed me that they were unhappy, because the item was smaller than it looked in the photos, even though all of the dimensions were clearly stated in the description. They wanted to return the item for a full refund AND receive the return shipping charge, OR they were willing to accept a refund of $200. That is when I contacted ebay powerseller support because it seemed like extortion to me. Powerseller support is based in the US. Not in the Philippines like the ordinary customer service. I had the rep review all of the messages between the buyer and me, and he suggested that it would be best if I just refunded the customer the $200. He told me that it was just the cost of doing business- you win some and you lose some. I reluctantly said that would be OK, as long as Ebay was willing to refund me the $108 final value fee that it charged me. This is where the problem began. He informed me that the only way ebay would refund the final value fee was if I refunded the entire amount. I will continue in another post, since this is the limit.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1369083401790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 16:56:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369084131533-7</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay has the worlds worst customer service of any PROFITABLE company</Title><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1369083401790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 16:56:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I then told him what he told me. That it is just the cost of doing business- you win some, and you lose some. Ebay makes enough money off of me, and if I was going to lose money on an item, ebay should not be making $108. He told me that it was completely impossible and against ebay policy to refund my final value fee unless the customer returned the item for a full refund. Ebay has no problem telling me to refund $200 even if I wind up losing money on an item, but Ebay STILL has to get its $108. So while they expect me to provide perfect customer service for the buyers, they are unwilling to do ANYTHING for me as a seller. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told that was not possible. Good customer service would be to just refund me the final value fee. By the way, my bill from ebay last month was nearly $1700. This company can't be successful for long treating customers in this way.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1369084131533</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 17:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369097333476-8</Id><Topic><Title>Boyish Rock Star Style</Title><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1369076698174</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 15:04:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>John, You are too funny.
