That's who! Still flagging posts (like the ones below that called him out) and spewing hate about a man who got under his skin so much so that he's actually glad he's dead. That's how seriously FLYKTNING took a MESSAGE BOARD! What kind of life must FLYKTNING have that he would allow something said on a MESSAGE BOARD rule him to this day? A very sad, sorry lonely life. So lonely that he doesn't even have any beans to count DURING TAX SEASON. Instead he's still here living his life out on a message board gloating over the death of a man who ruled him in every way. FLYKTNING you have my pity. Now call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, you know the one. Fly's idea of stalking is when someone sees his picture, that he himself posted, on a public website. I see you're still a sad case McFly. At least I can't be accused of being him anymore. You've been proved a liar. Don't worry I won't speak ill of you when you die and can't speak up for yourself but you might want to start thinking about what others would say. Feel better now that you got that out of your system, Fly? The best part is he can't retaliate. Woo Hoo!!! You are such a drama queen. He stalked you? You mean because he saw your picture on Crime's site and mentioned it? Is that the "information" you're talking about? I saw your picture on that site too so I guess that means I stalked you as well. John's a bigger man than you are but that's always been clear. I hope you feel good about yourself.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1361717839111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 09:57:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361731541095-2</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>francismuldoon</Username><Timestamp>1360873275155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:21:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks</Msg><Username>deanchapam</Username><Timestamp>1361731541095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 13:45:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361735717741-3</Id><Topic><Title>What kind of person speaks ill of the dead?</Title><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1361717839111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 09:57:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Flyktning hates you because you speak the truth to her/him/IT/whatever. I find it amusing that Fly, John, SEN Sybil and a tiny horde of board trolls publicly hate someone, yet constantly reveal themselves to be far lower, the most obsessed, and far more hateful than anyone. I am glad I don't sully my mind on that garbage. ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I Hope That Helps.</Title><Msg>As the great Mark Twain said "The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated" but if thinking so has allowed the hateful gang (Fly, John and other losers) to gulp a few more desperate breaths than I hope that helps. I simply tend to my garden and invest in CDs unlike Fly who sows despair and posts on Craigs as a cd. Wise words from The Baron Von Munchausen "And they all lived happily ever after... at least those who had a talent of it". I am quite happy and I know HE and HER are too. As for the rest?

You will find in the long run they don't amount to a tiny molehill of beans. Email me direct Midnite. I have some funny facts for you.
