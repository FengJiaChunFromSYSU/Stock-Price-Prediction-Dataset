Source: Marketing Sherpa An excellent message for Local Corp with the offer Launch by Local: "That’s a very solid majority of small businesses that are putting more money into their marketing efforts." As mentioned, mobile use in general is only going up and, as we’ve said before, it is soon expected to surpass desktop use. The huge rise in mobility is evidence that on-the-go consumers aren’t just searching for things like restaurants and retail stores, but they’re looking for all kinds of businesses and products, including entertainment, professional services, healthcare, and groceries. So, don’t make the mistake of thinking your niche doesn’t need a mobile website.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1364367058857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 02:50:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364386363624-2</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Bounce Report !!</Title><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363629476162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot!</Msg><Username>toddsandoval232</Username><Timestamp>1364386363624</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 08:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364387829525-3</Id><Topic><Title>Just casting the line...</Title><Username>sullyinmass2013</Username><Timestamp>1364316630269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:50:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just as I predicted.

In essence creating disruption amongst sellers. You know the old strategy, divide and conquer, kill two birds with one stone AND raise CEO john Donahoe's compensation.. When eBay charges $0 up front fees for listings, one overall fee including payment processing like Amazon does, then we will be simplified As a TRS / Powerseller on eBay, I always wonder why my 20% discount doesn't include my premium store and listing fees? Only FVF's which pale to the up front listing fees.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1364401746641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:29:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364402028811-19</Id><Topic><Title>128% fee increase.

That doesn't mean eBay is a good long term investment. Here's on small clue. If Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway own a company, it's probably a good investment. Buffett has always steered clear of eBay.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1364406931120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 13:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364407036729-36</Id><Topic><Title>The STIFF that never DIES</Title><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1364400350160</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:05:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor broke failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy.

The minute Meg Whitman took over, ebay started its demise. Whomever took her place is even worse( i dont kniow becasue I quit eons aga). IT was a place to make some money, make some friends, and generally spent some good times. Now it is horrible place with rules for everything. It is nearly impossible to contact a buyer for ebays fear you might become friends. Most buyers try to cheat you using ebays rules that favor buyers who know how to work the system, and believe me they do. Without paypal ebay would not exist anymore, and forcing you to use paypal will eventually get them a lawsuit. In the end Ebay will self destruct, its just a matter of time. Own the stock or not the truth matters. Meg whitm,an ran for Calif gov on her ebay merits, but she was to dumb to know that she lost the election because of her ebay merits. She is now trying to destroy hewlett packard, and it wont be long there either. Possibly the worst CEO that has ever run a company.</Msg><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1364408456782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 14:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364409115154-41</Id><Title>EBAY: will close 53.65$ today bcz 2Many negative on this board rush cover A,s,s,......</Title><Msg>============= eom ====================</Msg><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1364409115154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 14:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364409195670-42</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay is its own worst enemy</Title><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1364408456782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 14:20:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smeg?
