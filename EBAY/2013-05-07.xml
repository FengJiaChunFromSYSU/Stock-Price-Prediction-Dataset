Heading into the slowest retail months and once again another fee increase. the 3rd increase in 4 years. Wonder why eBay had to raise fees again May 1st if they're doing so good as the CEO states over and over???? 200% increase on listing fees for Premium store owners. Huge increase on FVF's for high ticket items. Last year it was FVF's on shipping, before that it was the "stores into core" fiasco. In 2009, it was $15.95 for a store with .03 cent listings. In 2013, it's $59.95 for a Premium store with .10 cent listings. 300% fee increase !!! BEFORE THE FIRST SALE IS MADE !!!! Amazon, charges $0 listing or store fees.
