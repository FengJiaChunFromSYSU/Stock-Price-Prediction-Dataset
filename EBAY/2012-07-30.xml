I knew the moment the "drive-by shooting rating' DSR system was announced that eBay and I would be parting ways. I paid eBay over $1000.00 a month in fees back then (that's before the enormous fee increases in the interim) and received zero support from eBay. I still "sell" on eBay mostly big ticket items that don't have a local market, items are overpriced by 20% to accommodate the certain eBay risk. The potential buyer is encouraged to telephone by which most sales occur off eBay. Basically I employed a method to use eBay instead of eBay using me. The risk: A buyer purchased a $4000.00 piece of equipment from me, it cost $700.00 freight. The buyer filed a dispute stating the item was not as described. PayPal reversed the transaction, $4700.00 gone. The buyer ships the item back, it arrives with the expensive components removed and replaced with the buyer's broken junk parts. Now I got a worthless machine that can't be sold and plus I am out the freight cost, just to fix the buyer's machine. What did PayPal say when I advised them of the scam? You can't prove what you say and sellers tell the same sad story all the time. Open a lawsuit if you think you have a case, essentially PayPal told me to go pound sand.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1343653665000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:07:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343653692000-4</Id><Title>Read this new report on eBay</Title><Msg>I cant believe what this analyst just told me about eBay .

"&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, let me school you on the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit. A tax deduction is a reduction in the amount of taxable income, which in this case, IF IT WERE TRUE, would be a *percentage* of the 77G, depending on which tax bracket you fall under. A tax credit is a reduction in the amount due, which in this case, IF IT WERE TRUE, would be the *entire* 77G. Now let me school you on this horse deduction of Romney's. THE LOSS DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR A DEDUCTION and that is clearly shown on his tax return. So, get your facts straight. When I file my business taxes my accountant shows all expenses/losses but that doesn't mean they are all deductible as in this case with Romney. You are a typical DemocRAT. Twisting a tidbit to fit your agenda. In other words LIE. You are pros at it as you demonstrated so perfectly in your post. Now why don't you stick with the simple stuff like boycotting Chick-fil-a. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1343697025000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343704303000-51</Id><Topic><Title>romney deducted $77,000 for horse care in 2010</Title><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1343532733000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 23:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the truth hurts don't it nag.
