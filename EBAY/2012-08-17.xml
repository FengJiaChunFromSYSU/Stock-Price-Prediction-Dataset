It's not if there is, but WHEN there is a financial collapse. It is not the financial wizards on Wall Street that's causing the coming financial implosion, it's GOVERNMENT DEBT. Your precious JUG EARS is the PROBLEM with the social justice and green agenda. Romney is only marginally better in regards to solving the debt problem. The trouble with most people is they choose a political party much like they choose their favorite football tear, then the adopt this 'us against them' mentality, it's the rivalry that's becomes all important. I've got news for you: The republicans have no solutions. The democrats have no solutions. Yet you all choose a side and get about espousing that side's talking points, like the political zombies you are.

'Republicans have no solutions' 'Democrats have no solutions' All agreed. But government debt, obscene as it is, isn't causing the purposeful (and yes it's being done on purpose) financial collapse. Study the Federal Reserve, which is neither federal or reserving anything but it's own private profits to see ALL money is debt. It starts as debt, is made of debt, and even though some profit, it's still debt. The huge banks compound the problem by playing derivatives speculating with that debt, and as we see, when it all goes to hades, they get the indebted tax payer to bail them out. Study where the interest goes on this obscene government debt and see why the deficits are kept high. Study where the debt goes on our near worthless dollar and see why it's nearly worthless. Note the government (even the Social Security Department) buying 100s of thousands of rounds of ammo and you can see that the government knows their sham is about to collapse, and everyone can see what will happen when it does. I'll vote neither Repub or Dem. I still like the IWW, the Wobblies, but we are so far the down the looking glass now Alice will never come home. The Mad Hatters have wrecked it and put the winnings in their pockets. That 32 Trillion offshore. Fact. Calling me an idiot won't get it fixed or get you one tiny grain of corn. What we are seeing is the ultimate result of capitalism. Especially this rogue free market (that isn't free but skewed toward the huge investor, whether they win or lose) is all about. It could not have gone any other way.

The USA came out of World War II a creditor nation. It was the redoubtable Ronald Reagan that took the nation back to being a debtor nation. EVERY president since has increasingly borrowed more (don't give your blinders on crap that it was just the repubs). JUG EARS has borrowed the most, however in fairness, JUG EARS can't totally be blamed as it is Congress that appropriates the money to be spent(thus necessitating the borrowing). You are correct again about the tax cutting repubs. I believe the tax rates could be raised on the UNPRODUCTIVE RICH, like Romney himself, Wall Street speculators, the 1000% unproductive Karedashians. There needs to be a way to focus the tax cuts on the PRODUCTIVE rich. Romney and his ilk shouldn't enjoy tax breaks in perpetuity because at one time they made their money with money. Matter of fact our whole tax structure should be focused on encouraging the 5 percent productive element in our society. Everything in society emanates from those proud, industrious and independent souls, however the government increasingly burdens them more and more to squander on the UNPRODUCTIVE. What happens when your government makes the burden unbearable? You have less incentive to put forth the effort and if your business permits you move it off shore. Take for instance, the attack on the coal industry which JUG EARS is at war with. The coal fired generating plants MOVE TO CHINA along with all the attendant industries. The USA has cleaner air and that's wonderful, but nothing has been achieved, instead of the USA producing the pollution China spews it out while eating our lunch. Yes, JUG EARS is winning the green battles, but losing the green war as China pollutes far more than the USA would -- AND CHINA REAPS THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT. The endeavor to stop global warming is in worse shape and the greenies in the USA are so proud, are there bigger idiots anywhere. Wake up you dumb bassturds, you are going to stupid yourselves out of a country. You can't borrow $0.43 cents of every government dollar spent and have a country for long, the economic grim reaper is sharpening up the scythe.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1345234001000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345234140000-65</Id><Title>Why I Hate Ebay - Buyer Protection</Title><Msg>This buyer protection crappp from Ebay has got to end.

To make a long story short, ebay sided with the Buyer. They had him ship it back to me, and then I tested it. It worked just fine. So because the buyer probably had buyers remorse, or didn't like the product after all, they forced me to take it back. Well, this was sold with NO RETURN policy, yet they still made it come back to me. So the idiot buyer could have damaged the product, and I'm sure ebay still would have forced the product back to me. This is ALL WRONG. Buyer protection policy like this should not exist for Buyers who are stupid, or have buyers remorse.

I know illiterate types have a problem with figurative and literal speech. An example: you are literally an idiot. You are figuratively the biggest idiot on Earth.
