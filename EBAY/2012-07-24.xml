Ending times are scattered. When I'm looking at auctions ending within an hour I don't want to miss out on something ending in two minutes because it falls after a bunch of auctions ending later. I'm not even sure Advanced Search would solve this problem. I do know that when I tried it came up with items not related to what I wanted and therefore had to change my wording, adding to the hassle. I just don't get why ebay went and messed Search up! It's going to cut into my buying dramatically.</Msg><Username>mntndo67</Username><Timestamp>1343107376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 01:22:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343107558000-3</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY DECREASING BUSINESS</Title><Username>olojinomic</Username><Timestamp>1343069392000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 14:49:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watch it get worse since they messed up Search results.

Thousands of great sellers are being held hostage right now by unfair new evaluation practices. Not only are thousands of eBay store small business owners loosing it all, but customers are becoming outraged. This pattern will surely result in the very rapid decline of eBay profits and stock values. Please heed my warning and do what you can do to influence an instant fix to this new pending financial disaster. Attached is more information on what is going on. Please help US before it's too late. http://ecorporateoffices.com/Ebay-146 http://www.sps.ebay.com/sd/sdperfdetails?spsProgram=US&amp;tabValue=lastEval My account was evaluated on the 20th. As you can see by viewing my page, everything was inline for me to be classes back as an above rated seller. Yet, all of my funds from previuos sales are on hold by Paypal waiting for delivery confirmation. I cant ship the items because the money is on hold. I can't refund the customer's money because the money they paid me is on hold. Hence, more unhappy customers=lower seller status= Less profit for US all.

"We may be standing in the shadow of being close to a resolution," said Rep. Howard Coble (R, N.C.). A U.S. House Judiciary Committee hearing did not iron out every detail and showed that concerns remain about the practicalities of using a streamlined software system to automate the collection of state and local sales taxes. But the hearing revealed that a large number of lawmakers had moved beyond the question of the legitimacy of collecting online sales taxes and were focused on how to avoid making the process overly burdensome. "It may not be the beginning of the end but it may be the end of the beginning," said Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R, Va.). He added that "I'm completely sold on the fairness issue."</Msg><Username>edssports</Username><Timestamp>1343157152000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:12:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343158169000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Funniest Part Of The "Everyone Is One Poster" Myth</Title><Username>johnosborne.toolfool</Username><Timestamp>1343072828000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 15:47:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"but you sure are G@Y for that name" Charles, There you go with the gay talk again.

I live in Evanston IL the city has not funded the police and fire pension funds they commit to providing the pension but do not have the funds to meet the commitment, personally I think this should be made illegal! Evanston is in Cook County whiuch has just enacted a cigar tax which will probably kill off the retail cigar business sending the buyers out of state to Indiana or online this is putting thousands of people out of work and killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Cook County is in Illinois which owes payment to contractors in the amount of billions of dollars, how would you like to own a company that does business with Illinois and have them say they arent able to pay you for the work done? In the meantime there are virtually no gambling machines in Illinois bars and there is no casino in Chicago that is because they cant get agreement to do the creative sin tax revenue generating policies either. In the meantime county ans state employess are promised outrageous pensions that neither can afford to pay least of all the taxpayers!</Msg><Username>moochiethebeagle</Username><Timestamp>1343159167000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343159674000-53</Id><Title>Broke John Z50com Sobering Up While Sullied Taint Gets Far Worse?</Title><Msg>Go figure!

You should've listen when I told you to get out. Don't get greedy. Sully" I know. But I am going to stick with yout original plan/advice which was to buy and STAY long. I do not have your uncanny prowess when IT comes to getting in and getting out with massive profITs. I am long and strong with a mighty fortress. However, as always, I am open to any signs you might be picking up on aapl. Do tell again if needed....privately. As always. Your help is appreciated by more people than you know! Thank-you, soldier!!! -Sully Rules ps- We are all getting quite a chuckle when you patiently put our self-professed, non-trading NARU in her place. So entertaining!!!!!</Msg><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1343179583000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:26:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343184527000-73</Id><Title>God I wish another Auction site would....</Title><Msg>knock ebay off its perch.</Msg><Username>mntndo67</Username><Timestamp>1343184527000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 22:48:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343185212000-74</Id><Title>I'd like to see a VISA auction site</Title><Msg>Everybod has a VISA, put paypal to sleep.</Msg><Username>mntndo67</Username><Timestamp>1343185212000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
