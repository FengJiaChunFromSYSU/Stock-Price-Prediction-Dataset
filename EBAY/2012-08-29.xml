Wake up and smell the outsourcing. This is very much a service economy with the brains creating high paying jobs in America while the "productive" jobs are outsourced to Vietnam. It is a pity because that productive elememt included many workers who did not have an ownership stake in the businesses to which they greatly contributed. Your anger over the President's comment reads like that of a petty entrepreneur who feared his workers, looked down on his customers and does not understand why others succeeded and he didn't. Successful business owners are usually grateful to the people who help them get where they are.</Msg><Username>flyktning_alltid</Username><Timestamp>1346223598000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 02:59:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346244538000-2</Id><Title>Is eBay about to plunge?

You are as stupid as JUG EARS. What you are is a victim of prosperity. You naively think an economy can thrive selling each other pizzas and lattes. Outsourcing? JUG EARS is the outsourcer in chief. JUG EARS war on coal through EPA regulations has China bringing online a new coal fired power plant every two weeks. China isn't building that much electrical capacity to enhance China's "service economy", they are building it to PRODUCE. Every coal fired plant JUG EARS closes in the US essentially reopens in China with all the ATTENDANT JOBS that once were in the USA. How can you people put so much faith in JUG EARS? The man is a total fake and a lovable puppet of his communist handlers. You all can't be that stupid to believe JUG EARS is good for this country. Romney is a total buffoon, but for America he's a million times better that the communistic JUG EARS.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346257744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 12:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346258464000-10</Id><Topic><Title>RNC "We Built This" With 62% Of Public Funds</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1346089627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 13:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You all can't be that stupid to believe JUG EARS is good for this country.

He's mirroring Roosevelt's 8 years (1932-1940) of economic misery. Roosevelt's domestic policies were a disaster. I do have great admiration for FDR, he was the perfect wartime president, couldn't imagine anyone better. FDR prosecuted World War Two expertly. His genius was choosing the best people to do the job and giving them the autonomy to do the job as opposed to a meddling Hitler who saw himself as a military genius. Roosevelt reached way down in the general ranks to choose my personal hero General George C. Marshall who magnificently managed the war effort. Thank God we had a productive economy instead of a "service economy" for Marshall to build the machines of war. I pray every day this country doesn't encounter a conflict like WWII under JUG EARS term, JUG EARS couldn't manage a lemonade stand and besides the military hates JUG EARS guts (or more appropriately --gutlessness).</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346259232000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 12:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346260705000-12</Id><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on eBay</Title><Msg>Im in shock!eBay is on the verge of a major change in trend.

When we get poor enough the jobs will come back. It does not matter who is president as the economy runs itself with little public sector input. I agree we need industrial jobs here at home, but the American economy is too expensive because of all the promises we have made in the form of social security, private pensions and health care delivery. This is not really any president's fault though some action to arrest the growth in entitlements might have been nice. In any event, we are getting poorer as jobs decline and more people are left to scrounge for their existence. These people falling off the economic wagon and there are millions of them will hold down wages and prices and gtrowth will stagnate until we get a little poorer. And then the jobs will start to trickle back. "JUG EARS war on coal through EPA regulations has China bringing online a new coal fired power plant every two weeks." Let China destroy its environment. Mother Nature only gives us so many second chances. This is why I worry about global warming. You screw da pooch on that it could be game over. Our great grandchildren will regard us worse than we regard yesterday's slaveowners.</Msg><Username>flyktning</Username><Timestamp>1346263234000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 14:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346263356000-15</Id><Topic><Title>BULLISH</Title><Username>precious_krystal34</Username><Timestamp>1346244101000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 08:41:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great call!</Msg><Username>tressa_caitlin</Username><Timestamp>1346263356000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 14:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346268923720-16</Id><Title>Yahoo Finance raised target on ebay :$48.27</Title><Msg>Yahoo Finance has raised the target on ebay today to :$48.27 from 48.02 Target going up every day for Ebay.
