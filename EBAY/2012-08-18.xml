That is the nicest compliment ever! I try my best to dumb myself down on this board, but apparently you can see right through me!! LOLOLOL! Just kidding! If I remember right, one of the first posts I ever responded to, because it was so clever and funny, was “Ebay Buries Another Mistake” “33 percent of it”! You, and the author of your intended compliment, and everyone in this thread, seem to have brought a nice shiny coat of laquer to the board! This board would be boring without the brainiacs!</Msg><Username>a_car_this_fine</Username><Timestamp>1345269449000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 01:57:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345269586000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Vote for Paul Ryan</Title><Username>paul_ryan_vp</Username><Timestamp>1345226590000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:03:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That’s right Sully!

Tumble down shack on Big Foot country. Snowed so hard that the roof caved in. Delilah Jones went to meet her God, And the old man never was the same again. Daddy made whiskey and he made it well. Cost two dollars and it burned like hell. I cut hick'ry just to fire the still, Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill.

It would have been a far better world. Far better. I'm reminded of the famous quote "Who you going to believe, me or your lying eyes" when it comes the fact of global climate change only being "debate-able" basically because the Koch brothers spend billions for their own "scientists" and Fow "news" is paid to spread their nonsense.

He would not own ocean front property. According to him, sooner than later it would be under water. And just how do you know we would of been better off with Gore. Everyone can be a armchair quarterback come Monday morning. The US could stop polluting tomorrow and we would still be heading down the same road. Europe,Asia,India and China are huge polluters compared to the US. Their are too many people on the planet.....maybe when the bodies start stacking up in the streets of China and India those countries might do something about it.</Msg><Username>gewizmeto</Username><Timestamp>1345335681000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 20:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345336442000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting Extreme Right Wing Doubts On Ryan</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1345130853000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right about the see thru part....and i have been seeing it for a long time.....LOL I can keep a secret!</Msg><Username>gewizmeto</Username><Timestamp>1345336442000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 20:34:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345337407000-17</Id><Topic><Title>"Gone are the days........</Title><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1345301011000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:43:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anybody who signs their first name followed by (Rules) is looking for a fight!
