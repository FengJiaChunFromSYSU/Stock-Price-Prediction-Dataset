Troll that board eternally loser. Even her own neglected children and grand children will #$%$ on her grave. We all can see she is utterly obsessed and not worth another breath. Even poor Uncle Flyktning, my failed daddy's boyfriend, and Sybil Sully will #$%$ on Johnie too but that's just because they can no longer hold their bladders. Old "men" in a lost game. Poor Johnie, The biggest failure ever! 12 years for nothing! Being nothing. Standing for nothing, but her hate. It would be funny if this had not been at the cost of her, and others, families. Oh well, karma will be served. Piping hot! A true failure is when your family hates you.

Do you still think it wise to host that sick psycho Johns_Joint on your boards here making public threats to people and taunting those he mistakenly thinks are dead? I think bad things will happen to that guy and we see hosting that sick board troll year after year keeps sinking Yahoo and all things Yahoo. I hope that helps. Really I do.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1362253818413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:50:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362255078250-4</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Yahoo.

You have no pictures of your enemy, just people you wrongly think are your enemy. You never were much of a driver on the Information Highway. But everyone is getting a very clear public picture of what an obsessed sicko you are. Who is that still living at 5008 Hanover Circle Cypress CA 90630? I am so glad HE gave me that address to post. We need to keep an eye on psychos like you, oh yes we do. I hope that helps. PS: What good will any of your long term public illness do you the second your breath stops?
