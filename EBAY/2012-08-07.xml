As a Board Elder I've noticed he takes over threads and makes them about himself, then they, and poster's IDs vanish. Also, kuddos for talking with him MS Midnite as I recall he addressed you under a far more derogatory name. Anyways, tried to post this yesterday but Mommy wasn't having it: Leave it to the UK Guardian to post what US papers can't, but you can see on Truthout.org.21 to 32 TRILLION! When you look at the shell of the once thriving society we live in, it explains a lot. The media always points to the tiny welfare cheats because these giant welfare cheats own it. Don't be fooled over that, and don't be fooled by nose bleed territory over pumped ebay stock. It still pays not dividend. I wonder how many ebay insiders dump their pumped unexpensed shares and hide the profits offshore. Jobs for the Caymans!

It posits that taxes would have to go up on someone to make the plan pay for itself. Reality is that the plan would never pay for itself and Repub tax policies will only increase the deficit. If Mitt Romney wins, you can watch with your own eyes as the deficit widens. Republicans have this magical thinking that says that if you cut taxes, it will spur so much growth that revenues will increase. Such laissez faire economic policies lead to boom-and-bust cycles like we saw in 1987 and 2008. Another problem with GOP policies is they increase budget deficits as happened under Reagan and Bush 2. They cannot be trusted with a budget even more than Democrats cannot be trusted. Neither major party is ready for serious budget reform.</Msg><Username>flyktning_alltid</Username><Timestamp>1344353355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 11:29:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344353571000-13</Id><Topic><Title>ebayalphamale ~ S/B alphabitmale</Title><Username>ebay_paid</Username><Timestamp>1251992245000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2009-09-03 11:37:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"As a Board Elder" ~ LOL 2009 isn't an elder!

I agree neither candidate for President, and almost no other lesser politicians have a plan on the coming storm because they are owned lock stock and barrel by the profiteers causing said storm. Some of these groups, like Goldman Sachs, think they can somehow profit by turning society inside out. Just for the sake of discussion: 1. Offshore cash. It's going to be worthless too, and can one access it in troubled times? And send it where? 2. Gold. Shiny and fun, but you can't eat it.

Alphamale, Surely you can't such a shallow thinker or oblivious to history's lessons. Kyle Bass advised buying gold BECAUSE after the economic collapse it it the only thing TRANSPORTABLE that will have REAL value. Kyle Bass advised buying guns TO PROTECT THE GOLD. Instead of being here espousing your infantile political dogma you ought to be out on the gun range becoming expert on every weapon you possibly can. Just to give you an idea of what to expect after the economic crash, think Rwanda, think Somalia where young alpha male thugs control the population. Think hundreds of thousands human beings floating dead in the Mississippi River. You are so naive and life experience-less that you won't survive a nanosecond. If you are young you will certainly experience something far more horrendous than Germany's Holocaust, you can't even imagine how despicable men will act when a society collapses and the is mass hunger. Quaint by coming future anarchy, I remember that in the last depression rich people's Cadillacs and Lincolns were stoned and they parked them and bought a plain model Ford or Chevy to drive.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1344365182000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 14:46:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344365757000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's tax plan crunches middle class</Title><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1344289413000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:43:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, by the way, Since DO NOTHING FOR THE USA Jugs Ears was elected there has been unprecedented record gun sales and factories are straining to keep up with the demand for ammunition.

First off, I agree with your central premise, and rest assured, I am well versed on every kind of weapon. Anyone who says gold is easily transportable hasn't had more than 10k of it. Yes, history shows it can be a hedge, but not always for the little guy. The sight of it will interest gangs and governments of your presense and survival. Same with guns. They can only go so far. To use your analogy on Somalia (and "kuddos" on the needless innuendo of equating my ID with the punks, not alphas, of Somalia). Wade into that crowd of war lords with your gun to protect you and barter a piece of that gold for food, water, or anything else needed and see how it goes. Myself, I'm hedging with much of the above, and a sweet piece of land (if I can get to it in time and keep it) and my friends, because the quality of friends in the coming times will be the ultimate survival resource. PS: 1. The evidence shows the powers that be want a crash. They think they'll profit by it. 2. Only people with no reading skills think I'm a Democrat, who are only a shade better than the completely corrupt and conniving Regubs. And 3. I'm going to need to see a link on that stoning of Caddilacs because I think that's as made up as the "spitting on returning Nam vets" myth.</Msg><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1344370565000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:16:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344371999000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's tax plan crunches middle class</Title><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1344289413000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:43:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Anyone who says gold is easily transportable hasn't had more than 10k of it."
