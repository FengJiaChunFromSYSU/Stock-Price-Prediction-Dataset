I put every plant in its place, in its row. Some I water and others I let get very hot and dry. Some plants are sweet but a few are very bitter. It is not for the plants to know they are salad. They live their days sweating soil. I certainly live my days as I choose. No mono crops. No garden trolls. No GMOs. I hope that helps.</Msg><Username>madbezos.angels</Username><Timestamp>1372858019114</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:26:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372859693690-3</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From My Free Speech Garden In Philadelphia</Title><Username>madbezos.angels</Username><Timestamp>1372858019114</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:26:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe you should do a little DD on the real Madbezos Your writing style is nothing like the professors A simple search here on this board will reveal his writing skills that you lack Why can't YOU just let him rest in PEACE Do you HATE him that much?
