Ebay claims the package is not track-able??? This Ebay policy will result is a decline in sales as EBAY sellers will now be forced to either use a much more expensive "TRACK-ABLE" shipping service ( a turn-off for International buyers) or simply not ship to International addresses.</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1373180014483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 02:53:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
