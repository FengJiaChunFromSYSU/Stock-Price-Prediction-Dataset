"Paul Ryan's budget does not eliminate a single unconstitutional cabinet (Department of Education, EPA, HHS, SBA and hundreds of agencies like USAID), illegal spending for foreign aid, payments to the International Monetary Fund and other foreign entanglements.

"I'm sorry to say that conservatives who support the "comeback team" are supporting the continued destruction of this republic." "(Ryan) Voted to create the Department of (Fatherland) Homeland Security which includes the TSA molestation administration. Last December he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act, one I misjudged as not so dangerous, but later learned is no different than the old Soviet Union with their gulags. Ryan voted against an amendment to remove the provisions that allows for American citizens to be picked up on U.S. soil and held indefinitely without charges being filed.

JUGS EARS continues the march to totalitarianism, Romney will be a great manger of the decline as Gingrich stated. We have to be wrecked as a country before things will get better this time.
