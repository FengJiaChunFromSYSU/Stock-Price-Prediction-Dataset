Maybe I should word that, how do I mark an item down so buyers can see the mark down? I have seen auctions where there is a red line through the original price and it shows the sale price.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1350914514909</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350916417892-4</Id><Topic><Title>There's that Pesky Ebay $50 Again</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1350914034629</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:53:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have to have an Ebay store to use markdown manager. I liked that feature but it wasn't worth the $15 a month Ebay charges for a store. I pay a little more for listings but Ebay is denied my $15. I dropped my store because Ebay ripped me off of being a Top Rated Seller for a month and I lost $50 in FVF discounts so I closed our store for a few months to make up the difference. Sometimes I HATE Ebay! ! !</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1350916417892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350916649774-5</Id><Title>Mannkind - MNKD - Potential Blockbuster Drug - Under $2.00</Title><Msg>The announcement that Mannkind has issued a new secondary to raise funds has created a buying opportunity. Mannkind's insulin drug, Afrezza, could receive F.D.A. approval as early as September,2013 if it is granted "priority review" status. With $1.6 billion in tax-loss carry forwards and insulin inventory to produce $10,000,000,000 worth of Afrezza the company in a potential takeover target which may be why Mr. Mann probably decided to convert so much debt to equity at $2.59/share last week. A "big-pharma" partnership could happen at any time. Consider buying a few shares below $2.00 before the approval run-up begins.</Msg><Username>aunttizzy</Username><Timestamp>1350916649774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:37:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917356412-6</Id><Topic><Title>There's that Pesky Ebay $50 Again</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1350914034629</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:53:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks. I listed 5 things for the first time in over a year and eBay pulled 3 of them. Reminded me of why I quit selling on a regular basis. Just sold one of the 3 off ebay and was told by that person the other 2 should not have been pulled. Luckily that person emailed me before the one got pulled so I contacted him and he was more than happy to pay my asking price...plus paid as a PP gift so no fees there either... I stuck it to eBay and am proud of it. Thanks again.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1350917356412</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:49:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350918246250-7</Id><Topic><Title>$10 Bucks away from a New ....</Title><Username>keimosaabe</Username><Timestamp>1350908471055</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 08:21:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will get thief.
