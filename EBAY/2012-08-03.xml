It was the official ending of the cold war since the 60's. It all happened on Reagan's watch. Remember star wars.....and the Tear down that wall directive. It was a big sigh of relief to see the nuclear threat diminished and a major push for nuclear reduction. That spending bought some big changes. When it came to foreign policy the whole world listened. We recovered economically from Ron's spending......so don't tie him to what we have going on today. The albatross belongs to Bush and Obama.</Msg><Username>gewizmeto</Username><Timestamp>1343982513000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 04:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343987834000-2</Id><Title>A Gift for "bush to go"</Title><Msg>weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!!!! http://m.newyorker.com/online/blogs/borowitzreport/2012/08/chick-fil-a-introduces-new-hate-sauce.html -Sully Rules</Msg><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1343987834000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 05:57:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343991070000-3</Id><Title>Gross: BTG luffingly gaping at A Dallas Chick Fil A</Title><Msg>Kisses only, bloat!!!! -Sully Rules</Msg><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1343991070000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 06:51:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343998373000-4</Id><Title>Doesn't ebay own 20% of meli?</Title><Msg>I thought i read that somewhere.</Msg><Username>camel892</Username><Timestamp>1343998373000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 08:52:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344006236000-5</Id><Topic><Title>A Gift for "bush to go"</Title><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1343987834000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 05:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How trapped in the past ARE you?

I've been hard on you in the past and realize you see this issue far more accurately then I' thought. The Reagan debt never really went away and has been sitting there compounding, along with the massive GW Bush debt increases and frankly, Obama's. We've been at war in the third world since Reagan too and that's never ended, all built by debt as well. We still borrow billions a day from China to keep the lights on in DC yet it seems still too dark there to see the obvious, because all kidding aside, government work, and government office, is the biggest "entitlement" program of all. We already have a twisted form of communism in the USA, where State gets everything but at the expense of the people, to benefit itself, and the huge corporations. Large banks live on the debt the little people only have to pay, trying to keep their businesses open, trying to jump through all the laws and loopholes, while government subsidizes all investment and tax dodging off shore.</Msg><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1344008760000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 11:46:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344008891000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Sharpey</Title><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1343945548000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:12:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"(As agqut worded it, it will be a vote cast against someone.)"

How have those tax cuts helped the wealthy to the extent you imply? They are still in a higher tax bracket plus they must pay the alternative minimum tax plus they don't qualify for many of the deductions those in the lower income bracket do. The biggest tax break, IMO, is that on capitol gains but all Americans are privy to that, aren't they? Or is it assumed that those in the lower income bracket cannot afford investments therefore that makes it unfair? In order to level the playing field perhaps capital gains should be paid at the same rate as income but not more like Obama wants. A while back I posted this on my FB page (I have tried like hell not to get political on my page but sometimes I can't help myself). I didn't get a very big response but I didn't expect to. One person said, ouch that makes my head hurt. I forget what the few others said: Did you know the current Tax Code is 7500 pages? That's 7500 pages of rules for filing your taxes. Our tax system is broken. Today I looked up what the "tax breaks for the wealthy" are. The second largest "tax break" is the deduction of mortgage interest. (Apparently you are considered "wealthy" if you can afford to own a home and it's considered an unfair tax break to those who don't since they can't take the deduction.) The #1 largest tax break is employer deduction of medical insurance to its employees. Doesn't that encourage companies to offer free health insurance to its employees? I'm thinking if that tax break is eliminated it will be one employee benefit you won't see much of anymore. Same with 401K plans (#4 on the list). #3 on this list is capitol gains (currently fixed tax rate of 15%). That means if you own a home, retire and downsize you currently pay 15% capital gains tax on the profit of the home you sold. It's on the table to raise that to 39.6% plus another 5.2% for some other tax. That's 44.8%. Ouch. Doesn't pay to downsize. Think real estate is hurting now? One last note, the "alternative minimum tax" is an extra tax paid by the wealthy (and some middle class) over and above the current tax bracket rates. This tax is to make sure the wealthy are paying their fair share and aren't getting over with the "tax breaks" mentioned above. So doesn't the bottom line "tax owned" balance out for "the wealthy"?

That is a common misunderstanding of the alternative minimum tax. It is paid INSTEAD of the regular rates. It can be paid at a lower rate but still be a higher tax because some deductions allowable against regular tax are not deductible against alternative minimum tax. But it is not an "add-on" tax. There is no proposal to raise the long term gain rate to 39.6 percent for the wealthy. Obama hasn't proposed it and it would not gain support of quite a few Democrats if he did. Your post is essentially a fear factor one not rooted in political realities. And what about this threat to lie down and stop working if your taxes get any higher. That is not what got a small business owner anywhere and such a retirement will simply leave the same business opportunity to someone else. Higher taxes could raise the cost of capital, but not the need for capital. There is plenty of capital around in this and other economies. Higher taxes are an inevitable PART of the kind of fiscal restraint the federal government will need to undertake someday even if it is imposed by outside lenders.</Msg><Username>flyktning_alltid</Username><Timestamp>1344012802000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 12:53:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344012918000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Sharpey</Title><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1343945548000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:12:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Being "IN" the business of taxes What do you think of a flat rate tax with no deductions?</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1344012918000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 12:55:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344012994000-38</Id><Title>12.5 years</Title><Msg>Many people on this board have advised you to quell your fruitless and petty needling of others.

The seven figure incomes are usually planned for as "regular taxpayers", not "alternative" ones, but it has to be determined case by case.</Msg><Username>flyktning_alltid</Username><Timestamp>1344019392000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:43:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344019510000-66</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Sharpey</Title><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1343945548000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:12:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wasn not talking about delaying the payment of taxes past the due date.

Reuters’ Sam Youngman reported on a related issue: His vast fortune is invested in dozens of funds linked to Bain Capital LLC, the powerhouse private equity firm he co-founded and led for 15 years. Several Bain funds have offshore connections and take advantage of tax breaks used only by the U.S. financial elite. His tax returns could shed light on how Romney and Bain use offshore strategies to avoid taxes, said Daniel Berman, a former U.S. Treasury deputy international tax counsel and now director of tax at Boston University’s graduate tax program. Bain funds in which Romney is invested are scattered from Delaware to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, Ireland and Hong Kong, according to a Reuters analysis of securities filings. http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2012_01/romneys_offshore_accounts_draw034846.php</Msg><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1344025463000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 16:24:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344027096000-70</Id><Topic><Title>romney creates jobs for OFF SHORE banker's</Title><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1344025463000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 16:24:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;&lt;"His tax returns could shed light on how Romney and Bain use offshore strategies to avoid taxes"&gt;&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, I thought you said Romney hasn't filed tax returns for 10 years.

Strategically it makes sense for Romney not to release his tax returns. Everybody is assuming the worst on offshoring and capital gains tax reduction, but the truth may be even worse. Foreign investing is a financial management necessity, but foreign stashing of a US citizen's worldwide income is fraudulent.

He still would have had to pay income taxes on any money he made in the U.S. that ended up in an off shore bank. IF he made foreign investments from his off shore bank acct. he avoided income taxes on any gains from said investments. Maybe tax avoidance and not exactly ethical from that standpoint but it is certainly legal.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1344038311000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 19:58:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344046641000-78</Id><Topic><Title>Why is DRIBLLES so obsessed with John??</Title><Username>sullyinma2009</Username><Timestamp>1344028909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 17:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems like the "board" you're after belongs to a long long long ago poster that you, my imposter, dumb old John and your crazy sick Sybil ID can't get out of your minds or mouths.
