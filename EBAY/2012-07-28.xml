It's too obvious you never invest (even in your own lost family) because your gurlies are up here day and night blathering about "all one poster" and believing your own stupid lies. Investors don't do that. In actuality, people will not listen to a broke mentally ill board troll who, with his other ID pals, blathers 247 for 12 long years, as your z50com ebay fails, your daughter seeks heroin for a father, and you couldn't even pay for your drug growing hovel at 5008 Hanover Circle Cypress, CA 90630. Investors do not respect dead beat bums and failed father/grandfathers huffing weed and melting about obsessions. Ebay is a pumped up wonder right now. Won't last. You won't last either. Why waste your old man days melting and obsessing on your lies?</Msg><Username>johnosborne.toolfool</Username><Timestamp>1343490387000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343491179000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Dribbles Short Selling Advise</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1343438946000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 21:29:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sold the place for $445,000 Enough to pay the bills for a long time ~ LOL</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1343491179000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:59:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343491406000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon P/E at 289</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1343490172000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:42:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can they believe a broke homeless pot head talking investments?

You always were a lying fountain of llies, melt and disinformnation. I do believe your daughter got clear away from your abuse and neglect though. First smart thing an Osborne's done in 3 generations. Everyone but you, and your similar pals, can see you're a life time loser, a sad intellictually inferior drop out, always angry at the educated, always angry at the world, and not able to face your personal 'proclicities' while you project that sickness on whoever you can target and an every day effort for 12 long years has only got you laughed at, outed, poorer, more mentally messed up, and tossed out of your dope house, but I guess as long as Sully and Sully's Licker laugh with you you'll pretend not to face that you are a loser, a worthless loser, and your lives were completely wasted. And the only thing you ever did that was almost something has moved far away from you. Melt on Sparky. It's all you have and all you'll ever ever have old man. One might say that was tragic were it to happen to a normal human. With you? Too bad.

Talk about WELFARE for the rich!? The American people should be outraged with the "rigged"(from the bottom up) wealth transfer that has occurred during the past 30 years. According to forbes, "If you’re making more than $50,000, you’re in the top 44% of Americans." which means 56% of Americans earn less than $50K which is $22K LESS than the romney's $77K tax deduction for their HORSE??!!
