JUG EARS through his writings, his spoken words and most importantly his actions has demonstrated contempt for the USA. I have disliked presidents, but I have never feared one, until now. JUG EARS has that that certain magnetism that draws people into believing (though he has zero knowledge or experience) that he is a legitimate leader. Just what Valerie Jarrett's Chicago communist organization needed to succeed in achieving power. In collage it was observed that JUG EARS had the unique ability to make everyone believe he was on their side. It there were 50 people in a room, each one was convinced they alone had a special relationship and understanding with JUG EARS. The first time I became aware of JUG EARS and the cult following he generated my mind instantly conjured up images of the worst atrocities ever visited upon human beings,. It was not a stretch to envision H1tler, Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin. How people would willingly and enthusiastically follow a bogus leader like JUG EARS and evil leaders to their own destruction still baffles the mind. For all my life I've sought an answer to how a despot like H1tler could have ever risen to power in an advanced educated society like Germany. Still can't understand it, yet we have the same evil phenomenon playing out right now in the USA. What possesses humans to be attracted to these despots?</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346141731657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 04:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346158310000-2</Id><Title>eBay is showing historic technical movement</Title><Msg>eBay looks really unstable right now.

The film, written and narrated by conservative scholar Dinesh D'Souza, argues that Obama was heavily influenced by what D'Souza calls the "anti-colonial" beliefs of his father, Barack Obama Sr., a Kenyan academic who was largely absent from the president's life. To document that claim, D'Souza travels to Kenya to interview members of Obama's extended family as well as to Hawaii and Indonesia, where Obama grew up. He also cites several actions and policy positions Obama has taken to support the thesis that Obama is ideologically rooted in the Third World and harbors contempt for the country that elected him its first black president. The assertion that Obama's presidency is an expression of his father's political beliefs, which D'Souza first made in 2010 in his book "The Roots of Obama's Rage," is almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best. It's true that Obama's father lived most of his life in Kenya, an African nation once colonized by the British, and that Obama's reverence for his absent father frames his best-selling memoir. D'Souza even sees clues in the book's title: "Notice it says 'Dreams From My Father,' not 'of' my father," D'Souza says. But it's difficult to see how Obama's political leanings could have been so directly shaped by his father, as D'Souza claims. The elder Obama left his wife and young son, the future president, when Obama was 2 and visited his son only once, when Obama was 10. But D'Souza frames that loss as an event that reinforced rather than weakened the president's ties to his father, who died in a car crash when Obama was in college. D'Souza interviews Paul Vitz, a New York University psychologist who has studied the impact of absent fathers on children. In Obama's case, Vitz says, the abandonment meant "he has the tension between the Americanism and his Africanism. He himself is an intersection of major political forces in his own psychology." From there, the evidence D'Souza uses to support his assertion starts to grow thin. D'Souza says Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, shared his father's left-leaning views. After living in Indonesia for several years, D'Souza said, Dunham sent the younger Obama to live with his grandparents in Hawaii so he would not be influenced by her second husband, Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian who worked for American oil companies and fought communists as a member of the Indonesian army. "Ann separates Barry from Lolo's growing pro-Western influence," D'Souza says in the film. Obama has said his mother had sent him back to Hawaii so he would be educated in the United States. In Hawaii, D'Souza asserts with no evidence, Obama sympathized with native Hawaiians who felt they had been marginalized by the American government when Hawaii was becoming a state. D'Souza also asserts — again with no evidence — that Obama had been coached to hold those views at Punahou, the prestigious prep school he attended in Honolulu. "Oppression studies, if you will. Obama got plenty of that when he was here in Punahou," D'Souza says, standing on the campus. In Kenya, D'Souza interviews Philip Ochieng, a lifelong friend of the president's father, who claims the elder Obama was "totally anti-colonial." Ochieng also discloses some of his own political views, complaining about U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Iraq and saying the U.S. refuses to "tame" Israel, which he calls a "Trojan horse in the Middle East." D'Souza seems to suggest that if a onetime friend of Obama's late father holds those opinions, so too must the president himself. D'Souza then goes through a list of actions Obama has taken as president to support his thesis. Many of them don't hold water: — D'Souza rightly argues that the national debt has risen to $16 trillion under Obama. But he never mentions the explosion of debt that occurred under Obama's predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, nor the 2008 global financial crisis that provoked a shock to the U.S. economy. — D'Souza says Obama is "weirdly sympathetic to Muslim jihadists" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He does not mention that Obama ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the drone strikes that have killed dozens of terrorists in the region. —D'Souza wrongly claims that Obama wants to return control of the Falkland Islands from Britain to Argentina. The U.S. refused in April to endorse a final declaration on Argentina's claim to the islands at the Summit of the Americas, provoking criticism from other Latin American nations. —D'Souza says Obama has "done nothing" to impede Iran's nuclear ambitions, despite the severe trade and economic sanctions his administration has imposed on Iran to halt its suspected nuclear program. Obama opposes a near-term military strike on Iran, either by the U.S. or Israel, although he says the U.S. will never tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. — D'Souza says Obama removed a bust of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill from the Oval Office because Churchill represented British colonialism. White House curator William Allman said the bust, which had been on loan, was already scheduled to be returned before Obama took office. Another bust of Churchill is on display in the president's private residence, the White House says.</Msg><Username>barack_obama_in_2012</Username><Timestamp>1346179921986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:52:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346180391000-25</Id><Topic><Title>RNC "We Built This" With 62% Of Public Funds</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1346089627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 13:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT" The singular dumbest statement any US president has ever spoken.

JUG EARS is like Sarah Palin -- 100% idea-less and 100% vision-less, just big mouths saying nothing useful.

"YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT", in one non-teleprompter moment JUG EARS demeaned the contributions of the hard work of the American people.

Bush, who doesn't even have a bit-part at the GOP convention opening in Tampa. But W's ghost may be there, anyway. The National Weather Service says tropical storm Isaac is now heading for New Orleans, and Isaac is projected to become a Category 1 hurricane by the time it makes landfall late Monday or early Tuesday. Isaac is very likely to revive memories of the Bush administration's monumental incompetence in dealing with the needs of Americans caught in Hurricane Katrina. And if the public remembers the Bush administration's incompetence with Katrina, they may also recall the Bush administration's incompetence and its lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — which led us into that devastating war. And the public may recall how George W. Bush took the $5 trillion surplus Bill Clinton bequeathed to him and turned it into a $6 trillion budget deficit by slashing taxes, mostly on the rich, and by creating an expensive new Medicare drug benefit that helped drug companies more than it helped seniors. The public might even recall how the Bush administration tried not to see what Wall Street was up to when the Street went on a rampage of risky bets, and then, when Wall Street was about to melt down, pushed Congress into approving a no-strings bailout — both of which cost the nation billions more. Indeed, we're still living with George W. Bush's legacy — the last Republican to occupy the White House — which is a truth that Romney is desperate to put out of our minds. He wants to blame the bad economy, and most of everything else, on Obama. The GOP was intent on not even bringing up Bush's name at the GOP convention, because the former president might also remind Americans how little the Republicans care about average Americans, like those caught in Hurricane Katrina, and how much they care about top corporate and Wall Street executives, like those being entertained in Tampa. But Hurricane Isaac seems likely to remind Americans anyway. Let us hope and pray Isaac doesn't cause the disaster of Katrina. We can at least be confident that the Obama administration will respond as the Bush administration didn't. But the split screen on the TV newscasts — part GOP convention, part Hurricane Isaac bashing into the Gulf Coast — may nonetheless pose a public-relations disaster for the GOP."

Isaac is very likely to revive memories of the Bush administration's monumental incompetence in dealing with the needs of Americans caught in Hurricane Katrina. And if the public remembers the Bush administration's incompetence with Katrina, they may also recall the Bush administration's incompetence and its lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — which led us into that devastating war. And the public may recall how George W. Bush took the $5 trillion surplus Bill Clinton bequeathed to him and turned it into a $6 trillion budget deficit by slashing taxes, mostly on the rich, and by creating an expensive new Medicare drug benefit that helped drug companies more than it helped seniors. The public might even recall how the Bush administration tried not to see what Wall Street was up to when the Street went on a rampage of risky bets, and then, when Wall Street was about to melt down, pushed Congress into approving a no-strings bailout — both of which cost the nation billions more. Indeed, we're still living with George W. Bush's legacy — the last Republican to occupy the White House — which is a truth that Romney is desperate to put out of our minds. He wants to blame the bad economy, and most of everything else, on Obama. The GOP was intent on not even bringing up Bush's name at the GOP convention, because the former president might also remind Americans how little the Republicans care about average Americans, like those caught in Hurricane Katrina, and how much they care about top corporate and Wall Street executives, like those being entertained in Tampa. But Hurricane Isaac seems likely to remind Americans anyway. Let us hope and pray Isaac doesn't cause the disaster of Katrina. We can at least be confident that the Obama administration will respond as the Bush administration didn't. But the split screen on the TV newscasts — part GOP convention, part Hurricane Isaac bashing into the Gulf Coast — may nonetheless pose a public-relations disaster for the GOP."
