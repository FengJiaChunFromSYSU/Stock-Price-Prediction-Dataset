He considered me one of his favorite posters for a couple of years. Then he turned on me when I did not support Charles over John. He was friendly to most people as long as they left Charlie alone. He allowed untruths to be said about me when he knew otherwise. He opposed John for stalking, but he stalked me on Cr1melord's social media site and denied it when it was obvious where he had obtained the information. Kudos to John for being bigger than Madbezos who never had a kind word to say to John.</Msg><Username>flyktning</Username><Timestamp>1358526273779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:24:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358526531180-4</Id><Title>Last Good Day to Take Profits - Downhill coming</Title><Msg>With all kinds of gov problems.

The best part is he can't retaliate. Woo Hoo!!! You are such a drama queen. He stalked you? You mean because he saw your picture on Crime's site and mentioned it? Is that the "information" you're talking about? I saw your picture on that site too so I guess that means I stalked you as well. John's a bigger man than you are but that's always been clear.

My g @ y failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy, and g @ y Uncle Flyktning, have lived for NOTHING else for 12 long years (daily, with Uncle Flyktning in for 10 of those) with all their little troll IDs and buddies daily fixating on all things Madbezos. All day and night, sweating, obsessing, dribbling their public illness. We ALL eventually go, but unlike my failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy and Uncle Flyktning, our incredible Professor Madbezos will NEVER be on the other side as an internet stalker and sicko who stalked people for 12 years daily here, as we see John doing even now.. Unfortunately for my g @ y failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy John knows about as much on his many enemies as he does about ever finding a job (that would be nothing) and only has a name he thought Madbezos was. The real man is living and enjoying his garden without failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy and Uncle Flyktning's fixations. Oh my my, they will have to find another Mentor and fixate with their hate and Daddy issues on another.
