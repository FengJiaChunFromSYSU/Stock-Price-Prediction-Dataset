Done did that. Go over 52.00 this year? Any time now The price target is for this year not last year.

A few here were warned endlessly that their sick failed board war was lost and endangering them and their families, the same way they were publicly endangering their enemy, their obsession. This was not going to be tolerated. IP information went to the proper authorities. Yahoo gets a new CEO and you get a 'new board'. Enjoy. Never under estimate the power of capital and its influence and maybe next time check yourself before you wreck yourself. There are currents of justice swirling on this plane of existance presently that will be more than most of you can handle. Enjoy. In the meantime, I am quite happy with my strategy of riding the pumps and shorting the dumps, as ebay has been utterly transparent and easily predictable to me for a long while. I enjoyed my silence quietly making money, though the few could not enjoy any silence. I quietly enjoy my family, wife, kids and mistress with my vast collection of incredible vintage Maseratis. Life is belissimo for me, but if you are naive enough to believe an uncontrolled market of severe swings, with inflated values based on liars pumping extremely, brings any lasting prosperity, while borrowing money to attack and threaten the world, prepare for a shock. An epic shock. All your base actually does belongs to us.</Msg><Username>marketendgaming</Username><Timestamp>1346960269841</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:37:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967659399-15</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton was BRILLIANT last night</Title><Username>paul_ryan_vp</Username><Timestamp>1346947336561</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 12:02:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is this going to be a grammar lesson or a history lesson?
