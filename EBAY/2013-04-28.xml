After all, this board is set up for discussion of eBay stock, not your personal battles. Come on guys, grow up already. Sure it's funny if you take snipes at each other but starting topics with the express purpose of attacking another person like this is not very mature.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367177559798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367177842461-2</Id><Title>eBay Below 50 This Week</Title><Msg>As the ship sinks, the captain will not go down with it, instead CEO John Donahoe has a golden parachute. So much for ethics and responsibility. Guess we should all teach our kids to be more like John Donahoe, replace George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in history books with ex-Bainer's. Applaud irresponsibility, proclaim corporate raiders as American heroes. Listen to some Skrillex and fade away as the Chinese kick our butts because they have work ethic.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367177842461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:37:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367177918902-3</Id><Title>America'[s Most Hated CEO</Title><Msg>John Donahoe</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367177918902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:38:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367182306204-4</Id><Title>Ebay will lose sellers big time</Title><Msg>This company is making sellers spend more time on updates that sellers like me are cutting listing and have much less time to list new items,the books will be cooked this quarter in showing gains that ebay will book the next quarter as refunds to overcharges to sellers that they screwed out of listing inflated charges like me...they will only give me a credit after inflated charges...so much for the next quarter</Msg><Username>texasmovieman</Username><Timestamp>1367182306204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 16:51:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367192546168-5</Id><Topic><Title>Up So Early On Saturday Morning Spewing Hate.</Title><Username>flyktning_onde</Username><Timestamp>1367060573021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 07:02:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting.
