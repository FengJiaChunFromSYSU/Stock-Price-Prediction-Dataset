Just because one of my students left ebay on his own accord after you stalked him here (leaving YOU the bill) and sold his domain and moved on to bigger and better things (like YOU never can or will) is not failure. No one is responsible if they sell their site to someone who doesn't want your cyber stalking obsession either. The WELFARE is what you took to (almost) raise your abandoned daughter and grand child. Abandoning your family so you could be here every waking second 12 long years, THAT is the true nature of failure. That is a deep corner of hades failure. Carrying on your long ago lost board war over it just reminds people about you and your failing z50com and your grandma's drug growing house you lost at 5008 Hanover Circle Cypress CA 90630.

Local Corporation Reaches Record Mobile, Organic and Total Search Traffic Press Release: Local Corporation – 5 hours ago.. . . IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Local Corporation (LOCM), a leading online local media company, today announced record mobile, organic and total search traffic for the first quarter 2013. The company reached mobile traffic of 32 million monthly unique visitors (MUVs) during the first quarter 2013, up 167 percent from 12 million MUVs during the year ago period. Organic traffic also continued to grow, representing 49 million MUVs during the first quarter, up 40 percent from 35 million MUVs during the year ago period. The company reached 106 million total MUVs during the first quarter, up 13 percent from 94 million MUVs during the year ago period. “Traffic volumes remain a key performance indicator for our business. We exceeded our first quarter expectations in each area, which provides us with a strong foundation for performance for the year,” said Heath Clarke, Local Corporation chairman and CEO. All site traffic and usage statistics are from third-party service providers engaged by the company. Quarterly MUV traffic is equal to the aggregate of each month's MUV traffic numbers in that quarter. Traffic and the company’s monetization of that traffic combine to determine its revenues for any given period. The company’s traffic volume alone for a period should not be viewed as demonstrative of its financial results for such period.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1365673711413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 05:48:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365679938188-8</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Broke Lonely John Osborne, Ebay's z50com Keeps Jabbering Her Illness Publicly</Title><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1365551296939</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 19:48:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not everyone who bids on ebay, ends up buying.
