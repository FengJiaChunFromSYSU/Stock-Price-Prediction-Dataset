We can choose between giving Wall St, the banks and the rich everything they want while we wonder what Michelle is wearing today, or giving Wall St, the banks and the rich everything they want while we wonder about dressage horses and elevators for automobiles in huge mansions. Either way we get drones everywhere killing people. Even killing American citizens is "legal" now and the drones are in the US. Of course, everthing Hitler ever did was legal at the time. Never makes it right. Romney supporters are lukewarm sitting on the fence, except for the record breaking donors, while Obama's past fans still wait for their hope and change. Anyways, keep up the good work and at least trying out there.</Msg><Username>fellow.professor</Username><Timestamp>1345047963000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 12:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345048130000-4</Id><Topic><Title>ebay over $ 80 in five years</Title><Username>acman40930</Username><Timestamp>1345039532000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:05:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of my students recently did their term paper on paid stock pumpers, those who receive money to make outlandish claims to mislead investors, and I was amazed at how little they are actually paid, and how so few of them even invest in the stock they are touting.

"Too bad the blackies don't work" is such an shockingly idiot false racist statement that I doubt much intelligent discourse can come from you, but it's ironic women and the poor might vote against their interests in a Romney administration. I guess it's kind of fitting for slaves to lick their Master's boots. Sad, but too predictable. If you don't make over 4 million a year you will get nothing but pain from Romney.
