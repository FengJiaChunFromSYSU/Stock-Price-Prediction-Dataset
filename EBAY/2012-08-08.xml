Because the small guys are jumping ship as its become far too costly to sell there. I for one only use eBay with limited, lower priced, high margin items as a feeder to my actual website. I could never afford to sell all my items there, especially higher priced goods, many of which have thinner margins. I'm sure the big national retailers aren't paying their astronomical fees and then forced to pay the full PayPal percentage. Plus I'm not too crazy about their feedback system. All it takes is a couple of idiots to post some garbage that isn't likely true and BAM, there goes your reputation. Plus, its seems that many buyers on eBay expect you to bend over backwards for them. I never run into this when selling on my websites. I seem to always be bombarded with ridiculous questions along with subliminal threats. Usually stuff like, "if this doesn't get here tomorrow, its negative feedback for you"! I don't need them.</Msg><Username>morebeer4mee</Username><Timestamp>1344439931000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344441318000-14</Id><Title>Sweet Vacation!

Yes, eBay is courting big box retailers. However, what is happening, is all part of the plan. It's about control: If a venue, such as eBay, has a goal of one million listings (as an example)...which is better?: Having 4 retailers, each selling 250,000 listings or 250,000 small sellers with 4 listings on the site? eBay is no longer about having a community of people, doing commerce and trading goods. Without suffering a legal issue, eBay cannot come right out and state that they no longer want small sellers. Instead, they keep adding ridiculous rules/regulations and make it increasingly more difficult until the small seller either quits, or falls into a trap that eBay has set - ie buyers having the majority of control - the seller can no longer comply, as a result, eBay gets rid of them or places tight restrictions on their account. Then, eBay states, "We had no other choice but to entice Retailers".</Msg><Username>skirtt_chaser</Username><Timestamp>1344442673000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344442810000-20</Id><Topic><Title>Sweet Vacation!
