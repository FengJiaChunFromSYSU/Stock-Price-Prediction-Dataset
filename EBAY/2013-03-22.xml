Higher fees... more glitches... no clear policy on free listings... constant tinkering with image loading and auction formats, while introducing buggy 'features' before they are fully proven or even desired by users. And this last deal where some likely ham-fisted programmer or sys-admin without a clue wiped out tens of thousands of seller auctions - of course ebay won't say who or whom is responsible - is so typical of the faulty/misguided direction this Corporation has taken, post-Pierre and even post-Meg. To top it all, wrt to the thousands/millions of auctions gradually being re-instated over a period of several days, ebay is charging sellers fees for the "glitch" which sellers are not responsible for, and for which ebay is fully responsible. In this era of corporate monopolies where corporations can either buy or bury the competition it's useless to hope that some mega-auction format will appear to challenge ebay in the not-so-free market. But I seriously believe that the SEC and class action attorneys should look at ebay as a deep pocket which must be made to pay up for its out-of-control transgressions... like charging seller fees for mistakes that ebay itself is repsonsible for. I ask you, is ebay any different than one of the Too-Big-to-Jail banks in that regard?</Msg><Username>steve_kangas</Username><Timestamp>1363928802555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 01:06:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363929819035-4</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY RAISING FEES AGAIN UNDER GUISE OF LOWERING THEM</Title><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1363714244981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 13:30:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corporations are in business to make money, full stop. Mega Corporations don't care about anything other than their bottom line. They don't care about honest and free markets. Besides their profits (and losses) the main Big Corporate's concern is to buy-off or bury the competition. So even if there were a serious competitor to ebay, you can bet that ebay would destroy that competitor via lawsuits - like yah00 auctions - or by buying out their business. Like paypal. If we had the Sherman anti-Trust act still enforced - or any sort of effective legal or regulatory structure - ebay would find itself in court getting it's but-t sued off for all of its anti-competitive business practices. Not to mention outright theft. Like charging sellers FVF fees on shipping. The fact that ebay is not in serious legal trouble now well illustrates the depths of depravity to whit anti-Trust legislation in the USA is no longer enforced. I do believe there will be reckoning when this entire monetary house of cards collapses, but excepting Cyprus that seems to be well down the pike for the rest of us. Perhaps THAT is a good thing... :)</Msg><Username>steve_kangas</Username><Timestamp>1363929819035</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 01:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363930145585-5</Id><Topic><Title>SELL SHORT wait for $25!</Title><Username>happydayis</Username><Timestamp>1363897159947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 16:19:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wasn't too long ago that this turkey struggled to make $15 per share. $52 in FRN funny money per share is just a reflection on how Ben and his buds have been printing up a storm for their Too-Big-to-Jail banking friends, to speculate on this sort of garbage in their fantasy markets.</Msg><Username>steve_kangas</Username><Timestamp>1363930145585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 01:29:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363957834070-6</Id><Topic><Title>Positive news for EBAY, check out!</Title><Username>ryanbaker26</Username><Timestamp>1363265521729</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:52:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report!</Msg><Username>h_burns21</Username><Timestamp>1363957834070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:10:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363959467901-7</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think EBAY is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>schouderophalenclara</Username><Timestamp>1361803235084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:40:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>scjedadele</Username><Timestamp>1363959467901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363963170985-8</Id><Title>Good Morning Fellow Ebayers</Title><Msg>Looking for that hard to find item that seems to elude you Ebay may just have that Looking to get rid of that unwanted item someone else might want Ebay may be just the place No matter if you're a seller or buyer Ebay has what you're looking for!</Msg><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1363963170985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 10:39:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363965075725-9</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think EBAY is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>schouderophalenclara</Username><Timestamp>1361803235084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:40:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was really looking for some great news.
