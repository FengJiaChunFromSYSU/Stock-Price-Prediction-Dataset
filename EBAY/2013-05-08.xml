Want to know why eBay isn't worth even $50 a share? Here's why... Yesterday, I called Netflix to put my account on hold for the next three months because I will be out of town on a work contract. Immediately, I got a US, English speaking customer service rep who handled my call and we were done in less than 2 minutes. Called Amazon to put my seller account on hold. Same thing, US based English speaking rep and done in less than 5 minutes. Called eBay 6 times, no joke, each time I got some loser in Asia who couldn't even understand what I was talking about. After nearly 3 hours of calling, I finally got my call escalated and even the manager couldn't assist me. End of story, I closed my eBay account. That's why eBay is an epic fail. Worst customer service in the world. Not only didn't my problem get dealt with, it cost them hours of customer service and they lost my business forever. Wow, that's real success.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1368033695219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368034047903-8</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning Fellow Ebayers</Title><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1367248322303</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:12:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on.

Premium store owners now pay $10 per month more for the store and listing fees doubled from .05 per listing to .10 per listing. So they give you 500 free listings per month. Sellers with more than 2000 items will be paying double what they are now before they even make the first sale. 9% Final Value fees across the board means sellers of items over $1000 will now be paying up to 300% more in fees. Another pack of lies from the eBay department of spin. Considering eBay claims they're doing so well, it's amazing they've raised fees 3 times in the last 4 years by almost 300% ~ More like a sign of a company in serious trouble.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1368045296895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:34:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368045452924-17</Id><Topic><Title>$56 or $57s tomorrow</Title><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1368045086258</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:31:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>eBay will never, ever hit $100 per share.
