George W. Bush. These advisors are called "chicken hawks" in polite society, in impolite society they are called "yellow cowards". These are the men who never served in war. They are the very same cowards who will fight a war down to the last drop of your children's or grandchildren's blood. These despicable people helped Pres. Bush lie us into an immoral, unpaid for, $3 trillion war in Iraq. The real tragedy is the human cost -- more than 4,500 dead soldiers, more than 30,000 wounded, and ongoing reports of hundreds of veteran suicides. Mitt Romney is very much like these advisors who wanted us to be at war in Vietnam, but he just did not want to be there himself. It looks as though a Romney presidency would be the second coming of George W. Bush. Please vote for President Obama, a proven leader and commander in chief, and a Democratic Congress to support his work. Our children and their children will thank you.</Msg><Username>notarethug</Username><Timestamp>1351960919093</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 12:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351962387933-2</Id><Topic><Title>Vote Democratic</Title><Username>notarethug</Username><Timestamp>1351960919093</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 12:41:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What branch of the military did Obama serve?
