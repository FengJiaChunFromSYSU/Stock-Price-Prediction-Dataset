I am done after 12 years. When the time is right I will short this pig. They had it all, but if they lost me, they will loose many others. I made 200K on the original ipo, sold for 12 years and made another 200k, but its absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. That includes cell phone companies and cable liars/ cheats. I fully believe there will be a mass exodus the likes of which has neveer been seen in a stock before. This will be way worse than when coke changed the formula, becasue people will not return. I will never sell again on Ebay.</Msg><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1367643720563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367680514072-2</Id><Topic><Title>N ew ebay fees ridiculous</Title><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1367643720563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How in the world are you paying 25%?

So he leaves us a negative feedback. C'MON, THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. His feedback represents nothing of any value to the Ebay community, but in fact, it DAMAGES the Ebay community. EBAY NEEDS TO SET LIMITS ON WHO CAN LEAVE FEEDBACK AND FOR WHOM. BUYERS NEED TO HAVE SOME DEFINED AMOUNT OF HISTORY BEFORE THEY CAN LEAVE FEEDBACK AND POWER SELLERS SHOULD HAVE SOME CLOUT. We are SUPER #$%$, because this in not the first , second , third, or etc. time this has happened, Ebay has been touting how they are supposedly protecting sellers....

Shipping international in general is perilous when accepting Paypal but shipping to Africa, BRIC countries, South America and the Middle East is just asking for trouble. I quit all international shipping on Jan 27th when USPS hiked their rates by 200%. Before that, the only negative or neutral feedback I ever got in over 10 years were from international buyers.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367703861332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:44:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367704001891-6</Id><Topic><Title>N ew ebay fees ridiculous</Title><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1367643720563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't pay eBay anything because you're homeless and your wife owns z50com eBay store.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367704001891</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:46:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367704228147-7</Id><Topic><Title>N ew ebay fees ridiculous</Title><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1367643720563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mass exodus is right. I started keeping tabs of the number of listings in several categories last week to see if the May 1 fee change would reduce listings. All categories watched are down by over 10% already. Wait until Monday when the last batch of the 200,000 free auction listings from the end of last month expire.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367704228147</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:50:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367704748669-8</Id><Topic><Title>$10 pop next week??

The reason Walmart declined Paypal is because the interface is SLOW and CLUNKY. They stated consumers do not want to enter their phone number and a pin code to checkout when they can just swipe a card. Paypal will never, ever get a footing in brick&amp;mortar checkout. Visa and Mastercard are not just going to let them chip away at their profits.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367704748669</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:59:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367705060349-9</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay No downgrade after earnings, 1 upgrade after earnings</Title><Username>acman40930</Username><Timestamp>1367592051623</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:40:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe if you buy enough shares, you can drive the price up to $60, then you can dump them on all the sucker who actually believe eBay is worth more than $25 a share !</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367705060349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 18:04:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367705481722-10</Id><Topic><Title>$54.35 isn't bad</Title><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1367590800761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:20:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, so accurate predictions with dates even?

More than 50% of our business is international. Many Americans are unemployed or on government assistance. Limiting our market to just the USA would put us out of business. Ebay needs to protect sellers, especially Powersellers who bring in the money for them. It's very simple. ! DON'T ALLOW BUYERS TO LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING SHIPPING ISSUES IF THERE IS A TRACKING NUMBER.</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1367708231600</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 18:57:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367711910716-12</Id><Topic><Title>C'MON EBAY - YOU CAN'T LET A ZERO FEEDBACKER DAMAGE A POWERSELLER !!!!!</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1367690663585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 14:04:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>eBay problem? Yeah right, like an eBay rep is going to come in here and respond to you? Ding ! Ding ! Hello eBay, thanks for customer service in the Philippines with reps that barely speak English... Many Americans unemployed? Did you see the jobless rate in the US is at the lowest in over 4 years? Take a drive a few blocks from your trailer park and you'll see many Americans have extravagant houses (the kind you don't live in). Are you serious? If 50% of your business is international, you definitely need to find another venue other than eBay and definitely not use Paypal.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367711910716</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 19:58:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
