And he keeps trying to post that fake name's home addresses. Why did you LIE about ebay hitting $60 John? Is it because you keep both thumbs, your head, and your wife's dildii way up you all day? Can you even imagine the life of Johns.Joint, ebay's failing z50com, the 14 year long board troll who lives up here daily never investing, yet jagging on people, jibbering among his Sullied IDs, and generally hoping we all forget he trashed his grandma's house at 5008 Hanover Circle Cypress CA 90630, after turning it into a hovel to grow dope in, after molesting his daughter, and trying to molest his son's Bot Scout friends? Why every time these FACTS are pointed out, he goes back to 2005? How is someone so stupid as to never see that only gets John more outed? The Boy Scouts got letters, Yahoo and Auctionbytes know all about this 14 year ongoing #$%$, so why not the investors that she LIES here to? It's not that made up name's fault John Osborne needs shot.</Msg><Username>id_dejour</Username><Timestamp>1374208589897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374209116185-2</Id><Topic><Title>Broke Liar Pumper Molester John Osborne Stalks 2005 When Outed Publicly</Title><Username>id_dejour</Username><Timestamp>1374208589897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Charles, get a grip on yourself It's only a message board No need to spread lies about the Boy Scouts of America No one molested my daughter My old house had a grow room no big deal and it was totally legal under California law Ebay still might hit $60 and it might not You'll have to push a lot harder than that to get me post your current address IAN sold you out and emailed us all your info Now settle down and have some fun with the board like the old days We're all friends here. . .</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1374209116185</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:45:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374209151621-3</Id><Topic><Title>Broke Liar Pumper Molester John Osborne Stalks 2005 When Outed Publicly</Title><Username>id_dejour</Username><Timestamp>1374208589897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you care who my boyfriend Johnie molests?

My garden and family is so happy, not wilting with mites and mold and the family staying distant. I'm alive and well. None of my grandchildren were taken away for their protection. Lonely John Joint z50com must be very sick to think him calling people dead, and taunting them, makes a friendly board. I will be certain to post your desert obit John, but we all see you're already gone. I'm proud I posted your drug house after HE sent it to me. HE wanted to surprise you. I think I did the right thing. You can't stir doubts about Ian. He's observing you closely. Never helping you. I hope this actual knowledge helps. Now explain your pumping when ebay fell off a cliff! Are there cliffs near you? Are they high too? Why did you lie to investors John? Why do you believe your own lies? Why even live? 120 today? 124 Tomorrow? And the next and the next?

Arrogance and greed is eBay's undoing. Their competitors such as OSTK is starting to eat their lunch. I'm sure longs will scoff, but I think in the long term eBay will be in big trouble. It is doubtful eBay will BK any time soon, but the glory days are gone and they will have to completely re-think their business model to survive.

As a long time seller I think the number 1 factor is the poor economy. Many people simply have less and less spending money after they pay their basic bills. But there are other factors which John Donahue doesn't mention. Donahue is the CEO but I doubt he actually uses his product; I doubt he ever actually buys or sells anything on ebay. So he really is quite ignorant with what drives Ebay. Donahue drove millions of great sellers away his first 4 years by "toughening up" on sellers, but what he didn't understand is that a high % of these sellers he drove away were also buyers; some heavy buyers. And many would buy heavy in their category that they sold in, so they could resell for higher. Another factor Donahue doesn't mention is the huge USPS international shipping increase in January of this year. Overseas shipping jumped about 50% on items weighing 1 to 4 pounds. As a seller I've seen just 5% of my items sell overseas this year as compared to about 25% before the horrible price increase. There are other factors involved in Ebay's drop including their policy of taking part of the seller's shipping money and a search which seems to exclude many items because Ebay keeps changing their technology for search. The poor economy and the USPS rate hike were out of Ebay's control and Ebay has been more seller friendly this year. But the damage done from Donahue's bad policy towards sellers in his first 4 years combined with factors out of ebay's control are now beginning to show. I don't follow the stock price but would suggest people have caution. Sales have been very slow this year for many sellers. My sales have been okay, but prices are lower lately due to what appears to be less buyers.</Msg><Username>contentsmatters</Username><Timestamp>1374247346357</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374249618014-28</Id><Topic><Title>Just covered my short at 54.4 x 1000 shares</Title><Username>philthyesthoodlum</Username><Timestamp>1374092600497</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:23:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>phil we're still laughin at u on the ffiv board</Msg><Username>kkkelleeyyyjuwterminatorzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1374249618014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374250483448-29</Id><Title>FAST BOYS</Title><Msg>none picked EBAY sorry</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1374250483448</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374251931787-30</Id><Topic><Title>The Cramer Kiss Of Death...My Condolences, So Sorry.</Title><Username>mooseonaplane</Username><Timestamp>1374189794540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 19:23:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so sorry...</Msg><Username>mooseonaplane</Username><Timestamp>1374251931787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374252007439-31</Id><Title>Do we get to 50 by Monday?</Title><Msg>I will buy at 50, not until, I think it gets there next week.</Msg><Username>burnaka</Username><Timestamp>1374252007439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:40:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374252588305-32</Id><Topic><Title>The Cramer Kiss Of Death...My Condolences, So Sorry.</Title><Username>mooseonaplane</Username><Timestamp>1374189794540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 19:23:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did you see AMD and ISRG ?</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1374252588305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:49:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374252630813-33</Id><Title>Cramer Said He'd Buy At $53.30</Title><Msg>What a turd!</Msg><Username>vincent90157</Username><Timestamp>1374252630813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:50:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374252685503-34</Id><Topic><Title>THANK YOU.......ALL HERE.....YOU MADE MY DAY</Title><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1374182732126</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 17:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OH YA....YOU MIGHT NEED TO...........BAAAAAAAAAAAA</Msg><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1374252685503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:51:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374252726990-35</Id><Topic><Title>THANK YOU.......ALL HERE.....YOU MADE MY DAY</Title><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1374182732126</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 17:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CRAMER BLOWS HOT AIR</Msg><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1374252726990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:52:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374253670856-36</Id><Topic><Title>PayPal is our friend: ""Oops!

Granted, many of them exhibited poor sales techniques such as slow shipping, poorly described items, etc but eBay was never designed to be a "one size fits all" venue as Donahoe has tried to make it.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1374256055342</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:47:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374258311697-39</Id><Topic><Title>Factors Not Mentioned in Earnings Report</Title><Username>contentsmatters</Username><Timestamp>1374247346357</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:22:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was pleasantly surprised to finally see some Wall Street analysts question the fact that users are up 16%, items for sale are up 14%, but actual selling is only up 10%. Essentailly EBay's own numbers show less sales per seller. I have been on ebay for 14 years, I make my own product and was first ever on ebay in my niche. I stopped selling on Ebay on May 23, just with the intent of taking 3 weeks off from selling. Immediately I was buried with orders via my website and even a facebook page, not authorized by me appealing me to start accepting sales orders again. That Facebook page has essentially become a waiting list que for my selling. I was selling $1400 a month on ebay, I have only needed to sell 2 items since June 10. Ebay is charging 10% to provide a service that I now provide myself for free, and I get better results. My own pause from selling on ebay has caused an instant 15% increase in the price of the most common products sold in my niche nationwide. Plus, I have taken the 10% I save in fees and channeled it into my own auction site that I am setting up to cater to my industry.
