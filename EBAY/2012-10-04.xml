According to TipRanks he has a problematic track record and success ratio.

Apparently they don't know they didn't even have to ask now. It seems this person didn't pay for their order until 10 days after they clicked "Buy-it-Now". Now they want to return it. No problem, but if they had gone through Ebay's new return system, we'd be stuck with the return postage as well. This looks like another nightmare for sellers, it may be the worst yet. This is going to kill of a lot of sellers, No Doubt!</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1349403188929</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 22:13:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
