My eternal friend, you are nuts. But if it is fun to think so, enjoy it. Just remember that if elections really made that much difference, we probably wouldn't have them." -------------------------- This election is more significant than George Washington's refusal to become a dictator. There was no country when Washington turned power over to civilian rule. In the past 200+ years through the sweat, toil, intelligent self-interest, FREEDOM and manifest destiny the USA has become an EXCEPTIONAL NATION. It would be a shame if that were all lost. JUG EARS wants to become dictator. The despicable one has to go, he's nothing but trouble for the USA mainly for doing nothing about the debt crisis. Those advocating for JUG EARS either have a vested interest in totalitarianism or they are certifiably stupid sonsabitches. When the financial s#it hit the fan and it impacts flyktasswipe he will still be blaming it on George Bush.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346719304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:41:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346720424000-28</Id><Topic><Title>Obama &amp; his Followers</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1346693317000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"JUG EARS wants to become dictator.... When the financial s#it hit the fan and it impacts flykt@#$% he will still be blaming it on George Bush." Obama does not want to be dictator; only the gun nuts and birther types believe that. Get real. I never blamed the financial crisis on George Bush. He did more to bail us out of it than most of the Republicans who wanted to do nothing. His bailout bill passed with 2/3 of the Democrats voting for it and 2/3 of the GOP voting against. It was far from perfect, but it may have kept us from depression. We may yet have that depression, but it is worth trying to prevent. The libertarians want to see a depression for the glorious cleansing of it. It is tempting to want it and it wouldn't wipe me out because I have investments in things that would ride a depression out better than most investments. I have talked about them before on this board, but you did not acknowledge my existence until you started calling names a month ago or so. Hi.
