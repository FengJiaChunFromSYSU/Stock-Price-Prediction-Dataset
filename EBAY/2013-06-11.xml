Words I never even bother to read. My assistant said you were totally losing it this weekend and I reminded her how you have wasted a million words, in a hundred thousand posts, under thousands of IDs, over 13 years, trying to teach the words only you need, or deserve, to hear, only to end up where you are: Nowhere. Thought highly of by no one. You will be a forgotten stench in the universe 2.3 seconds after your final breath.

Doing so would make you more boring than ever as you become more predictable. What you need is some good sex. Something that has been missing in your life for years now. I can sense than from your frustrated comments. Please (and I mean it) please don't stand next to IT. You don't need ITS support. IT has no self respect IT will support you in any case. Agqut - Please don't tell me you're taking ITS actions seriously. Relax, every once in a while I need to come here to pull ITS ears and keep IT busy to prove I own IT. IT's gutless, and lack intelligence. Don't let IT get to you. On a brighter note, it seems to me that the daily Good Morning comments from Joe Paterno comrade has been missing. Thank GOD. I swear. Thank God. For all, as you can tell this message board was awfully quiet and boring up until yours truly chose to step back in. So tell me now: Who owns it now?

As we can all see, it's still really hard for you to sit down. I don't know why Mommy Yahoo allows you to have the same exact ID as me, but everyone can see your extreme mental disease still owns you intensely, and you're talking to posters that have long ago lost their investment money based on your silly advice. I don't guess you got the memo or can handle the truth but it's odd you, Sullied and John Osborne jabber the same false info and names and spin and spin in endless melting circles. Based on Ian's reports of your life, I see why you want to go back to prison. LOL!
