He gave Charlie enough information here to allow him to stalk me to my workplace when I haven't printed his last name since 2007 at the latest. Madbezos didn't care what anyone did as long as they left precious Charlie alone. One exception was Elike for a while who madbezos befriended at a very strategic moment during the deconstruction of our relationship. Madbezos had a dark side and he let it loose here on anyone who attacked poor Charlie. He didn't usually do it through direct attacks, but he let Charlie know who was safe to hit. And it wasn't as if Charlie was Madbezos's puppet. It was more the other way around.</Msg><Username>flyktning</Username><Timestamp>1372812288899</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 20:44:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372821367248-12</Id><Topic><Title>"I still don't buy that Bezos was Shack/Gina and a whole host of others, but you gotta wonder with the complete departure."</Title><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1372789378704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:22:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi Midnite, the melting over my (non) death has been quite hysterical and amuses me. It simply shows what our board troll gang is truly all about: rotten to the core. I always found it amusing John Osborne believed his own lies and lived here 247 for 13 years and that the Flything would suckle his boyfriend in his ongoing public sickness, but found it quite tragic that John Osborne completely wrecked his own family and life in this game. There is no worry about John doing something to my non-existing grave. besides the fact he is so old and dry now he wees sand. I hope that helps.</Msg><Username>madbezos.angels</Username><Timestamp>1372821367248</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:16:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372821459230-13</Id><Topic><Title>"I still don't buy that Bezos was Shack/Gina and a whole host of others, but you gotta wonder with the complete departure."</Title><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1372789378704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:22:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi Fly, Your recent intense melt has greatly amused me.
