That, long ago, was all the probably cause needed to gather everything on you (legally) and have you under observation. Second, there were no 4 hateful posts today, until yours. Oh, and your next one, and your post after that. You are the "Team" (John Osborne basically) who first started the name posting here, and you beg daily for that to continue. Third, all of your info is basically wrong, but that hasn't stopped your team from publicly bashing and gloating over the death of who you thought I was. That is really low class but some of the least of your public crimes. Fourth, the "We" you speak of are not many at all and have been well bagged and tagged for the purposes of our experiment. And fifth, a gang of cyber stalking publicly exposed and rant spamming mental patients on chat board will never endanger men. Only themselves. Your "life" is sad and could use the laughs, but the joke has always been on you, and at your expense. I hope that helps. You're not going to like what else might.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1365281759579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 16:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365287368189-18</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Bounce Report !!</Title><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363629476162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well done!</Msg><Username>jefflorenz366</Username><Timestamp>1365287368189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 18:29:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365288139343-19</Id><Topic><Title>A company with such facts is extreme undervalued: with only 36 million like today</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1364029048775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 04:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Local Corp has a tremendous first player advantage, as it has been strong influenced the local search since the early 2000's (1): About 25 million Monthly Unique Visitors from the flagship-site alone 01/2013: 26,410,927 Monthly Unique Visitors 02/2013: 24,017,605 Monthly Unique Visitors Decrease of 9.06% (February has only 28 days against 31 in January) against January and an increase of 38.64% year-over-year (2): Flagship-side directory of over 18 million local businesses Our extensive flagship-side directory of over 18 million local businesses – which can be filtered by locale, optimized for social media sharing and private labeled for you – gives you the power to generate additional revenue by selling new ad formats and premium listings while securing immediate passive ad revenue.
