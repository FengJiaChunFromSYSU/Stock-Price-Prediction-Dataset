Apparently the customer's family member saw the charge on their credit card and filed the claim not realizing our customer had indeed placed the order. Well, I guess that's the good news, the BAD NEWS is the charge back is still on our Paypal account and our sales FELL OFF A CLIFF since the charge back. We had FOUR sales last week, we typically get 100/week......So let's see we (a POWER SELLER with over 10000 FB score) had our money taken out of our account and apparently our PAID FOR listings were given less exposure because a customer's family member made a mistake. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1343537054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 00:44:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343564306000-2</Id><Topic><Title>CHARGEBACK UPDATE: "It was mistake"...............</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1343537054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 00:44:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one cares dude.

LOL You left out the Kennedy's, Kerry, Pelosi, etc. They are all millionaires. What makes them any different? They know their way around the feed trough. Congress and the House of Representatives are in a very bad place. The only way to fix it is term limits. The big difference between the elephants and the donkey's is, the elephants are all about business and it is no secret. The donkeys want you to think that they are for the little guy, but when it comes to a vote, they are looking out for themselves....oh sure, they will throw you bone every now and then, just to make it look good......they have to appeal to the lower end of the pay scale if Obama and the Dems want to get re-elected. I don't like the presidential choices in this election. But only one party can get us out of this mess, and it is the party that knows business best. Whether you like it or not, America for over 200 years has been about the trickle down theory. You cannot make money off of someone poorer than yourself. The day is fast approaching, when in a grocery checkout line, if you are paying cash and you are the minority........ the end will be near! Oh! And by the way....Obama Care was modeled after Romney care, which has been in place for almost three years in the state of MA. Just to let you know!</Msg><Username>gewizmeto</Username><Timestamp>1343584032000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 13:47:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343588630000-9</Id><Topic><Title>romney deducted $77,000 for horse care in 2010</Title><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1343532733000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 23:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for that brilliant moment of clarity and intelligent discourse Sharpey and Gewiz.

I agree the political system is broken &amp; has been for a long time but rest assured, IT WILL NOT BE REPAIRED BY A republiCON, it is not in their interest. I can honestly state that I do not know a single republiCON who believes that education or lack there of, is totally the key to America's future. If we do not get back to the basic's of graduating mathematicians &amp; scientists, the current trend will definitely continue and in 25 years, instead of being number 25 in the world, we will be number 35 or lower. republiCON theory is climb the ladder by any means &amp; pull it up behind you, and in many instances, stay there and stomp any fingers of those citizens that by some chance manage to be clinging to the edge of the level you have achieved. I much prefer the "lift all boat" theory that education provides which transcends into a much "healthier" society. The neo-con members of the republiCON party must be held accountable for the "lock &amp; load" mentality of the weak minded &amp; impressionable members of our society that do not have the cranial capacity to distinguish between campaign rhetoric &amp; reality. This should be evidence enough for anyone with an ounce of objectivity, that the gop has reached an unacceptable level of greed for power no matter where your core political belief's lie</Msg><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1343589199000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 15:13:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343590148000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Richb Has My Failed Daddy Grand Daddy Sullied G@y Too?</Title><Username>jen_dimebag</Username><Timestamp>1343514131000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 18:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DRIBBLES, I see that you couldn't even refrain from posting for one single day.
