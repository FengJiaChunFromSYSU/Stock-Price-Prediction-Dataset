The local shopping startup Milo has recently been acquired by eBay – for 75 million dollars. Milo connects the worlds of online and offline stores by searching local store shelves in real-time to find the best prices and availability. The business concept of Milo is to show you what’s in-stock where, and tell you how much it costs at that very moment. Milo also allows insight into detailed product information and user reviews. In short, Milo makes it easy to access both online and offline shopping in one place. For eBay, Milo represents just another way to get into the $917 billion market of online research to offline buying. And Forrester estimates that this will eventually reach $1.3 trillion and account for nearly 50% of total retail sales by 2013. eBay plans to bring the inventories of its sellers to Milo. The company will also integrate Milo’s local product feeds into both its online marketplace and mobile applications. eBay’s barcode-scanning iPhone application RedLaser will also feature Milo local results.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1373873691317</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 03:34:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373884532293-3</Id><Title>Good Morning From Wonderful Phildelphia.

The location was first settled in 1901 by Cipriano Hernandez, who farmed the area and built the original Castolon Store, now known as the Alvino House. The area began to attract refugees from nearby Mexico who were fleeing the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The Castolon area was the site on a U.S. Army encampment, called Campo Santa Helena, to house units patrolling the Mexican-American border. However, by the time the camp was complete in 1920 the border was quiet and the camp buildings were never used by the Army. In 1921 the La Harmonia Company was established in the barracks, operating a trading post and farming cotton. The La Harmonia Company was established in 1918 by Howard Perry, who owned the Chisos Mining Company in Terlingua, in partnership with Wayne Cartledge. Cartledge and his son Eugene chose the name and managed the company. The La Harmonia Company lasted until 1961, when it was sold to the National Park Service. The store continues to be operated by a park concessioner. Castolon is divided into two areas. "Old Castolon" comprises the Old Castolon Store, a cafe-residence and a shed. The Army Compound includes a barracks, now the Castolon Store, a recreation hall, latrine, two officers' residences, a granary and tack room, and the Magdalena, Garlick and Alvino residences. The Magdalena and Garlick houses post-date the Army construction and are associated with La Harmonia Ranch, while the Alvino house pre-dates the Army. All of the buildings are built with adobe walls, and most are roofed with corrugated metal roofing. A few use traditional vigas, latillas and a soil roof covering</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1373905286551</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:21:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373905346588-9</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY ALLOWS LOW FEEDBACK BUYERS TO DESTROY ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1373780569775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 01:42:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You Said "Why was the tone bad in the 1st place? ".... Only the buyer knows the answer to that....Maybe he was in a bad mood.......Don't know???...but this about business, not about someone having a hissy fit because he doesn't like the tone of an e-mail...That is is ridiculous! Ebay needs to simply ask the buyer two questions before he/she is allowed to leave feedback.......1) DID YOU RECEIVE THE ITEM YOU ORDERED IN THE CONDITION LISTED 2) DID IT ARRIVE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME....If the answer is YES to both, it's an automatic positive.</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1373905346588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373905425261-10</Id><Title>TEAM dominating with love, knowledge, wealth and ACcURATE TIDBITS!</Title><Msg>ebay is plain and simple...
