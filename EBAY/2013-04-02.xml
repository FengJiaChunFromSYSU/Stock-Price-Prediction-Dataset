You may pay a very slightly higher fee on some of your items, but overall your total fees will decrease because your listing fees will decrease. If you contact us, we can run your actual business results in a model that takes into account the store subscriptions, final value fees, and the insertion costs and show you how your actual sales would have played out in the new fee structure. You will see that your overall fees will decrease, just as they will for just about every Ebay seller. The fee for selling on Amazon is 25%, so you will be paying 16% less if you list in catagories with a 9% final value value fee. And if you receive a top rated seller discount, you will only be paying a modest 7.2%.</Msg><Username>jeffatebay</Username><Timestamp>1364905071854</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 08:17:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364905984039-6</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY Bounce Report !!</Title><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363629476162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good job</Msg><Username>dunnmorgan16</Username><Timestamp>1364905984039</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 08:33:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364907203326-7</Id><Topic><Title>350% increase in Final Value Fee</Title><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364841984639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"And if you receive a top rated seller discount, you will only be paying a modest 7.2%" That's me!</Msg><Username>sullyinmass2013</Username><Timestamp>1364907203326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 08:53:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364908218916-8</Id><Topic><Title>350% increase in Final Value Fee</Title><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364841984639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you please stop spreading your lying propaganda. I only pay $50 a month in up front fees, and I wouldn't care if you tripled that. I will be paying an extra $100 in final value fee on almost every item I sell under the new fee structure. I contacted power seller customer support and told them that I was being repeatedly told that my fees would decrease. The rep ran my bills from November to now, using some software that you don't want the customers to use. He told me that if I open a store, and WITH my Top Rated Seller 20% discount, my bills since November would have been 86% higher under the new fee structure. That is my best case scenario. He then read me a prepared statement about how I can pass the increase along to my customers, which I assured him that I could not do. He also suggested that etsy was a better choice for people selling collectibles. I find it strange that ebay reps are pushing sellers to etsy. As far as your remark about Amazons fee being 25%, who cares. I do not list on Amazon, and was not planning on doing so, so what does it matter to me. I am concered about the overall 86% increase in what I will have to pay ebay, AFTER FIGURING IN MY REDUCED UP FRONT COSTS. Incidentally, I have been selling on ebay since 1997, am a gold power seller and a top rated seller. I am also a shareholder.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364908218916</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:10:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910530648-9</Id><Topic><Title>350% increase in Final Value Fee</Title><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364841984639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe you should seek out a different product line if your margins are small and your merchandise is going to be subjected to higher fees or Maybe it's time to move away from Ebay Good Luck</Msg><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1364910530648</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:48:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364916719584-10</Id><Title>Will break out...</Title><Msg>Give it a little time...</Msg><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1364916719584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:31:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364917809307-11</Id><Topic><Title>350% increase in Final Value Fee</Title><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364841984639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see you're all meeting Flyktning's "free Speech Poster Child" aka Johns.Joint aka Z50com John Osborne, along with her sidekick Sully and are most impressed! Would it further your opinion to realize he's been here pumping ebay, stalking the posters here, spamming and harassing people for 12 years? Ebay pays his bills that's why his bank account is locked, and he thinks people who sell $10 items are rich. John and Sully don't work, they're here 247 with instant hateful responses all brought to by ebay and a Marin County bean counter Flyktning, who hides in the shadows lurking over his daily fetid mess.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1364917809307</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:50:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364918323717-12</Id><Title>Ebays is headed the way of DELL</Title><Msg>Last time I contacted you had polite people that you could understand. great customer service.
