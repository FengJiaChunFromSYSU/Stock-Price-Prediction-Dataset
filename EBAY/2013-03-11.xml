Why did you mention Doctor Clarify's awesome stock trading handbook? You know that only inflames the #$%$ board trolls dwelling here in their endless pain here. Isn't it enough to quietly profit on this stock while they wallow in their misery? Isn't it enough that we few profited by crashing ebay to $9 and then made more money letting the sucker bag holders pump it back again? Isn't it enough that we can short it, crash it, and then go long again, endlessly, for our own personal gain? What's next? You'll mention Marketendgaming and let these loser trolls have a stroke trying to back peddle their lies in yet another frenzied spew? As if yelling at rich people ever accomplished anything ever. Isn't it enough that you rule these small minds (they think) from even beyond the grave or do you just get giggles having them dress up in your ID and show everybody their @ every day? Can you imagine the misery of a daily board troll, like John Osborne, ebay's z50com, living here every hour of every day for 12 years, too blind to see it made him no money and cost him the only thing in life worth anything: his own family? Yet she still thinks she is a winner? Isn't that loser's pain good enough for you? Or are you that rich and bored?</Msg><Username>ebay_bored</Username><Timestamp>1363013379754</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 10:49:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363014594585-6</Id><Title>International shipping might affect Ebay stock</Title><Msg>The post office has done a very large increase in shipping rates for U.S. sellers selling overseas. Packages under 1 pound have practically doubled to all parts of the world; for example the cost of shipping a cd to Asia has gone from $5 up to $10. Usually each year a slight 20 cent type increase and now the post office doubles the rate. Packages between 1 pound and 4 pounds have gone up more than 50%, so a vinyl record has gone from $14 up to $21 for most parts of the world. I think this has to hurt Ebay and investors should look into this. For me as a seller; I've seen a huge drop off in Non-U.S. buyers, which has led to an overall decrease in total sales. Generally I've had about 20 to 25% of my orders go to non-U.S. buyers, but since the rate hike on January 27th; I've had just 6 out of 153 orders go to non-U.S. buyers. So from about 22% going to Non-U.S. buyers down to about 3%. Rare items are still in demand worldwide, but your basic cd or other more common low priced items will be staying in America. Paypal takes 3% of the shipping so with less and less high cost international shipping, that alone hurts Paypal and with less overall bids, auctions will sell for less overall. I think this is a factor investors should consider for both Ebay and Amazon.</Msg><Username>contentsmatters</Username><Timestamp>1363014594585</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:09:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363017127413-7</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think EBAY is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>schouderophalenclara</Username><Timestamp>1361803235084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:40:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love this article.
