So I figure if I have to give all my personal data to questionable sites, what do I need MoneyPak or PayPal for...I can just use my own credit card and be done with it. I had $12 left in my PayPal account, so I figure ebay can keep that money...cause I no longer have a need for their services. Hoping that $12 raises the eps.</Msg><Username>huevo_apestoso</Username><Timestamp>1348937673617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:54:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348959793406-2</Id><Topic><Title>Breakfast Anyone?
