Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity . Local Corp do it like Apple - Companies need both: To be first to market and have patents protecting their products - and Apple and Local Corp has both – in opposite to a company like Groupon (only product) or Vringo (only patents) "Before a company can book a single penny in profit it needs a product to sell. Yet in today’s fiercely competitive global economy, before a company can produce something to sell, it needs to patent the idea. Otherwise, it’s too easy for competitors to knock off the product and steal market share. In other words, being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage. Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) serve as good examples of this new paradigm at work. As you’re well aware, Groupon invented the daily deals market in 2008. All it took was a novel idea to connect consumers and businesses in a new way – via coupons over email. But guess what? Groupon didn’t have even one patent protecting its novel business model. And within four years, over 300 competitors emerged. Now, Groupon doesn’t stand a chance to keep booking higher profits, let alone survive. Contrast Groupon’s experience with the details behind the meteoric rise of Apple and you’ll definitely get the connection between patent filings and stock price performance. We can all agree that Apple took the world by storm with its iPhone launch in June 2007. Before it sold a single one, though, it secured as many patents as possible. And it continued to do the same thing on every next generation device."

While Amazon has inventory, warehouses and actually ships goods, eBay is only a website that facilitates third party transactions. Much as Paypal is only a payment intermediary. It's like comparing apples and oranges. Over the last 10 years, Amazon's model has remained relatively unchanged as has their catalog and website. On the other hand, eBay can't figure out what they want to be. Constant change and disruptive innovation have alienated long time users. Ebay's love affair with big box discounters selling refurbished items and cheap Chinese penny sellers hawking knock-offs has made them the equivalent of a dollar store, while Amazon attracts more affluent shoppers who will spend more for quality items.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1364311098025</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 11:18:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364313531325-11</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think EBAY is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>schouderophalenclara</Username><Timestamp>1361803235084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:40:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just read your article.
