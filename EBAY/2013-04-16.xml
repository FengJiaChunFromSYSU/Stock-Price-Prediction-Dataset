The fact they remain in business is proof that noone has any real balls to tell Bezos and JD they go #$%$ themselves when they find themselves out of a job when they get to old age. They sleep peacefully with the bill of rights sewn onto their quilts and pillow cases. When you find yourself banned from their sites, you always have the freedom to buy their stock and give them the tools necessary to #$%$ the next generation of people over.
