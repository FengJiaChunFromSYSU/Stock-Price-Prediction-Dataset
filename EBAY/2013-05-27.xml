A user can perform a search using a web page associated with the localization service or by searching using an internet search engine. The user's search includes a search origin. The search origin may be defined in terms of location information such as a place name or a postal code. A search for a particular product at local retailers may be made using search parameters such as search origins, product names, model numbers, product categories, and product attributes. The localization service may provide the user with search results in the form of web pages that list which retailers sell the desired product in the vicinity of the search origin. A targeted advertisement server at the localization service may use display criteria to determine which targeted advertisements should be displayed for the user. Local Corp's New Patent Could Offer Company Significant Opportunities Oct 14 2011 The USPTO granted a patent to Local Corp that appears to have significant implications for location based product and deal search offerings in the local space and has the potential to be the most valuable among a growing and increasingly valuable stable of local and directory search patents owned by Local Corp. Patent 8,032,427 related to location based product search appears to encompass core aspects of services being offered by Groupon (Groupon Now), Living Social (Instant) and Foursquare; and is part and parcel of the product search functionalities</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1369674579429</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 13:09:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369677220861-11</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay insiders SHORTING ???</Title><Username>trader_best</Username><Timestamp>1369445269867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 21:27:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanx</Msg><Username>davidjackson655</Username><Timestamp>1369677220861</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 13:53:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369702083201-12</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From Wonderful Philadelphia</Title><Username>owlprofessor</Username><Timestamp>1369666246528</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 10:50:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like Shaq said: you can always tell it's another John Osborne z50com Ripples Gang ID because they don't jump up and down screaming at it like rabid baboons.
