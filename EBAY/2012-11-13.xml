Politics - "The activities associated with the governance of a country or area." What You strive for is Anarchy - "Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal." You should post on your "Ebay Pays My Bills" / ebay_pays_my_bills account. There's a rumor that Lawrence A. Dickerson is still looking for you. By the way, when you short sold your home did you disclose your marijuana use and growing? Move over, meth: Marijuana 'grow houses' an increasing menace "When Mikey and Zeina Kostelny found their first home in the suburbs of Altadena, Calif., it appeared to be a buyer's dream, complete with fresh paint, carpet and fixtures. But that dream quickly dissolved into nightmare after the sale closed in late 2008 as the couple began to discover problems hidden behind its glossy finishes — from mold to gas leaks to bad wiring — all stemming, they believe, from its undisclosed past as a marijuana grow house." No Osborne? The new owners could file a SNAD on you. Where is the name of the realtor and owner? Wow. Public record. For everyone else, somebody will post John ebay_pays_my_bills Osborne's old address. Maybe the new owner and realtor will have emails with your pot posts in their future. Have a nice day.</Msg><Username>humebill203</Username><Timestamp>1352839461068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 15:44:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
