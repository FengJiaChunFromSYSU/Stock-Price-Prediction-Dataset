I know if you obsess harder your info will become true. First it's him, then it's not him, then it's HIM, but HE left in 2005, then him is HIM, then it's "best writer" but he is not best writer, nor is HE, and He isn't him, then he always hated him, and HE hated him, but hates HIM or him? But he is HIM and hates himself, yet he wants to be anyone but himself, even if he is not here, or HE is not here, and he's not HIM, yet someone, or someONE, kicks our gums in daily, while I am in you, and you are in me, and we are all together, but not the same poster hating Gina, and soon Midi again, koo koo ka chew. Our side is sane! Do you like my double birds above? It's you and me my darling. We are the best haters of all. I'm so proud of you and Sybil. Tomorrow is another melt. Rest my dear... rest.</Msg><Username>flyktning_onde</Username><Timestamp>1373093647274</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 02:54:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373119031041-2</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From My Free Speech Garden In Philadelphia</Title><Username>madbezos.angels</Username><Timestamp>1372858019114</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:26:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really need to find some friends or just someone real to talk to I feel sorry for you now :-( You're all ALONE. . .</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1373119031041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:57:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
