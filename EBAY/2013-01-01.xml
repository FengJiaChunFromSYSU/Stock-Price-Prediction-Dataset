You won't get good customer service from ebay. Their job is to ignore everything you say and hope you just leave them alone. When I had the paypal issue I contacted the sellers and they were all very kind and patient and worked with me. Ebay customer service on the other hand was not willing to work with me. I'm switching my buying now on EBID and Amazon, In December I spent $3000 on ebay alone so I'm sure my spending on EBID and Amazon will have some impact and hopefully encourage sellers to sell more there and perhaps lower their start prices thus drawing in more buyers.</Msg><Username>jupiterspinning</Username><Timestamp>1357067596116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 14:13:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357092608309-3</Id><Topic><Title>New Years Resolution</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1356969849483</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 11:04:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The government, and everyone else, is certainly keeping the money away from you failed Daddy, failed Grand Daddy!
