We are losing a generation of American minds, American students are not learning the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today’s world. Today, 70 percent of our eighth graders can't read proficiently and most of them will never catch up. Some 1.1 million American high school students drop out every year. Children need knowledge and life-skills to be prepared for life. Adults have an obligation to help children—all children—learn and be prepared for life. Educated people make better neighbors, colleagues, parents and responsible citizens. Quality education is an American “right,” and our children deserve nothing less. Compared to the rest of the world, the state of education in America is disappointing and embarrassing. After World War II, the United States’ had the number 1 high school graduation rate. Today, we have dropped to number 21 among industrialized nations. American students rank 25th in math and 21st in science compared to students in 30 industrialized countries. Even America’s top math students rank 25th out of 30 when compared with the best students across the globe. While America spends more money each year on education, we are losing more and more American students. While we agree that no American student should be left out, written off or ignored, far too many of our poorest and minority students today still lack adequate resources to learn, and the republiCONs DON'T GIVE A D*A*M*N</Msg><Username>sharpeyeddude</Username><Timestamp>1343856247000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 17:24:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343856404000-17</Id><Topic><Title>Chick-fil-a Day!</Title><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1343827962000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 09:32:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL......thanks for that tidbit of pork you.
