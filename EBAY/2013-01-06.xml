I don't know about you but ebay's 10% Final Value Fee just ate into my profits. I was sending them huge payments every month. Plus ebay's customer service is horrendous, I got the brush off. Ebid is the underdog and needs support. I have sold on other auction sites in the past and have always done well so I expect Ebid to be a good alternative to ebay. Ebay doesn't want small sellers anyway, at least just check ebid out, I don't get paid to say this so it doesn't matter to me I just hope ebid can get a few more buyers and sellers so it can become bigger.</Msg><Username>jupiterspinning</Username><Timestamp>1357514198924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 18:16:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
