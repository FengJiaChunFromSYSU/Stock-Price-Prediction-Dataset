Last year I won an auction for a large lot of 1700+ items, local pickup only, for $375. I've already made over $6000 profit and only half way through the lot. Will also give away a secret. Every week I bid on hundreds of items at opening bid. Every week I score 10-20 items for opening bid (usually 99 cents) I can resell on eBay for 5-100x the price I paid.

"To facilitate transactions even further, Visa has launched PayWave, while MasterCard has launched MasterPass. The common thread between the two is that both are mobile payment systems that use Near Field Communication (NFC) equipped in the latest smartphones. The management of Visa stated that by 2020, half of its transactions would be carried out by mobile payment solutions. Considering the fact that smartphones equipped with NFC technology have already begun rolling out, it appears to be a realistic goal. Besides that, PayWave and MasterPass would also challenge eBay’s PayPal (NASDAQ: EBAY). Consumers would no longer have to re-fill their PayPal wallets to make online transactions, as a PayWave and MasterPass would be directly linked to millions of bank accounts. Furthermore, PayPal’s dominance in domestic and international funds transfer could also be challenged as both PayWave and MasterPass can transfer funds throughout the world."</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1370016818758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:13:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370017788170-9</Id><Title>Poor Broke John Osborne z50com Admits Publicly He Makes Ricin.

Only way to avoid that is to use cash, but even then, there are video cameras everywhere these days.. Personally, I love my smartphone. I have a rooted Samsung Galaxy phone and keep the GPS disabled but even a regular cellphone bounces off towers and location data is collected. That cellular data can only be acquired with a court order and you have to be involved in some serious illegal business like RICO or Patriot Act stuff.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1370031407139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 16:16:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
