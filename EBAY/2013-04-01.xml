They twist, moan, cry and genuflect to their Master all day and night here to no avail, always in a circle. They are obsessed in attempting to show that there is some kind of graded on the curve equality between high school drop outs and a full tenured Professor, an author of several valued books, but there is not, not ever will be. Sad really, but year after year after year they keep trying. We all saw Sully#$%$ ID post "hollowed" then try to say it was "hallowed". She still doesn't know the meaning of either word, or why they're spelled differently, but somehow that means I am not a Professor. Endless endless circles of the illiterate. It is amusing how some waste their "lives" but I just laugh and feed them a typo occasionally and thus own their existence. Fitting actually, because the educated should own everything. We earned it and did not just sit on some chat board playing grammar queen while only wearing our Mommy's girdle, the way east coast Sybil/Sullied does.Enjoy this splindiferous day!

Despite your never ending obsession over a poster who left in 2005. You clearly show you're just an obsessed high school drop out who would rather be up here repeating your hate and misery daily for 12 long years, then ever trying to go rescue your heroin craving daughter, who you molested and abandoned with your grand child. You only hate me because I show you who you really are. A child full of endless hate and misery. Your denial won't allow you to really see your misery, but everyone else knows why you chatter you endless obsessive hate, misery and uselessness, and we see what it has cost you. The price can go higher of course.

Technically, CCUR has gained 12 straight months and 8 of the past 9 trading days, but its gains have been slow and steady. CCUR has the best looking chart with the most momentum in the market, and is not even close to its peak. CCUR is currently $7.91 and as soon as it breaks through the key $8 resistance level early this week, it will rapidly rally to double digits. 9.3mm shares have traded since Feb 1st vs. CCUR's 9.2mm s/o, so the $8 resistance most be almost completely gone. CCUR's net income last quarter was up 100% from previous quarter and up 300% from two quarters ago. CCUR has $24.6mm or $2.67 per share in cash and no debt. After subtracting its cash per share from share price, its business is worth $5.24 per share. CCUR's non-GAAP EPS last quarter of $0.125 equals $0.50 annualized, valuing CCUR's business at only 10X earnings. CCUR has $62.59mm or $6.80 per share in revenue, also valuing its business at only 0.77X revenue. SEAC is now $11.89 and expected to report on 4/9 full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, giving it a P/E of 30. With CCUR's latest annualized non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 a P/E of 30 would value CCUR at $15 per share. CCUR is the leading video on demand (VOD) technology provider and has deployed their solutions with Time Warner Cable (TWC), Cox, Charter (CHTR), and Bright House. CCUR's technology is in 23mm U.S. households and 54mm homes worldwide. CCUR's business is about to explode from the new multi-screen spending boom set to take place in the cable TV industry. CCUR's MediaHawk Multi-Screen Video Delivery Platform was just selected by Virgin Media (VMED) to power their Virgin TV Anywhere platform.</Msg><Username>asj48493</Username><Timestamp>1364835863126</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364836153833-46</Id><Title>Oh Failed Daddy Failed Grand Daddy z50com John Osborne.

It costs me 50 cents each to list, and I do not have a store. That is a grand total of $50 in up front costs. Period. I sell about 40 items a month, with an average selling price of $1800. The final value fee on each of those items will increase by at least $100. That is an increase of $4000 in final value fees. How can saving $50 in listing fees possibly offset an additional $4000 in final value fees!

The new ebay final value fee is going up 350% on everything over $1000. Ebay may try to say that it is only a 7% increase, but they obviously do not know how to do simple math. The current fee for items sold for over $1000 is $62.50 plus 2% of the amount over $1000. That means 6.25% for the first $1000 and 2% for the rest. The new fee is a flat 9%. While the difference between 2% and 9% is 7%, it is not a 7% increase. A 7 % increase on 2% would be to raise it to 2.14%. The real increase is 7/2 which is 3.5, or a 350% increase.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1364841984639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364842116583-64</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY RAISING FEES AGAIN UNDER GUISE OF LOWERING THEM</Title><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1363714244981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 13:30:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the fee goes from 2% to 9%, it is more than tripling.
