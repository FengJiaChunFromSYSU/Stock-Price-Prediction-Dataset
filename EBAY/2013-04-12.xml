Here is my experience. I had a fraudulent charge on my account. On day 1, I contacted the seller and informed them of the fraud. On day1, I contacted Paypal and informed their security group of the fraud. On day1, I called my bank and put a stop payment. Therefore a shipment should never have been made. Since I have a stop payment on my bank account, I know that Paypal has not paid the seller because it only pays after verifying shipment and delivery and only after collecting my funds straight out of my account. Here is the problem. My paypal account shows a negative balance after the positive balance I carried on Paypal was taken out. My account is limited. I cannot remove my bank account from Paypal. I cannot remove the addresses on my Paypal that the fraudster added. Reaching Paypal is not easy. You get to the first agent who transfers you to the folks who can help unfreeze/unlimit your account and you wait for about 20 minutes and you get cut-off. Happened to me 5 times. The agents will not call back because I was told by multiple agents that they do not. Ebay is successful because it allows you to have a garage sale without having traffic at your doorstep or your neighbors knowing that you are having a garage sell. It allows you to sell without having a store front. And Paypal benefits because of a near monopoly with ebay. But is is the most customer unfriendly service when you have a problem. Don't get me wrong the customer service personnel are very friendly, they apologize for the slightest of things, very polite but will tell you sorry we do not call back and when the phone is cut-off when the problem gets tough, you have to start again. Very convenient in normal times. but very inconvenient when you have a problem. Customer service is not 24 hours and long wait times for customer service. Had two incidences so far. Try a complicated problem and see how fast you get cut-off.</Msg><Username>stockbrrokerq1995</Username><Timestamp>1365778620663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 10:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365779489770-9</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH eBay Analyst Report !</Title><Username>morris_cassie</Username><Timestamp>1365771315519</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.</Msg><Username>rankindaniel973</Username><Timestamp>1365779489770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:11:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365782097139-10</Id><Title>Back to where Ebay (57.32) was yesterday morng.
