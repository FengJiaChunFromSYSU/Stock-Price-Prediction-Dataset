There needs to be a feedback interview process or at least some restrictions on who or what type of feedback can be left. If the customer received the product they ordered on time, THEN THAT'S IT!....They should not be allowed to leave a negative feedback because they didn't like the tone of an e-mail response.

Some Power Sellers think there God's gift to eBay because they move a lot of merchandise. If your rude to a customer you deserved bad feedback. Clean up your act there's always some else to take your place if you don't. eBay owes you nothing.</Msg><Username>mpg54</Username><Timestamp>1373855407468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:30:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
