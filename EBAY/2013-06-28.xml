Your big announcement kinda fell flat. Or, should I say flaccid? What a let down that must be for you. Nobody cared. The only person left to tell was you and your long list of nasty characters. The only person you got a rise out of was me and that's only because I thought we were "friends". How many other people did you lead to believe that?</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1372471188626</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 21:59:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
