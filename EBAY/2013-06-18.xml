Clearly, something does, Sybil! There is nothing wrong with your original, "Even Archive Alley, here, cLEARLY showing the indeed actionable offenses, is no deterrent!", comment. However, I did feel it was a half-assed remark. :-^D Enjoy this fantastic weather on the best coast!</Msg><Username>dr.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1371574318619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 12:51:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371606935733-14</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From Wonderful Philadelphia</Title><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1371553165521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 06:59:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hello Professor, it's obvious you completely own the puking trolls here. They dance and dance around your manly example, and yet they still can't get one jabbering point across. Even the "imposter you" showed up. That is clear and present ownership. Thanks for taking my dogs for a work and making them p and poo so very very publicly. There is not a gram of credibility left in the lot of them. PS: I'm going to send you and three others email notices about the next awesome short. The trolls however, will remain broke and useless.

Lickity lickity! Lips on fire with second hand rear door Tabasco. Small wonder they puke up this board. One can always tell Team Troll because they believe their own lies and swallowed those fake names to hate, and always repeat the same old gibberish, yet they are lost in the weeds. I thought smoking drugs was supposed to make them mellow, but I guess the smoke dirt weed. If they ever had to truly face their 13 wasted years of daily public melting sober, they'd burst in a star spangled explosion of puke. Their worsening melts shows it's imminent! Maybe they can light up by the 4th of July and finally do something American for a change.</Msg><Username>id_dejour</Username><Timestamp>1371607730861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 22:08:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371608942000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Notice All The Usual Trolls Showed Up Today With Their Half @ Remarks.</Title><Username>id_dejour</Username><Timestamp>1371607730861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 22:08:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you so forcefully publicly slap my g @ y failed daddy grand daddy and all her Ripples pals so when you know they like it?
