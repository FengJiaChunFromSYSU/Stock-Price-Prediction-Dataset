Besides that, from a technical perspective, the stock is at a longer term support level, so that reinforced the buy decision. The negativity?

Ebay continues to play the shell game with their fee structures and stock. It's obvious Amazon is the better company, overall. Sure, they might be slightly overvalued, but smart people recognize what they are trying to accomplish. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Amazon is the end-all/be-all company, but it is eBay who continues to compare themselves to them, instead of just being the great company it could be. John Donahoe is not the least bit interested in growing the company for the future, he is only interested in right now (no matter what he says, he's full of it). This is what you get with Bain spawn.</Msg><Username>skirtt_chaser</Username><Timestamp>1374343211029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:00:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374343844756-21</Id><Topic><Title>It's on Ebay not Amazon</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1374331074341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:37:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I admit I'm confused on Donahoe's thinking on what Ebay should be I myself think he's moving in the WRONG direction with the company but I'm not college educated like he is.

This is the trouble - eBay continues to struggle with it's core business, they have an identity crisis going on. Amazon is on auto-pilot in regard to their core business. Investors recognize this, and continue to go with them. If one is in the fast money game, eBay is the ideal choice. For a long term, Amazon wins, hands down. However, eBay could (and SHOULD) be king at what they do, but are short-sighted.
