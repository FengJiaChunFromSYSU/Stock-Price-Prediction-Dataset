Uh...Did you see what happened in Cyprus? They took a chunk out of the money that was sitting in people's bank accounts. We decided to do that too because we want to waste some more of the money you have exchanged your life for earning.</Msg><Username>coachd40</Username><Timestamp>1364224569839</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:16:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364225905363-6</Id><Topic><Title>Amusing A Pair Of Failed Illiterates Would Obsess On Me And Imitate Me.

On the other side of the trading aisle, 19,000 puts have crossed the tape. It looks as though a number of today's speculators are hoping EBAY will trek higher over the course of the next few days. he two most popular calls have been the weekly 3/28 52.50 and 55 strikes, which have seen 4,726 and 4,498 contracts traded, respectively. A large portion of them were exchanged at the ask price, implying they were purchased. Meanwhile, today's volume exceeds current open interest levels at both strikes, and implied volatility has surged during the course of the session -- underscoring our theory of new bullish bets.</Msg><Username>boomyy</Username><Timestamp>1364240560586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 15:42:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364241320672-21</Id><Topic><Title>Buying opportunity?</Title><Username>drd3tr01t</Username><Timestamp>1364234345038</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:59:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You might want to use the E-Zone System to find best entry point - - I think it is free on tradingstockalerts</Msg><Username>fl_geezer</Username><Timestamp>1364241320672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 15:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364242367680-22</Id><Title>just when i think she#$%$ bottom she retests</Title><Msg>not sure what'll take to get out of the dumps on this thing.
