At what he jokingly called his "first post-incarceration convention," Abramoff said he was in Tampa mostly to tell the media what happens at the private receptions he once frequented as a lobbyist at Greenberg Traurig and Preston Gates &amp; Ellis (now K&amp;L Gates) before he pleaded guilty in 2006 to bribery, fraud and tax evasion charges. During the convention, Abramoff said he ran into old friends, who were "wonderfully kind." The former lobbyist said he only heard "a snipe here and there" from his detractors.

You are deceiving yourself if you believe his presidency has been a success. Obama is nothing more than a smooth talking community leader who had no business is the white house. In 3 1/2 yrs he spent twice what Bush did in 8 yrs. and that includes Bush's personal war in Iraq. Even Obama himself knows he's a failure or he would be campaigning on a successful record rather than throwing mud and lies about his opponent. Mud is all he's got.

"Thank you President Obushma!" "The number of U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan has more than doubled since President Obama took office, The New York Times reports. One thousand members of the U.S. Army and Marines were killed in the nine years after the 2001 invasion, the newspaper said. The toll hit 2,000 last week when Specialist James A. Justice died of wounds in an Army hospital in Germany. The Times figures are based on an analysis of Defense Department statistics. The newspaper included U.S. deaths in Pakistan in operations aimed at aiding the Afghanistan effort. In 2010, Obama decided to send an additional 33,000 U.S. military members to Afghanistan. The surge increased the intensity of the fight there, and the number of U.S. casualties jumped."</Msg><Username>squamish7b</Username><Timestamp>1346777802992</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:56:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346778794545-14</Id><Topic><Title>Ask Yourself this Question</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1346766447464</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor broke psychotic Johnie Osborne!

Just plain dumb luck and the fact that drilling the Marcellus Shale is on private land. JUG EARS has a thousand ways to impede drilling on Federal land and he's trying hard through the EPA (Employment Prevention Agency) to curtail private drilling, but thank God the Subversive One hasn't found a way or knows if stops drilling on private land he'll get a push-back he can't handle. The drilling unit that our land is a part of went into production in late July, production tests are indicating it to be the 32th most productive gas well -- IN THE WORLD. The buzz is $100,000.00 - $200,000.00 PER MONTH royalty checks. One local farmer's well that went into production last year was receiving $95,000.00 a month, but due to low gas prices and an over supply of gas his well unit has been throttled back, poor guy is down to $15,000.00 a month.
