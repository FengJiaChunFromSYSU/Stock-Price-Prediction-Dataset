It is the sellers responsibility to make sure that an item gets in the buyers hands, and in the condition described in the auction. You are the one who should've purchased the insurance. 1) Did the buyer claim that they never received the coin? Did you mail the coin with delivery confirmation? Delivery confirmation is your proof that the item arrived at its destination. 2) How much did the coin sell for? If it was more than $250 then signature confirmation is mandatory by Ebay. Again that would be your proof of delivery. The issue here is not with Ebay. It is with you, the seller. It is quite obvious that you have alot to learn as a seller.</Msg><Username>sullyinmass2013</Username><Timestamp>1365166714291</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 08:58:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365167689997-8</Id><Topic><Title>Important Report on EBAY</Title><Username>jonesthomas525</Username><Timestamp>1364563893231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:31:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>full detailed report. thanks.</Msg><Username>hydenluis</Username><Timestamp>1365167689997</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 09:14:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365170015045-9</Id><Title>Thanks2 jobNumber: Good time to loadUP: EBAY CBI GOOG</Title><Msg>Yeah much cheaper now ======================= eom ===========================</Msg><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1365170015045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 09:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365170184209-10</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay Seller's Beware, This Could Happen To You...</Title><Username>bear_cubster</Username><Timestamp>1365122505480</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:41:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It does not matter how CLEARLY your auction stes that it is the buyers" WHAT????????

It is a merchants responsibility to get the merchandise into the hands of the buyer regardless of if they're selling on eBay, Amazon or their own website. It's just good business ethics. If a merchant is accepting Paypal, you ALWAYS have to use Delivery Confirmation and signature confirmation on orders over $250. By using DC, if the tracking shows as delivered, the buyer has no recourse. Why on earth anybody who accepts Paypal doesn't print shipping labels through Paypal is beyond me, unless you like waiting in line at the post office to pay more for postage?

Face facts already, eBay is not and never will be Amazon. Amazon has a reputation for customer service and satisfaction. eBay... If you want to talk to someone in the Philipines, who has no clue what they're talking about, call eBay customer service. Comparing eBay to Amazon is not unlike comparing a high end department store to a dollar store.</Msg><Username>quinnwolf</Username><Timestamp>1365200773894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 18:26:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365201004876-40</Id><Topic><Title>Move money from AAPL ..</Title><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1365190645707</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 15:37:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Listening to John Donahoe's projections for eBay in 2015 reminds me of Kenneth Lay's projections for Enron in 2001.</Msg><Username>quinnwolf</Username><Timestamp>1365201004876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 18:30:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365211120489-41</Id><Topic><Title>Important Report on EBAY</Title><Username>jonesthomas525</Username><Timestamp>1364563893231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:31:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"She probably thinks this is Dr Clarify because it has pertinent information and is liked."
