A user can perform a search using a web page associated with the localization service or by searching using an internet search engine. The user's search includes a search origin. The search origin may be defined in terms of location information such as a place name or a postal code. A search for a particular product at local retailers may be made using search parameters such as search origins, product names, model numbers, product categories, and product attributes. The localization service may provide the user with search results in the form of web pages that list which retailers sell the desired product in the vicinity of the search origin. A targeted advertisement server at the localization service may use display criteria to determine which targeted advertisements should be displayed for the user.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1358111058882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 16:04:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358129376541-6</Id><Topic><Title>Houston ~ We have SNOW</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1357835922801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:38:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Bum" is the operative word failed Daddy failed Grand Daddy, as we all know you never got to the beach much when you lived here 247 daily for 12 long years. You may have ignored me and ruined my life until I was a heroin dime bag sucking 'ho but you'll never ever ever ruin little Grand Baby Dime Bag's life. The state of California has seen to that.

All at the expense of proper stock trading and American values. Ebay is worse than Enron. At least Enron went away and the liars ate dirt.</Msg><Username>jen_dimebag</Username><Timestamp>1358129656122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 21:14:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
