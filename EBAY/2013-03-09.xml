I got luckier with APA. It's always hard to call a bottom but "oversold" and near 52 week lows you have to get in. Friday's are always tricky when options expire and weekly options have really screwed up the trade!</Msg><Username>jesseliverspot</Username><Timestamp>1362848559206</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 12:02:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362848661869-3</Id><Title>This Baird analyst really put the screws to EBAY last week!</Title><Msg>Makes you just want to find him and kick his little red #$%$</Msg><Username>jesseliverspot</Username><Timestamp>1362848661869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 12:04:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362860848899-4</Id><Topic><Title>Record High DOW (Look Out Below) But Ebay Kicked A Little Red?</Title><Username>ebay_bored</Username><Timestamp>1362525715148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 18:21:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"angel.madbezos"........Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! "Dr. Clarify handbook"........I would never share with you any of my professional advice. I may share such advice with other select elders. You are not an elder and I would choose not to share with you if you were. I hope this helps. Many people on this board have advised you to quell your fruitless and petty needling of others. Your subscription to said advice would help this forum revert to a more impassioned yet civil atmosphere. An atmosphere where intelligent posters once again feel at ease to discuss meaningful topics. You have driven most of these posters away with your childish, mean-spirited behavior. Gone are the days of brainy discourse.</Msg><Username>dr_clarify</Username><Timestamp>1362860848899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 15:27:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362880607683-5</Id><Topic><Title>Record High DOW (Look Out Below) But Ebay Kicked A Little Red?</Title><Username>ebay_bored</Username><Timestamp>1362525715148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 18:21:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor imposter child! The real Doctor Clarify, who you imitate, yet hardly flatter, was one of the original Board Elders and the Elder of such standing that your tiny mind must dress up in his used underwear to this day! Talk about childish mean spirited petty behavior! You forget that I, as the Original Board Elder, appointed the Board Elders, of which you are NOT one. We profit from the Good Doctor's Handbook despite your hate claiming we don't have it, as it was never yours to give. That is why you continue your imposter nonsense. I may print some of the archived Doctor Clarify's great writing to show you will only always be a dried barnacle on the impressive hull of such a great ship. Why keep your flattery and fakery flowing year after year after year? How g@y IS that? I hope that helps.
