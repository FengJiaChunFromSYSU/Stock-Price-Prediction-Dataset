Haven’t spoken to you in a long time, With regard to global warming, could you do me a favor and do a little research for me? I need to know what percent of the atmosphere is comprised of CO2. 40%? 4%? 0.4%? 0.04%? Less than 0.04%???? Please post. CO2, of course, is necessary for plant life. Is the Earth’s climate that sensitive that a small tweak in CO2 (in relation to the atmosphere as a whole) will have any effect on climate? I would be grateful if you could research one other question for me. The Earth is billions of years old. In the life of Earth, was there any time when the climate was static? Is it your opinion that man now has the capability to enable the climate to be static?</Msg><Username>lrseab</Username><Timestamp>1345472721000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 10:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345473060000-5</Id><Title>Engaging Force Of Gravity On Ebay.

What hasn't been established is the effect on the earth due to an increase in temperature. Elevated temps during the dinosaur period was accompanied by prolific plant growth, life was easy on earth. Where the climate change issue goes wrong is typically where all things go wrong -- GREED. Al Gore (once just a dumb newspaperman mentored by his father) has already become filthy rich beating the global warming drum. The establishment of a trading carbon exchange credits even included the present occupant of the white house. They were all set to become billionaires hawking their form of climate change snake oil. It is a beautiful thing to witness the stupid buying the climate change snake oil. Nothing gets people mentally so irrational as a 20 foot increase in ocean levels and the earth becoming a desert in our lifetimes. Hell, that even initially scared the poop out of me until ALL the facts are analyzed and it is discerned WHO is positioned to become filthy rich. Al Gore stated it was settled science, the debate was over -- until the emails surfaced that the scientific data had been massaged to achieve the armageddon like predictions the snake oil salesmen were touting. Like Deep Throat once said "Follow the money". Nothing gets my fraud antenna up as an fervent evangelistic plea, when someone invokes God or the ultimate destruction of mankind into the sale.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1345485879000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 14:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345486239000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Engaging Force Of Gravity On Ebay.

I believe that that theory has been debunked. As flytking indicated, the percent the make-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is less than four-hundredths of one percent (&lt;0.04%). I know of no controlled study that has been performed where one can isolate CO2, alter its content, make a conclusion that the Earth will warm up a half of a degree over the next century and that half of a degree will melt the polar icecaps because the icecaps’ temperature is on the cusp between a solid and a liquid. The mathematical algorithms just don’t work. I like the point that you made about following the money: Sound the CO2 alarm and get a federal grant for you and your university to study the problem. It puts food on some of the scientists’ tables.</Msg><Username>lrseab</Username><Timestamp>1345499816000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 17:56:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345501048000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Making money is now a piece of cake using this strategy!</Title><Username>faracivmnvy6796</Username><Timestamp>1345486479000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 14:14:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spammer crap</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1345501048000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345501133000-36</Id><Topic><Title>eBay could double based on this report</Title><Username>georgiannegossling</Username><Timestamp>1345479643000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 12:20:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spam -malware virus - ignore</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1345501133000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:18:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345501209000-37</Id><Topic><Title>How Can I Survive 2012? - Surviving In The Face Of Disaster</Title><Username>medina.aldo33</Username><Timestamp>1345467919000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 09:05:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPAM MALWARE VIRUS CRAP</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1345501209000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345501361000-38</Id><Title>I sew mad</Title><Msg>Tha frunt of my favrit librall magazine Newsweak saided dis month dat Burrock Whosane Ohbombya need to hit tha rode an dat we need a knew prezzydint!

I believe that that theory has been debunked." There is a scientist and his wife at Ohio State University that dedicated his life to core drilling ice all over the world. He has the largest inventory of cores in the world. He states without expressing a theory one way or the other that CO2 levels have risen to levels seen in other periods of warming. He also states that studies based on data derived from his cores has yet to support any conclusion in regards to global warming. I tend to believe the guy because he for one doesn't have a dog in the fight and for two he isn't seeking to get filthy rich off the issue. He just presents his life long work -- his data. If there is global warming the extreme element of the climate change movement have diminished the issue with their hyperbole. Personally I don't think burning the rest of the world's supply of fossil fuels will irreparably change the earth's climate. Then again I don't have a dog in the fight either. Politically one thing is for certain, climate change in the dominate factor on Jug Ears agenda. He is ready and willing to wreck the USA based on unsubstantiated science. Jugs Ears. a man with zero knowledge and even less life experiences outside of community organizing has the temerity to think he can manage the USA from the top down. The last guy of that ilk was the dictator of Germany for 9 years and we know that ended badly. An old man once told me that the USA will emerge from the next depression a dictatorship, Jug Ears scare the bejeezus out of me. Doesn't really matter to me personally I'll be dead in a few years, but I feel sorry for all the men that fought a died to establish this republic and all of those that fought and died to maintain the USA and the exceptional nation it is. Jug Ears has stated the USA isn't an exceptional nation, a little story about that: After World War II the Volkswagen automobile plant lie in ruins yet the machinery had been salvaged and protected from the elements. However Germany had no money to rebuild. Guess what this non-exceptional did? The US Army was tasked with getting the Volkswagen plant back into production. Matter of fact a US Army officer ran Volkswagen for over a year. The rest is history, it is very likely Volkswagen would have disappeared if not for this non-exceptional country. Other victors raped, plundered and abused the losers with reparations, the USA essentially asked the losers how much money they needed to get back on their feet. Never before in history had a victor been so generous and magnanimous. When General MacArthur left Japan after established a government in Japan it was the biggest parade in the history of Japan, the Japanese people revered Douglas MacArthur. Yet Jug Ears believes the USA is nothing special and guaranteed Jug Ears don't you are anything special either.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1345509302000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:35:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345510538000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting Extreme Right Wing Doubts On Ryan</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1345130853000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is trying real hard to beat Jimmy Carters title as the worst president ever.
