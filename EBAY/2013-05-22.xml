My students all know I'm alive. I'm the real Madbezos and never was James Roberge. I know it's hard for a psycho like John Osborne to admit he wasted over a decade obsessing on false names. Only a fool posts here, do politics, or sell on ebay with their real names. Don't you agree John Osborne, ebay's failing z50com and VW? I hope the Roberge family gives a psycho like you all the attention you crave, and may the public bash your z50com and VW ebay sites. Sick losers should live on the highway in ditches until the chain gang finds you, as your public actions prove once again John Osborne z50com and VW. Must be fun to be trapped daily in your lies and illness while you can't even feed yourself.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1369219604105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 06:46:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369220047958-2</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Homeless John Osborne z50com Is Dying Over His False Information And Obsession.</Title><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1369219604105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 06:46:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good morning Professor. Congratulations on graduating another great class. Again. No worries on Johnie Osborne as Ian has his every move tracked. John is just a spinning top winding down.
