And so many pants. The shirts and pants I am talking about are barely used. In the past year I have gone from a weight of 170 to 145 (kale smoothies day and night). I am lighter than you now.

You and I both know who is though. I am certain now that same person also played several "Charles" characters to F with you, John, etc. His main purpose on this board is to F with heads no matter whose. He probably had many ID's with the name fly &amp; john in them and you assumed they were "Charles". This person studies characteristics of a "real person" and duplicates them like a schizophrenic cameleon. He is a highly educated, grown man playing games on a message board like a prepubescent boy. Apparently the cerebral fibers in his frontal lobes became stunted at puberty causing an impaired maturity level yet the ability to excel on an educational (and scheming) front....like one may think of a mad scientist or insane genius. He had to dumb down for several of his characters but as much as he tried, his literacy was difficult to mask. This person has admitted to being Agqut. There were many times when I thought to myself that Agqut's writing skills were a little too accomplished for a "3rd grade drop out"....but I told myself perhaps he had time to educate himself while serving a prison term or while on that Navy ship drifting on the seas of the Atlantic for months on end. (lol) Well, his recent agqut admission solved that little "doubting voice in the back of my head" mystery. To profile his mental illness further it is my guess this person kept a log of his cast of characters, describing their personality, traits, sayings, misspellings, life story, etc. as well as what they have said and how they have said it. Afterall, he had to remain consistent with their biography. Even with those certainties one thing you and I can agree on is, "even after years of experience it is difficult to tell who is who".</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1372710206649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:23:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372724520611-15</Id><Topic><Title>It was a hot one today in the desert</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1372480227362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 00:30:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't be allowed in Vermont.
