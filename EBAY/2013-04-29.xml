The true beauty is in appreciating one's loving family, warm home, and friendly intelligent colleagues, who deal only in factional information, never misguided delusions. The power of deep intelligence powered with good intentions is the only way to have direct import or impact. I hope that helps.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1367238591138</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367246647245-2</Id><Title>Ebay will be $55+ by Friday</Title><Msg>Ebay is now more than $10 below price target, that's a 20%+ upside from the price today.</Msg><Username>acman40930</Username><Timestamp>1367246647245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:44:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367248322303-3</Id><Title>Good Morning Fellow Ebayers</Title><Msg>The truth be told only Ebay works and works well</Msg><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1367248322303</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367250148116-4</Id><Title>Motley fool: growth rate: ebay 21% amzn 24%, but ebay 89% cheaper than amzn by P/E</Title><Msg>Third, eBay's core growth rate is second only to Amazon. When comparing companies, I use a measure called core operating cash flow. Core operating cash flow is simply a company's net income plus depreciation. Using this measure eliminates some of the non-cash adjustments companies make to their cash flow. Using this measure, only Amazon showed a faster core operating cash flow growth rate of 23.69% over the last year. eBay came in second showing 21.02% growth, compared to 18.22% growth at Google, and 7.01% growth at Walmart. Given the fact that investors can buy eBay for a P/E ratio 89% cheaper than Amazon, and get almost the same cash flow growth is impressive</Msg><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1367250148116</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:42:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367254539638-5</Id><Topic><Title>eBay Below 50 This Week</Title><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367177842461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:37:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Precisely.

"PayPal is posting impressive growth in accounts, but the number of payments is going the other direction. In fact, in the last five quarters, active account growth has increased from 12% to 16%. In this same timeframe, net payments have decreased almost sequentially from 31% to 23%. With more members and less net payments, PayPal's growth seems to be slowing down." Paypal is 40% of eBay's income.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1367254859706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 13:00:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367255013188-8</Id><Topic><Title>eBay Will NEVER Go Below $50.00 Again.
