Looking at what the polititians in Washington are doing. It's a real SHAME when politics are going to creat the worst economic downturn of probably all times. The senators, house members are all multi millionaires, and they seem not to care much about the population of the U.S. Obama won the election even with the platform he unveiled to fellow Americans. Still people voted for him, So IMO House Speaker Boehner should wake up and realise what the people of the US want, not what HE wants. SHAME ON EVERY MEMBER OF GOVERNMENT IN THE US</Msg><Username>marty81274</Username><Timestamp>1356787955053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:32:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356788279839-4</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst Interviews: ECommerce Stock Outlook amp; Review</Title><Username>milagrosferringerqyoisas8564</Username><Timestamp>1308326168000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-06-17 11:56:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thats true</Msg><Username>stevensherry131</Username><Timestamp>1356788279839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:37:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356796930053-5</Id><Topic><Title>I've officially called buying on ebay Quits!</Title><Username>jupiterspinning</Username><Timestamp>1356460169774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 13:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am really upset today. I bidded on several items on ebay, someone changed my bids, I didn't know who, put large amounts, I am done buying on ebay from now on. I called and spoke to a man who assured me everything would be ok, told me to wait an hour or so, yes, I am concerned because within the last 12 hours you cannot retract a bid. I told him it has happened on three of my items this morning. I repeatedly asked to speak with the resolutions office and was not directed to them. I am concerned as someone has been bidding on my behalf unbeknown to me. They had my correct bid amount on their end. Yes, then they stick the difference in money in their pockets. Well, no more bidding from me. We all lost because of this, me on my bidding, the person selling and ebay. I hope they stop the dishonest people from doing this to innocent people. Soon they will have no business if this keeps up. I do not believe the seller did this either. I believe someone at ebay is dishonest here.</Msg><Username>dove_debra</Username><Timestamp>1356796930053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 11:02:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356814577106-6</Id><Title>I am sure, that Ebay's Milo hurts an important patent of Local Corp</Title><Msg>Milo is local shopping made easy.
