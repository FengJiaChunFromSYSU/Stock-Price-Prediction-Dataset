Am I stuck with it for the duration of the auction? I used to be the one answering these questions for others. To this day I still get phone calls with eBay questions but it has been so long since I did this on a regular basis I'm not up on all the changes they make on a daily basis.</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1354888212456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:50:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354893084873-2</Id><Title>The big funds are buying EBAY puts and AMZN calls, AMZN shares they r buying serious weight</Title><Msg>Listen anywhere Amazon decides to enter and go take market share, they are successful, they step on googles toes and then have a better product and more customers in the cloud, goog has repeatedly dropped prices yet Amazon with a better product has stopped dropping prices for the cloud yet more and more people continue to sign up for Amazons cloud which has gotten larger and better for 6 years straight. Now Amazon apps are up a whopping 500% and market share rumors are that they now have 11-17% of tablet market share after selling a chitload as so many stayed home and bought online and Amazon had the best price on the kindle fire and the parents loved the controls to block bad stuff from kids. Now Amazon is going to list private sellers and auction people listing into 2 categories and take many loyal ebay customers with simpler and better pricing, less hassle listings, and AMZN is going to offer the good sellers loans so they can get bigger and AMZN makes more when they sell more, AMZN is just too smart, its not fair for people not as smart to compete. Watch as ebay stock goes nowhere or down while AMZN runs right by its 52 week high and approaches its target of 314, should be around that by JAN 15-19th and after Jan 31st (record earnings) will gap to 240-350!</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1354893084873</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:11:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354902137733-3</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY is too beneficial to miss right now.

If it does not have a bid you could change it back at least it used to be that way. If no bids are on the item cancel the auction and start again. You should be getting 50 free auctions a month.
