They are separate it into 2 different type of ebay type sellers, this is not good for Ebay, not good at all. Amazon simply crushes any area it wants to enter. With Amazons price target raised to 314,I recommend the Jan 310 calls that were .55 by .65 a few weeks ago and the mm is sleeping or trying to get fools to sell them before moving them up quickly to where they were, and then higher quickly as the news is better and the target price has been raised along with all the obvious hints, that this will be Amazons best earnings report in the history of the company. Amazon is now listing the ebay private seller listings in two separate categories, this is bad for Ebay and wonderful for Amazon that will do what Ebay does but smarter, AMZN is also offering loans to proven sellers. 314 is not high enough of a target my friends and Amazons market cap is over 100 billion less then google and over 450 billion less then AAPL yet Amazon competes and scares both companies on a daily basis. I am long 2700 shares AMZN, short 1000 bidu,short 1000 sony, with 4000 amzn call contracts.290-295-300-305-310-315-320-325 Jan calls</Msg><Username>gruen7</Username><Timestamp>1354551121410</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:12:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354551224582-8</Id><Title>EBAY is definitely looking very good.

The big boys are buying Ebay puts as insurance for a big fall. (in this case 10-15 points) and AMZN calls as big boys see a move above Amazons 52 week high this week, (an 87% probability) the target was raised to 314 and Amazon has a habit of reaching targets very quickly. I saw 3 separate 50,000 US dollar sales of EBAY stock and immediatly 300 of the Jan 250 amzn calls and 170 of the Jan 285's then 25 of the 290's and 25 of the 295's immediately following the 150,000 shares of EBAY dumped. Then 200 of the 50.00 and 52.50 puts of EBAY then if that wasn't enough 265 270 275 Jan Amzn calls 150 contracts each. Listen I am long Ebay shares, I'm just smart enough to protect them with 10 times my long shares in EBAY puts and 100 times my AMZN shares in calls. A 100 or 200, wish I had 100 of the Jan 310 calls, we are talking new E350 Benz when Amazon reaches its target of 314 by Jan 19th. Not only is everyone long Amazon and fighting over shares but the 20% of Hedge Funds that are down on the year will all pile in AMZN for the ride north of 300 by Jan 15th. It can change a losing hedge funds year from being down and having redemptions to being up 5-7% on the year.</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1354552991202</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:43:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354553808092-11</Id><Title>Dramatic you are so right as ebay was getting talked up on CNBC big boys dumping into it</Title><Msg>Nobody with a pulse would not fear Amazon listing in a different and seems to be better way to list the main listing Ebay makes its money from. Scary Scary Scary...ebay is a great company but why risk it? Amazon dominates any place it feels like dominating. I also just bought EBAY puts and Amzn calls, makes me safe in case of a fiscal cliff sell off and Amazon will break its 52 week high ahead of its best earnings report ever anyway, regardless of fiscal cliff , my shares of ebay will most likely go up also but they are up a lot before this new uncertainty of Amazon entering my Ebay's main sales. Why should I take a chance?, I am locking in my Ebay profits by protecting them with ebay puts. I will cover Bidu around 70 and by then should be able to get back in Ebay around 43-44 area maybe a little higher unless Amazon has really started to dent Ebays business by then.</Msg><Username>nanotechmillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1354553808092</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:56:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354557499053-12</Id><Topic><Title>Very well written report, it's really worth reading.</Title><Username>raymondcox273</Username><Timestamp>1354552653315</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:37:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report</Msg><Username>millerrichard290</Username><Timestamp>1354557499053</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:58:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354566288605-13</Id><Title>Sell it!!!! downgrade!</Title><Msg>last time it went to 51</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1354566288605</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:24:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354584461469-14</Id><Topic><Title>DRIBBLES and some of his ids...</Title><Username>sullyinma2007</Username><Timestamp>1343308033000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 09:07:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sullyinma2007 you bees de mows funniest peoples ever in the universes!</Msg><Username>janesnose</Username><Timestamp>1354584461469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 20:27:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354584601590-15</Id><Topic><Title>EBAY is definitely looking very good.
