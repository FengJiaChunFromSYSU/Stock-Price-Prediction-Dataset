Need serious knowledge and experience. More details will follow ASAP. Have to have access to acquisition people, and Brazilian bond procedures. Those interested should know that these items are not tradeable, will never be put into PPP, and should be viewed for what they are:if real, very valuable pieces of history. Anybody who is interested in that rare Rembrandt, old Indian nickle, Babe Ruth's last piece of chewing gum, 1926 Ford,mink that Betty Grable wore, old gem. etc will be intrigued by these, and place them some place safe to eventually go to grandchildren.
