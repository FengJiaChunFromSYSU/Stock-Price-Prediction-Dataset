Rakuten is very well known in Japan for its on-line shopping, travel, golf reservations, community and greeting cards sites. This will be the company’s largest acquisition to date. “We are extremely pleased that LinkShare has agreed to be acquired by Rakuten under the proposed terms,” said ICG chairman and CEO Walter Buckley. “Since we acquired a stake in LinkShare in 1998, we have strongly believed in LinkShare’s potential to be a market leader, the strength and vision of its management team and the value it delivers to merchants and affiliates, added Buckley. “We view this event as a great illustration of the ICG model, as it demonstrates the full cycle of owning, building and realizing the value of one of our Core partner companies.” AP provides a little background info on LinkShare: LinkShare runs a performance-based online advertising business called affiliate marketing service. LinkShare places client companies’ advertising on blogs and other Web sites managed by individuals, and the site creators can get compensation once the viewers of the sites buy advertised goods. Established in 1996, Linkshare posted a revenue of $32 million for the fiscal year ended June last year. Its clients include such companies as Dell Inc. The deal is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to reach completion within about four to six weeks. ICG is expecting to get about $150 million out of the deal.

Read between the lines. eBay was upgraded by Compass Point, a slightly less than reputable firm. Also notice the flurry of news stories today on Forbes, Barrons, etc.. Shows eBay is buying coverage as those news outlets are pay to play. I think investors are finally becoming aware of the smoke and mirrors game eBay management is playing and it's reflected in the stock price tanking.</Msg><Username>masterbates649</Username><Timestamp>1370369134152</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 14:05:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370375091418-10</Id><Topic><Title>Upgraded to buy</Title><Username>p28j15</Username><Timestamp>1370350545189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:55:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another upgrade another dump</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1370375091418</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370376874844-11</Id><Title>Timberrrrrrr!</Title><Msg>Down she goes..........</Msg><Username>newengsalvage</Username><Timestamp>1370376874844</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:14:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370381282822-12</Id><Title>Ebays finds new bottom at $52.50,</Title><Msg>$52.50 should be the bottom, now for the run up back to $58.00 A person can make a lot of money playing this stock up and down. 52.50 is a buy now, then sale at 57.00.ebay goes back down to the next buy point at 53.50 and then sale at $58.00 54.50 59.00 55.50 60.00 after earnings report 65.00</Msg><Username>acman40930</Username><Timestamp>1370381282822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 17:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370381862353-13</Id><Topic><Title>Ebays finds new bottom at $52.50,</Title><Username>acman40930</Username><Timestamp>1370381282822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 17:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct about eBay's volatility and potential profits, however, you would need some serious skin in the game (ie:$50,000+) to make $2000-$4000 after capital gains. eBay's not going to run up anytime soon.

This is nowhere near the bottom. If I thought you had a gram of credibility I would explain how the DOW touching 15000 causes serious investors to divest and diversify before the little investors get shucked again. If you invested at all you would know that, but paid shills don't make enough to invest. PS: Didn't you spend years melting at someone playing ebay (and other stocks) up and down? Loser. Ha.
