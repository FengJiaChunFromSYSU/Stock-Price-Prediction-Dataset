Depending on the type of financing and the subsequent expected start of actual gold production I would think an initial run to the .15-.20 range is quite possible. Obviously there are other factors that could take it much higher. The new C.E.O. was a director at the U.S.Mint prior to joining the company. Read the recent Yahoo news. "Penny stock today. Dollar stock tomorrow."</Msg><Username>wcoastguy2008</Username><Timestamp>1348846846754</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 11:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348853436885-5</Id><Title>EBAY is a piece of FU$@#% #$%$ STOCK</Title><Msg>Markets are well off the lows of the day, and this piece of SH@# stock is at it's lows.
