This seller's money is gone for good. PayPricBassturds pulled that same stunt on me a half dozen times. PayPal accepted the unauthorized credit card, but refuses to take responsibility for doing so. PayPric simply reverses the transaction to avoid a loss to PayPric. The seller's fault is they shipped too quick. In PayBassturds transaction reversal email, PayPal emphatically states: "Do not ship the item" -- OOPS! Too Late. The eBay seller is between a rock and hard place, eBay demands fast shipment or DSR's will be whacked. The prompt shipper bears the risk of having the transaction reversed. Chalk it up to the price of doing business on eBay and adjust your selling prices accordingly. Your Ebay prices should be at least 15% higher than you'd normally sell the item elsewhere to compensate for the risk. Higher selling prices are your only insurance against eBay's institutionalized fraud.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1343311463000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343312423000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Does Ebay SELLER PROTECTION Exist ???</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1343256347000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 18:45:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Incidentally, just received an email from eBay about new quote "Seller Protection Enhancements" coming this fall. In part Ebay evidently has recognized the buyers are abusing the absolute power eBay gave them. http://announcements.ebay.com/2012/07/fall-2012-seller-update/ However, like every eBay policy change there is a hidden fee increase. If you end an auction item, you'll now pay the full Final Value Fee anyway. Don't list an item if you think it could possibly sell elsewhere. Ebay found a way to lockout a period of time to have the exclusive market for your item, and you pay for it.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1343312423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343317493000-6</Id><Title>Poor Broke Sullied Sybil z50com Dribbling Away!

Perfect description of professor bozo. Bozo has been neutered for well over a year now and recently been relegated to the 'who the heck is this clown' status. But, in all fairness, even the mental middleweight bozo obviously finds the idiocy abyss that exists on this board now not worthy of reading much less responding to. All the intelligent posters have gone, all that are left the mental dregs of society which unfortunately is the way the internet is heading. The cacophony of stupidity on the internet is so loud, insistent and overwhelming that it drowns out and drives away good people, less and less information is shared today because folks simply hate being attacked and derided by the stupid like those prevalent on this board now. On the other extreme are jerks like bozo that will viciously and tenaciously attack and deride others with his pseudo-intellectual farce just to delude himself that he is the smartest person in the room. There is nothing to be learned here anymore, and if you present mental slobberers get enjoyment from posting your idiocy may God help and protect you because you are indeed a pitiful excuse for human beings. Then again seems most of you are posting on your employer's time, the poor bassturd! that hired you idiots.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1343331716000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:41:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343333268000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Does Ebay SELLER PROTECTION Exist ???</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1343256347000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 18:45:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of doc_madbezos aka Bozo, here he is in his Walmart uniform. http://www.clown-ministry.com/images/bozo-the-clown-adult-costume.jpg ROTFLMAO!!!
