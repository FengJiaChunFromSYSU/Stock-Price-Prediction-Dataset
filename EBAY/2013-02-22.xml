Are you still obsessed daily with a man from 2005 that outed your ebay selling lies and showed the world that you would sacrifice your family (especially your daughter and grand child) to live on a third rate chat board of a 5th rate stock 247 every day for 12 years? Really? That's your story and it's someone else's fault? ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All day in comfort, ease, and high minded pursuits, it's so much like being a tenured professor. Is that yellow moisture on the end of my Golden Staff or am I just happy to see John and Fly still obsessing in their endless endless endless circles?
