Sorry Doppel, You're No Gina Or Shack</Title><Msg>Poor Sybil Sullied. I tried to be silent today in respect to the bag holders who lost major money yesterday, but must comment on your worsening public illness. I wonder why Mommy Yahoo let's you have my ID? Oh well. It's time to re-celebrate Charlie's Angels. In honor of everyone who listened to you and Fly, yet chose HIM. You impersonate me but could never be me. You impersonate my friends but you could never be a toe nail on them. No one is fooled. The most insane poster rotting here daily in dozens of IDs, who wasted 10,000 posts in 5000 IDs and millions of words to accomplish nothing, is in your mirror. It's funny to witness your public swirling down the drain. Funny to see typos festor you. Funny to see your same old tired endless repeating hate, at the same old made up names. YOU were always IT. Please die now, so you, and our board, can finally be quiet. I hope that helps.</Msg><Username>madbezos.angels</Username><Timestamp>1371815333749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 07:48:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371815959620-2</Id><Topic><Title>Good Morning From Wonderful Philadelphia.

Smart. Keen! A little hard and honest work and you are rewarded. Some still can't figure it out! Some have it, some don't.

TEAM will give me carte blanche and handle me with kid gloves. They seem such an inten$e and "winning" organization with good and honest people. Failure is no option here. Very shortly there will be another proposal electronically transmitted to me through TEAM's server. I will check the proposal over and, this time, may possibly ink with TEAM. I will tweet later. ciao</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1371827414566</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 11:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371829497147-8</Id><Topic><Title>Loving every minute of my FREE SPEECH doctrine!
