You publicly foisted John Osborne z50com, and his 5000 destroyed IDs, along with Sybil and Sullied, on us all while you snitched out and deleted posts and posters trying to blame another man. You've had all that served back to you as ashes in all your mouths full of very public daily puke. It doesn't matter how many 1000 posts you and your "team" waste and how many times you lie by saying it's "all one poster" my team is going to make you personally choke on that puke and mark your graves as the toxic waste dumps they are. Personally, one is asking for it playing such public witnessed games when Patrick Mitchell, John Osborne, Sybil and Sullied's exact locations are known. You've noticed authority figures paying extra attention to you, yet no attention to your reports.That is just the start. You've been given too many chances to end your public puke so now enjoy its bile stuck inside your lungs for eternity. When people remember "Flyktning", Patrick Mitchell, San Rafael's idiot tax boy, they will see the boat anchor of John, Sybil and Sullied wrapped around all of your necks.

He LIES about ebay paying his bills, he lies about growing dope when he lives on the street, he LIES about the people he cyber stalks, he and his girlfriends LIE about every single thing in their lives and everything they say and do because facing the truth would destroy them. We already see it is wrecking their minds and their old man bodies are failing. These old gumming grandpa's can never hurt the people who out them. But the coolest thing of all, is that all his "team's" lies will be shoved down there throats and rot their for eternity. Everything they say will be a sigh of relief for anyone who knew them when they soon go silent. The echo of their sickness will ring in their skulls eternally, but everything they ever said will be as quickly forgotten as John's deleted posts. That is the only result and legacy they can ever have: a cold lonely rotting grave.
