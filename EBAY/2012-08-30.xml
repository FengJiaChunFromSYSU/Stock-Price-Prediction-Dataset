Jan Brewer, who pointed her finger in the face of President Barack Obama during a heated confrontation on a tarmac in Phoenix earlier this year, endorsed him for president at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday. During an interview with MSNBC from the convention floor, Brewer--who has taken a hard line on border security and illegal immigration in her state--was asked if she had talked to Mitt Romney about those issues. "I know Governor Romney understands those issues," Brewer said, before her slip-of-the-tongue: I know that if President Obama is elected in November, which I hope that he is, that he will be able to come together with all of us and come up with a solution and I believe he will secure our borders and therefore we can resolve all those other issues, it's a simple matter.</Msg><Username>barack_obama_in_2012</Username><Timestamp>1346332663473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 09:17:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346333922381-2</Id><Topic><Title>Jan Brewer endorses Obama at convention</Title><Username>barack_obama_in_2012</Username><Timestamp>1346332663473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 09:17:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These Republicans are literally shooting themselves in the foot during this convention.

With Paypal, customers will be able to have another viable mobile payment solution, placing them in the ring with competitors like Google (Nasdaq: GOOG ) , Square, and Merchant Exchange Services (MCX), all geared up to take advantage of the upcoming move into mobile payments.

When JUG EARS gushes on eloquently about "GREEN JOBS" and a "GREEN ECONOMY" I want to hurl at the stupidity. Sending our pollution to China is acceptable to you? Then you don't believe in "GLOBAL" warming? "I agree we need industrial jobs here at home, but the American economy is too expensive because of all the promises we have made in the form of social security, private pensions and health care delivery. ----This is not really any president's fault----" Health care delivery isn't any president's fault? What do you call the albatross JUG-EARS-CARE? JUG-EARS-CARE is the final nail in America's economic coffin. Every boardroom in the USA is wrestling with the tremendous added expense JUG-EARS-CARE adds to costs. It's a business decision, a majority of lower margin companies will chuck JUG-EARS-CARE OR if possible move off-shore. It's IMPOSSIBLE to provide the NON-PRODUCTIVE with first class health care. The productive capacity of the USA can't support it. The USA already spends $10,000.00 per year PER PERSON on health care. Sounds heartless to limit (not eliminate) care to the NON-productive, but the NON-productive shouldn't receive knee and hip replacements, heart bypass surgery, liver transplants or any of the high price procedures, but JUG-EARS-CARE does just this. To give you an example of this right now. My neighbor is on welfare, as her parents were for the past 70 years. The only time anyone in that family was employed was when the father in 1964 was forced to work at Christy Park Works of US STEEL making bomb casings for the Vietnam war, my father rode the bus with him to work and the guy bawled his eyes out complaining he was making about $10.00 a week more for working, in a year he was back on welfare. The current father is suffering from heart disease, his wife is a paraplegic(from being thrown from parent to parent in a mid-night crying spell until one of the parents dropped her). Information (inappropriate) from a lady that works in the social services offices reveals that in 2011 the sum of $320,000.00 was spent on their medical bills. It's easy to see, there are white medical supply vans that visit their house every other day. Try getting a medical supply to deliver you medical services or supplies. To give you an idea of the laziness of these NON-productive people. For years when I pick sweet corn (daily in a 45 day season) I would pick them a couple of dozen per day and sit it on their mailbox. I did this primarily to keep them from stealing it as they had done in the past. This year being out of town a lot I left a note on their mailbox that they could pick their own. Guess what, even though they have a person provided to assist them with household chores they picked none. You rarely see anyone outside their home any more since the government installed air conditioning(ostensibly for medical purposes). They have become so lazy and demanding of others to provide them with everything that they refuse to pick a genuine free summertime treat. Here's a family that consumes $400,000.00 per year of government money yet contributes absolutely zero to society, AND they will keep consuming $400,000.00 plus in perpetuity because they have bred the next generation. These people get first class medical care for free. my grandfather died of heart disease in 1964, his total hospital bill was $400.00, they put him in an oxygen tent and provided pain shots for two days until he died. That's just how it used to be and my grandfather was a highly productive person, he could do the work of 10 men. There are intelligent solutions it's just government is incapable of finding them.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346338382000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346338711000-5</Id><Title>Read this new report on eBay</Title><Msg>I cant believe what this analyst just told me about eBay .

The global warming issue has been corrupted to be a power and control issue. JUG EARS doesn't give a s#it about global warming, it's just a vehicle to power, control and riches for him (you do know JUG EARS is a founding member of the trading exchange for carbon credits and is poised to make billions from his investment). Global warming is red meat to wild eyed liberals and the less politically savvy. It is a "feel good" issue, who could possibly be against the environment. It's also an issue the zealots can seize upon to advance their particular sinister political agenda. It's a perfect "us against them issue", the greenies automatically have the moral high ground because they set themselves up as the saviors of the planet, any opposition by default hate the planet. Yet despite the moral high ground the greenies can't make it fly because they are bald faced liars as the emails that surfaced where the greenies own scientists openly admitted to fudging the data. Yet, Analmale you refuse to back up and see the issue in an intelligent format. For you it's all about screaming about "settled science" that is based on lies and deception. Yes, the global warming issue needs to be addressed in an intelligent and scientific manner, but naive corrupt idiots like you and the corrupt methods you support have done what's likely permanent damage to the global warming issue. Your self-enriching idiot front man AL Gore also damages the cause. JUG EARS had control of the house and senate, cap and trade was a done deal except the lies came out and even the wild-eyes strident faced dimocrats ran for political cover. Cap and Trade would be a reality if not for the liars and the corrupt ideology you support. Analmale you are obviously a reasonably intelligent person, but like JUG EARS you are functionally an idiot.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346349405000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:56:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346350406000-11</Id><Topic><Title>RNC "We Built This" With 62% Of Public Funds</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1346089627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 13:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intelligent discourse????? Sounds more like the ravings of a communistic lunatic and certified idiot. I haven't heard this much stupid communistic rhetoric since the 1950's Isn't it strange that communist countries are bending towards capitalism to survive. Agreed, looking abstractly capitalism is a mean and cruel system particularly to the lowest class. History however has produced clear and indisputable evidence capitalism is the best system yet devised. Are there abuses, certainly, but humans are imperfect therefore no political system can be perfect. The communists like Analmale had to build walls to keep people IN, the USA has to build walls to keep people from flooding in, pretty conclusive proof our system is the best. ---------------------- Good morning.

Those that have health plans will see little change. Premiums will continue to rise faster than inflation as they have been doing for decades regardless of which party held the White House. Medical care delivery is now up to 18 percent of GDP, a higher percentage that any other nation on earth in spite of our high per capita income and in spite of the fact that our national government has less of a role in managing health care services than any of these other nations. On another note, I agree we have too many people who are able to rationalize a non-involvement in the economy or an illegal underground role due to public subsidy. We have to learn how to get help to those who need it without shoveling it to those who don't.</Msg><Username>flyktning</Username><Timestamp>1346350702000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:18:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346353402000-14</Id><Title>Is eBay about to plunge?

My idea for the $80 billion Food Stamp program is to limit purchases of food to a limited number of VALUE based SKU's that will provide adequate nutrition. No snacks, no prepared food, no sodapop, etc. Food like fruits, fresh vegetables, cheaper cuts of meat, dried beans, flour and other ingredients, in other words BASIC foodstuffs. In the grocery store have you ever seen what a food stamp recipient piles their cart high with? -- I don't eat that good. Cutting out by SKU what food stamps can buy could cut food stamp expenditures by two thirds.,,,,but,,,, that's nonsense, that's only $50 billion, chicken feed the wild eyed liberals would reply, only 13 lousy days federal borrowing, chicken feed, Agqut you cruel ugly bassturd.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346354264000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:17:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346354648000-16</Id><Title>Poor Angry Hateful AnalAdgut Admits Defeat</Title><Msg>Poor angry hateful AnalAdqut's nickname for me could not shout LOUDER that she has been whipped in every way, shape and form by my facts and has to resort to name calling, which tells us all far more about her real life proclivities than my straight male lifestyle or interests.

This doctor has had great success in treating the AIDS epidemic in Haiti. When asked how he could afford to buy the drugs necessary to treat AIDS, the doctors replied (paraphrasing): "Most of the drugs to treat AIDS are off patent. We have the generics manufactured in INDIA for $.01 cent on the dollar" ThaT'S NO TYPO -- 1 cent on the dollar. I can validate the low cost of drugs in India. Several of our grandchildren use Albuterol asthma inhalers of which their parents were paying a $36.00 co-pay at the drug store, so you can assume the total cost was near $100.00 per inhaler. I found the inhaler in India for $3.50 EACH. My daughters now buys 10 inhalers for the price of her previous co-pay. Very convenient as they can have inhalers in the car, at their camp and other places as children are likely to forget carrying one with them/ The inhalers look exactly like the Glaxo-Kline inhaler, even the instruction sheet is eerily similar. I venture to say Glaxo has their $100.00 inhalers manufactured in India for about a buck a piece delivered to the USA. Now if our government was SERIOUS about bending the cost curve down the government would shop the world for drugs the government is paying for.

Your first love JUG EARS could have addressed the cost of drugs in the "Affordable"(facetious context) Care Act -- HE DIDN'T. I remain pessimistic, I believe this country has to impact the financial concrete wall at a 1000 mile per hour to show people there was actually a financial crisis. Hey, lets talk about gay marriage, free birth control pills or something that don't mean a s#it. Ryan had a good line in his speech last night --paraphrasing -- do you want an America where everything is free except the people (then vote for JUG EARS) The USA "HAD" one thing going for it -- freedom -- without it the innovation the USA created and prospered from would have never happened. JUG EARS is depressing the spirit off this country, 4 more years of his idiocy the USA may never recover. BTW Romney is an idiot too, an idiot that loves the USA though. I wouldn't vote for either one, but I will definitely vote AGAINST anti-everything but black JUG EARS.</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1346365476000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 18:24:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
