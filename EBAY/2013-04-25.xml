Yourself in your fake imposter ID is always right? You are your own biggest fan in all your many IDs! It's all you live for: being a fraud, a fake, a con. I see a tiny typo causes your ID fail! Too funny. Always is. It's not the first time your emotions have outed your lies. I have an easy career, as a fully tenured professor, which grants me a few free moments to completely destroy you as a fake, a phony, a con and a self aggrandizing sham, yet you are too delusional to see it and come back for beating after public beating. You still pretend you have the skills to be a grammar queen when all I half to do is throw you a typo and say good dog, good dog. But you are not good. Just a dog. Now go fetch.
