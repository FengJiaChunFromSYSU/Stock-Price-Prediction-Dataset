I have been selling on Ebay under the name of Mill Fabric Store out of my house since December 8, 2003 with 1,363 feedbacks with a 5 star rating. Up until a few months ago, I had a 100% feedback rating except for “one customer“. I sent her invoice for six items with the shipping &amp; handling expense Ebay stated on the invoice. I made one mistake. She gave me negative feedback six times. After that mistake I made sure that I combined the shipments. She is the only person I received a negative feedback from so I have no way of knowing that other people complained. They didn’t make it known to me on the feedback or the 5 star ratings. I feel the buyer has no right to find fault with my “shipping &amp; handling” charges. I list my auction. They see the picture and like it. They see the price and agree to it. They read the description and agree to it. They read the “shipping &amp; handling” charges and agree to it. Then they buy my fabric. They have agreed to all the terms or they wouldn’t have made the purchase. Then I’m told that they complained about the shipping costs. It’s “shipping &amp; handling costs” as listed by Ebay on the auction under shipping and payments title. It’s “shipping &amp; handling” as stated on the buyers invoice by Ebay. If they didn’t agree to the “shipping &amp; handling costs“, they shouldn’t have made the purchase of the fabric. The dashboard states that I am below standard - Global. I don’t sell outside the USA. The dashboard also states..”Your policy compliance rating is high”. I just made a purchase last week and on the feedback it says…“tell us more” but a message says “Why can’t I enter this rating?” It states “Free shipping automatically gives the seller a five star rating”. I didn’t get Free shipping, I was charged $5.95 Your policy states that if a seller rating is low, search of his items will be limited, then I would be limited to fewer listings, then after that I would be “suspended” and told what I have to correct in my auctions in order to list items again. Your stated Ebay auction policies were not carried out as stated. Maybe your software has some glitches in it. In any case I don’t feel I should be treated this way. I would like to know exactly why Ebay restricted indefinitely my account over one incident many months ago that I corrected right away. You can read all my feedbacks where my customers rave about my fabric, my very low prices, the quality, the super fast shipping, etc. etc. I respectfully request that you allow me to continue to sell on Ebay.</Msg><Username>ab2244</Username><Timestamp>1345823308727</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:48:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345823402192-9</Id><Topic><Title>Ebay</Title><Username>ab2244</Username><Timestamp>1345823308727</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:48:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't see my message on the board.</Msg><Username>ab2244</Username><Timestamp>1345823402192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:50:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345824348000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Go check Out the New &amp; Improved Message Boards</Title><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1345818553000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe they will leave the Ebay board alone.
