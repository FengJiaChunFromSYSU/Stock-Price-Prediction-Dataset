"I don't care what people say on this idiotic board" you might say, but you do. You are imitating Charlie, using his words, copying his names and overlooking the many excesses of what he writes while taking down EPMB for doing a scant portion of what Charlie does. Join the late Madbezos and Midnite as backers of a guy who has written his way into obsessive self-abusive misery. Like them you will deny supporting Charlie, but you are, every step of the way."

Um, your post, to which I am replying, is dated "May 21". Above, you can clearly see that at that time, you are stating the school year is still very much in session, but winding down. Actually, the Spring session was over and the Summer session had already commenced at the time of your post! Yep, at Temple, final exams for the Spring 2013 session ended May 15 and Commencement was May 16. The Summer session began May 20. Where do you teach, "Professor"?
