I think they're touring in Canada this year anyway. He even has a look to him that's Freddiesk. Did you see the photo of him (Marc) with a mustache next to a pic of Freddie? They showed them side by side on the Ellen Show YouTube video. Uncanny. He's the closest vocal wise than anyone else of heard....still not Freddie of course. I still go on my Queen binges every so often, where that's all I'll listen to for days on end. Their music never gets old (to me). To this day the relationship he had with Mary Austin makes me melt. The true meaning of the word soul mate.
