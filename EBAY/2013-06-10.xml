Ever notice how intelligent people always wake early and get more down with their day than the silly people who waste their lives filling pages and pages of a chat board with a pestering circular hatred based on false information they sadly believe. I'm so glad I don't sully my incredible mind on that. I'll have yet another enjoyable day with my wonderful family and my garden. Be thankful you don't have the public mental illnesses deeply infecting our board. Unless you do. Then ask yourself: how g @ y IS that? I hope that helps.</Msg><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1370861845189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 06:57:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370862087342-2</Id><Topic><Title>Poster Most Likely To Say "Good Morning From Philadelphia" Sincerely</Title><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1370861845189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 06:57:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sincerely LOL!

Will IT ever end? You post under everyone else's names. Your middle name is "impostor"!! You say "we" a lot. There is no "we" for you (by your own design). YOU chose your eternal festering loneliness, no one else. No one else. TEAM has exhausted all their resources in trying to get you better!! IT really is up to you. Now, only you cAN crawl your way back to decent living. BUT, we are here to help. Oh yes, TEAM is "at the ready" to help. Please accept this help. I wouldl like you to sit back and reflect on these words which I authored several years ago. "Many people on this board have advised you to quell your fruitless and petty needling of others. Your subscription to said advice would help this forum revert to a more impassioned yet civil atmosphere. An atmosphere where intelligent posters once again feel at ease to discuss meaningful topics. You have driven most of these posters away with your childish, mean-spirited behavior. Gone are the days of brainy discourse." -Sully Rules</Msg><Username>sullys_ebay_board</Username><Timestamp>1370868752799</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 08:52:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370869797026-5</Id><Topic><Title>Poster Most Likely To Say "Good Morning From Philadelphia" Sincerely</Title><Username>angel.madbezos</Username><Timestamp>1370861845189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 06:57:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"get more down with their day" Once again you've proved yourself to be an imposter.

I've come to terms with the 9% seller fees and 3% PayPal fees. But 12 hour delays to sell items has cost eBay hundreds of dollars from me this month alone. I'm selling for 10% less locally on craigslist so I can cycle through my inventory. My items usually sell within 3 hours of being available to see through a search. But eBay will sometimes take 10-15 hours after I list to make it available. I've been a seller for 10 years and they treat me like I'm new at this. I've never had a negative feedback and they tell me it's to protect their buyers. Instead of 5 listings a day they are getting 1 from me every 2 days. I cannot be the only one who feels this way. Why do they not care about their revenue?</Msg><Username>josh.hadden</Username><Timestamp>1370919671049</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
