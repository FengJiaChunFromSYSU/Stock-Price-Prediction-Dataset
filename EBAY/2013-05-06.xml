Ebay customer service is telling those who complain to use other internet sights and they will even recommend alternative sites to the sellers. A powerseller customer service representative told me that ebays only concern is Amazon. That is it. Ebay wants Amazons sellers to switch to ebay, and ebay does not care at all if it loses all of its current sellers as long as it gets Amazons sellers. I sell mostly in the collectibles category. The representative stated that ebay no longer wants to be considered a flea market and does not want used items sold on the site any more. That is why they are trying to force sellers of used items off of ebay. I cant understand how this can be good for profits. Why not keep all of the sellers and get money from everyone. ebay management doesn't care though and just wants to transform ebay into Amazon at all costs.</Msg><Username>doublefeebay</Username><Timestamp>1367844359578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 08:45:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367845103742-2</Id><Topic><Title>N ew ebay fees ridiculous</Title><Username>gunn7r</Username><Timestamp>1367643720563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>":they will loose many others" It's supposed to be LOSE, not LOOSE.
