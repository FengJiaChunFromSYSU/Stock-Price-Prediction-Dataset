Come election day gas prices will be in the $4.50 range (national average for regular unleaded). The republicans lowered the prices dramatically on election days when Bush was running, they also took gas prices to the sewer trying to help Lame John McCain. This time with the contempt in which JUG EARS holds the petroleum industry -- the petroleum industry is going to ram one up JUG EARS' shine behind. There are other tricks the repubs have in store for JUG EARS -- THE INEPT ONE will never know what hit him. ----------------</Msg><Username>agqut</Username><Timestamp>1345713733000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 05:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345714131000-2</Id><Topic><Title>New Report: CEOs Massive Salaries Subsidized By Your Taxes</Title><Username>ebayalphamale</Username><Timestamp>1345576398000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 15:13:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So ANALPHABETICMALE you embrace COMMUNISM, but just the benign parts of communism?????

You don't have to wear it in your teeth and have it keep you up all night and sweating about it all day long, you know. Everyone sees your standard 12 year long game: you obsess on people, make up lies about them, and then obsess over your lies. You believe your own lies. Anything you don't like is just "all one poster". Meanwhile, you and your pals give much away publicly about your sick failed lives and daily misery. It's quite funny actually z50com.
