I do the best I can at clearing the riff-raff from this board. It is only a matter of time before DRIBBLES is no longer posting here. He will be taking his fake sully (i.e. sullyinmass.2012) ids to other Yahoo boards, as he is not welcome on this one. DRIBBLES leads such a pathetic life. He is actually at the point where he thinks (and prays) he is me when he posts with his sullyinmass.2012 id. Sad, very sad indeed.

Yes, when the economy was better, 90% STR was not uncommon when running auctions. Now you know, Like many others, I've been seeing your ridiculous posts here, on eBay discussion boards, AuctionBytes, PSU and other places for over a decade. Never once, have I ever seen you post anything helpful or sincere. You've been kicked off most message boards for starting trouble.

He was not. As soon as John's wife found out what a public mess he made of z50com, she cut him lose the way they both cut lose their daughter and grandchild. I hope that helps.
