And no deal teaming up with Paypal to make a debit card for non-card holders - this is the mother of all treasure hunts. Why not Paypal if it's so great? Credit cards and their companies are supposed to be dead, right? Not according to Walmart.</Msg><Username>skirtt_chaser</Username><Timestamp>1349967276810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:54:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349970914337-3</Id><Topic><Title>And...back down it goes...!</Title><Username>skirtt_chaser</Username><Timestamp>1349808757766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:52:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your foolishness is funny I just used our Paypal Debit card at Walmart last night for a pair of $12 shoes no problem Are you sure you know anything about Paypal, you might try opening an account to enjoy the benefits they can offer online sellers and buyers alike. . .</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1349970914337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:55:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349971305354-4</Id><Topic><Title>Supreme Court to rule....Sold all my shares this morning</Title><Username>tradermkx</Username><Timestamp>1349800211196</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 12:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a nut!

BTW, I've had Paypal since the beginning - even had Billpoint before Paypal absorbed them, which is probably longer than you've used Paypal.</Msg><Username>skirtt_chaser</Username><Timestamp>1349982703024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:11:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349990664082-6</Id><Title>How Old is Your Paypal Account?</Title><Msg>I did a history search and found my first transaction on Paypal to be on 12-17-2000 I never had a billpoint account. . .</Msg><Username>ebay_pays_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1349990664082</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 17:24:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
