He doesn't care if he and his ex-wife's ebay suffers over his public sickness. He's eating dead rat dinners on $190 a month, sleeping in a cardboard box. None of his bro's toss a nickel into his chipped plastic coffee cup. He's too shameless to see his troll life isn't worth living. A fitting sullied troll's fate.

You never had a gram of dignity, self respect, honor and credibility. I'm sure ebay's thrilled to have such a public destroyed joke of a pumper still pumping. It's funny to see your Ripples "life" at 60. You're so stupid you can't see your every public word just buries you further. Is throwing more dirt on you the only way to have peace and quiet? Cool then. ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!
