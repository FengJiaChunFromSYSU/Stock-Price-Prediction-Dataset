I never really had a problem with you. In fact at one time I never had a problem with Fly until I found out he had one of my main ID's deleted. By doing that he thought he put me in my place for whatever reason he had conjured up in his head. Plus, he wanted to control who I (and others) could and could not associate on the board. He looked at the board as "us against them" when all I wanted at one time was to be friendly with *most* everyone. I did not want to "pick a side" like he demanded of all board "members". His motto was "you're either with us or against us".</Msg><Username>midnite.oasis</Username><Timestamp>1372551894158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 20:24:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
