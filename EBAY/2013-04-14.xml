Poor grammar queens are just broke queens, while ebay stock slips a cog. Silence from me never silences them. They are trapped in their sad endless self inflicted negative feedback loop. Works for me! As in: my slaves work for me. How many IDs will fixate on this? ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!

I also have no clue as to why Paypal could not quickly pick up the phone and tell the seller to not ship. And I totally understand why the seller wants to ship....he is protected by eBay and makes money on the sale. So I have no clue buddy as to why the buyer will now have to pay more to cover the cost of fraud because Paypal does not have a money tree....you and me are their money tree. In short, you can suck, pump and support ebay and Paypal but with what I experienced, it is an irresponsive company that can't take calls to receive fraud information after 10:00PM.</Msg><Username>interestinginvesting</Username><Timestamp>1365991124908</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 21:58:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365992916400-6</Id><Title>The 'Chuckle' Is A Poster Who Left In 2005 Still Completely Controls A Few Losers.</Title><Msg>We all see losers here obsess over a long ago poster who proved spamming joke (John Osborne z50com, a daily 247 troll for 12 years) did not have ebay sales paying his bills. The bills did not get paid. He lost his daughter and grand kid, while all his IDs self to self to this day! Such power that Man has over them! All they can do is spin over him endlessly. Publicly obvious. Publicly observed. ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
