At least James has a wife. All you have is your board troll loofah buddies. The real questions here are what ever became of your heroin addicted neglected abused daughter and that little grand baby Dime Bag the authorities will never let you see again. Do you think your Boy Scout record is about to come out in a very public way? Yes soon. ROTFLMAO!!!!!!!!!
