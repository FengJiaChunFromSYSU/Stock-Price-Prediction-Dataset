And they're too stupid to see it. The G@y Sybil Twins have to talk to themselves because no one likes them. They WERE a big help in running John Osborne, ebay's failing z50com and our 12 year long board troll here, out of his onging crime scene at 5008 Hanover Circle Cypress CA 90630 out into the mean streets, but other than that, the G@y Sybil Twins haven't said anything new, or of merit, for 12 long years. It WAS easy to wreck them. Let's pitch in and buy them some ball bearings for their cheap pine caskets so they can spin spin spin for eternity while they rot in hades. Cool beans! Nice short profits today!

Also the way they fritter and fret like little abused school gurls. They lost their board war years ago because they constantly gave themselves away with their own words. Words are powerful. They are locked in the grip of language used by intellignt posters, while their own reveals their failures. Plus, their words are hypocritical because they have 1000s of IDs. Thankfully liars and haters never win, but they are trapped here.
