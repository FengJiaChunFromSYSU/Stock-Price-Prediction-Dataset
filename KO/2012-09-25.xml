CAT comes out and says the global economy still awful, so now industrial names dont look great. Industrial and tech sells off, pulls down the DOW-- people jump on the short side DOW ETF's and everything in the index gets sold off by them. Buying opportunity if you ask me. Plus, hedgies and others are locking in some profits "while the getting is good" to have something worth printing in their quarters to keep their clients happy enough to "stay the course". I would buy some of these names as they come down. Coke and others are still looking at 8-10% CAGR on shareholder's equity and thus their earnings if they keep their ROE and Payout ratio in line with historical averages. Set to reinvest and ride this into retirement. What makes logical sense given a weak global economy (from the stand point of the investor, I mean)? Sell the heavy machinery and high price product tech companies? Or the small daily luxury soda/juice/ cigarette/spice/alcohol companies that keep everyone happy in both euphoric and apocalyptic periods?</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1348603359448</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:02:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348604313192-4</Id><Title>Stem Cell Therapy—Breakthrough in Health Paradigmat Motley Fool(Tue 2:58PM EDT</Title><Msg>Stem Cell Therapy—Breakthrough in Health Paradigmat Motley Fool(Tue 2:58PM EDT</Msg><Username>antiqcoll12</Username><Timestamp>1348604313192</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:18:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
