He'll be treated like the King of Kings there and will be exposed to riches that even he couldn't afford in his wildest dreams. He'll also be worshipped like a demigod by workers who will say that they have him to thank for their jobs and would have starved to death without him. In 2016, his political opponent will repeatedly accuse him of laying down for China and will promise to lay the smack down on them, if elected. Same old dance, different dancer. *yawn*</Msg><Username>nothingsmissing</Username><Timestamp>1350747902552</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:45:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350776182292-2</Id><Title>BECAREFUL OF ROMNESIA!
