However, since 1919 Coca cola has been pumping its product and doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Health nuts can get over the fact that there are people that like drinking coke. Jack n coke, Captain n coke, regular coke... plus everything else coke is used for. Some folk have an agenda to change the world and everyone can live healthy.. I have an agenda too. Its called investing in rock solid companies. KO is rated 5 stars by the S&amp;P 500, Warren Buffett has high regards for the company (as he owns a major stake in it) and a lot of Americans and folk around the world flat out love the product. So don't be fooled when you read other folks bull s**t about how KO is going down because some folk eat rabbit food and soda isn't it. KO is the industry leader when it comes to soft drinks.. always has been , always will be !!! STONG BUY ALL THE TIME !!! KO FOREVER!!!</Msg><Username>oilnboil427</Username><Timestamp>1374247865383</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374252704303-7</Id><Topic><Title>WAFR is looking like it is about to go on a massive run</Title><Username>hortonoliver495</Username><Timestamp>1374247495789</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:24:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WAFR ?? pump n dump ? you wanna make money or lose money ??</Msg><Username>oilnboil427</Username><Timestamp>1374252704303</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 12:51:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374254957007-8</Id><Title>Start your DD on WAFR ASAP</Title><Msg>WAFR plans to recomplete lucrative oil well in the Catrunesti Field</Msg><Username>jonathansherman190</Username><Timestamp>1374254957007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:29:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374283664948-9</Id><Topic><Title>Boycott Coke soda</Title><Username>dahl.messenger</Username><Timestamp>1374174493101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The stores set the prices, clown shoe. The invoice prices that they pay for the product are well above what they sell it for, and they make money by marking up other goods that they hope consumers will buy during their trip. That's why you'll often see minimum purchase amounts listed in order to get the deals (which normally cycle on alternate weeks for Coke, Pepsi, and 7-Up). I think you should end your boycott of common sense before you try boycotting anything else.</Msg><Username>nothingsmissing</Username><Timestamp>1374283664948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
