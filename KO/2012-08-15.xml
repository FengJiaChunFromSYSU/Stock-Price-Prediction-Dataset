For me, it's time to bring it into my brokerage portfolio and finally collect the divs to pay living expenses. That's what it's all about. Accumulation leads to retirement. I started with 12 drips in 1962 and only have 2 left that haven't been brought into my brokerage account. A small part of my 60 holdings. Silly buyers and sellers, always chasing a few bucks. My end game won't depend on some government program or pension, just me. My companies pay me, why would I want to sell them?? Then I would have to pay taxes on capital gains; silly, when all I have to pay taxes on is divs. My heirs won't have to pay anything either, except gains after my date of death. How do you think wealth is built? Not by buying and selling and paying taxes over and over.</Msg><Username>chance_pocketwatch</Username><Timestamp>1345077514000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345078223000-6</Id><Title>Nobody want that sugar water anymo</Title><Msg>It make ya sick. better off with plain ole wawtta.Sell Sell Sell</Msg><Username>SpinalTap58</Username><Timestamp>1345078223000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:50:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345078886000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Nobody want that sugar water anymo</Title><Username>SpinalTap58</Username><Timestamp>1345078223000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KO sells water too.... buy buy buy...</Msg><Username>DrunknDangerous</Username><Timestamp>1345078886000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:01:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345079446000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Nobody want that sugar water anymo</Title><Username>SpinalTap58</Username><Timestamp>1345078223000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea coke water, or try one of these: http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/brands/brandlist.html I never drink coke or eat any fast food, it's just that everybody else does.
