The key dates to be aware of are as follows: The record date, which is currently anticipated to be July 27, 2012, determines which shareowners are entitled to receive one additional share for each share owned as of the record date due to the split. July 27, 2012 is also anticipated to be the effective date of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation that will double the number of shares of authorized common stock. The payment date (or distribution date), which is currently anticipated to be August 10, 2012, is the date shareowners of record are mailed notification of the shares received as a result of the split. The ex-split date, which is currently estimated to be August 13, 2012, is the date the common stock will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "KO" at the new split-adjusted price.</Msg><Username>mycomputersux</Username><Timestamp>1343175085000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 20:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343181651000-4</Id><Topic><Title>split info straight from the horses mouth.</Title><Username>mycomputersux</Username><Timestamp>1343175085000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 20:11:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot to include this very important part: "...beginning as early as two days before the record date (i.e., July 25 th ) through the payment date (i.e., August 10 th ), two separate markets for common stock of The Coca-Cola Company will trade on the NYSE. The "regular way" market, traded under the ticker symbol "KO", will continue to trade at the higher, pre-split price. Shares sold in the market at the "regular way" price will receive full value for the shares sold and the seller is not entitled to the split shares they will receive by virtue of their being holders on the record date. Therefore, the split shares are transferred to the buyers by means of "due bills"."</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343181651000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 22:00:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343182110000-5</Id><Topic><Title>So what is record date of holding to get split?</Title><Username>hold4triple</Username><Timestamp>1342020799000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-11 11:33:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Even if you buy from June 28th to Aug 9th you will still receive twice as many shares on Aug 10th since the stock is splitting 2 for 1." You're right except the date spread is a bit wider than you indicate. Anyone buying from June 25th through August 10th will not be shareholders of record, yet will get the split shares, assuming they hold until August 13th. Also, because all shares bought during the period of July 25th through August 10th will not be shareholders of record, they will not receive their split shares on the 10th, they will receive them on the due bill redemption date, which is a few days later.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343182110000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 22:08:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343182291000-6</Id><Topic><Title>So what is record date of holding to get split?</Title><Username>hold4triple</Username><Timestamp>1342020799000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-11 11:33:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Since the record date is July 27, and the split is like a dividend, wont the stock trade ex-split on the 25th" No. Splits of this size and also large dividends use a deferred ex-date. The company outright tells you in their stock split FAQ on their website that the ex-date is August 13th. "If your trade is settling after the record date, you should be buying the already split shares." No, it doesn't work that way. It's handled through the use of due bills, as the company's FAQ also tells you.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343182291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 22:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343182395000-7</Id><Topic><Title>If I have KO stock that settles on the 27th</Title><Username>thewildwanderer</Username><Timestamp>1343141772000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 10:56:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"will that mean I am the holder and will receive the split shares on 12 Aug?"

No, that's the record date. The split is effective on August 13th.
