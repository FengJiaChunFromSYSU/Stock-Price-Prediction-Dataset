Brock, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and Bill Douglas, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will deliver the remarks. In the presentation, CCE will also discuss current marketplace and operating factors that have dampened second quarter expectations. "Throughout 2012 and so far this year, we have faced challenging operating conditions, including persistent underlying macroeconomic weakness, significant headwinds from poor weather, the prolonged impact of a sharp excise tax increase in France, and a dynamic competitive environment in Great Britain," Mr. Brock said. "To date, some of these factors have been unexpectedly persistent and impacted our current outlook for the second quarter," Mr. Brock said. "Though we expect some of these challenges to abate as we move through the year, we will better understand the full-year impact of these factors as we move deeper into the prime summer selling season. "As a result, we will update you more specifically about our operating outlook for the remainder of the year with our second quarter results in July," Mr. Brock said. "Despite these current challenges, we will continue to manage each lever of our business, drive strong free cash flow, and remain focused on our ultimate objective - driving value for our shareowners."
