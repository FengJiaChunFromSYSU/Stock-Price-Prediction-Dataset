First of all earnings power over time is fairly low risk for Coke so in terms of risk probably not too far from a bond. The earnings yield on Coke based on EPS is close to 5%. However if the stock remains here that yield will grow over time. A 10 year treasury will not. In 10 years the earnings yield on Coke should be over 10%. How good does a 2.5% bond look next to an earnings yield of 5% that is headed over 10% in less than 10 years? So while hard to pick any top or bottom you can sleep well by buying some coke here to get a position and then just add to it if it should pull back thus lowering your cost basis. Take the dividends and reinvest them back into the stock over the decade. You should be handsomely rewarded and crush a 10 year treasury as well. Could you do better if you could predict and nail a short term bottom should it occur? Sure, but nobody can do that. That lies in the realm of luck, not skill</Msg><Username>equityrich</Username><Timestamp>1369962023643</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 21:00:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
