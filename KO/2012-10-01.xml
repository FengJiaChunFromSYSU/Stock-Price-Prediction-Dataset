Fidelity usually gets Divys right on time or posts even earlier.

If you bought $2000 worth of coke at pe-split lets just say at 76 you would have 26 shares with a divy of 0.51 per quarter, which at 76 a share basically gives you $13.26 divy divide that by 76 and you would get 0.17447 shares through reinvestment. However, if you bought $2000 at 38 you would 52 shares with a divy of 0.255, which at 38 a share give you the same divy $13.26 however, with reinvestment you would divide 13.26 by 38 and you would recieve 0.3489 shares. So its simple this is a great time to start a position in coke now rather than wait for it to climb back to the 60-70 level which is inevitable and in the meantime racking up more reinvestment shares at cheaper prices as it rises back up. Just my opinion for anyone considering to start a position in KO. Good luck all.</Msg><Username>bumbleb572</Username><Timestamp>1349100108817</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:01:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349102264242-3</Id><Topic><Title>One good Reason to Start a Long Position now.</Title><Username>bumbleb572</Username><Timestamp>1349100108817</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:01:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've held a position in KO for some time.
