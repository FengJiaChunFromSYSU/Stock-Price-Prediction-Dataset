The SEC isn't going to protect us. The Career Politicans are not going to stop the fraud and manipulation. Mary Jo White? hahahah!! good luck. Corp - America is going to protect you? Last I checked Glaxo Smith Kline had a 5 digit number for each baby they kill in a study at a foriegn location test study. Your going to have to stand up and fight these career politicians who are attacking and manipulating democracy at every turn.

I __________________ pledge the next time DOW is brought down by 50% or more, I shall show up in less then 48 hours at Washington DC wearing a white feather and surround the White House with locked arms with my fellow US Citizens of all races. To correct what should have been corrected almost a century ago. No longer will we the US Citizen allow men who elected by the US Citizen yet at every turn illustrate their allegiance to be for the primary interest of Corp-America, lobbyists and foreign institutions with the interest of the US Citizen as an auxiliary motive to be financial terrorists to this nation. This political regime which describes itself as "Republican and Democrats" we the US Citizen shall help exit in a non-violent yet immediately out of the White House and Congress since our judicial system has been handcuffed and become obsolete to address this nation's needs and the SEC can no longer certainly safeguard the future's of this great nation any longer, if ever. Non- democrat and non-Republican representatives currently serving at the local level will be elevated to newly vacated ranks Last names from A to F will be assigned 18th St. NW Last names from G to K will be assigned H St. NW Last names from L to S will be assigned 14th St. NW Last names from T to Z will assigned at Constitution Ave. NW Thereafter on the 50th hour we shall start to move non-violently but certainly marching to the White House if a formal press conference has not been held announcing the resignation of all current Republican and Democratic regime members. Please copy, paste (message boards) and email this to other US Citizens and ask them to take the pledge, together we can stamp out cancer, energy crisis, disease as well ineptness of the current two tier political regime that continuously fails the US Citizen. Communication will be the next vaccine to cure the US Citizen of the ills that plague us unnecessarily.</Msg><Username>jforuus</Username><Timestamp>1374066340370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 09:05:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374066489943-4</Id><Topic><Title>long term?</Title><Username>gapp01</Username><Timestamp>1374028533499</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:35:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KO is arguably the BEST long term hold in America.

We see PIMCO BIG DADDY SLICK WILLY GROSS on that show but do you ever see those psuedo-journalists ask questions about their funds and why him and his lisping partner haven't been able to capitalize on the 77% premium the collusion bid it upto? Everyone made money on PHK 77% premium at one time except the PHK shareholder! lol Bill Gross is to into his own $15K suits and crossing his legs with that slip smile knowing his talent is 2 steps above BUSH LEAGUE. at BEST but everyone pays those fees to PIMCO. A few other teams like the GABELLI FEE MONGER and the CORNERSTONE PONZI like structure are just as bad. I stopped looking at CEF since they are run so poorly and the managers expect to get paid via fees to lose their clients money! lol Anyways...Carl and Kelly get some journalistic integrity instead of puppets?
