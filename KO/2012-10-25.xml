Would the market for KO stock react on November 7 if the proposition passes? The reason I ask is that Coca-Cola has spent a significant sum opposing the measure along with Pepsi co, Monsanto, Dow Agri etc. etc. Therefore I assume they would view its passage as being negative for earnings.</Msg><Username>twineberg2</Username><Timestamp>1351185186590</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
