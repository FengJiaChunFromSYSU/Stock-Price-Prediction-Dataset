Picking the actual bottom, or close to it really isn't that important unless you are trying to short term trade. KO is one good buy and hold stock, and if you buy it to hold for both price appreciation and the dividends ... a buck or two or even 5 or more is just not that big of a deal. This company, like some other great American companies has an upward trajectory, and the comfort that comes with investing .... and I did say investing not trading, is knowing that your money will grow without you needing to sit and watch the ticker and get nervous over every little hiccup.</Msg><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1346423709420</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:35:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346427751815-5</Id><Topic><Title>when will this consolidation done?</Title><Username>beatyouup</Username><Timestamp>1346283045161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bought some this morning (20%)...hopefully it will go down more next week as people back from summer holidays thinking no qe3 yet...have a large pending order @ 200 ma...hoping target $40 by christmas...i will be a very happy man...</Msg><Username>beatyouup</Username><Timestamp>1346427751815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346430919968-6</Id><Topic><Title>Picking The Bottom</Title><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1346423709420</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have followed that for years with KO. Because I have been so long an investor, I have kind of learned its movement characteristics, seasonal issues, and keeping an eye out for important news. So, it is just kind of automatic for me now. I have a core position and then move in and out as I can see the changing movements. But yeah, I always want to be there for the dividend payment and be at max status to get it all. I feel good and relaxed knowing this one works that way.</Msg><Username>foxeelicious</Username><Timestamp>1346430919968</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 12:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346453596759-7</Id><Topic><Title>when will this consolidation done?</Title><Username>beatyouup</Username><Timestamp>1346283045161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like a good buy this morning. I'll probably pick some up Tuesday morning myself. I look for it to bounce back up to the 38 range next week, but then it will hit resistance, and I don't know about beyond that. I fight for pennies. I never catch a big move. Too chicken to hold I guess.</Msg><Username>davesmith49</Username><Timestamp>1346453596759</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 18:53:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346453597807-8</Id><Topic><Title>when will this consolidation done?</Title><Username>beatyouup</Username><Timestamp>1346283045161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like a good buy this morning.
