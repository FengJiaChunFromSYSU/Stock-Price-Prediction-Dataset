AWESOME ROMNEY WOULD NOT TAX CAPITAL GAINS AND INVESTMENT INCOME</Title><Msg>Romney in the last debate revealed he would eliminate tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains. What a tax savings for investors. Romneyâ€™s plan would let households earning less than $200,000 a year collect capital gains, dividends and interest tax-free. That would encourage more Americans to build cash nest eggs and to own stocks and bonds above and beyond their retirement plans.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350576937370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350589740250-3</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!

Never in the history by the middle of October with an challenger with a plus 50 which Romney now actually leads by seven points has the incumbent won. Guess the Prez will enjoy alot of rounds of golf in Hawaii though and who knows what ghost writer will pen his autobiography. Dinesh DeSousa perhaps?
