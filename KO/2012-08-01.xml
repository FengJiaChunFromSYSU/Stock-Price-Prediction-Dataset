Coca-Cola is a great company but not a good buy at these prices with a major bear market on the horizon. Price target 50 to 55 in the next 18 months. This is great time to short stocks with earnings about to plunge and a epic bear market to ravage the bulls.</Msg><Username>jca433</Username><Timestamp>1343836530000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 11:55:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343853068000-2</Id><Title>I dont know about shorting KO, but</Title><Msg>Its definitely a crowded trade. WHEN it comes down, it will come down hard just due to the fact that everyone and their brother is sitting in it and there are no shorts to catch it. Good luck.</Msg><Username>nofoodinbeard</Username><Timestamp>1343853068000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343853603000-3</Id><Title>My bad.
