The ruling came as part of a motion by the conservative legal watch dog group Judicial Watch, who had sued the DOJ in federal court to enforce a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for documents pertaining to the New Black Panthers case. Judicial Watch had secured many previously unavailable documents through their suit against DOJ and were now suing for attorneys’ fees. The Obama DOJ dropped charges in the case involving armed Black Panthers who blocked Caucasian voters from entering polling places in Philadelphia during the 2008 Presidential Election. http://washingtonexaminer.com/federal-court-finds-obama-appointees-interfered-with-new-black-panther-prosecution/article/2503500 Where is the mainstream media's coverage on this? Also conveniently ignored by Yahoo "news".</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1343729794000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:16:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343740895000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama DOJ loses in fed court over Black Panther case</Title><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1343729794000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:16:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QWAK,Obama was made POTUS by TPTB so he and his party could be the "BAG HOLDERS" as the ilusion of unlimited welth in the USA is exposed as a FRAUD! :( Paper and digital curency are NOT MONEY -- only real physical GOLD and SILVER are actualy MONENY and and that is about to become OBVIOUS to every one with an IQ over 70!:( I tried to warn every one here on the KO board for years but NONE here would listen SOoooooooooooo as your percieved welth EVAPORATES try to remember --- YOU were worned in time so you would not have to learn the HARD WAY about real POVERTY! :( Sorry I could not have helped more! :( the DUCK</Msg><Username>uglyduck555</Username><Timestamp>1343740895000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343745070000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Coke a Total Trash Product ?

Dividend for October and December will be 25.5 cents per share. The current dividend is .51 cents per share. Divide .51 x 2 = 25.5. Been down this road before. Stock prices usually increase after a split. Splits indicate company strength.</Msg><Username>rosmith3704</Username><Timestamp>1343753654000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:54:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343773973000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Are Sodas like Tabacco</Title><Username>soylaberga</Username><Timestamp>1343709312000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 00:35:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry, I didn't notice the article, only 750 pics of almost-nude celebrities.

July 27, 2012 is also the effective date of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation that will double the number of shares of authorized common stock. •The payment date (or distribution date), which is August 10, 2012, is the date shareowners of record are mailed notification of the shares received as a result of the split. •The ex-split date, which is August 13, 2012, is the date the common stock will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "KO" at the new split-adjusted price. so If I buy after the 27th and before august 13 will I not get split shares?</Msg><Username>Sobekk</Username><Timestamp>1343776076000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 19:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343776650000-8</Id><Title>Nice run and break out</Title><Msg>As I was figuring, the run in recent weeks hit that break out level, so with a little rest and small dip pullback, this great solid company could work up to $83 and keep looking good for the rest of the year.

If you hold until the ex-date of August 13th, you will get the split shares. Anyone who sells before August 13th, no matter if they were a shareholder of record or not, will also be selling their right to the split shares.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343780325000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 20:18:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
