Plus company has posted good news over past few weeks. Seems to be Coke should be in the $42 to $45 range right now versus $37 and change. Going to hold since I think Europe new tomorrow and Fed news next week will push markets and Coke way higher. Just don't understand pull back after split.

The hype surrounding a split drives up the stock price prior to the split. KO was st it's all time high prior to the split. The price/earnings ratio is high relative to the average S&amp;P average of around 15 with a forward of around 18.</Msg><Username>todlondon</Username><Timestamp>1346857625444</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346861962663-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: We All Need to Just Be "Patient"</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1346785425189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 15:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If OweBama is reelected we will all be patients of the local mental health facitity.</Msg><Username>crazyhorse1786</Username><Timestamp>1346861962663</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:19:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346867310160-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why has KO dropped since split?</Title><Username>truthbtoldhonest</Username><Timestamp>1346857011946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:56:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In august it dropped mainly due to corn futures rising.
