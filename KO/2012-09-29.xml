Also, I wouldnt call soda a luxury, I mean, if by not really needing soda, you mean luxury, well I guess it could be seen that way, but through my observations over the last 35 yrs or more, it is a staple. Last, with the likes of KO or PEP or PG or KMB, etc, those companies you can buy at any price really and stick them in your IRA or whatever and come out very well in the end.
