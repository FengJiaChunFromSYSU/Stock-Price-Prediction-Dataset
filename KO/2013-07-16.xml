It was the cool and raining weather that hurt. It was a cop-out to me! How does cool and raining weather hurt the sales of coke's product? People weren't able to get to the store, really? ALL people need to buy food at the grocery store or convenience store on a daily or weekly basis, so how does weather effect there business? I was shocked at excuse, does he think investors or anyone are that stupid? To me, the big problem is management is having a hard time executing. Don't blame the weather, blame yourselves (upper mgmt). If I was an shareholder, I would complain.

Coca-Cola Leading Brands Inc. (LBIX) - Beverage Buyout Talks make sense. The whirlwind of recent beverage buyouts may continue with net income on the rise at Leading Brands. It's important to note that Leading Brands is a relatively safe investment and over the relatively short term should rise to over $10 a share. Buying sooner than later makes perfect sense. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have bought out smaller beverage companies in the past. With health scares sparking a number of investigations at the state and federal level into the energy drink's role in several fatalities in the beverage industry expansion into healthier beverages makes perfect sense. Private-equity firms backing healthy beverage brands are pushing the spurt of strategic buyers. They point to the needs for new brands with a healthy appeal. "They're all trying to rejigger their product portfolios to more healthy products," said Mike Chase, a managing director at Health Business Partners, a boutique investment bank in Warwick, R.I. Acquiring a small company that can be plugged into a larger distribution pipeline is a better bet than developing a brand from scratch. "Pepsi and Coke don't make acquisitions of these beverage companies because they can," said Scott Van Winkle, a managing director at investment bank Canaccord Adams Inc. "They see the need." That can pay off handsomely for buyout firms, as large drink companies can pay high multiples for smaller drink brands since sales will likely spike after the acquisition once the brand is plugged into a larger distribution network. Look for LBIX Shares to be one of the best performing stocks for the remainder of 2013/2014.</Msg><Username>savvyblood</Username><Timestamp>1373984566256</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:22:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373985286127-18</Id><Title>Go to your local store</Title><Msg>and look at all the options you have to chose from just like beer those days are over where KO had the market to them self !!!!

The Coca-Cola Company (KO) announced its financial results for second quarter, reporting earnings in-line with expectations, though CEO Muhtar Kent remarked that the results came in below the company’s expectations as a result of a challenging macroeconomic environment and adverse weather conditions. Operations in the Philippines were adversely affected with the deconsolidation of its bottling operations, which the company partially attributes to its overall performance. Coke reported net income of $2.68B, or $0.59 earnings per share, a decrease from the same quarter last year of $2.79B and $0.61 earnings per share. Revenue of $12.75B was a 3% decrease from last year this quarter. The company continues to increase its market share in the North America market while it makes strides to improve its performance overseas, particularly in Europe and China.</Msg><Username>adspatz</Username><Timestamp>1373987929373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373988241837-23</Id><Title>Dear Carl and Kelly at CNBC...ref.

June was an unseasonably cool month and dramatically so. I have to ask, do either of you drink hot chocolate in 100 degree weather? Or would you select a coke? How about an ice cold frosty coke while you're out ice skating? Each one of these little decisions by each consumer adds up to MILLIONS of consumers making said decision. Fewer outdoor BBQs, etc. in June...and no, I'm not talking about planned events being cancelled, rather,. all the other individual consumers and their Families who elected to well, not BBQ today during JUNE! Why does gas consumption typcially rise during the summer months? More people travelling! Airline traffic during those graduation months? More people travelling! Coke sales at stadiums during summer months? Because baseball at every level is in season. I'll bet those same coke sales go down when a game is rained out! What do you two think? LMAO! Come on you two! No one expects you to know everything but, consumption of BEVERAGES is affected by weather the only question is, to what scale. JUNE was the collest June I think I have ever lived through and I have been around alot longer than either of you. But hey, maybe you are correct, people might have been falling all over themselves to go buy and drink coke but there were fewer of them!? LMAO! RRRRRiiiiigggghhhhhhtttttttt!

Coca Cola is gotten huge. Not everyone is going to drink 2 cans of coke a day. There is limited growth potential. Law of large numbers is acting against them. Mutual funds and Warren Buffet are happy with the 3% dividend. 3% can be a lot when you have hundreds of millions invested.

But soon, most all companies were benefiting from emerging markets. But the colas either have massive sugar in them or preservatives that require warning labels. The reason they do this is so the product can be shipped and stored without refrigeration. And the teas taste awful and taste like instant tea. The water is not spring water but purified tap water. Also, worry that carbonated beverages increase prostrate problems. WB recently asked the CEO to study failure. In other words, consider changing with the times instead of getting out of step with the times.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1374027372043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374028173151-68</Id><Topic><Title>time for Warren Buffett to buy the rest of COKE</Title><Username>vito_grandinetti_xlt</Username><Timestamp>1374008953249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:09:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Berkshire owns 9%, not 25%.</Msg><Username>rhino_hunter</Username><Timestamp>1374028173151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:29:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374028533499-69</Id><Title>long term?</Title><Msg>Is anyone still holding for long term?
