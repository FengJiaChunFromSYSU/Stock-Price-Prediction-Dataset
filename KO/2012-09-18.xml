Those on fixed income will get hurt. Romney has a plan. He will reduce federal spending and we will all get hurt temporarily. Regan did this in the '80s dropping the economy for brighter days ahead. This is a historic election. To my mind, either way we are done as a country. Meet you on the barricaids.</Msg><Username>crazyhorse1786</Username><Timestamp>1348008653549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 18:50:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
