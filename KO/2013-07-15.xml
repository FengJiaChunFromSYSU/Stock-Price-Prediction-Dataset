The company employs 50,000 local-Chinese employees. Coca-Cola plans to almost double its investment by investing an additional $4 billion into China by 2014. This money will be used to add more plants and increase its retail distribution arm. Ahmet Bozer, President of Coca-Cola International, said: "We want to make China our largest beverage market soon." Coca-Cola's goal is to expand its market share. Last year, the company only had 16.6% of the soft-drink market with its Coke, Sprite and Fanta brands. Rival PepsiCo only had a 5.1% share of the market. In terms of carbonated beverages, Coca-Cola has a bigger share of the total market with 55%. PepsiCo has 32% of this market."</Msg><Username>commishfree1</Username><Timestamp>1373904010929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:00:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373906582866-2</Id><Title>IN COLOMBIA KO IS EVERYWHERE</Title><Msg>I dont see pepsi at all in the resturants or the stores except for their snacks .
