The new competitor for KO. A competitor like they have never faced. I would buy it just to hedge your bet. KO is actually looking pretty top heavy right now. Giants do fall. Especially when an old company is reinvented and takes out the microsofts hewlet packers of the world. Meet the giant killer. Meet the company about to cut KO's achilles tendon.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Many people who buy them will use them once and will have them out at their next yard sale. No stocks go straight up, KO is no different. KO will be around long after the soda stream fad is over and it assumes its place next to the pet rock.</Msg><Username>jananjim</Username><Timestamp>1356579417032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:36:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356581382009-5</Id><Title>George H.
