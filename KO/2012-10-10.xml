Attitude Drinks, has recently announced record orders and expanded distribution of their recently launched Phase III Energy Recovery drink and brand, and has made tremendous progress as of late, by increasing that distribution to the likes of Walgreen's in Florida and Sam's Mart Stores in the Carolinas and Georgia. ATTD is expected to pull in tens of Millions. Analyst suggests ATTD is ready for a MASSIVE BREAKOUT. This Stock price has the potential to 5cents to 20cents. And buying the stock for nothing at 0.0009 will bring unbelievable profit. Buying 1 million shares@ 0.0009, cost= $900. Sell 1 million shares@ 1 cent = $10,000 or 5 cents= $50,000 With 2200% gains, ATTD can turn around your losses and bring your trading account back positive.</Msg><Username>agreenview</Username><Timestamp>1349883746790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:42:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349918404826-4</Id><Title>VALE AONE on watch alerts - ko pcfg aumy</Title><Msg>,,</Msg><Username>girlsnightowls</Username><Timestamp>1349918404826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 21:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
