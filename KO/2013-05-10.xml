Most calories in the form of carbohydrates come from drinks, I think Mayor Bloomberg might know something about this also. HFCS is a synthetic toxin and is getting Americans sick. Look around you at everyone's weight and bulging abdomen, read about "VISCERAL FAT" in the abdomen or better yet, go to your doctor and let them explain it to you before you get coronary heart disease, diabetes or cancer. Your at 5 times the risk of heart disease with a 40 inch abdomen.</Msg><Username>rmorgan725</Username><Timestamp>1368183431472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 06:57:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368191836352-2</Id><Topic><Title>HFCS is poison, do not drink this garbage!!!</Title><Username>rmorgan725</Username><Timestamp>1366937787182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 20:56:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone ever tell you that you're batsh^t crazy?</Msg><Username>commodityhq</Username><Timestamp>1368191836352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 09:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368195454440-3</Id><Title>LOAD UP ON MARGIN!!!</Title><Msg>TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!!!</Msg><Username>marketeer1001</Username><Timestamp>1368195454440</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368230268486-4</Id><Topic><Title>HFCS is poison, do not drink this garbage!!!</Title><Username>rmorgan725</Username><Timestamp>1366937787182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 20:56:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like I gave you too much credit. You truly are clueless. If you actually did any research, you would have already known that what I posted was true.
