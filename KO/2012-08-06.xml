I work in the health care sector, Director of Nursing, where I see on a daily basis the over consumption of sugars. But, we also know that so many Americans just are not going to give up their sugars and carbs, so that is why in medicine the hard work is to deal with the consequences and figure out new medications and preventive programs. As for KO, this is really nothing new and the whole company has diversified to offer all kinds of alternatives for better health. It is just still a company that is well run and grows.</Msg><Username>foxeelicious</Username><Timestamp>1344270230000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 12:23:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344271006000-4</Id><Title>SODA +++++ The perfect</Title><Msg>short squeeze set-up!!!

August 10th is the last day to buy and qualify for the split shares. "is the price at end of that date [July 27] the split price" No. On July 27th it closed at 80.01. On July 30th it closed at 81.12. Does that look like a two for one split? "or is it the close of the 10th" Sort of, but not the closing price. After the close on the 10th the shares will split and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at the open on the 13th.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1344303246000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 21:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344306716000-12</Id><Topic><Title>P/E: 21.42 keep buying...lol</Title><Username>sushibn</Username><Timestamp>1344004466000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:34:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The correct answer is, keep holding. How many times have I thought about selling this since I bought it in '84?? Too many! Sure, take some profit off the table and get back in at a lower price, blah, blah, blah. But it kept on splitting and paying dividends, so I've been rewarded for holding a piece of the world's addiction to sugar water. If I've got the cash on hand when it dips, I've added to my position, but sell? Why?? Maybe when I hit 90 and I need to pay a hot young nurse to wipe me........</Msg><Username>chance_pocketwatch</Username><Timestamp>1344306716000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 22:31:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
