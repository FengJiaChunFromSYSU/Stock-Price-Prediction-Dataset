I also hold F and would love if some people's predictions of 30 for it at the end of the year were true. Same with FCX at 45 and GE at 30. Point is, it is nice to dream, but realistically it likely won't happen.</Msg><Username>juanruiz1330</Username><Timestamp>1371615583559</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371643588924-2</Id><Title>Credit Suisse initiates coverage on Coca-Cola (KO) with an Outperform rating.</Title><Msg>Wednesday, June 19, 7:00 AM ET Credit Suisse initiates coverage on Coca-Cola (KO) with an Outperform rating.</Msg><Username>hawgputter</Username><Timestamp>1371643588924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 08:06:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371651467559-3</Id><Title>Do some DD on PSID.

KO had a really nice little pop all day till, boom. All beverage companies did. People don't stop drinking Coke when the gov stops buying. And when the economy is bad there is nothing like a Coke to hold the booze. I know the market is nuts but come on. On the short term tech KO is coming out of a healthy MACD dip with other indicators suggesting a buy opportunity. If it ended unchanged, oh well it followed the market. But -.52 ??? Just Nuts.</Msg><Username>buylow101a</Username><Timestamp>1371683665850</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 19:14:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
