First of all that article is written my idiots. Who ever thinks that coca cola is a penny stock....please so slap yourself in the face, oh be sure to do it in front of the mirror, this way you feel the pain AND see it!! Do you realize what has been going on time and sales?? Big guys with deep pockets are buying and buying large! These fools think they can dump a stock. To manipulate a company like this you need a few hundred million, anyone posting on this site does not have that sort of cash. If they did, they would be non-existent in this mere mortal world. Please stop with the nonsense! here is a tip, buy if you can otherwise stay out...unless you have no problem losing your shirt, pants and underwear!</Msg><Username>broil.king</Username><Timestamp>1346352731000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346353195606-11</Id><Topic><Title>i out ko going to 15 a share selllll</Title><Username>ymkhail</Username><Timestamp>1345764379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL Not without a split.</Msg><Username>verioinc</Username><Timestamp>1346353195606</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:59:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346354165468-12</Id><Topic><Title>i out ko going to 15 a share selllll</Title><Username>ymkhail</Username><Timestamp>1345764379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Own them both!

If the market looks stable tomorrow might be a good time to buy. I don't think it falls all the way to the 200 day MA unless the broader market corrects with it. Put in a limit order as low as you dare and it will likely bounce if it fills.</Msg><Username>davesmith49</Username><Timestamp>1346365561500</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 18:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
