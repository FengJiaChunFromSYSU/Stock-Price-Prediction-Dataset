No response from the knuckle dragging crowd means they ran out of race baiting insults. I'm sure they are checking talk radio and the internet for further instructions. WOW, none in the US, that says a lot. And why do you mention plenty in Africa?? And since you're telling, can you name some of the "plenty" in Africa - should be easy since you know that there are "plenty". And please elaborate on Philly being in financial ruins (from what I read the owner - J Bruce Llewellyn was ill and up in age and had no kids in the business and this is why he sold it and he died a few years later, which would make this explaination beleivable). Or did you make this statement about Philly to imply that African Americans cannot own these bottlers and run them well? (nice Fox News fun house mirror trick). I guess you will now tell me that all of the white owned bottlers are run extremely well with now history of problems.</Msg><Username>kofrankwhite</Username><Timestamp>1344096203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:03:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344105446000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Will eventually be a problem for KO</Title><Username>johnberchick</Username><Timestamp>1341280697000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-02 21:58:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a fade like yo yos.

I don't...White, black, or purple; I own both MCD &amp; KO and want to see the most qualified person in the job. If that is a black person or a white person for 50 years straight then so be it.
