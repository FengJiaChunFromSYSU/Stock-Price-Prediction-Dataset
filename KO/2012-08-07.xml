There are no additional shares. One share splits into two; nothing more. Further, any shareholder of record who sells their shares before the ex-date of August 13th also sells their rights to the split. In cases where the ex-date is after the record &amp; payment dates, the only relevance of the record date is to state that only shares outstanding as of that date participate in the split. It's very different from a normal distribution but those are the stock exchange rules every company has to follow. "i realize if I buy before Aug 10th i'll receive split, but, do not qualify for additionsl shares." Only because there are no additional shares. Anyone who was a shareholder of record on July 27th with the same number of shares as you and holds through the 10th will still have the same number of shares as you after the split. Where did you get the idea there will be additional shares beyond the split?</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1344356358000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 12:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344357189000-9</Id><Topic><Title>P/E: 21.42 keep buying...lol</Title><Username>sushibn</Username><Timestamp>1344004466000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:34:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great company, but lets face it, KO is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.
