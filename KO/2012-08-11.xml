Alot of institutions were selling since they own plenty and made a very good return. Now if the other DOW stocks that have been going up nicely would also announce a similar stock split it would really make my day next week. Don't expect it but you never know now do you? Congrats to all longs who stayed patiently and got an nice bonus! Rewards go to those who know how this all works!</Msg><Username>siserv2001</Username><Timestamp>1344659987000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 00:39:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344686501000-2</Id><Topic><Title>So Monday</Title><Username>snowshovel70</Username><Timestamp>1344645112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:31:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>after hours trade dose not count.monday you will see $39.895 as the price per share, and will stay there till market opens. as a rule the pps drops when a stock splits, but in this case the pps should pop to $45+ then run up another $5 in the comming weeks.IMO</Msg><Username>pig.porky57</Username><Timestamp>1344686501000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 08:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344689426000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Quit Asking these Stupid Questions about the Split</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1344376745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:59:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup.

Do you honestly think that KO shares will have two prices quoted??? $40.00 a share for those smart enough to buy KO in time to participate in the split. And $80.00 a share for those idiots who did not pay attention to the complex fine print pertaining to the split??? Through market mechanisms EVERYONE who owns KO shares prior to the actual slit date gets 2:1 shares!!!! You guys should spend all this time getting split beavers instead of this non-sense!!!!!</Msg><Username>the_planters_guy</Username><Timestamp>1344706964000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344737715000-6</Id><Topic><Title>So Monday</Title><Username>snowshovel70</Username><Timestamp>1344645112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:31:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney, though.
