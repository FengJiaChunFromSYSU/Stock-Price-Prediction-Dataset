Read the 7th paragraph down. It reveals the growth of the Relaxation drink market. If KO doesn't grab BEBIDA, which is the leader in that drink category, Pepsi will. We need to get into the relaxation drink market, and as shareholders of KO, we should push for accretive acquisitions in growing markets. Wake up KO!</Msg><Username>newlifehealthandfitness</Username><Timestamp>1372439819970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 13:16:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372450690952-2</Id><Title>KO to buy GMCR</Title><Msg>What a perfect acquisition</Msg><Username>melvinprit</Username><Timestamp>1372450690952</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
