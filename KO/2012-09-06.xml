Will Stevia First Corp (STVF) be the provider?</Title><Msg>There's a new article that came about stevia in coke products and the author focuses on a new developmental stevia- producing entity called Stevia First corp (STVF). I definitely see the new need and demand that will arise for the product as a sweetener when KO and pepsi, and starbucks is starting to utilize it. Here's a section from the seeking alpha article: What is surprising is that Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Monster all have products on the market that are sweetened with stevia. Coca-Cola, the Atlanta based beverage giant, and Cargill filed 24 US patents relating to stevia; and in 2008, the FDA approved Truvia, a Reb A sweetener developed jointly by the two companies. Coca-Cola has added Truvia to over 30 products around the world, including Diet Coke in Japan, and Sprite and Nestea beverages in France. Cargill markets Truvia to consumers in sugar packs and is now the number 2 sweetener behind Splenda. PepsiCo developed a competing stevia based product, PureVia, jointly with The Whole Earth Sweetener Company. PureVia can be found in Sobe Lifewater and Trop50, Tropicana's fruit juice beverages. Monster sweetens their Hansen's diet sodas with stevia. If Starbucks Refreshers become a hit, it would only make sense for the other beverage companies to rush in and add stevia to their diet energy drink line.</Msg><Username>tradnfrank</Username><Timestamp>1346948731658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 12:25:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346984195606-2</Id><Topic><Title>SunTrust to sell $1.2 bln worth of Coca-Cola shrs</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1346976375611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:06:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Strong sell?
