If you are addicted to High Fructose corn syrup and 10x much salt then folks will stick with Coke. My point is that Soda is expanding rapidly and getting the hard core soda drinkers. Coke has a problem and will only get worse with time. KO is dead money or you will loose money. Not easy to expand when you are loosing your at home customers at such a rapid clip. I also think that MNST and Red bull have a problem since the soda energy drink is pennies on the dollar in terms of cost.</Msg><Username>tejdem1</Username><Timestamp>1357241993268</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:39:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
