Many are too dumb to realize that being overweight will shorten their lives, increase health problems and, cause the rest of us to pay more for health insurance. Gov. has te tell people to wear seat belts, quit smoking, wear bicycle helmets, put toddlers in protective car seats, cut down on calories in school lunches, require kids to take Physical Education, not to drive under the influence of alcohol, not use addictive drugs, use safe practices in the work place such as wearing safety glasses, and proper masks. Unfortunately many motorcycle rides, because it is not the law are still to dumb to wear helmets. Oh yes, snowmobilers must wear helmets.</Msg><Username>northvisitor34</Username><Timestamp>1363536530547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 12:08:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
