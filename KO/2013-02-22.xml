ORLA NDO, Fla. (AP) -- D arden Restau rants, stru ggling to draw more c ustomers into its Olive Garden and Red Lobster res taurants, predicted a third-quarter p rofit Friday that was b elow Wall Street's exp ectations and cut its outlook for the year. The Orla ndo, Fla.-based chain has tried to revamp menus and ma rketing for its flagship chains. But revenue at Olive Ga rden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakh ouse locations open at least one year is ex pected to fall 4.5 percent in the quarter ending Feb. . Dar den isn't the only comp any saying the higher payroll tax has cut into its business.

It took a majority share of the company in 2010, although its founders retained operational control up until now. Coke’s stake after the latest investment is above 90%, and the founders will step back from day-to-day management and join the company’s executive committee. Innocent’s smoothies have been a big hit in the UK and Europe, as food and drink companies like Coca Cola are paying more attention to the market for healthy processed food. Coca Cola owns a similar line of products in the U.S., Odwalla. Growing pressure in Washington for a regulatory answer to America’s obesity crisis adds a political incentive for big food players to boost their healthy lines. Innocent likes to let its customers know it donates 10% of profits to charity, uses only sustainably farmed ingredients, and so on. Its packaging also invites customers to drop in to its offices for a “chat” if they want to know more, including the company’s office address and a phone number. The company joins a noble list of small businesses that built their brands as alternatives to the big, sterile corporate behemoths they were competing with, only to end up as units of those behemoths once the numbers made sense for an acquisition. Ben &amp; Jerry’s has long been a unit of food giant Unilever ULVR.LN +0.54%, and the Body Shop is part of L'Oreal OR.FR +2.60%. Has selling out to Coca Cola been worth it? Absolutely, said Innocent’s co-founder Richard Reed in a statement announcing the latest deal. “They have been hugely supportive of our mission of getting natural, healthy foods to more people and have been 100% committed to protecting our brand and the values it stands for.” --- Has any boy tried the Odwalla brands</Msg><Username>unclelarry66</Username><Timestamp>1361563699443</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 15:08:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361563773931-13</Id><Topic><Title>KO buys more Innocent stake and Odwalla</Title><Username>unclelarry66</Username><Timestamp>1361563699443</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 15:08:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is from the Wall Street Journal for today</Msg><Username>unclelarry66</Username><Timestamp>1361563773931</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 15:09:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361564102437-14</Id><Topic><Title>Coke= 100% Poison</Title><Username>wakeupamerica87</Username><Timestamp>1361504275902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 22:37:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let that be a lesson, don't soak your eggs in Coke.
