If they expanded margins enough they could pull that off. If margins were flat to down, something could be amiss. Today's pop had to be part of people looking to buy things are not levered to China, but spread out among global consumers. I have no other idea why they would be up this much since they technically missed on the quarter because those headline excluded numbers are actually numbers that hit the bottom line, and their numbers are down from 1 year ago. They cam in soft on both counts. Sector rotation? Not sure what else to make of this.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1366129061270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366130337012-13</Id><Topic><Title>Why is the market up today?

It is connected...The United States has a terrorist attack and no suspects and you say it is not connected to the market!!!!!??? Will this cause another war? Increased security? Could this be a group of terrorist or one person... Domestic or abroad... the President says it was a Terrorist attack on our country and you relate that to a Big Mac? A less safe America affects the Market much more than Netflix subscriptions. Do you think the few stocks you buy or consumers buy are a big deal in the larger picture? No way, there is a way bigger financial world out there and it is lead by Interest rates, bonds, swaps and credt lines... all this is greatly affected by a terrorist attack. Trust me behind the scenes it is connected and a big deal. But consumers are always the last to know. Is this the normal now? Are 170 people injured or dead no big deal anymore? Are we used to this now? I worry it is like we are walking zombies. Is your money safe? Is our country safe? Are you safe? Two days ago 170 people involved in a maraton thought they were and look at what happened.</Msg><Username>legionfullmetal7</Username><Timestamp>1366130337012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:38:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366132160918-14</Id><Topic><Title>miss on revenue and beat earnings = accounting fraud</Title><Username>keepshorting</Username><Timestamp>1366124657595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 11:04:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someone did the due diligence and has new information.</Msg><Username>northvisitor34</Username><Timestamp>1366132160918</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:09:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366132546571-15</Id><Title>more good news...Afghanistan's opium production up 3 fold in the past year</Title><Msg>fighting for values...it's all good!</Msg><Username>nogwabd</Username><Timestamp>1366132546571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:15:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366134862512-16</Id><Title>Taking a little money off!</Title><Msg>KO: Take some money off the table!

To answer your question about whether I feel safe...I am in Spain, serving in the Navy, doing my best every day to make sure you're safe. Recommend you have a drink, relax a little, and realize that bad things happen every day, some days are certainly worse than others...but the machine keeps going...and I go to work every day to make sure the conditions are as optimal as possible for the machine to continue. Best of luck to you in your investments good Sir. Best thing you can do is cut back on Fox News and divisive talk radio, ratchet down the paranoia, and focus on the things you can control.

All of these factors seem to drive the stock price more than the earnings for one quarter. Plus two less selling dates than last year. Margins did increase. Worldwide case volume also was up vs last quarter. Earnings and sales beat analyst estimates for this quarter. The faster than expected granting of new expanded U.S. territories to five of its bottling companies did not hurt.</Msg><Username>pastagigi</Username><Timestamp>1366144839850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366148829160-22</Id><Topic><Title>miss on revenue and beat earnings = accounting fraud</Title><Username>keepshorting</Username><Timestamp>1366124657595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 11:04:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True, bottling was a factor. My only other guess is that there was a lot of pessimism for the sales of non-carbonated to outweigh drops in soda in the US and elsewhere where people are being more concerned about health effects of soda. Their numbers for tea and orange juice showed resiliency of the product line-up and willingness of customers to stick with Coke products while shifting product categories. Sigh of relief and optimism that Coke can actually survive in a declining soda consumption West.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1366148829160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 17:47:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366152407682-23</Id><Topic><Title>Buffett could get coke to get rid of flame retardant, if he wanted to.</Title><Username>gitreelonce</Username><Timestamp>1366139107311</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:05:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not if you don't let them drink Coke.
