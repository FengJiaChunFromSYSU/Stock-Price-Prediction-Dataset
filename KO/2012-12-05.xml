Within the last three months, SodaStream has been exchanging phone calls and e-mails with soda executives who are trying to learn more about its operations, said one source, who declined to name the executives. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo also declined to comment. SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum said he could not comment on what discussions he might be having. However, he predicted that the major soda manufacturers would eventually offer home machines also, saying, “Coke and PepsiCo will follow us.”</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

And I think Birnbaum is the one going after it, as well he should. Huge victory for him if he could offer syrup for the greatest soft drink on the planet, Coca-Cola.</Msg><Username>nothingsmissing</Username><Timestamp>1354758554764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:49:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
