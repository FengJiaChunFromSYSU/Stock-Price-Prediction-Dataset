If I buy just after the stock split for $40 and then can sell to someone that is not paying attention to the stop split for $80, then I make a fortune. Is there a way to put in these pre and post split order with my brokerage. I could use a 100% gain in a day. Also, if I don't sell before the split does it mean I own less of the company? Does a company do a stock split to dilute the existing shares and then give more money to the employees. That sucks.</Msg><Username>gold42004</Username><Timestamp>1344788093000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:14:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344789523000-8</Id><Title>A Real Stock Split</Title><Msg>Here is what Happens - - Early tomorrow morning when the brokerage employees get to work (an HOUR early) they take each share of stock and cut it in half - VIOLA this is a true stock split.. they then place both pices of each share you own back in the box and you have a stock split....</Msg><Username>usnavvet61</Username><Timestamp>1344789523000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344793824000-9</Id><Topic><Title>So Monday</Title><Username>snowshovel70</Username><Timestamp>1344645112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:31:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama failed miserably. anyone is better, i'd vote for a mop and bucket named jorge before obama.</Msg><Username>kartman9</Username><Timestamp>1344793824000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344794009000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Bought 750 shares at $80.50</Title><Username>wendyvtao</Username><Timestamp>1344526355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:32:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your fine wendy. i added another 150 shares around 78.80 myself. when your long term buying it honestly doesn't matter.</Msg><Username>kartman9</Username><Timestamp>1344794009000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:53:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344809077000-11</Id><Topic><Title>A Real Stock Split</Title><Username>usnavvet61</Username><Timestamp>1344789523000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:38:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You think they might come in 2 hours early for a 3:1 split or would their manager make them work overtime?
