If Buffet wants more, I think he will get it a lot cheaper. They are sitting under a ton of debt 35 billion, with Debt/equity =107. I think the chicken will be coming home to roost on this. I wish you guys hadn't chased cancanue off this board. He really understood the complex relationship between KO,COKE andCCE. COKE has deb/equity =527 CCE has debt/equity = 147 Sure looks like a bubble to me. Can someone explain why KO is a value stock?</Msg><Username>sg.cleveland</Username><Timestamp>1371965772403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 01:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372009294756-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why is KO taking such a big hit?</Title><Username>buylow101a</Username><Timestamp>1371763395823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 17:23:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody chased him off this board. What are we supposed to do when he spouts one phony prediction after another?
