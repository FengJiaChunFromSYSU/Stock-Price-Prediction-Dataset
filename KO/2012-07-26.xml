Furthermore, I just got off the phone with Fidelity and this is what they told me. After the date of record (7/27,) the stock continues to trade at the market rate (which is currently $78.) The payout date (when the stock splits 2-for-1) is in August. It is in August, after the payout date, the price per share is cut in half. As presviously indicated, that info. is from Fidelity; they are a HUGE brokerage firm, based in Boston, MA.</Msg><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1343321585000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 12:53:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343322871000-5</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes the split will take place aug 10th if you buy after the 27th but before the 10th you WILL still get the 2 for 1 split</Msg><Username>gary.knoll</Username><Timestamp>1343322871000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343324928000-6</Id><Title>77.70 close number of blessing</Title><Msg>Look for stock to take off from there</Msg><Username>shepmullin</Username><Timestamp>1343324928000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:48:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343329171000-7</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly. I don't see how people think buying after 27th but before the 10th would mean no split. It doesn't make any sense at all. If I buy on 7/28 I still would eventually have to own shares worth half as much which means they'd have to split them.</Msg><Username>sweetkissofmulder</Username><Timestamp>1343329171000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343329405000-8</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In other words if you buy 1000 on 7/27 at 78.00 you'll get the split, if you buy 1000 on 7/28 they will only cost 39 dollars. Those who own the 78.00 shares simply have to wait until august 10th to see their shares split and go down in price. Or the other scenario would be buying on the 28th is still at 78.00 and then on 8/10 they still split. either way you're getting the split.</Msg><Username>sweetkissofmulder</Username><Timestamp>1343329405000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:03:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343337363000-9</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"if you buy after the 27th but before the 10th you WILL still get the 2 for 1 split" Actually, you could buy ON the 10th and get the split shares (assuming you held until the 13th). The ex-date isn't until the 13th.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343337363000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343337516000-10</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"if you buy 1000 on 7/28 they will only cost 39 dollars." No. The split doesn't become effective until August 13th. Nobody's shares split until the 13th no matter when they were bought.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343337516000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343338104000-11</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"IMHO, this means if you buy the stock AFTER July 27, you will NOT receive the 2-for-1 split." That may be your opinion but it's not reality. KO's website tell you how it's going to work (if you can decipher the complicated language). They specifically say, "seller [after July 27 and before August 13th] is not entitled to the split shares they will receive by virtue of their being holders on the record date." So, if a shareholder of record doesn't get the split shares they will receive (by virtue of being a shareholder of record) if they sell before the ex-date of August 13th, what happens to those shares they have received but aren't entitled to? KO's website explains that too: "Therefore, the split shares are transferred to the buyers [those who bought KO from July 27th through August 10th] by means of "due bills"." Look up due bills and read up on how they work. The process is not of KO's making; they are simply following the same stock exchange rules that every other company has to. http://www.google.com/search?q=due+bills+deferred+ex-date&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343338104000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:28:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343346691000-12</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That stuff about the dividend was written by the same guy at Coke who decided using "K" in the stock symbol was a good idea.</Msg><Username>db_1950</Username><Timestamp>1343346691000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343347011000-13</Id><Topic><Title>I THOUGHT THIS WOULD GO</Title><Username>six6pack2go</Username><Timestamp>1343087830000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 19:57:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pray for $80.00, Then it will match your IQ!</Msg><Username>kennybear4738</Username><Timestamp>1343347011000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:56:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343352291000-14</Id><Topic><Title>July 27, 2012</Title><Username>lisa_in_shoreview</Username><Timestamp>1342459750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-16 13:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Considering that the original Coke contained cocaine, KO sounds quite reasonable, even if drinking too much only produced a TKO.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343352291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 21:24:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343356307000-15</Id><Topic><Title>I THOUGHT THIS WOULD GO</Title><Username>six6pack2go</Username><Timestamp>1343087830000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 19:57:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The split doesn't take effect until August 13th.</Msg><Username>cwn600</Username><Timestamp>1343356307000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 22:31:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343359892000-16</Id><Topic><Title>I THOUGHT THIS WOULD GO</Title><Username>six6pack2go</Username><Timestamp>1343087830000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 19:57:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i dont pray for stock prices i do research i think your mommy is calling you for your nap</Msg><Username>gary.knoll</Username><Timestamp>1343359892000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:31:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
