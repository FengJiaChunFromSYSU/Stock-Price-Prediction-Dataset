This is further confirmed by the EMAs, and you also have a Three Black Crow candlestick (cs)formation on the 3 mo d cs chart. This is a bearish cs formation. You are being warned that more downside is likely to happen .However, no stock goes straight down or straight up thanks to Elliott Wave Theory. They zig zag so there is a possibility it will move up some before it heads down. At this time there is good support at 38.43, 36.54, and 35.58. There is also an open gap at 36.25. Gaps are filled 95% of the time, and it doesn't matter how long it takes. It usually happens. This is a $1.17 gap, and Mr Market will not forget about it.</Msg><Username>dj28rd</Username><Timestamp>1370196094391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 14:01:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
