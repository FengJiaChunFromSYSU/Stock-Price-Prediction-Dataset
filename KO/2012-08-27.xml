Buy as much as you can while the dip is here. There will be up's and downs for KO, But this is not a traders stock. It is a long term player. I have been buying KO for the last 30 years every month no matter what the price. It has made me alot of money and alot of shares. You have got to paient and KO will come through for you. You have got to buy it and forget it. !!! Long KO strong buy !!!</Msg><Username>d740emailonly</Username><Timestamp>1346097734182</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 16:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346109048070-5</Id><Topic><Title>What's with Coke?

I think the other post in re to insider trading is that the ones selling were selling at prime 50-80 dollars a share. And also the stock split they can sell and still have the same number of shares they started with, so in turn they have not lost any of their shares. But regardless the insiders have been selling along for the last 30 years that I have been investing in KO and it has not hurt me a bit...This happens in all major companies !!! Still a strong strong BUY !!!</Msg><Username>d740emailonly</Username><Timestamp>1346112502259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 20:08:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346113830093-8</Id><Title>For the ones worried about insider trading with KO</Title><Msg>If you will look at the time of all of these insider trades they came before the stock split came into effect. The pay date for this stock split was August 10, 2012. The NYSE changed the stock to 39 something dollars as a result of the split on August 13, 2012. So the insiders traded at approx 78-80 dollars and still probably still had the same amount of shares. I have seen this in just about all stock splits...</Msg><Username>d740emailonly</Username><Timestamp>1346113830093</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 20:30:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346118868329-9</Id><Topic><Title>i out ko going to 15 a share selllll</Title><Username>ymkhail</Username><Timestamp>1345764379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And when it does I am going to buy about 5000 shares !!!!</Msg><Username>d740emailonly</Username><Timestamp>1346118868329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 21:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346120560167-10</Id><Topic><Title>Is it time to buy KO</Title><Username>gs_trader</Username><Timestamp>1345529525000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 02:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Broke below 38.75 - more consolidation possible according to this article.</Msg><Username>siraluce</Username><Timestamp>1346120560167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 22:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
