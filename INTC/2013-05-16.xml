Could you give me some color into when the first 2% quarter for the 28nm node was? - How will TSMC justify obsoleting its 20nm process so quickly with a move to 16nm FinFET in 2015? I mean, TSMC has been explicit in saying that they expect by 2017 or so that 20nm will be shipping in the same volumes as 28nm will be in 2013/2014, so will the 16nm node be an "exclusive" expensive node for the high roller customers like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Apple?

CCUR is currently trading for just $7.09 per share with 8.75mm outstanding shares, a market cap of $62.07 million, cash of $22.37 million, an enterprise value of $39.7 million, and revenue of $63.23 million! CCUR is the cable TV industry's number one VOD and multi-screen video delivery technology company with huge clients like Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter, Bright House, Virgin Media, and Rogers. CCUR's new CDN video delivery solutions allow cable TV companies to combine their RF-based classic VOD infrastructure with their new IP-based CDNs to deliver VOD content to smartphones, tablets, and other IP-connected devices, while quickly and cost effectively expanding the number of on demand videos they can offer. CCUR's multi-screen CDN technology is now delivering VOD content to the Android and iOS smartphones/tablets of Time Warner Cable's 12 million subscribers! They are America's #2 largest cable TV operator! CCUR's top rivals are Seachange (SEAC), which has gross margins of 52% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.65, and Harmonic (HLIT), which has gross margins of 46% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.90. CCUR has higher gross margins of 59% and is very undervalued with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.63. CCUR has record high trailing GAAP EPS of $0.25 vs. SEAC and HLIT having trailing GAAP EPS losses.

Last week Intel lifted the lid on its Silvermont microarchitecture that will form the basis for a number of key Atom products including Merrifield and Bay Trail. However the firm's presentation, which is still available on its investor website, made use of screenshots from ARM's DS-5 when talking about designing software for low power usage. Intel's PDF presentation (mirror), ran through various aspects of Silvermont, but on slide 24 the firm talked about the combination of its process node, an architecture that is specifically designed for low power and tools to help developers create applications that are power efficient. To illustrate each point, the firm used relevant stock shots of its transistors and architecture diagrams, however when referring to "design for low power" Intel tiled three screenshots. By zooming in, Intel's three screenshots can be seen a bit more clearly. The firm has seemingly decided to use screenshots from ARM's DS-5 software that are available on ARM's website.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1368709573660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 09:06:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368709683653-23</Id><Topic><Title>Intel uses ARM screenshots in Silvermont presentation........LOL @ Marsavian!</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1368706393733</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 08:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That Intel's use of screenshots that look almost identical to those on ARM's website is one thing, but there is little doubt that the foremost screenshot is that of ARM's DS-5. Another problem from Intel's point of view is that ARM's DS-5 supports only processors designed by ARM and devices made by its partners, so developers couldn't have used the software to profile and optimise code for Intel processors. Intel's use of ARM's DS-5 screenshots is embarrassing.. Intel's developer tools have a very good reputation and its compilers and profilers, in particular its C, C++ and Fortran compilers, are very highly rated for their performance. However ARM will most likely take this as some sort of backhanded compliment that Intel decided to use screenshots from ARM's website to illustrate designing code for low power architectures, even if ARM's software can't help developers that want to optimise for Intel's Silvermont architecture.

Intel, I think is the #1 customer of ARM and likely has many of their tools and documentation laying around. Looks to me like a screw up. If they did not have authorization to use the image, I think ARMH should sue Intel for royalties for using their "IP" without approval. Is that the spin you were looking for? So far the even blogasphere concensus (for those bothering) seems to be "Gives an inadvertant nod to a competitor" which is just a goof if that. I am not sure what "nod" means. It was an admin goof and review team failure.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368713487246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:11:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368713618632-42</Id><Topic><Title>Moto Missing In Action?</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1368712424365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 09:53:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where does Intel say "it's a big phone player" ??</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368713618632</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:13:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368713802570-43</Id><Title>AMD 10:13am EDT 3.74 -0.64 -14.61% Intel UP AMD down.

Everything you ever want to know about the fabless semiconductor ecosystem is there. There are 8,494 blogs, wikis, forum posts and as of opening day Jan 1, 2011: 603,844 people visited SemiWiki. Google: The Truth of TSMC 28nm Yield! TSMC breaks out revenue per process node in their quarterly reports. It took about one year from 28nm tape-out to revenue (production). 20nm tape-outs started in Q1 2103 so we should see production in Q1 2014. I know the TSMC financial lady said Q2 2014 but I think she is being overly cautious to please the financial community. My bet is Q1 and there may be a stock bump as a result since expectations will be beat. TSMC 16nm tape-outs are targeted for Q4 2013 but from what I can see today that may slip to Q1 2014. So I predict 16nm silicon in Q1 2015. As you know 20nm and 16nm uses a similar recipe so rather than the standard two year process gap 16nm will be one year. Here is some interesting data. I presented this at the IEEE conference on FinFETs last month: Design Rules by Process 700 rules @ 90nm 800 rules @ 65nm 1,200 rules @ 40nm 1,900 rules @ 28nm 3,000 rules @ 20nm 3,400 rules @ 16nm So 20nm is definitely much more complex than 28nm. The 400 extra rules on 16nm are for FinFETS and that number may grow when the final PDK is released in Q4 of this year. Thank you for the civil discussion. Maybe the rest of the board can follow your lead (including me).

Brian Krzanich, who was recently named chief executive, said that although Intel has been slow to respond to the rapid rise of tablets and smartphones, the company is well-positioned to participate going forward. "What we have will allow us to grow in this area much faster in the future," he said. Intel's annual meeting provided the first opportunity for Mr. Krzanich, whose appointment to CEO became effective Thursday, to address shareholders. He was named to the post May 2, following a selection process set off in November by the surprise decision of Paul Otellini to step down as CEO, three years before Intel's mandatory retirement age. Intel, in a break from tradition, evaluated external candidates as well as internal ones before settling on Mr. Krzanich, a 52-year-old company veteran who rose through its manufacturing ranks and had previously been appointed chief operating officer. While he was widely regarded as a front-runner for the job, Mr. Krzanich surprised some Intel-watchers by asking the board to promote Renee James to be president. The longtime software chief has been associated with some high-profile Intel flops, while her personal style is characterized by some on Wall Street as abrasive. But Mr. Krzanich and Andy Bryant, Intel's chairman, credited Ms. James with helping to develop a new strategy for the company that impressed Intel directors. Though few details have been spelled out yet, the Intel executives have indicated that the strategy is designed to accelerate the company's moves to place its chips in more products beyond computers.

First, the analyst divides the tablet market into separate Windows and Android categories, and this simply doesn't reflect that Intel-based tablets enjoy the huge advantage of being dual-boot and can run both Windows AND Android. The analyst doesn't explain what the other 25% of Windows tablets is supposed to be. Does he believe RT is going to make up a quarter of the Windows tablet market going forward? What evidence is there to believe that? The analyst goes on to assume, incorrectly I might add, that for Android based tablets Intel is competing on speed alone and that consumers won't experience any benefit unless new apps are developed to take advantage of Slivermont's architecture. Of course the guy is ignoring that at the same speed Silvermont is predicted to deliver up to 5 times better battery life than its competition. Clearly the analyst must believe battery life is unimportant to tablet buyers. Just as he ignores the value to consumers to buy a tablet that is capable of running both full Windows 8 AND Android on the same device at the user's convenience.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1368725322336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 13:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368725763642-109</Id><Topic><Title>Shills Continue Failed Content-Free Posting Strategy</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368725185070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 13:26:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ASP slides away.

The ARMH stock is positioned as the next Google, Apple, or whatever company that exploded. It's being sold to people too stupid to do their due diligence. It's an $8 stock with a $40 premium. The "PC era is over" story has been proven false. But ARMH has it's well crafted talking points and 20 years from now it will still sell at a premium to people still too stupid to do their due diligence. Stupid people with money are easy to find. ARMH has had a lead in the mobile space. Over the past couple of years instead of expanding the lead as Intel catches up ARM has been floundering. Problems with 28nm production, gate first vs last debate, big/little may or may not really work. Their solution? Quad core smart phones. As Warren East, the former CEO of ARMH said was that he welcomed Intel into his market because it was good competition. But then he realized what it really meant and quit before he had to be held accountable. Intel is going to run through the market with the best transistors in the world while ARM flounders. Then they are going to throw money around. Lots of it, sums that your little mind can't grasp. It will go into promotions and advertising campaigns. Some will make you think that Intel is so hated that they can never get a meeting with the large phone manufactures. Nice try. ARM suppliers have screwed up way too many times and the industry is seeking alternatives. The doors will fly right open for Intel.

Intel INTC +0.04%’s unveiling the following year at Computex 2012 with a plethora of form factors solidified that future. To predict the future of PCs, one must have an opinion on a few important areas of interest. One topic that requires a lot of analysis is if a convertible PC can replace your notebook or a 10” tablet. I do a lot of contextual research and I wanted to put it to the test and share with you my personal experience. I can tell you that under many circumstances, the latest convertibles can replace a notebook and/or a 10” tablet. Let me start with the methodology. You can find the detailed test matrix here. For three weeks, I stopped using my Nexus 7 and Apple AAPL +1.73% iPad and used three different convertible PCs: Finally, I ranked the experience as Poor, OK, Good, Very Good, and Great. I found what came out of the data quite interesting and I think you will to. The first big takeaway is that for me, I prefer a convertible over a traditional notebook. I don’t feel like the experience was compromised in any way that didn’t have an easy workaround. Every one of the convertibles was an Ultrabook, meaning they all had solid performance with a Core i5 or i7, woke up very quickly, had at least 5 hours battery life and had sufficient storage at 128GB of SSD unless you’re a hard core PC gamer. Both the Dell and Surface Pro had 1080P displays, too, so these were no compromise.

Intel’s main focus is to produce more power-efficient chips, as it also adds features for connectivity and security, Krzanich said during a speech at the annual shareholder meeting in Santa Clara, Calif. “We see that we’ve been a bit slow to move in the space,” Krzanich said of the mobile market. “We’re well positioned already and the base of assets we have will allow us to grow much faster in the area.” Starting later this year, Intel will also integrate LTE into Atom chips, which would be a big boost for the mobile business, Krzanich said. “That really opens up the market for our phones and connected devices,” Krzanich said. [Still a lot of shoes to drop as we know that a lot of behind the scenes negotiating is taking place on Intel's14nm FinFET processing runs. We know some new Foundry deals have already been made.

But the smaller Yoga 11 was underpowered by comparison, running Windows RT on an ARM processor. As of today, though, Lenovo is rolling out an alternative: the Yoga 11S, which replaces the 11's Tegra chip with an Intel one and runs Windows 8. Lenovo has started accepting orders for the 11S on its site, and they'll soon be available online at Best Buy. The base model costs $799.99 — about $250 more than the current price of its RT counterpart — and comes with an 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 display, 4GB of memory, a 128GB SSD, and a Core i3 processor, upgradeable to a Core i5 or i7. It maxes out at a 256GB SSD, 8GB of RAM, and a 1600 x 900 display. From what we can tell, orders might not be arriving particularly soon: Lenovo's site lists a shipping time of over four weeks, and the notebooks aren't going to be in Best Buy's brick-and-mortar stores until June 23rd. Despite this, it's the first we've seen of the 11S since it was first revealed at CES in January. That's a surprisingly long wait, but based on our experience with it at CES, it might be worth it if you're in the market for a little laptop that can take full advantage of Windows 8.

I mean, TSMC has been explicit in saying that they expect by 2017 or so that 20nm will be shipping in the same volumes as 28nm will be in 2013/2014, so will the 16nm node be an "exclusive" expensive node for the high roller customers like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Apple? 20nm will not be obsolete, I don't know where that comes from. You need to look at the value proposition of each node and what markets they serve. The mobile market is relatively new for the semiconductor industry and it is changing the way we do business. Each phone has a new SoC with a shelf life of 12-18 months. When the iPhone6 ships next year with 20nm TSMC silicon the iPhone5s will be obsolete within days. The iPhone6s will have 16nm so the 20nm SoC will be obsolete. Etc..... FPGAs on the other hand last for years and years. Same with automotive and other embedded applications. Xilinx and Altera both taped out to TSMC 20nm in Q1. Right now most FPGAs shipped are still 40nm due to the lengthy design win cycles of their customers. Automotive people are still on 65nm or larger. They probably won't start 20nm for a decade or two. Look at TSMC's revenue by technology for Q1: 90nm = 24% 90nm = 8% 65n = 17% 40nm = 23% 28nm = 24% * Note: those numbers are skewed a bit because TSMC has 90% market share at 28nm If you think Intel is going to make buckets of money off Altera you will be very disappointed. It will be YEARS before Intel sees an FPGA wafer profit. Wallis will be in his 70's by then and wearing diapers, if he doesn't already. :-)</Msg><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1368741244457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 17:54:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368744691364-166</Id><Topic><Title>Nenni</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368630162296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:02:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How would you know?

[That's funny in that you were the one trying to threaten me with your knowledge of the law - which was non-existent. The law: By your own admission you are what is called a public person (business leader, speaker, author, etc. - you never stop telling us how great and well-known you are). In that it's almost impossible to ever win a lawsuit against anyone for defamation. The law is different on defamation for public persons. I, however, am not a public person and you therefore better watch what you say about me. As far as my education or experience goes as an accountant, engineer, lawyer, manager or anything else, you know nothing about me. You make things up to suit your need for character assassination. Mainly because you don't know how to argue any issues on facts, logic or analysis.

We know that Intel is going to be two process nodes up on ARM as Intel's 14nm will be in volume production long before ARM's 20nm. This means ARM's 28nm will have to compete with Intel's 14nm FinFET. No comparison. Airmont will be the ARM-Slayer. 2.) We know that the economics of ARM foundries is going to decline steadily. See the article "Intel will win in foundry wars" for the details. Also Intel will be first to 450mm wafers by a long shot. And ARM foundries are taking longer to reach the same yield level with each drop in die size. Intel continues to enjoy improved economics at each node due to superior technology, fabrication and manufacturing. 3.) We know that Intel has a roadmap chocked full of consistent improvements. We will see a plethora of new product announcements all year long. We will see a ton of new Haswell products available immediately after the formal announcement on June 3rd. 4.) We know that we will see more big Intel foundry deals. 5.) We know that Intel is doubling tablet sales each quarter and that the ARM RT is toast. 6.) We know that 2014 will be the year of the Intel Smartphone as 14nm technology will combine with Intel's newly integrated LTE solution to finally offer superior products across the board. 7.) We know that ARM is the most over-valued stock since the dotcom era. With a P/E of 83 and Intel coming on fast there is no way they can grow earnings at a rate to justify that valuation. 8.) We know that with the exception of the blueredmonk that there is no ARM fanboi on this board capable of engaging in a discussion of technology with any semblance of credibility. 9.) We know that new form factors are re-energizing the computer business. We know that only Intel has the ecosystem to provide complete solutions across all of computing and mobility. 10.) And we know that the second half of the year will be much better than the first half with particular excitement brewing for back-to-school and the holiday period.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368752538538</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:02:18

As a result, the market has valued the company at healthy multiples of ~22x sales. The markets which ARM operates in are compelling growth stories as we enter a post-pc era. However, I believe the story (and how ARM is modeled) is fundamentally flawed due to increasing competition. The multiple attached to ARM can perhaps be argued if dominance of its markets remains a certainty over the next 5-10 years. However in a rapidly evolving tech space this would be a silly presumption to make. To continue, we must examine the impact on ARM with changes to market share in their most competitive markets, namely tablets and smartphones. My short thesis is based upon these two fundamental factors: sensitivity to changes in market share and the overall valuation of the company.

Because Android is programmed on the Java platform, it allows for the support of different instruction sets with relative ease. Java was designed to be a high level language with portability on numerous devices. In fact, Android currently supports the MIPS and x86 based instruction sets. Apple (AAPL) maintains tight control of its products and supply chain. With only a couple of products, there is no reason Apple would not be capable of switching processor design and instruction sets. The decision for Apple to switch would likely be due to significant performance gains (performance measured as energy efficiency and speed). Ultimately the decision switch will come from the phone/tablet manufacturers. To cause these manufactures to switch, Intel must have a superior product. In addition SoC's manufacturers may also offer MIPS based processor designs as a way to diversify their offerings from solely ARM's products."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368753764042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:22:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368753772246-197</Id><Topic><Title>RBC Capital Upgrades Intel (INTC) to Outperform Raises Target To $29</Title><Username>keiretsunikkei</Username><Timestamp>1367845718534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:08:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>upgrades keep coming wow</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368753772246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368753826832-198</Id><Topic><Title>Intel CEO: Well Positioned Now to Grow Fast in Ultra-Mobile Products</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1368719592083</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good info thank you</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368753826832</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:23:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368753860288-199</Id><Topic><Title>"how ARM is modeled is fundamentally flawed..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368753568089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:19:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The growth story dissipates rather easily as market share slips. ARM's market share falling to 60% lowers the revenue CAGR to 11% even assuming 20% end market growth. The loss of a major customer would be catastrophic to ARM and should not be discounted. Apple and Samsung both have ~20% and 30% of the smartphone market by units respectively. A loss of either of these either of these customers is certainly a realistic possibility. Strategically, Apple switching to Intel would make sense. Apple would gain access to some of the best fabs in the world for its tablets and smartphones. In addition Apple would then be able to build iOS on a cohesive x86 environment. I believe Apple would lose too much computing power to change its Macbooks to ARM chips. Samsung may wish to diversify itself away from the Google OS. The mobile OS Tizen has been backed by Intel and Samsung. From a strategic perspective, it makes sense for Samsung to diversify from Google (GOOG), especially if Google shows favoritism toward Motorola regarding software releases. ARM is a supported platform for Tizen, but I think it could make sense to switch processors in the event of a large software change on Samsung's mobile devices. Furthermore, ARM is poised to suffer from an unfavorable mix as lower-end smart phones outgrow the higher-end smartphones in emerging markets. Meanwhile growth is modeled by changes in volume, and this mix is set to negatively impact average royalty rates. Unless ARM is able to continually grow royalty rates (through gains in product levels), this shift in mix works against ARM.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368753860288</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:24:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368753915084-200</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Has Huge Tablet Market Opportunities with Atom “Silvermont”, But Core i “Haswell” More Important</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368723082779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:51:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agree</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368753915084</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:25:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368754015240-201</Id><Topic><Title>In first speech as CEO, Intel's Krzanich pledges stronger mobile push</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368735219341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:13:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good info Wallis thanks</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368754015240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368754052664-202</Id><Topic><Title>"how ARM is modeled is fundamentally flawed..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368753568089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:19:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All of this analysis is meaningless unless there is a catalyst to cause a rerating of the stock. While the valuation remains lofty, there must be a fundamental driver to rerate the stock. There are a variety of ways which may cause a rerating over the next 12 months. A better than expected unveiling of Intel's mobile chip architecture, Silvermont or a successful launch of Haswell in June. Windows 8 continued momentum into tablets would work against ARM's market share and could pressure the multiple. Finally, I think decelerating growth in the company's results could cause a multiple contraction from ~40x to ~25x. Regardless, I think the risk reward is attractive. Upside to earnings would be around $1.25/share, at a 40x multiple pricing the stock at $50. Unless there is significant growth ahead of consensus ~$1.14/share, according to yahoo finance, the upside of the stock is priced in. While I believe the fundamental value is very low in the long-term, in the short-term I am pricing this company at 25x 2014 earnings ~$28/share. This represents a downside of approximately 42.5% from Friday's close of $49.59. I remain uncertain of what the driving catalyst is, but at the current valuation ARM is an attractive short given long-term competitive threats.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368754052664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:27:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368754177724-203</Id><Title>INTEL CEO VOWS RAPID GROWTH IN MOBILE</Title><Msg>Intel's New CEO Vows Rapid Growth In Mobile Market Last update: 5/16/2013 11:46:16 AM By Ian Sherr and Don Clark Intel Corp.'s (INTC) new chief executive vowed Thursday to rapidly grow the company's presence in the tablet and smartphone markets at a shareholder meeting that formalized a major management shift for the Silicon Valley chip giant. Brian Krzanich, who was recently named chief executive, said that although Intel has been slow to respond to the rapid rise of tablets and smartphones, the company is well-positioned to participate going forward. "What we have will allow us to grow in this area much faster in the future," he said. Intel's annual meeting provided the first opportunity for Mr. Krzanich, whose appointment to CEO became effective Thursday, to address shareholders. He was named to the post May 2, following a selection process set off in November by the surprise decision of Paul Otellini to step down as CEO, three years before Intel's mandatory retirement age. Intel, in a break from tradition, evaluated external candidates as well as internal ones before settling on Mr. Krzanich, a 52-year-old company veteran who rose through its manufacturing ranks and had previously been appointed chief operating officer. While he was widely regarded as a front-runner for the job, Mr. Krzanich surprised some Intel-watchers by asking the board to promote Renee James to be president. The longtime software chief has been associated with some high-profile Intel flops, while her personal style is characterized by some on Wall Street as abrasive. But Mr. Krzanich and Andy Bryant, Intel's chairman, credited Ms. James with helping to develop a new strategy for the company that impressed Intel directors. Though few details have been spelled out yet, the Intel executives have indicated that the strategy is designed to accelerate the company's moves to place its chips in more products beyond computers.

In a transcript published by EETimes, Shang-Yi Chiang, TSMC’s R&amp;D boss, laid out six bullet points to explain the situation the company is coming from, what steps it’s taking to make amends and where it's going. The 40nm yield issues were blamed on the company’s previous lack of experience with the new, smaller node. Without going into too many specifics, Chiang explained the delay in achieving a viable yield was due to it using 193nm shrink immersion on the wafers, which resulted in a high defect rate, and also its low-K process that would damage the dies when converted into a package. TSMC is looking at extreme ultraviolet and e-beam direct write as alternatives to shrink immersion depending, of course, on cost. Having its clients breathing down its neck couldn’t have been easy. TSMC immediately started developing its 3rd generation manufacturing process on the node. Currently, output for 40nm wafers is 80,000 wafers per quarter, as only Fab 12 is manufacturing these. However, the company vowed it will be able to double that by year’s end, that is, 160,000 wafers per quarter, once Fab 14 is up and running. He then moved on to explaining what the company plans to do next with its 28nm roadmap. It will start with a 28nm Low Power (28LP) silicon oxynitride, followed a quarter later by the 28nm high performance (28HP) high-K metal gate process. Despite it being the first high-K metal-gate process, Chiang believes that TSMC will be able to migrate the technology as it moves forward with 22nm and 20nm nodes. 28nm should be introduced by Q3 2010, we garnered. Further along the roadmap comes the aforementioned 22nm node. Chiang expects to see a more mature second-generation high-K metal-gate process kick in. The first 22nm process will be a high-performance one (22HP), followed 2 quarters later by the low-power version (22LP). These should be in place by Q3 2012 and Q1 2013, respectively.

There are less FABS but there are not less FOUNDRIES at 14nm. To be clear, there are just as many Foundries that license the ARM IP at 28nm as 20nm as 16/14nm. Look on the GF website. They stated publicly that 14nm is in development. Both UMC and GF license the IBM 14nm process technology. As did Samsung. Same with SMIC. TSMC developed their own. Those are indisputable facts.Google the Foundry name + 14nm and you will see public data supporting this FACT. Let me repeat: The same number of FOUNDIRES that license ARM IP at 28nm will be at 20nm and 16/14nm.</Msg><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1368761205545</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 23:26:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368761308979-215</Id><Topic><Title>Great question from shareholder today</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368758698255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 22:44:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are new to developing low power versions of their manufacturing process and so have not lead on low process until later this year.
