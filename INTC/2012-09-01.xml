The core also sports its own floating point/SIMD unit, which has an out-of-order scheduler that can push through one operation per cycle, plus a load and a store. The FP unit can do 128-bit processing, but since there is only one unit, it cannot be double-pumped to emulate Intel's and AMD's AVX vector math instructions. (That would be a nice feature for X-Gene 2.0.) What we now know about X-Gene is that it uses a two-core module as the basic building block of the processor. Each core has its own L1 data and L1 instruction cache, and there is a shared L2 cache that spans these two ARM cores. The core has a four-wide, out-of-order execution unit for integer work, and includes full virtualization support including nested page tables. This is a feature that x86 hypervisors make use of to boost the performance of virtual machines running atop hypervisors like VMware's ESXi, Citrix Systems' Xen, Red Hat's KVM, and Microsoft's Hyper-V. And it means that any of these hypervisors can be ported from x86 to X-Gene processors – and probably will be in the long run, if ARM servers take off"</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1346486916226</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 04:08:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346489424431-7</Id><Title>Romney loses cool with reporter that catches him in a lie</Title><Msg>Check it out on Youtube!

Warren/AP Photo) Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the Federal Reserve’s past stimulus actions in a speech on Friday morning, saying its actions “can be effective” and more of them may be on the way. Bernanke’s keynote speech at the Federal Reserve of Kansas City’s Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. was closely watched by investors for clues of additional stimulus in the form of quantitative easing, which at its simplest level aims to increase the monetary supply after the central bank buys government securities. Though Bernanke did not announce any new Federal Reserve policies or strategies, he made clear the central bank would be open to additional action in the future.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1346515139588</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:58:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346515242398-21</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL SHARES HAVE BEEN UNCHANGED FOR 10 YEARS!</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1346513617020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:33:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then, why the heck are you here? ------------- Because this message board is "like the lure of the siren's song, never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?"</Msg><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1346515242398</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346516173875-22</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL SHARES HAVE BEEN UNCHANGED FOR 10 YEARS!</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1346513617020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:33:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My bank account sure has changed since I bought into Intel for the first time ever at 20 (bought Lucy_nuff"s shares at 20) = the 5 figure Dividend every three months.

Both groups have done very good. How would you lose money on Intel stock? The only way I can figure is to repeatedly buy high and sell low. Intel stock is the VERY ideal stock. Intel stock is GREAT for buying shares using put options because he premiums are so high. Intel stock is just OK for then selling call options until the the Intel shares are assigned. Intel stock is then GREAT for doing the same, over and over and over again. Intel, the company (separate from the stock), missed the impact of the current Steve Jobs products: iTunes, iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad. Intel was hardly alone in that mistake. Think .... NOK, RIMM, DELL, HP, .... I think (my opinion), that you are better at forecasting the past than the future. I have put a reasonable amont of my money on that opinion.

You will have to explain that more. The ARM THUMB instruction set is hardly "RISC" and is essentially the ARM "CISC" encoding of the ARM instruction set. Reducing the size of the instruction set introduces some difficult problems too. A RISC instruction set generates a program with a code footprint that is larger than its CISC counterpart. The larger code size means that less of a program will fit into a dedicated code cache. That means that the code footprint will consume more of any unified larger coherrent cache. Which means that there will be less room for data in those unified outer caches. Less data in the cache means a higher miss rate and program stalls as it waits for data back from memory. Memory IO will require the larger IO buffers which consume more power. ARM recognized this problem and patched in the THUMB instruction set which is hardly RISC. The x86 has been internally "RISC" for a number of generations. They have a front end instruction decoder that expands the instructions into their RISC engine format. Think of it more as COMPRESSED program code and an x86 front end DECOMPRESSION engine.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346527409555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 15:23:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346527650407-34</Id><Topic><Title>Applied Micro's X-Gene server chip ARMed to the teeth</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1346486916226</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 04:08:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good points... but the extra wide issues, and further distribute blocks of code... based on dependencies...

You are saying that 4 instruction can be loaded and executed in parallel and that is tough to do if you don't know how long the instructions are. With the fixed length instruction, 4 can be loaded and executed in parallel. The average number will likely be far less than 4-instructions because of a number of things. DATA DEPENDENCY between instructions will stall execution. Few programs can avoid this problem. There is not much a compiler can do. BRANCHES TAKEN will cause some vacant slots. The CPU has to prepare and expect the branch NOT TAKEN case. The average number of instructions between branches taken is not very high.

You will have to explain that more. Reducing the size of the instruction set introduces some difficult problems too. A RISC instruction set generates a program with a code footprint that is larger than its CISC counterpart. " Don't think the traditional definition of RISC applies anymore. Maybe a load/store ISA vs using operands in memory. But the original RISC came from the view that fewer instructions you could increase the clock speeds due to lower decodes. "The larger code size means that less of a program will fit into a dedicated code cache. That means that the code footprint will consume more of any unified larger coherrent cache. Which means that there will be less room for data in those unified outer caches." ARM can use predication, x86 needs to insert branch instructions. but ARM 64 will have burst instructions with double the register set of x86 !!!! With the info in the internal registers, you'll have to dig hard why you think the new ARM ISA would be slower... I look forward to the benchmarks comparing code sizes... but any CPU, will slow to a crawl when you thrash the cache.. "The x86 has been internally "RISC" for a number of generations. They have a front end instruction decoder that expands the instructions into their RISC engine format. Think of it more as COMPRESSED program code and an x86 front end DECOMPRESSION engine."

If you start with a CISC instruction set and based on what you've observed on the software (usage) side, if you pare it down to its bare essentials, the number of circuits you'll need to realize your instruction set (OPs) will reduce significantly from the CISC you started with. Simplifying right at the top (at the instruction set set definition stage) makes things simpler at every subsequent stage. This makes a lot of sense.
