Intel Accelerates Mobile Computing Push Posted by IntelPR in Intel Newsroom on Feb 24, 2013 9:01:31 PM ------- MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS, Barcelona, Spain, Feb. 25, 2013 – Intel Corporation today announced a range of new products, ecosystem and enabling efforts that will further accelerate the company’s presence in mobile and help usher in new devices and richer experiences with Intel Inside®. --------------------- Customers announcing support for "Clover Trail+" platform for phones and tablets include ASUS*, Lenovo*, and ZTE*. Debuting at CES last month, the Lenovo* IdeaPhone K900* is based on the Intel® Atom™ processor Z2580 and delivers rich video, graphics and Web content at fantastic speeds. The IdeaPhone is 6.9mm thin and also features the world’s first 5.5-inch full high-definition 400+ PPI screen for increased clarity of text and images. The K900 will be the first product to market based on the Atom processor Z2580. Lenovo plans to introduce the smartphone in the second quarter of 2013 in China, followed soon by select international markets. Building on the Atom processor platform ("Clover Trail+"), Intel also highlighted its forthcoming 22nm smartphone Atom™ SoC ("Merrifield"). The product is based on Intel’s leading-edge 22nm process and an entirely new Atom microarchitecture that will help enable increased smartphone performance, power efficiency and battery life.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362212290996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 03:18:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362219039554-6</Id><Topic><Title>No Merrifield announcement at MWC</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1362209611770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 02:33:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems pretty low key.

If you like pure income, go buy the INTC 2041 senior notes. The rest of us would like growing EPS, which implies growing dividend and share price.

Mentor moves tools toward 16-nanometer Ron Wilson 8/23/2010 3:51 PM EDT A conversation last Friday (Aug. 20) with Joseph Sawicki, vice president and general manager of the Mentor Graphics Corp.'s Design to Silicon Division, provided a snapshot of the conundra facing foundries and EDA vendors as they approach sub-20-nm process geometries. The landscape is filled with uncertainties, Sawicki warned, but there is no time left to wait for resolution. "We saw our first 16-nm test chips go out a couple of months ago," Sawicki said in an interview Friday (Aug. 20). "There is design work going on now at that node—so far, though, it is mostly intellectual-property development." Sawicki cited some big bets that foundries and design teams are being forced to put on the table. One is the choice of gate-first or gate-last processing for high-k/metal-gate gate stacks. "It seems clear that gate-first will provide greater density," Sawicki said, but he warned that other uncertainties remain, such as potential differences in process variations and even whether both approaches will scale below 20-nm. The questions are critical to chip designers because the two major foundry powers—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) and Globalfoundries Inc.—have taken opposite approaches, leading them to have quite different design rules. Since there will not be easy portability between the two foundry groups, design teams may have to pick one track or the other. There is also the still-unresolved lithography roadmap. Printers for critical layers at 16-nm might be EUV systems, or they might be massively-parallel e-beam direct-write systems. Or we might still be using 193-nm immersion lithography. Each choice requires different treatment of design data before the masks are made, and each would have different design rules. more in the article ..... eetimes ...</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362285693748</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 23:41:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
