MacBook Air</Title><Msg>[A very nice review of these products, all with Intel Inside, with a great comparison chart...] Google hasn’t always been known for making breathtaking hardware, but today’s announcement of the Chromebook Pixel — arguably one of the best-looking laptops ever made, if nothing else — means that may no longer be the case. Still, you can’t be blamed for being wary of shelling out a decent chunk of money on Google’s first foray into laptops, let alone a Chromebook of all things, so here’s a preliminary look at how the Chromebook Pixel stacks up against two prominent rivals in the computing space: the stock version of Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air and Microsoft’s Surface Pro. *Note that we compared the base MBA and the surface Pro with upgraded storage, to establish a better baseline in terms of comparing more similar price points and spec load-outs. VERSUS THE 13-INCH MACBOOK AIR Compared to the base 13-inch MacBook Air, Google’s Pixel has a lot of similarities. It’s priced around the same, but actually comes in as more expensive that the OS X ultraportable, at $1299 and $1449 for options with Wi-Fi only, and Wi-Fi + LTE networking. What does the Pixel offer to justify the extra cost? It does have a denser display, with 239 ppi on a nearly 13-inch display. And that screen is touch sensitive, which isn’t something Apple can claim. But until now, it hasn’t shown off much about how touch might work with ChromeOS, though it has reportedly been “optimized” for finger-based input. Another place where the Chromebook Pixel falls short of its competition is in local storage. 32GB on the Wi-Fi model and 64GB on the LTE version is tiny compared to the MacBook Air, which is already pushing it with 128GB. LTE is nice to have, but, with the prevalence of hotspots and modems, arguably less important than more offline-accessible storage space. The Chromebook Pixel is very much aimed at the same market as the MacBook Air, with Google stressing that it’s an upscale device. But despite what looks to be a beautiful screen, this arrives with an even more experimental, touch-enabled version of an OS that has yet to prove itself with general consumers, meaning that the reasons to opt for Google’s brave new laptop over the Air perhaps aren’t as apparent as Google would’ve hoped. VERSUS THE 128GB SURFACE PRO I can’t help but think about the Chromebook Pixel in relation to something like the Surface Pro, another premium computing device from a company that has historically shied away from making its own computers. Granted, the differences in execution between the two are pretty staggering, but it’s hard not to look at both devices as fresh steps into a market increasingly driven by novel hardware. The Pixel certainly has the Surface Pro beat when it comes to sheer screen size and resolution (it has a 12.85″ display running at 2560 x 1700, compared to the Pro’s 10.6″ panel running at 1920 x 1080), but the Surface Pro seems to sport better touch support with its included stylus and Wacom digitizer. It’s too early to say whether or not one device has a definitive advantage of the other because of their seemingly similar processors (though the Pixel could squeak by because of its slightly quicker chipset), but we’ll return to that once we get our hands on a review unit. Again, the Pixel may fall flat with its paltry 32GB of internal storage (though folks who spring for the LTE model will have around 64GB to play with). Sure, having a terabyte of cloud storage is neat, but those in need of real speed will prefer the Pro’s SSDs and memory card slot. The other big question mark here is Chrome OS itself. The Chromebook is a very handsome little machine that seems to have some horsepower under the hood to boot, but I’m curious whether or not people will choose to plunk down upwards of $1299 for a computer that exists outside of the two entrenched environments that have dominated consumer computing. Windows 8 isn’t a shining star yet either, but it’s far from a company’s side project. IN THE END… While the Air and Surface Pro have their share of advantages, it’s still a little too early to write the Chromebook Pixel off completely. It may just be the right computer at the right time to give Chrome OS the boost it really needs, but for now Google needs to make a better case for why people should spend $1299 on a computer that hinges on the cloud instead of, you know, anything else.

Intel's 10 year adventure into WiMAX made great press claiming how Intel was going to transform the wireless industry - much like the press today about Intel's Web TV changing the TV industry, but after $10 billion dollars and many misguided steps they lost the standards battle to the carriers themselves as the carriers upstaged Intel with a similar but better wireless technology called LTE, which today is the global 4G standard. The parallels between Intel's WiMAX project and Web TV are remarkably similar. Intel enter's the business of a different industry dominated by other tech industry titans that own or control the critical assets of their industry. Intel introduces some good technology and good ideas but the incumbent industry titans take the market opportunity away from them as they replicate the Intel solution and do it better as they still control the critical assets. In this case the assets are content and distribution instead of spectrum. It would have been better if Intel had simply designed the box then offered it to cable incumbents form them to implement, with Intel inside. But what will not happen is the cable industry allowing its control of the consumer or revenue be dismantled by any over-the-top streaming service for live TV. And if the ad revenue of spying on viewers is necessary to make Intel's business model work, it's a definite fail no matter whose brand is on it.</Msg><Username>mega.hurts</Username><Timestamp>1361716058369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 09:27:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361716119925-14</Id><Topic><Title>Google</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361549477899</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:11:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well, it is pretty awful, and not to defend Yahoo in any way, but it probably wouldn't have degenerated to being this bad were it not for the shameless self promotion of unwitting web site click based revenues by the likes of D.

Maybe it's time for Apple to rethink the MacBook concept. Thank you, Google. For obsoleting my MacBook. Question: What two killer hardware features are missing on MacBooks? My answer: a touch screen and 4G. What a coincidence. Just what Google is offering on the Chromebook Pixel. And in a package that comes close to matching the MacBook's aesthetics. Not everyone may agree with that. Take the laptop flat-earthers. They will say touch is stupid (or "pointless" as one columnist said) on a laptop. Yeah right, just like the mouse was a stupid idea. Then there's Apple's your-arm-wants-to-fall-off on vertical touch surfaces excuse. That will eventually give way to a touch-screen MacBook of some sort. You heard it here first. The point is, Google knows (they're not stupid) that touch is important on a laptop. As does Microsoft (Windows 8 and Surface). That leaves Apple in Luddite land. 4G: And some might say that a Chromebook needs 4G more than a MacBook because the Chromebook is so immersed in the cloud. Hmm, my MacBook spends lots of time in the cloud too. And the last time I used it on the road, I was constantly hauling out my Verizon MiFi or running down my iPhone's battery with the Personal And the operating system? I believe that cool hardware is the first step in luring consumers to a new operating environment. While Chrome OS is still a work in progress (and lacks key features that many users need), with the success of Android, I do think it's possible that an improved Chrome OS combined with a second-generation Chromebook Pixel could reel in more consumers. Google certainly has my attention. By CNET, Brooke Crothers [This has to be disturbing news both for Apple and ARM fanbois and investors. Apple clearly is in a swoon and with no signs of coming out any time soon. The only hope for a lift I see for Apple out of the doldrums is to announce both an iWatch and a fabrication deal with Intel that will indicate that they are capable of and interesting in leading edge of technology. Waiting on TSMCs fabrication to evolve is worse than watching grass grow and it's increasing the rate of Apples' downward spiral. Apple is currently getting out-innovated right and left, as this article indicates. They need to bust a move and they need to do it quickly.

The Line: “The president’s sequester.” The Party: Republican Editor’s note: This is the first of an occasional series called “Party Lines” that will highlight misleading talking points by both parties. This Republican talking point aims to blame President Obama for more than $1 trillion in automatic, across-the-board cuts in domestic and defense spending that — without action by Congress — are scheduled to take effect on March 1. House Speaker John Boehner, who said on Feb. 12 that “we are only weeks away from the devastating consequences of the president’s sequester,” has been using variations of the line on his website since at least September 2012. He and congressional Republicans recently have taken to using the hashtag #Obamaquester on Twitter to fault the president for the looming cuts. But the reality is that the pending cuts would not be possible had both Democrats and Republicans not supported the legislation that included them. Here’s the background: In the summer of 2011, when Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree on a way to cut spending in exchange for increasing the federal government’s borrowing limit, legislators settled on the Budget Control Act instead. The law capped federal discretionary spending to save almost $1.2 trillion over a 10-year period, but also mandated that a bipartisan, 12-person congressional committee find at least $1.5 trillion in additional cuts. If the committee failed to come up with a plan, another $1.2 trillion in cuts would occur automatically — half from defense spending and half from discretionary spending on domestic programs — through sequestration. The committee failed to reach an agreement, and the automatic cuts will now begin in March if Congress doesn’t stop them. In his book “The Price of Politics,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that it was, in fact, Obama’s then-director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jacob Lew, and White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors who brought the idea of sequestration to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid before it was proposed to Republicans in Congress. That is the source of Republican claims that this is “the president’s sequester.” But as Woodward wrote in his book, and as he subsequently explained to Politico, neither party wanted the automatic cuts to take effect or thought they would happen. The cuts were included as a mechanism to force members of the bipartisan committee to work out a deal to avoid them. Politico, Oct. 23, 2012: “No one thought it would happen. The idea was to design something … that was so onerous that no one would ever let it happen. Of course, it did, because they couldn’t reach agreement,” [Woodward] said. “They all believed that the supercommittee was going to come up with a $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction plan, so there would be no sequestration. Of course, the supercommittee failed and so the trigger went off, which has all of these very Draconian cuts.” The automatic cuts were supposed to take effect in January, but the president and Congress agreed to delay them until March 1 to give themselves more time to work out a deal. Now, as the new deadline for sequestration draws closer, many Republicans blame the president. And though it’s true that the idea of sequestration originated in the White House, there would be no possibility of automatic cuts had members of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — not gone along with the idea. The Budget Control Act passed in the House with 269 votes in favor — 174 from Republicans and 95 from Democrats. And the bill cleared the Senate with 74 “yea” votes, of which 28 were cast by Republicans. In fact, one of those voting in favor, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Feb. 17 that “Republicans deserve blame; I’ll take some blame for it.” And Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan who voted against the bill, has said that “it’s totally disingenuous” for Republicans who voted in favor of the bill to now blame the president for it. Amash told Buzzfeed: “The debt ceiling deal in 2011 was agreed to by Republicans and Democrats, and regardless of who came up with the sequester, they all voted for it. So, you can’t vote for something and, with a straight face, go blame the other guy for its existence in law.” – D’Angelo Gore Below is a list of some Republicans who have faulted the president for the sequester: Rep. Martha Roby, Feb. 16: My district is home to Fort Rucker, the primary flight training base for Army Aviation. If the president’s sequester takes effect, Fort Rucker would lose 500 students training to be combat aviators and roughly 37,000 hours of aviation training. Source: Weekly Republican Address Sen. Mitch McConnell, Feb. 13: Take the Obama sequester as just one example. The President had a chance last night to offer a thoughtful alternative to his sequester, one that could reduce spending in a smarter way. That is what Republicans have been calling for all along, and it is the kind of thing the House has already voted to do not once but twice. We want to work with him to actually make that happen. Source: Congressional Record Rep. John Boehner, Feb. 12: We are only weeks away from the devastating consequences of the president’s sequester, and he failed to offer the cuts needed to replace it. Source: Press release Rep. Jeff Miller, Feb. 10: The Administration’s sequestration threatens to reduce our military’s readiness and throw our nation into another recession. Source: Newsletter Rep. Howard McKeon, Feb. 8: Today the White House finally broke their silence on the consequences President Obama’s sequester would have on domestic spending. Source: Press release Rep. Peter Roskam, Feb. 5: The sequester is the president’s sequester.

Qualcomm is at the top of its game and sits triumphantly at the top of the smartphone food chain. It has had a significant lead in LTE and it should preview another round of very competitive products at MWC 2013. But unfortunately for Qualcomm and fortunately for Intel, Qualcomm has an Achilles' heel and that weakness is its dependency on the dwindling number of ARM foundries for state-of-the-art chips. This last year saw headlines such as: Qualcomm Criticizes TSMC for Inability to Make Enough 28nm Qualcomm blames TSMC for chip shortage TSMC Spurns Apple, Qualcomm Bids for Guaranteed Fab Capacity Apple, Qualcomm won't get to hog TSMC chip fab capacity While Qualcomm is now saying that the capacity problem has been essentially solved by getting additional production from Samsung, all is still not well. The fact that Qualcomm essentially only has 2 choices in getting its chip manufactured is an indication of the serious problems in the fabless model as evidenced by shrinking numbers of foundries and shrinking funding for expansion. This problem is simply not going to get any better due to the immense cost of fabs and the R&amp;D needed to support a foundry operation. Second, there continues to be a bottleneck at 28nm. This is the most advanced node available to the ARM world and there will be a lot of demand by many players at this level. Whether 2 foundries can meet this demand is still a significant unknown. A stumble by either foundry would send the ARM world and Qualcomm spinning out of control. And as Apple has found out, it's not such a great situation to have a foundry that also competes against you as Samsung does with its foundry customers. And then there is the fabrication competition. Intel is already at 22nm and will be at 14nm by the end of the year. It's expected that ARM will have 20nm production in a couple of years but it will be a long time in arriving and limited in its improvements as it is planar as opposed to the FinFET technology that Intel has transitioned to. The bottom line is that the entire ARM world including Qualcomm will be substantially at 28nm for several years and Intel will have at least a couple of years with a two process node advantage - their FinFET 14nm going up against ARM's 28nm planar. This is a very serious competitive advantage for Intel and will hamstring Qualcomm as they attempt to maintain market share in face of a competitor who simply will have much superior technology. And finally Intel will have immense manufacturing capacity, making shortages unlikely. Here too the risk is much greater on the Qualcomm side. In conclusion, it appears that Qualcomm's Achilles' heel will make it difficult for them to remain at the top of the smartphone food chain, regardless of their performance in design and micro-architecture.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361754981169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 20:16:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361755141888-44</Id><Topic><Title>Poll of the Day</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361653994286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 16:13:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What ID does author and perennial Intel-basher Dana Blankenhorn post under? 1.) lucy_nuff 2.) tooofunnny 3.) lucifer_nuff 4.) harlan_titusville 5.) mark_this_post 6.) gordon.greco 7.)

The parabolic SAR is a technical indicator that is used by many traders to determine the direction of an asset's momentum and the point in time when this momentum has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions. Sometimes known as the "stop and reversal system", the parabolic SAR was developed by the famous technician Welles Wilder, creator of the relative strength index, and it is shown as a series of dots placed either above or below an asset's price on a chart. (To learn more about Wilder's other indicator, read Getting To Know Oscillators: Relative Strength Index.) One of the most important aspects to keep in mind is that the positioning of the "dots" is used by traders to generate transaction signals depending on where the dot is placed relative to the asset's price. A dot placed below the price is deemed to be a bullish signal, causing traders to expect the momentum to remain in the upward direction. Conversely, a dot placed above the prices is used to illustrate that the bears are in control and that the momentum is likely to remain downward.

As the industry's first 4G technology Intel's WiMAX even enjoyed first mover advantage but it still wasn't enough. The titans of wireless industry that controlled the critical assets and paying customers crushed Intel in the marketplace. And FYI, Intel's plan to monetize people's privacy via the camera has not been addressed. Many journalists that have reviewed Intel's Web TV call it creepy and even New York Time's Walt Mossberg told Intel's Huggers to expect a lot of pushback on that feature. You can be sure that topic is far from over. And furthermore, Intel clearly announced they were not offering "a la carte" programming, though they said they would offer bundles and it would be no cheaper than what consumers are already paying. Well "moving towards the goal" of "a la carte" is NOT a la carte so obviously it is you who is trying to distort the facts.</Msg><Username>mega.hurts</Username><Timestamp>1361766582057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 23:29:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361766980563-66</Id><Topic><Title>Key to Intel's Web TV set-top box is WiDi</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1361575496389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 18:24:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can draw more parallels between your brain and piece of Swiss cheese than you cam between web TV and WiMAX.
