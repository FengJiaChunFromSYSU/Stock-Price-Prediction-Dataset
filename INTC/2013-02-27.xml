An inherernt weakness of RISC is that as the chips become more powerful and increase in complexity they require more power. Much more. RISC chips excel at areas where the task isn't overly complex. In those cases it has a distinct power efficency advantage. They don't scale very well performance wise. ----- I'm not sure where you are getting your RISC/CISC view from, but it's wrong. Did you know that at the heart of every Intel CPU is basically a RISC core? While the A15 may be a power hog compared to previous generations, it's also much more powerful. The A15 is competitive (performance) against low end sandy bridge CPU's (such as the 847) yet it uses much less power doing so.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361952385536</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 03:06:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361964763265-5</Id><Title>Discrete Add-in Graphics Decline 17.3%</Title><Msg>According to a report by Jon Peddie Research.

You could still attempt to put one of these chips in a phone but only one core could go flat out or you could have 4 cores working at about half speed and even then not for a significant length of time.

He thinks Apple is going to need its cash to ride out a "potentially very rough two-year period." He prefers dividends and buybacks because they provide flexibility. Einhorn wants Apple to issued preferred stock that has a perpetual dividend. He has scolded Apple for having a "depression-era mentality" when it comes to cash. He thinks Apple needs to stop hoarding its $137 billion in cash, and start distributing it to shareholders. Misek sees some big issues confronting Apple in the near term that will require lots of cash on hand: Capex is likely to double in the next two years, costing an additional $10 billion a year. He thinks Apple is switching to TSMC for chip making, and it will have to finance much of TSMC's operations to support the output Apple needs. Apple will need cash for iCloud and data centers. An Apple TV could require Apple to pay more for premium content. Apple may have to do financing for iPhones in developing markets. Misek explains, "In the hypothetical scenario where all international iPhones were financed by Apple, we believe Apple's cash balance would take a hit of ~$10B due to the company having to cover upfront manufacturing costs and ~$40B of cash collections would be deferred over the next two years. We believe this could affect international markets where pre-paid is more popular and installment plans are being tested." Improving knock-off phones in China are a threat. We're not sure what to make of this, but Misek says there are "white box" phones that are clones of popular Samsung phones selling for $130-$200. Apple's iPhone costs 4X that. To compete with these phones, he believes Apple will have to do something that could put pressure on the cash. Basically, Misek agrees with Apple's position on cash. He sees a turbulent period in the near term and doesn't think Apple should sign up for anything that gives away cash forever. He thinks Apple either doubles its current plan to $90 billion in dividends and buy backs over the next three years, or keeps its current $45 billion in dividends and buybacks, but does it over the next year and a half.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361976427410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:47:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361976511327-26</Id><Topic><Title>13 INDICATOR INTC Resources BUY/SELL/HOLD REPORT</Title><Username>davidfrost674</Username><Timestamp>1361969282127</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 07:48:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great stuff !!!</Msg><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361976511327</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:48:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361976552829-27</Id><Topic><Title>The TRUTH about Intel Corporation...</Title><Username>wayne.garza</Username><Timestamp>1361975360186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great stuff !!!</Msg><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361976552829</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:49:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361976594066-28</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung abandoning their Exynos (A15) chips for their next Galaxy products could mean exit from SoC design business</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1361935742087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 22:29:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just curious.

Face it, phones and tablets are no more cute little toys they are being asked to do a lot of stuff that desktops have been doing. The ARM design doesn't scale very well. Anytime they try to crank the speed in these things the power usage goes through the roof. They are doing weird things like big little and extra cores to keep the usage reasonable because they can't put a chip in a phone that uses 4-8 watts. The companies that make them hype them by cranking the clock speed up and boast how much work they can do but in a real world situation they have to drop the clock speed to get the usage under control. A15 produces great power but at a cost in battery usage that vendors cannot accept. Their power usage is getting right up their with Haswell and of course Haswell will obliterate an A15.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1361977934358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:12:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361978164315-35</Id><Topic><Title>The TRUTH about Intel Corporation...</Title><Username>wayne.garza</Username><Timestamp>1361975360186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot! useful report</Msg><Username>darwinblake12</Username><Timestamp>1361978164315</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:16:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361978443546-36</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung abandoning their Exynos (A15) chips for their next Galaxy products could mean exit from SoC design business</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1361935742087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 22:29:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Exynos, uses big little design which basically hooks a small chip up with a big one.

These days they prefer the safe, incremental moves rather than the bet the farm Steve Jobs leaps of faith. I expect to see this risk reluctance to come into play in Apple's choice of fabrication partner going forward. When it comes to fabrication, Apple is already in a high-risk situation. Using Samsung means giving business to their prime competitor. A situation that has already led to a parcel of lawsuits. Using TSMC means exposure to a foundry that struggled with ramping 28nm and that won't have 20nm production soon enough to demonstrate reliability in the face of Apple's huge demand. To insure the presence of a reliable supplier with state-of-the-art technology and a roadmap reaching far enough into the future to justify the enormous costs of changing fabs, there is only one low risk choice. And that is Intel. This reluctance to take excessive risk is the reason I believe that we will see Apple strike a deal with Intel in the next 12 months.

Intel has done this over the last 40 years and managed to stay ahead. Apple had to design its own chips because low power ones were not available from Intel. There is no logical reason to continue on this path once Intel addresses this issue and is able to provide good SoCs with a good innovation cadence - which Intel has demonstrated over a long period of time. Apple's strength is software. It had to get into designing chips. Getting into fabs is moving well out of its area of expertise. If Apple were to do this, I would see its stock plummeting to $100 or lower...and eventually waste away as a company.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1361985512302</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 12:18:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361985684827-69</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will have to finance TSMC's operations</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361976427410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:47:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It would not give them access to the latest processes but it would allow them to tune the fabs to build the parts they want.

Take that, Warren, the tipping point has been reached...] Our phones are the fastest Fashion bag maker, Intel is talking itself up so much at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that most of its announcements have to be made from the base of the Columbus statue in Tibidabo. While Intel has barely got its foot in the door of the mobile chip business it is already claiming to be the biggest and the best. Mike Bell, Intel's mobile chief has been telling anyone who will listen that comparing his company’s chips to anything ARM designs is like comparing a lightly greased leopard to a three-toed sloth. Intel’s cunning plan to become the leader in mobile, he said, was build the best chips. If you suspect that Intel might not be the best, then Bell has shedloads of benchmarks that will prove it to you. Against the top-of-the-line ARM chips, Intel says its mobile processors win hands down. He also adds that since Intel has its own fabs with the latest in manufacturing processes it can bring new technologies to market faster. ARM has to design the chip core and then hand it to its licensees who then have to play around with it and then take their designs to a fab for construction. Bell seems to be implying that ARM and by extension AMD is too slow and can be out-evolved by Intel. According to CNN he said that to be successful in the industry, simply building chips is insufficient. Intel can write software that helps us get the most out of our hardware, he said. Intel can also make some nice fashion bags to go with your choice he didn’t add. Even though Intel's mobile chips don't yet have multiple cores, while ARM has more than you can point a stick at, the speed tests aren't even that close. Bell claimed that it was like having a jet engine or two propellers. Clearly he has never tried to fly a plane with only one jet engine, if you don’t tip over you end up flying in circles. Mobile chip designs are getting smaller and smaller and will halve their size down to 14 nanometers and it is going to be difficult for many less-experienced companies using ARM's platform to manufacture something like that, Bell said. Bell is an import from Apple and one of his jobs is to make sure that hardware and software work well together. Jobs’ Mob chips may not be the best but they tend to work better with software than most things Andriodish. Bell that with Intel’s relationship with Google it can do a good a job optimising its systems as anyone, and Google has never told Intel 'no' when it asked to improve performance somewhere, he claimed. Intel believes that its fortunes will change with the release of its new 22 nm mobile chip design this autumn, which will incorporate 4G-LTE capabilities.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361997681061</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 15:41:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361997706728-98</Id><Topic><Title>Answer: Altera</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361997357822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 15:35:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Announcement of Cisco deal sends us on a path to 25.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361997706728</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 15:41:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361997879623-99</Id><Topic><Title>Intel goes hard sell in Barcelona</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361997681061</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 15:41:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This can be looked at as good or bad, since he didn't talk smack about power consumption.......</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361997879623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 15:44:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361998003570-100</Id><Topic><Title>Intel should be at least 21.50 to 22 today - way undervalued</Title><Username>harrydick836</Username><Timestamp>1361986623972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 12:37:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>31.00, yeah, right, and geese should lay golden eggs ____________ You sound pretty stupid saying this, since you are the moron who said the chances of Intel going to 24 were ZERO for a LONG TIME........right before it went to 29 in mere months.

Looks like the Altera new really shook some people up. Those who just assumed nothing was happening while really big deals were being developed behind closed doors....] Since Intel has opened up its fabs to other fabless IC firms, the Silicon Valley giant will pose a threat to TSMC at some point when it comes to high-volume orders, including future chip orders from Apple. TSMC will no longer be the sole supplier of Altera-designed chips. The FPGA vendor has announced plans to use Intel's 14nm FinFET process technology for the manufacture of its next-generation, high-performance product series. There is no doubt about Intel's manufacturing leadership, said Digitimes Research analyst Nobunaga Chai, when asked to comment on the just-announced partnership between Altera and Intel. Intel remains ahead of TSMC by 1-2 generations in technology, Chai added. Using Intel's 14m FinFET process will bring Altera's next-generation products more competitiveness against their counterparts provided by Xilinx, in terms of performance, Chai believes. However, making FPGAs is a lot different from producing application processors for mobile devices, Chai noted. The architecture of a FPGA does yield a high throughput while that of an AP doesn't, Chai continued. In other words, grabbing future chip orders from Altera should not be associated with a greater chance for Intel to land foundry orders for Apple's mobile devices, Chai said. From the lessons of cooperation with Samsung Electronics, Apple should find a number of reasons not to work with an IDM especially when the architecture it provides deliver better performance and power savings than that provided by the foundry partner, Chai pointed out. Nevertheless, another scenario is that Apple transitions its iPhones and iPads away from the ARM SoCs if Intel is able to provide more competitive solutions for mobile devices, Chai said. Intel can also utilize and extend further its relationship with memory chipmaker Micron Technology so that it stands a better chance of grabbing future chip orders from Apple, Chai suggested. The capability of manufacturing a single-chip integrated logic and memory device through 3D chip-stacking technology will be a competitive edge for Intel to win an Apple contract, Chai said.

Chai said previously that TSMC with its 20nm SoC process would most likely secure its first chip orders from Apple, and the foundry's 16nm FinFET process would play a key role in Apple's "breakthrough" product.technology.

It is not a big secret that Apple wants to develop their own chips. It is doubtful that they would want to continue to pay royalties for ARM and have the kind of restriction on them that using ARM creates. It just isn't Apples style. They will probably lease space at a fab and design their own chips at some point. I don't think Intel will cooperate with this since Apple is a big player in the mobile space and Intel does not want to help them out.

Good things come in threes. Should we keep our eyes out for another announcement involving Intel some time soon?"] On February 25th, 2012, Altera and Intel announced an agreement to build next-generation, high performance FPGAs on Intel’s 14nm Tri-Gate technology. This is significant because Altera has used TSMC as their sole foundry for years. Altera has never before been swayed by price or lured away by the promise of technology. But, as the saying goes, “never say never”. As of today Altera has two foundry relationships. This announcement comes less than a week after Achronix announced the successful rollout of their Speedster 22i which is being built using Intel’s 22nm Tri-Gate technology. Achronix used TSMC for their 65nm and 40nm product development. It was somewhat of a risk, but Achronix left the TSMC technology track at 40nm, skipped 32/28nm and went straight to Intel for their 22nm Tri-Gate technology. Was Altera watching in envy? During TSMC’s Q4 2012 financial conference call, Morris Chang, TSMC’s CEO, was asked at what technology node and for which end markets does TSMC view Intel as becoming a more fierce competitor? Morris Chang is not new to this business. He stated that he already viewed Intel as a fierce competitor. Altera isn’t TSMC’s biggest customer. And of course, this was an announcement to build product. We still have to wait and see how long it takes for a product to actually rollout. But from a marketing standpoint, this is a big coup for Intel. As I mentioned in my analysis in the February Semico IPI Report and in a blog on SemiMD, the big foundries have to go after the big volume customers because the fabs have to be filled. Intel has the luxury of concentrating on a few small volume customers since it can use its own products to test the technology and fill its fabs. What’s the saying? Good things come in threes. Should we keep our eyes out for another announcement involving Intel some time soon?

The foundry trades at a premium despite lower GM and higher capital intensity," the analyst added.] [Yeah, for those badmouthing these deals, just imagine Intel's stock moving up by a factor of three...] Intel Corporation has a high volume foundry customer in Altera Corporation , which announced that it would manufacture future FPGAs on Intel's 14-nanometer (nm) tri-gate process with initial shipments in 2014. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed after manufacturing. Instead of being restricted to any predetermined hardware function, an FPGA allows the end customer to program product features and functions, adapt to new standards, and reconfigure hardware for specific applications even after the product has been installed in the field—hence the name "field-programmable". The latest deal could be a game-changer for Intel and could position the chip giant to add more foundry customers in the future as it becomes the primary supplier of high performance logic where cost is less of a concern. These next-generation products, which target ultra high-performance systems for military, wireline communications, cloud networking, and compute and storage applications will enable breakthrough levels of performance and power efficiencies not otherwise possible. Intel has been transitioning to 22-nm process from 32-nm. Now, the 14-nm is a more advanced manufacturing process and is in the development stage. The move indicates the company's strategy shift and increasing focus on foundry business, which has been in the back burner as Intel predominantly made its own chips rather than making them for others. "We view this announcement as significant because it is a 3rd party validation of Intel's manufacturing leadership," Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore wrote in a note to clients. Although FPGA volumes are relatively small compared to GPUs and application processors, they demand the highest performance and drive much higher revenue per wafer. This announcement represents a significant departure for Altera and access to Intel's process technology will give the company a significant first mover advantage. This process technology advantage should help Intel make gains in foundry services and perhaps more significantly in mobile devices. "The company (Intel) has long maintained its process technology leadership would translate to success in the market, and this is the first point of proof," Seymore noted. Moreover, the deal would help Intel to diversify its revenue stream and may offset lower revenue from PC chips as the PC sales are weak due to demand shift to smartphones and tablets. In addition, valuation gap for Intel with foundry should narrow with the latest deal and initial revenue will come in 2015, while the strategic benefits to Altera and Intel should become clearer in 2013. "We note the leading foundry trades at ~6x sales compared to Intel at less than 2x sales. The foundry trades at a premium despite lower GM and higher capital intensity," the analyst added.

Under a new arrangement, Intel will manufacture processors designed by Cisco, the largest maker of routers and switches. Intel Corp. (INTC) has signed Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) as a customer for made-to-order networking chips, landing the biggest customer yet for its fledgling foundry business, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Under the arrangement, Intel will manufacture processors designed by Cisco, the largest maker of routers and switches, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal is private. Cisco is already a buyer of chips that are designed and manufactured by Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker. The new orders represent a vote of confidence in Intel’s effort to expand into the $30.7 billion market for making processors according to other companies’ specifications. If successful, Intel’s push would step up pressure on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330), the top producer of made-to-order chips. “One thing that Intel knows how to do well is manufacturing; they are the best in the world at that,” Daniel Amir, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, said in an interview. “They are ahead of TSMC.” Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Intel, declined to comment. “Cisco has a long-standing relationship with Intel,” said Karen Tillman, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California-based Cisco. “The company is one of several strategic suppliers of silicon to Cisco. However, Cisco does not comment on the specifics of its relationship with suppliers.” Becoming a contract manufacturer is one way Intel might seek to offset a slump in its main personal computer chip business, as consumers put off PC purchases in favor of smartphones and tablets. Intel, which reports fourth-quarter earnings later today, has reported profit declines as it slows down plants to burn off stockpiles of unused chips. “Given that their growth is slowing down, they’ll have this capacity that could be available for other uses,” Amir said. The only companies that have announced plans to hire Intel to make products they design are Tabula Inc., Achronix Semiconductor Corp. and Netronome Systems Inc., three small designers of programmable logic and networking chips, Mulloy said. Intel’s management has faced questions from analysts about whether it would be better to make chips based on other companies’ designs, rather than keep trying to sell its own designs for new markets, such as smartphones, where it has largely failed to win orders. Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini has described Intel’s interest in the foundry industry as being at the first stage in a “crawl, walk, run” progression, according to Mulloy.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362015622532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 20:40:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362016276172-134</Id><Topic><Title>Exclusive: Qualcomm-Powered Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-i9500 Performance Revealed</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362013835304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 20:10:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"wallisweaver, why do you even bother responding to this individual?"

According to the world’s largest chipmaker, the code-named "Bay Trail" platform, scheduled to be available for holiday 2013, is already up and running on Microsoft Windows and Google Android and will help enable new experiences in designs as thin as 8mm that have all-day battery life and weeks of standby. In a bid to significantly improve performance of its entry-level offerings, Intel is expected to boost general-purpose x86 performance of quad-core Valleyview chip by up to 50% - 100% compared to currently available Atom solutions. More importantly, Valleyview will integrate seventh-generation Intel graphics core, which is projected to be up to three times faster than existing graphics technology inside Atom chips. In addition, the world’s largest chipmaker intends to integrate various technologies that improve user experience and enhance security into the Bay Trail platform, according to slides published earlier this year unofficially. Intel did not comment on actual features of ValleyView.

Correia February 27, 2013 4:03 PM ET Intel (NSDQ:INTC) is going all-in on embedded Linux development. The company this week released the Intel System Studio, an all-new development suite that includes profilers, debuggers, code analysis tools and optimized compilers for Linux apps destined for hardware built with Intel-based SoCs as well as the company's Atom, Core and Xeon processors. The news came at the annual Embedded World in Nuremberg, Germany. Starting at $3,499-per-seat, the Linux-hosted toolkit is designed to accelerate development, testing and optimization of embedded and mobile-device applications, according to the company. The suite includes the Intel VTune Amplifier, JTAG Debugger, Intel Inspector and Intel C/C++ compilers, plus the GNU Debugger (GDB) along with Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives algorithmic building blocks for media and data apps and Math Kernel Library packages for performing highly vectorized and threaded linear algebra, Fast Fourier transformations and statistics functions. Also included is Intel Cilk Plus extensions for C and C++ that optimize code for multi-threaded applications and parallel systems. [Related: Intel, SAP Make Big Data Play Behind Hadoop] The key to its appeal for embedded systems developers -- whose power optimization and efficiency concerns are often paramount -- is Intel VTune Amplifier profiling tools. These let developers look deeply into SoC events to analyze CPU and GPU activities related to power and performance. A power profiler identifies causes of wake-up, application-triggered timers and other events that can lead to power loss. And, the performance profiler identifies hardware events with call stacks and helps find hotspots in small functions. The low-overhead tool requires no code instrumentation, and results are shown in source code or assembly language. Intel VTune Click for full-sized view. Getting even closer to the hardware are the Intel JTAG Debugger and GDB Debugger modules, which can display register descriptions of the CPU, SoC and chipsets. And a software event tracing framework also provides source-level debugging of the Linux kernel BIOS, UEFI, firmware and system drivers. The Intel Inspector module is a static and dynamic code analyzer that can pinpoint memory and threading defects; memory leaks and invalid access; and code that can result in data races and deadlock conditions. The tool also supports remote connections and debugger breakpoints, and it can break on selected errors. Intel System Studio has been tested on Fedora versions 14 through 18, openSUSE 12.1, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 (SP4) and 11 (SP2), and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 LTS. For developers using the open-source Eclipse CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling), Intel says the suite's compiler, debuggers and libraries will integrate naturally, and in some cases it will install automatically. Tested target systems include Fedora 14, Wind River Linux 5, Yacoto Project 1.2 and 1.3 and other Linux distributions that support the real-time scheduler and use kernel 2.6.2 and 3.x.x (up to 3.3.x). Intel System Studio is available now and sells for $3,499 for a single-user seat, or $5,299 per user for a floating license. In addition to support for all platforms using Intel Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 and Intel Xeon processors, the tools also support Intel Atom D2xxx, N2xxx, D5xxx, D4xx, E6xx, N4xx, N3xx, N2xx, Z5xx and CExxx series processors.

Endgadget Americans wanting a Galaxy Note 10.1 LTE of their own have largely been biding their time for a Verizon model. They're still waiting for that variant to show, but US Cellular isn't -- it just started shipping its own variant of the 4G tablet. From all indications, the slate is largely a branding swap that's adapted to the carrier's network, which is good news for prospective buyers who aren't dead set on Big Red. Pricing might give at least some customers pause, however. US Cellular's Note 10.1 LTE costs $500 only when it's paired with at least a 2GB data plan, and $800 no strings attached. With that kind of outlay, you'll want to be fully committed to the concept of pen-based computing before picking one up.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362019921737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 21:52:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362022117571-139</Id><Title>Surface Pro getting rave reviews on Best Buy site from Business users</Title><Msg>Here's just one review, posted on 2/24. Ease of Use 5.0 out of 5 5.0 Features 5.0 out of 5 5.0 Screen Quality 5.0 out of 5 5.0 Value for Price 5.0 out of 5 5.0 I am a tablet frenzy. I have androids, IOS, webOS tablets. Then I bought this tablet. And it beats all the above tablets. As a matter of fact I should not compare Surface Pro with other tablets in the market because they don't provide full operating system but Surface pro has full operating system. I am writing this review on Surface pro and it is very easy to write on it. Pro is fluid, fast with brilliant display. I am also happy with the battery as well considering it has i5 processor. HD display is crisp. Kick stand provides excellent viewing angles. Run full adobe flash. Adobe has stopped supporting flash in tablets but since pro has full OS thus you can play flash material in desktop mode. On screen keyboard has very nice sound and extremely easy to type. I have put aside my other tablets since I got this one. Now other tablets looks hassle to use or maybe use as toys. Windows 8 and Surface pro is the best combination at this moment in the tablet in my opinion. I have no regret buying this.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022117571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:28:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362022520726-140</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro getting rave reviews on Best Buy site from Business users</Title><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022117571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:28:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's a review from Amazon: This review is from: Microsoft Surface Pro Windows 8 Pro 128 Gb Tablet (Personal Computers) I picked one up last weekend. It is a full blown computer in tablet format. I have had other tablets but they were so limited, this one is not. Be aware that the storage space is better than some of the Apple Centric reviewers say. Included in the drive is a full copy of Office 2013. You do have to buy a license but it is already on the drive. Also there is a full back up image. The battery life is a little low for a tablet, I am getting about 5 1/2 hours but that is of constant use. The screen resolution is amazing, I think better than the iPad which is also excellent resolution. So far there is nothing that it will not do. It is not a high powered desktop replacement but when I am out of my office it does everything I ask. My notebook now sits on my nightstand and is used there. I carry the Surface Pro everywhere. The prices quoted here on Amazon are very high, check the retail price before you pay a premium. The Microsoft store I went to last weekend sold out a pile of them (literally a pyramid) in about three hours but they say that more are on the way. If you want a no compromise tablet that will not make you miss having a real computer with you I highly recommend this unit.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022520726</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:35:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362022553111-141</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro getting rave reviews on Best Buy site from Business users</Title><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022117571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:28:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The Microsoft store I went to last weekend sold out a pile of them (literally a pyramid) in about three hours but they say that more are on the way."</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022553111</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:35:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362022867849-142</Id><Title>Recurring theme amongst Surface Pro users: Blows Ipad out of the water</Title><Msg>By wallyj (NY USA) - See all my reviews This review is from: Microsoft Surface Pro Windows 8 Pro 128 Gb Tablet (Personal Computers) OK. So here it goes. All the critics out there that are dissing the new Surface Pro can complain all they want. Because all I need to say is I got one and they don't!! Any one that doesn't have one can comment all they want about how bad Microsoft is, and how they are playing catchup to Apple. But let me tell you this... There is nothing that this Surface Pro can't do better and faster than ANYTHING that Apple, Linux, Unix, Blackberry, Android has to offer. Just imagine... The most powerful practical portable device ever. Because it is a Windows 8 operating system, I set up an SIP softphone, an FTP server, two Oracle Virtual Box systems running a Windows 2008r2 and SUSE. Anyone that is complaining about space, I dumped an extra 64GB microSD chip to handle the extra load. I can print to every shared printer on my network, run my Quickbooks and Skype all while I watch the new "Lincoln" on JustinTV. Tell me... What tablet can do that? I took all my notes this morning by writing in OneNote. Not typing, but writing! I did most of my Google searches with voice commands, just because I could. Believe me, a new era has arrived in computing. The desktop and laptops are going to go away. Because if this is what the future has in store for us, why do we need a desktop any longer? Let me tell you that the Surface Pro has raised the bar on all future products. Anything less than this will be, well, less. I can see future products, by other companies like ACER, ASUS, SAMSUNG etc. making faster products with greater battery life, smaller screens, lighter weight, more memory, with 4g. But what they will have as the backbone is Windows 8. And folks, that is where good `ol Microsoft will reign again. Because let's face it. Apple is a hardware company. And until they make their software that can come close to what Windows 8 can do, who is going to want just an old iPad IOS 6 or anything running an OS X Mountain Lion? It'll be years before Linux will catch up to the touch interface that Windows 8 has. Google will have to go back to the drawing board with their Chromebook. And their Android... could it ever dream of running MySQL or SQL Server express? The world has been waiting for the most powerful portable device that is not a laptop. And it has got it with the Surface Pro.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022867849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:41:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362022920366-143</Id><Title>Surface RT @ getanid61</Title><Msg>ROFLMAO!</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022920366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:42:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362023596294-144</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro getting rave reviews on Best Buy site from Business users</Title><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362022117571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:28:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This guy on Amazon says it's the best product he ever bought. I have been using Windows 8 for several months on my desktop and liked it with some qualifications, but now that I have been using the Surface Pro for about 2 days now( purchased from the Microsoft site), it is apparent what a great OS it is. Windows 8 is incredibly snappy on the Surface ( benchmarking about 5 times faster than the newest iPad). The surface configured itself by syncing with my desktop, very cool! Apps work fine with a mouse, but on the touch screen they really shine. The device itself has a great feel to it, you can tell an incredible amount of thought went into the smallest detail. I can't remember buying any product of any kind that I have been more pleased with, it far exceeded my high expectations.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362023596294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:53:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362025577607-145</Id><Title>Apple shares slip more after Cook speech</Title><Msg>Number of the day: 37 percent That's how much Apple shares have fallen since setting a record high of $702.10 on Sept. 19. They slipped again on Wednesday after CEO Tim Cook, speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, offered no fresh insight on what he'll do with Apple's $137.1 billion in cash and investments. Cook is under pressure to compensate shareholders who have lost more than a third of their investment in the past five months. [Wow, 37 percent!!! Apple desperately needs to bust a move and a strengthened partnership with Intel appears to be one of the few good moves available to Tim Cook. The shareholder's meeting seems like it would have been a good place to have announced something but Time gave them nothing. Is he just keeping quiet because they are close to something big? Dunno. But if he announced a big deal with TSMC right after Intel announced Achronix and Altera, I think he might get tarred and feathered the same day.
