"The differences between the various FinFET processes available from the foundries today are significant enough that we have to start over [with IP development] each time," he said. "Also, most FinFET processes and design kits are still in the development phase, adding to the effort," he added. FinFETs “will drive a complete re-evaluation of your architecture--how you separate out devices and optimize them—it’s a big change,” Campbell said.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364530171189</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 00:09:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364532292613-2</Id><Title>Apple, now what?</Title><Msg>Right after Steve Jobs died I spelled it out. I said that Apple won't ever have another Steve Jobs again and their stock would drop because without a new innovation every two years there is nothing to propel it's sales year after year. As bad as things look today things could be worse had they not introduce the iPad mini. Let's see, at the time the stock was racing to $700 someone came on here and did us all a public service and mentioned we should get out of Intel and buy Apple because it was going to $1000 and then $1500. I mentioned that when the stock dips below $460 it would have lost 20% of it's value. The problem was that it shot up to $700 after I said that and is now below $460. What this means it that Apple is on it's way to losing not 20% but 40% of it's value. I won't say that Apple has "no choice but to work with Intel." But when you peddle less than cutting edge technology with fancy advertising it only gets them so far. . If Apple can't innovate with new products they can at the very least make certain that what they sell is compelling and current. ARMH helped get them this far, but as new capacity from Intel comes online can they afford to be one or 2 nodes behind with ARM? Hardware does matter, and they really need to think about where they've been and where they are going. If they are going to be a one OS house like they say they're going to be when, and who with? Working with Intel they've made Thurderbolt Apple and Intel seem to play nicely together. Intel will have capacity to fill with new lines and Apple has a need for more compelling hardware. Intel will eventually fill it's capacity left to it's own devices. The question for Apple is what happens if they let this opportunity go and Intel rips through the low power market with the help of Apple's competitors? Apple has a position of strength in the phone market, but so did RIM. In a few years everything can change.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364532292613</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 00:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364532340808-3</Id><Topic><Title>Lilliput Slays Gulliver: ARM Vs Intel, And Why Intel Lost The War</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364524812986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:40:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Mr Head in the Sand aka semi_junkie How clever of you... presenting the obvious as if it was novel &amp; new...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364532340808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 00:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364532548530-4</Id><Topic><Title>Lilliput Slays Gulliver: ARM Vs Intel, And Why Intel Lost The War</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364524812986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:40:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364532548530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 00:49:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364533137688-5</Id><Topic><Title>Lilliput Slays Gulliver: ARM Vs Intel, And Why Intel Lost The War</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364524812986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:40:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What part isn't getting through?

Tilera officials said they are looking to build on that momentum with the release of their third-generation processors, which offer significant enhancements, including 64-bit computing capabilities, and will be built on a 40-nanometer manufacturing process, rather than the 90nm process of the company's previous offerings. Along with the chips, Tilera also is offering three evaluation systems in multiple form factors that include 1U (1.5-inch) servers and a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) card, which holds a 16- or 36-core chip. The appliances will offer either a single 36-core processor or four 36-core chips, for a total of 144 cores. More boards and systems will be coming from Tilera partners later in the year, the company said. Tilera, which has the financial backing of such companies as Cisco Systems, Quanta and Samsung Ventures, first made headlines in 2009, when officials talked of 100-core chips and the way the chips are organized in a highly parallelized mesh fashion with a large number of interconnects between the cores. The goal is to create chips that offer high performance and low power consumption, which is important to companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which are building densely populated data centers and are interested in keeping their costs down. To date, Tilera has released 16-, 32- and 64-core chips. Doud said that the 64-core third-generation processor, as well as the first 100-core chip, would be released at the end of 2012. According to a report in Wired, as many as 200 cores could be featured on chips in 2013, when Tilera rolls out its upcoming "Stratton" line.

It is sort of ike the liberals controlling the main stream media. One needs to vent the truth. ARM.s sigular advantage is that ARM provides the only CPU's that everyone can use in their increasingly integrated product designs. If someone wants to design a CPU part they have no choice. ANYone with any capability like Apple and QUalcom will actually desing their own CPU's using only the instruction set. ARM has historically also been low power only because the they have provided low performance CPU's. Power goes up exponentially with performance. You can not fairly compare powerformance per watt at differnet performance levels. Also Computers are used at the user request while phones must ring 24 hours a day. This imposes different reuirement that Intel had to design to. Intel has an enormous manufacturing advantage. Don't you think a 50% power advantage and 50 cost advantage will make a differene in the market? What is the problem with Smasungs big/little anyway. Seems to be some problems there. Pretty stupid design compared to Intel standards Intel will better control dynamic voltage and frequency in future chips and better optimize performcnce and power without having to have two different CPU's Intel can always cluster a number of Atom's on the same ring as their high end CPU's if they need more parrel performance like with their GPU's</Msg><Username>johnnelson1205</Username><Timestamp>1364570323438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 11:18:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364571255578-33</Id><Topic><Title>Why a Massive Apple, Intel (TV) Partnership Makes Sense</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364502810337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:33:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC &amp; many other highly successful companies wouldn't be where they are today without taking calculated risks,you wouldn'd be an INTC financial board shut in Troll if that was the case.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364571255578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 11:34:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364571730960-34</Id><Topic><Title>Tilera Challenges Intel, ARM With 16-, 36, 72-Core Server Chips</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364569156806</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 10:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're recommending a strong sell, yet under your "aladiesright" alias, you claim to be holding Jan 14 call options.

Not much real benfit to using advanced geometry." Not true - in particular for Intel TriGate - google it - Bohr trigate analog 22 nm SoC Myth #1: The economics of analog integration don’t add up Analog circuitry does not scale in the same way as digital circuitry. The performance requirements for analog blocks, especially in terms of linearity, mean the function is easier to implement using thick oxide devices at I/O supply level. As this type of device has not changed in many generations, the total area of the analog block that uses it is also more or less constant. In this case, the myth is that the relative portion of the real estate allocated for the same function in new process technologies keeps increasing, and therefore the cost also increases to a point where integrating the analog function is no longer justified. Advances in analog circuit techniques disprove this myth. For example, digitally assisted analog architectures, digitally calibrated architectures, and other dithering and randomization techniques can, through digital processing, eliminate most of the non-idealities inherent to deep-submicron devices. This simplifies the circuit, making it more robust and increasing performance while using only thin-oxide devices. By reducing analog complexity and taking full advantage of process characteristics, the economics of integration are positive to analog block integration. Most designers find that integrating these blocks end up improving their competitive position in the market.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364571850035</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 11:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364572248185-36</Id><Topic><Title>Tilera Challenges Intel, ARM With 16-, 36, 72-Core Server Chips</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364569156806</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 10:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Tilera 16- and 36 core server chips were announce Jan 2012.

Doud said that the 64-core third-generation processor, as well as the first 100-core chip, would be released at the end of 2012. According to a report in Wired, as many as 200 cores could be featured on chips in 2013, when Tilera rolls out its upcoming "Stratton" line. The company has seen a "staggering amount of demand" for the 16- and 36-core chips, he said. Tilera is working with 80 customers and has 20 design wins, including with the likes of Harmonic and Mercury Computer Systems.

The new driver is said to balance CPU and GPU utlization to improve performance up to 10 percent while lowering power simultaneously. It also adds support for the OpenCL 1.2 API and fixes a bunch of bugs.

They want to dump their shares on you. [March 29, 2013] Intel activity slows in Arizona amid slack demand Mar 28, 2013 (The Oregonian - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- Even as Intel ramps up construction in Hillsboro, the pace of work seems to be easing at its factories in Arizona. That could suggest that demand for Intel's chips continues to ebb. The company has slowed the installation of production tools at its nearly complete, $5 billion Fab 42 near Phoenix (a fab is the industry's term for a chip factory), according to Intel suppliers and contractors in Oregon. These personnel, who asked not to be identified because of their relationship with Intel, say some tools appear to be idle in Arizona. Other tools have been redirected to the new D1X research fab in Hillsboro, which opens its first, $3 billion phase late this year. When Intel announced plans to build Fab 42 two years ago, it said the Arizona facility would be complete in 2013. That's still the timeline, according to corporate spokesman Chuck Mulloy -- but he wouldn't say when the facility will begin making high volumes of chips. "Fab 42, the construction will be completed this year," Mulloy said. "We'll talk more about production later." Intel revenues were down slightly last year, and industry observers expect 2013 will be another flat year for PC sales, the core of Intel's business. "Intel's not using its fab capacity. They have so much more fab capacity than they need right now," said Jim McGregor, president and principal analyst at TIRIAS Research in Arizona.</Msg><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364588369401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 16:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364590686969-65</Id><Topic><Title>Fab 42 not looking good, not looking good AT ALL</Title><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364588369401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 16:19:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How much do you think the Fab42 work has slowed? Do you know how many suppliers and contractors COMTEX surveyed to arrive at their conclusion? Fab42 and D1X are both 14nm and Fab42 will be Intel's 450nm fab. The 22nm Trigate ramp and wafer yields were above expectations. Do you think there is the possiblity that Intel is getting higher than planned yields on 14nm test runs and might be redirecting Fab42 directly to 450nm? There are other reasons that "suppliers and contractors" might be taken out of the loop and not know what was happening.

Intel is a master at managing excess capacity. So, sure they would slow things down a bit until the capacity can be used. This is such a normal thing for an analyst to take a good thing and mistake it for a bad thing. It's why these people are analysts and not running companies. 2.) So, I wonder if this brilliant analyst thought the Altera deal was a good thing. Because they got that deal because of excess capacity - which he says is a bad thing. And then he would also conclude that getting more lucrative, profitable deals would also be a bad thing. 3.) The analyst community continues to be totally brain dead, just like the person who originated this post. The trends are clear, even at this point. Intel's excess capacity is in demand and will be utilized. Intel is taking its time in choosing who to serve, just as it should. And these are extremely complex deals. The simpleton analysts and shills think if these things don't materialize overnight that there is a problem. There is but it's not with Intel. 4.) Even as Intel moves closer and closer to completion of a winning strategy, the know-nothing analysts fail to be able to get their minds around it and deny every step forward (like the Altera deal) as being a step forward. 5.) You still never, ever hear the analysts in any comprehensive review of fabrication and the implications of ARM not having FinFET now or for years. Or the implications of ARM being stuck at 28nm for years and years as Intel moves to 14, 10 and 7nm production. 6.) Analysts are still stuck on the PC is dead and Intel has no mobility share. They are unable to connect the dots: Haswell, Bay Trail, Airmont and have no idea how the waves of Intel progress will affect the market place. They are just not smart or educated people. They are people who do a tiny bit of due diligence - just enough to come up with an off the cuff, harebrained synopsis. And then they all go huddle together in a mutual admiration fest.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364594303261</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 17:58:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364594669172-69</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364415752381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 16:22:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, you've created yet another ID with my name in it.

Eventually all older fabs are shut and replaced by newer ones. Could that be what is planned. Fab 12 was built in 1996. Wikipedia shows it as 300mm wafer size, and 65 nm process node. Fab 32 was built in 2007. Wikipedia shows it as 300MM wafer size, and 45/32/22 nm. Fab 42 will be complete in the 2nd half of 2013 according to Intel Website. Zero outside jobs posted for manufacturing positions in Arizona. Looks like it's a normal close the 17 year old fab 65 nm and allow the people to transfer to the brand new 14 nm Fab over time. Frankly 65 nm is pretty old tech for Intel.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364595735561</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:22:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364596170413-74</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL IS CORNERED BY ARM &amp; IMAGINATION TECHNOLOGIES: Single digits in 2014</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364569076600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 10:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The long-expected demise of optical lithography for manufacturing ICs has been delayed again, even though the technology itself has reached a plateau with a numerical aperture of 1.35 and an exposure wavelength of 193nm. Immersion lithography is planned for the 20/22nm node, and with the continued delay of EUV, is now the plan of record for 14nm. How is it possible to use 193nm wavelength light at 14nm? How can we provide the process window to pattern such tight pitches? The secret lies in computational lithography. For 20nm, the two key innovations in computational lithography involve enabling double patterning with concurrent OPC, and in improving difficult-to-print layouts with localized in-situ optimization and by using an inverse lithography technique. For 14nm, computational lithography offers more tools for process window enhancement with better approaches to sub-resolution assist features (SRAFs). SRAFs have been used since the 130nm node for resolution enhancement, but for 14nm, SRAF placement has evolved considerably. SRAFs placement has traditionally been based on a set of defined rules, which has given excellent coverage for line-space layouts and moderately good coverage for complex 2D layouts, along with fast runtime. However, the final SRAF coverage is highly dependent on the OPC recipe that the user is able to tune. Setting up these highly tuned recipes for 2D layouts can be time consuming, and also inadequate on very complex 2D layouts, leading to catastrophic failures in certain locations. The complexity of developing a well-tuned SRAF rules recipe since the introduction of pixelated sources and the introduction of more sophisticated contact and via layouts has driven lithographers away from rules-based solutions and towards model-based approaches. Two distinct model-based approaches have developed: inverse lithography (ILT)-assisted and model-based. In the ILT-assisted approach, you use inverse lithography analysis to create a golden reference for a rules-based SRAF placement. ILT provides the ultimate lithography entitlement, but may not be practical to deploy in manufacturing because of increased mask cost and runtime. So, you use ILT only to find the best rules, and then let a rules-based SRAF tool do the actual placement. This gives superior process window for critical blocks like SRAM where the rules are relatively easy to develop. The second approach is a true model-based approach, where a model is used to determine which areas on mask would benefit most from SRAFS and also to perform the initial SRAF placement. The model-based SRAF optimization reduces dependence on rules generation and improves SRAF placement. Model-based SRAFs can provide a process window that is comparable to that provided by ILT tools, but with much lower mask cost and runtime. The model-based approach is particularly useful for random logic designs, where developing rules continues to be challenging. Figure 1 shows a wafer validation done by IMEC, which shows that the process window obtained using model-based SRAFs and dense OPC was the same as obtained by using an ILT tool. Given that both the ILT-assisted, rule-based approach and the model-based methods are good, but for different design styles, what if you could combine them easily into a hybrid approach? A hybrid approach combining the best of both solutions provides a single, unified SRAF recipe for SRAM (rules-based) and random logic designs (model-based). This is one of the secrets to 14nm computational lithography: advanced SRAF solutions that provide flexibility, control runtime, and leverage both rules-based and model-based approaches for the most challenging layouts.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364596170413</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:29:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364598164126-75</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL IS CORNERED BY ARM &amp; IMAGINATION TECHNOLOGIES: Single digits in 2014</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364569076600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 10:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is appropriate to give credit to the author when you copy their work.

It would allow design firms like Qualcomm to save themselves the capital expense of a foundry, and have more options for managing their supply chain. When the semiconductor industry began moving towards ARM's architecture, it was an extension of this logic. ARM could avoid a huge R&amp;D burden by simply licensing its design, while clients like Qualcomm would benefit from a more competitive field, with one less barrier to entry. Breaking up the industry in this way meant less revenue for each company, but also a diversification of risk, and more flexibility. Companies could focus on what they did best, and problems at one manufacturer, or the failure of a single system-on-a-chip (SoC), wouldn't sink the whole ship. So the theory went. Today, fabless designers are the norm, and ARM's designs are ubiquitous in smartphones and tablets -- but instead of diversification we've seen consolidation. Qualcomm alone controls half of the smartphone SoC market, with Nvidia in an entrenched second place. Smaller competitors like Texas Instruments have been forced out. The idea of an open and diverse industry has given way to the hard reality of foundry retooling costs, and the inability of smaller chip designers to command timely and affordable manufacturing services. The industry is no less aristocratic now than it was 10 years ago, when Intel and AMD controlled it. A handset maker looking to buy a SoC has few choices -- a dynamic that likely played into Apple's decision to produce its own line with the A4.

DSA is not a next-generation lithography (NGL) tool per se, but rather it is a complementary and double-patterning scheme. DSA is also disruptive and threatens the status quo, because the process isn’t dependent on traditional and costly lithography. Many of the key processing steps are conducted in an existing wafer track system. There are two basic types of DSA methods: graphoepitaxy and chemical epitaxy. In graphoepitaxy, a guide is patterned using existing lithography tools. Using a track, the guide is spin-coated, rinsed and spin-coated again with copolymers. The copolymers self-assemble and the guide is then etched. In chemical epitaxy, self-assembly is guided by lithographically determined chemical patterns. In theory, DSA is attractive because it could reduce the overall cost of lithography. And compared to EUV, DSA requires less R&amp;D funding.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364607417971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 21:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364607647036-87</Id><Topic><Title>Fab 42 not looking good, not looking good AT ALL</Title><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364588369401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 16:19:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel processor demand will decline sharply in 2013/2014 new solutions for DATA centers will also start hurting Intel in 2014 Phones and tablets building glut inn 2013 Bad for Intel/ARMH too.......... steep declines will bring new opportunities to accumulate... for now trade with a -ve bias</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364607647036</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 21:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364607983522-88</Id><Title>Singhlion has said this several times.........</Title><Msg>.....................................he says Intel is going to single digits but he once revealed that he would cover at 19.

Where did you go to school? Vitellius was the son of the emperor Claudius’s colleague as censor, Lucius Vitellius, who was also consul three times. Aulus himself became consul in ad 48 and proconsul of Africa (c. 61). The new emperor, Galba, appointed him imperial governor of Lower Germany in 68. The troops in Germany were not friendly to Galba, and Vitellius won them over with generosity. On Jan. 2, 69, his men proclaimed him emperor, and the armies of Upper Germany, as well as most of the governors of Spain, Gaul, and Britain, soon gave him their support as well. He then led his troops into Italy. Galba had been murdered, and Vitellius’s armies fought the forces of his successor, Otho, at Bedriacum (now Calvatone, between Verona and Cremona). Otho’s forces were defeated, and he committed suicide on April 16. Vitellius was recognized by the Senate. He entered Rome in July, sacrificed to Nero, and replaced the Praetorian Guard with his troops from Germany. He did nothing to win over Otho’s troops or those from other parts of the empire, however. When Vespasian was hailed as emperor on July 1, the troops in the Balkan provinces recognized him and invaded Italy under Marcus Antonius Primus. After Vitellius’s troops were defeated in a second battle of Bedriacum (October 69), Vespasian’s brother, the city prefect Flavius Sabinus, persuaded Vitellius to abdicate. The Roman mob joined with Vitellius’s troops to chase Sabinus to the Capitoline Hill. (The temple of Jupiter was burned to the ground during the rioting.) Vespasian’s army, under Primus’s leadership, attacked and entered Rome on December 20. Vitellius was murdered with great barbarity.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364610382775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 22:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364610916233-90</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody who can't grisp what the ALTR deal means</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364580292992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 14:04:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GREAT news for ALTR !!!!! yeah GREAT news for TSMC - but first we'll have a great capex party.
