They have contracted it out to an independent 3rd party. I expect Intel results to be slightly above but very close to the Intel forecast. There is no manipulation by Intel (just my confident opinion). If you listen to the last earnings conference call, Intel pointed out that Q3 was "back end loaded" which means that the important CPU buying stuff happens in SEPTEMBER as Intel customers (HPQ, DELL, ...) buy parts for the holiday season computer build. DELL and HPQ and .... lowered their holiday builds and could they could then easily delay the remaining purchases beyond the Q3 quarter end. Vendor delays disrupted the Intel back end loaded quarter. DELL, HPQ, .... will be burning off their current inventory and will go back to Intel only when their inventory demands. They will burn off all their inventory and be back at Intel in Q4 but we don't yet know how strongly but will in two weeks at the earnings call.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1347773474562</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 01:31:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347776524190-4</Id><Topic><Title>ULTRABOOKS ARE A HUGE FLOP</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347718284823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:11:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She wants Apple MacBook Air but an equivalent would cost $1200.

How in the world are 5 factories going to be pumping out chips ? Where's all the demand gonna come from?" *** The demand for the high end already exists. It's why all of TSMC customers have been so angry. And why some ARM customers are begging Intel to do their fabrication. But design takes time. It's not an instant thing. If Intel does have excess capacity, which we haven't heard anyone say yet, they will have the ability to do foundry work. I don't see it. Intel is re-tooling for mobility and is addressing a lot of new markets. And there are a lot of embedded markets as well. Intel doesn't make PCs - Intel makes processors and they are going into all aspects of society. Including medical, automotive, signage, and industrial, in addition to PCs, servers, smartphones, tablets and other mobility applications. Intel is also a master at adjusting costs when confronted with lower demand. If that happens they will just use the lull to move faster to 14nm where demand will be better and better. Intel will have huge 22nm capacity and then huge 14nm capacity. Why would anyone want 28nm ARM processors, given a choice? As it becomes more and more obvious that Intel will stay on the cutting edge as ARMs fabrication fades, there will be much more of an incentive to switch. We are in the midst of that change where it is becoming obvious. 14nm will be available in a year. That means a whole lot of discussion and planning is taking place right now for those who want to be on the cutting edge. Intel has made the decision to own mobility. And they have the fabrication, manufacturing prowess and capacity to make it happen. All of their focus for the last 18 months has been on changes necessary to address the mobility market. These efforts are coming to fruition and will substantially arrive in 2013. So, where is the demand going to come from? It will come from those who realize that ARMs fabrication is crashing just as Intel's is moving steadily ahead with its every eight quarter pace without pause - to 14, then to 10, then to 7 and then to 5nm. ARM is going to stall out after 20nm for at least three years. Don't think any major manufacturer is going to wait three years for them to catch up. And how will they catch up with shrinking revenues and market share? The demand will come primarily from mobility. Intel started late. But Intel's newly defined assault on mobility has been well planned and well executed. You have people like Mike Bell backed up by Intel's R&amp;D, superior fabrication, world class manufacturing. It is possible that Intel will be the only major IDM (integrated device manufacturer) left in the world. As processors become more complex this is more and more important. The ARM fabless model is essentially broken because it doesn't have the tight integration of design and manufacturing that is required to have a successful experience with today's state-of-the-art processors and fabrication. Let us not forget the economics. Each new processor cycle brings improved economics. This is why Intel keeps telling us it is necessary for them to continue the every eight quarter pace. Those that can't keep up (the entire ARM world) will have lessor economics, worse margins and problems with cash flow. You don't have to be smarter than a fifth grader to see where this is going. Intel will provide the most bang for the buck. The best performance, the least power consumption and the best price. If you build it, they will come. Intel is building it. And there is nothing the competition can do about it...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347784114390</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 04:28:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347793460202-7</Id><Topic><Title>IDF: 14nm Production on Track for Late 2013; Paths to 10nm and Below</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347727491262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The PC market is a reliable and steady market that Intel has tight control over. All the customers there have been customer for several generations of product. While there is some slowdown there, it's a huge market which will account for much of Intel's chip supply. The tablet and smartphone market on the other hand is a new market where Intel is a new entrant. Their process lead does give them an edge over the competition, but they are clearly behind on architecture. Besides, the customers decision to go with Intel chips over competing alternatives is not based only on the technology competitiveness but things such as a cost, an area where ARM based solution have a distinct advantage. On the tablet/mobile side therefore, while Intel may get some volumes, they would be at much lower ASP than on the PC side. Based on past performance (Medfield) things are not looking good for Intel on this side.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1347793460202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 07:04:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347797180918-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Earning will be good</Title><Username>starbauch</Username><Timestamp>1347767958321</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 23:59:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you do a little history on INTC you will see last 2 years late Aug and early Sept the stock was at its lowests.

Intel is porting the Android 4.1 operating system to work on smartphones and tablets using its low-power Atom processors, known as Medfield. The fate of this Jelly Bean and Medfield courtship now rests with carriers, though, and not with Intel. Carriers and phone vendors will be the ones to sound their trumpets about Android 4.1 testing and deployment. Intel said that to date the Medfield-Android 4.1 build is complete and running on Intel workers' devices–the employees, in codename terms, are using Medfield smartphones with Jelly Bean. The carriers will now take the phones and put them through "acceptance" testing. The smartphones that are based on a single-core Atom chip are being introduced to consumers through such names as Orange, ZTE, Lava International, and Lenovo. Motorola is expected to announce a smartphone based on Intel chips next week. Analysts have assessed the Motorola alliance as an important one for Intel's smartphone prospects.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1347802786361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 09:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347806837604-16</Id><Topic><Title>Buy bac</Title><Username>yawnfestblink</Username><Timestamp>1347646060266</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:07:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>flash, as always you can't support your flashy claims. enjoy the short squeeze you deserve the pain.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1347806837604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347808929256-17</Id><Topic><Title>3 Dead Money Stocks To Sell Now</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1347745489704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:44:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you want to make money in the market you need to buy low and sell high.

Perlmutter was particularly excited about Intel’s upcoming fourth generation core processor--Haswell-- which has already made significant strides in terms of balancing high performance with much lower power than previous generations. With that in mind, we asked Perlmutter whether he believed Haswell to be a viable platform for tablets, given requirements for fanless design and all-day battery life. His answer? “Yes, absolutely,” though Perlmutter qualified this with a clarification, noting that by “tablet” he also meant detachable and convertible PCs. A Haswell tablet’s performance would require a slightly bigger battery, making it heavier, thicker and more expensive, while fanless cooling would also remain a challenge, but the idea is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility, said the executive VP. “If you really want high performance, you have to be willing to compromise in areas like TDP,” explained Perlmutter, noting that such a tablet could go fanless if the platform operated in the 3 to 4 W range, something that probably won't occur until at least the generation after Haswell. While it’s perhaps a theoretical possibility to get down to that level of thermal envelope, Perlmutter doesn’t think it should be treated as a holy grail. “There’s no sweet spot. There are multiple optimizations for different usages,” he said. Meanwhile, as Intel gears up to push Haswell into unfamiliar low power territory in tablets and convertibles, the firm is also pushing the limits on the other end of the scale, with its Atom microprocessor. The firm is looking to leverage its ultra-low power chip in the microserver space, previously the domain of Intel's much larger Xeon processor family. “We’re going to launch Atom into the space,” said Perlmutter, saying the move would happen “later this year.” Since Atom is so low powered compared to its approximately 17W Xeon counterparts, it would of course put out less performance, but Perlmutter noted that the big advantage was the consistency in software, allowing Intel’s customers to scale their offerings up or down while running exactly the same software stack. “You will still apply the same building blocks, fabric and connectivity, making it easier for people to switch back and forth depending on their needs,” said Perlmutter, adding that it was all about building a variety of solutions that were consistent.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347812551972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347812711522-20</Id><Title>I like INTC but</Title><Msg>I like CROX and FB better</Msg><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1347812711522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347812786961-21</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Haswell: a viable platform for tablets?</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347812551972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:22:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You #$%$ Nvidia pumper.

A better radio might not sound like an exciting new technology. The very word “radio” conjures images of Fibber McGee &amp; Molly gabbing about Herbert Hoover while Pop relaxes from a hard day of selling apples for ten cents. But old-fashioned radio technology has been the base of all our smartphones, Wi-Fi connections, and wireless controllers, and it’s improved less than you’d think. That could change soon. At this week’s Intel Development Conference, Intel revealed what the company is calling the “Moore’s Law Radio,” and it could be the next step in transforming how our electronics work for us. The radios that run today’s connected devices have always had plenty of digital components, but many crucial components remained analog. Computer processors have been getting better at a mind-boggling clip thanks to Moore’s Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip (and the computing power of that chip) doubles every two years. But analog components aren’t subject to Moore’s Law. Analog components can’t be shrunk too far before they start sending stray electric pulses all over the place, they can’t use better processors to reduce power consumption, and they can’t be integrated into a modern production cycle. For the last 10 years, Intel has been trying to make all of those analog radio functions happen digitally. And this week, the company showed off the culmination of its work: a completely digital Wi-Fi unit that fits onto a single chip. Besides being smaller than any previous Wi-Fi system, it’s also vastly more energy efficient, and ultimately will be much cheaper to build. Intel is also unveiling a new wireless standard to go with the chip: WiGig, which consolidates a number of proprietary wireless technologies under one umbrella to deliver bandwidth over 5 gigabytes per second. And for good measure, Intel is also developing a vast Cloud Radio Access Network, which will allow Intel-based servers to act as wireless providers, giving faster service than today’s hubs with fewer dropped connections. What all this means for consumers is a range of wireless applications that have been frustratingly out of reach for too long. Wireless connections that are cheap in terms of manufacturing cost and power consumption will enable a generation of phones and laptops that can be constantly downloading email,, news, and other data without devouring battery power. Many cities have talked about making their entire metro area wireless-enabled; this technology could make that kind of vast wireless network orders of magnitude cheaper and more reliable. Better phones and laptops are just the start of how this technology can be applied. Ultimately, Intel’s vision is to create “the Internet of Things,” where every physical object has a wireless sensor and sends information to any other object that wants it. Intel CTO Justin Ratner is proposing a world where “If it computes, it connects.” Cheap, fast, low-power wireless technology means that everything from your monitor to your refrigerator to your dishwasher is always online, and always sending information, all without wires and all using less power than today’s netbooks.</Msg><Username>fitfunactive2002</Username><Timestamp>1347817385285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:43:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347818368600-26</Id><Topic><Title>I like INTC but</Title><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1347812711522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:25:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I still like intel.

When I looked at scharts.co/NvTdtV not only is the bottom in early Sept for the last two years, MACD has been at its most negative. INTC, then has complementary PEAKS in May and Nov. Using that chart implies you sell Intel late Apr and buy Intel in early Sep. INTC has always had its strongest quarters in Q3 and Q4 and weakest in Q1. All driven by holiday sales. Things are in transition and I am always wary of forecasting the future based on the past. I think options are one reason the BETA is so low on Intel.

There are many places where they are the absolute best solution. There are many places where tablets are silly and impractical to consider. I had dinner last night with my daughter and her friend who has a small, one-person business. The friend talked about some of the problems she was having and expressed her plans to buy a tablet to help her business. I questioned her about the problem she was trying to solve and if the tablet had the capability do what she wanted. She said that she had tried it out and it worked fine. She is a "computer user" and reasonably computer literate. She is looking for a tool that will help her business. She has zeroed in on a part of the compute continuum that solves her problem. I would hardly consider her a "nitwit". Does that particular tablet sale consume a laptop sale? No. She is going to use computing to solve a problem that a tablet is a great match. She would not buy a current laptop to solve this problem. As for the article, the EE Times reporter is just restating the Intel position that has been published many times.

This manipulation appears to manifest itself in two primary ways. One is what appears to be the use of a cooperative strategy by Wall Street’s largest firms to use a combination of analyst’s reports, reports to the media, timed upgrades/downgrades, and buy/sell strategies by their own trading desks in order to channel the direction of the stock price and to then unethically and perhaps illegally profit from this combination of methodologies. The other is a similar strategy by hedge funds. Hedge funds under current regulations provide little or no visibility of their trading patterns, strategies or activities, essentially allowing them free rein to manipulate stock prices in ways not compatible with the normal trends produced by supply and demand. Both of these situations work to the detriment of the average investor. They tend to drive the smaller or average investor completely out of the stock markets with the conclusion that the “market is rigged”. In fact this certainly appears to be the case in an unfortunate number of circumstances. Let us consider the case of Intel. Intel has been locked in a trading range for years. Even when they recorded five years of 27 percent annual growth, the P/E ratio was continuously and significantly below that of the average S&amp;P 500 company while they performance was hugely better. Every time Intel threatened to move to a higher level, Wall Street’s largest firms would apparently band together with a barrage of downgrades and negative media comments. The result was a continuous valuation under what any reasonable analysis would support as being fair. Whether these firms traded against Intel in addition needs to be determined. I therefore ask for consideration of the following: 1.) An investigation of the manner in which Wall Street’s largest firms internally trade, correlated against analyst recommendations, upgrade/downgrade releases, and reports to the media. 2.) An investigation of the manner of trading across Wall Street’s largest firms to determine if there is any pattern of cooperation or collusion in regards to particular stocks. 3.) The development of new regulations resulting in greater transparency of hedge fund trading in order to determine if they are using money and leverage to manipulate the market and stock prices in a manner inconsistent with stock market fairness and stability. 4.) An investigation of large Wall Street firm and hedge fund trading of Intel Corporation to determine if they are engaged in activities which unfairly or illegally deny Intel a fair valuation. 5.) An investigation into naked shorting of Intel. Thank you for your time and efforts in helping to establish a market environment free of fraud, manipulation and methodologies which disenfranchise smaller investors.

Intel has recognized that mobility is the major growth area and has total re-organized priorities to address this. They have changed the timetables for all mobile strategies and moved them to the top. 2.) Intel will pass ARM in power efficiency in 2013. 3.) The companies that went with Intel early on in smartphones and mobility will look like geniuses by the end of 2013. This early adoption is going to put them in the catbird seat for superior performance and power consumption efficiency that ARM will not be able to match. 4.) ARMs fabrication is substantially inferior. Two to three years til 20nm volume production. And then after that - nothing. They are looking at at least 4 years to develop 14nm. This will give Intel three years of having their way with the market with their 14nm production. 5.) In four years Intel will be doing volume production on 10nm and getting 7nm ready. No company that has to be on or even near the cutting edge of technology will be able to rely on ARMs fading fabrication. 6.) The ARM roadmap after 20nm is a looming void. They will likely have to do EUV and maybe even 450mm at the same time. It took TSCM a year to get 28nm yields just up to an acceptable level. Intel ramped 22nm smoothly and rapidly and will do the same with 14nm. They are already producing product. Expect all these things to prevent TSMC from reaching volume production on 14nm for years. It's so far out in the future with so many massively complex issues for them to solve that it's impossible to predict when it might happen. When it does, Intel will be at least 2 product cycles ahead. Intel is going to own mobility and that's because of its advanced fabrication and manufacturing. 7.) Otellini has commented on Intel coming in to a "golden age". He’s talking about Intel’s significant technology edge. He knows ARM can't keep up with Intel's fabrication cycles and that will determine how mobility will play out. 8.) It's not about talking smack as ARM CEO Warren East is fond of doing. He can talk all he wants. It won't do a thing to diminish Intel's rapidly growing advantage in fabrication. Intel's efforts have gone exactly where they needed to go. Years of preparation are coming to fruition. 9.) Intel will have huge 22nm capacity and then huge 14nm capacity. Why would anyone want 28nm ARM processors, given a choice? As it becomes more and more obvious that Intel will stay on the cutting edge as ARMs fabrication fades, there will be much more of an incentive to switch. We are in the midst of that change where it is becoming obvious. 14nm will be available in a year. That means discussions and planning are taking place right now for those who want to be on the cutting edge and then on a direct path to 14, then to 10, then to 7 and then to 5nm. 10.) It's possible that Intel will soon be the only major IDM (integrated device manufacturer) left in the world. As processors become more complex this is more and more important. The ARM fabless model is essentially broken because it doesn't have the tight integration of design and manufacturing that is required to have a successful experience with today's state-of-the-art processors and fabrication. 12.) Let us not forget the economics. Each new processor cycle brings improved economics. This is why Intel keeps telling us it is necessary for them to continue the every eight quarter pace. Those that can't keep up (the entire ARM world) will have lesser economics, worse margins and problems with cash flow. 13.) Anyone who understands the fabrication space knows the miss was totally overblown. There shouldn't have been any reduction in stock price because the big Wall Street firms and hedge funds have Intel trapped in a trading range that has kept the P/E fifty percent below where it should be. That has to end. A fair valuation even with the revenue reduction should be in the 35 to 40 range. Bear Bryant once said, "It's not the will to win that's important. It's the will to prepare to win." Intel has the will to prepare to win. If you don't believe it, go take a look at the 14nm fabs in Oregon and Arizona.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347826125372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347826291635-37</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Earning will be good</Title><Username>starbauch</Username><Timestamp>1347767958321</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 23:59:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, INtel warning and lowering their numbers is a deception...

Intel will let some smaller players build their chips on 22nm as the company is the leader in changing the manufacturing process. At this time TSMC as its greatest competitor is at 28nm, with test chips in 22nm, and Global foundries at 32nm in Dresden and 28nm slowly staring this year in Malta, New York State. When we say Intel will make chips on its own terms it means that it will accept designs from companies that won’t compete Intel's offerings. Intel has even publicly mentioned few potential clients and we will try to get this information confirmed for you. In the long run, since Qualcomm and Apple are both fighting for TSMC’s love, there might be a time when Intel broadens its partner list trying to make money of these ultra-big, building fabs investments. This is a rather interesting twist and it looks like over the course of next two years TSMC will finally get some decent competition.

Sascha Segan By Sascha Segan September 15, 2012 11:30am EST iPhone 4 vs. iPhone 4S vs. iPhone 5 Apple couldn't engineer itself out of the global LTE mess, but maybe Intel can. The new iPhone 5 features 4G LTE, which is going to dramatically improve Internet speeds for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone owners. (Sprint subscribers are left waiting for LTE to arrive where they live.) But globally, the iPhone LTE picture is a disaster. There are two different iPhone models. The AT&amp;T iPhone will work on LTE on T-Mobile USA and in Canada, but not in the rest of the world. The Verizon/Sprint iPhone will work in some European and Asian countries. No iPhone will work on the existing LTE networks in Austria, Brazil, Columbia, Denmark, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland, as iMore points out. The phones will still roam where they can't get LTE; they'll be on 3G, which isn't fatal, but it's a night-and-day difference in terms of speeds. The incompatibility is because there are way too many frequency bands being used for mobile phone networks right now. Apple's a popularizer and refiner of technologies; they're not introducing any radical new RF breakthroughs here, so they're stuck in the same LTE band whirlwind that everyone else is. Between Apple's two models, it's already supporting seven different LTE bands, known as band 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 17 and 25. But European operators have three more bands they use: 7, 20 and 38. They may also use band 8 in the future. Some Asian operators appear to be on Band 40. Here at home, Sprint also plans to use band 26, and some smaller US carriers have band 12. It's a mess. It means phone makers have to put together lots of different models for different countries, and those units will have trouble roaming well in other countries if they travel. It also means small carriers on obscure LTE bands, like 12, have trouble getting phones that work well with their networks because there are no huge carriers placing large orders for them. Can Intel Fix Apple's Problems? Fortunately, across the street from the iPhone event, I saw a potential solution. Intel's Developer Forum was going on just across the street from Apple this week. Up on the second floor, the company was showing off the four relatively lackluster Intel phones so far, as well as a modem technology that could really change things. Intel's XMM6260 modem, which has been in the market for a while, uses a single power amplifier for multiple bands, and it can be extended in software to support as many bands as necessary. It doesn't support LTE or CDMA, which is part of why we haven't seen it in many U.S. products. But the point here, an Intel engineer told me, is that the company will be able to put an unlimited number of bands on a single LTE modem, possibly as soon as late next year. Intel's modems will be able to mate with processors from Samsung, Nvidia, TI, and others. Apple used its modems up until 2010, when it switched over to Qualcomm in part to get Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Modems are only half of the solution, though. Dermot O'Shea, co-founder of antenna firm Taoglas, said antenna design gets difficult when you're covering such a wide range of frequencies. Active antennas for smartphones, which have just started to hit the market this year, can adapt to different bands without being huge, although they add to the cost and complexity of smartphones. We're likely to see more of them next year. Between active antennas and multi-frequency power amplifiers, it looks like phone makers are starting to get their hands around the riot of LTE frequencies; they're just not there yet. Maybe we'll see them in the iPhone 7.</Msg><Username>blacklabpup2003</Username><Timestamp>1347834752319</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 18:32:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347834931059-48</Id><Title>Nvidia mobile chief Mike Rayfield resigns</Title><Msg>[Somebody better get the fanboi's shoelaces and belt.

Rayfield resigned effective August 24 and he is taking a role at another company, but we still don’t know anything about the new position. Rayfield oversaw the development of Nvidia’s Tegra processors and analysts are rather concerned about the high-profile defection, the Wall Street Journal reports. Moor Insights and Strategy market researcher Patrick Moorhead said Rayfield and his team were successful in battling larger development teams at rival companies. “Mike’s leaving on an uptick,” he said. Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney described Rayfield’s departure as a “big loss” for Nvidia. “He’s really been driving the strategy,” she said. Earlier this year Nvidia landed the biggest Tegra design win to date, the Nexus 7, and Tegra chips will also power Microsoft’s Surface RT tablet. However, while Nvidia has had quite a bit of success in the tablet market, the list of interesting platforms it missed out on is just as long. You won’t find Tegras in Amazon tablets, new Samsung phones and tablets or Windows Phone 8 devices.

(More...) Edited By Adam Isaac Intel (INTC) is the world's biggest semiconductor chipmaker. The company designs, develops and produces computing and communications micro components. It also develops computing platforms for integrated hardware and software computing technologies that are intended to provide optimized solutions to personal users and large enterprises. Following the trends in the industry, Intel is going through significant transformation. The company is shedding its primary focus on design and production of semiconductor chips. The main reason is to give way to a business that offers complete solutions through software and hardware platforms and auxiliary devices. When I look for quality dividends at attractive prices, Intel is the first stock that comes to my mind. Intel is one of the few stocks, which offer healthy dividend yield at a reasonable price. Its dividend yield, growth prospects, EPS growth, strong cash flows, lower PEG and rich asset base makes Intel a nifty dividend choice. Why Is Intel A Candidate For Strong Dividend Payer? Intel has an attractive dividend yield of 3.90%; this represents a healthy return as not many companies show such good yields. In addition, the company has extremely impressive EPS growth rate of 37.5%. Intel has a strong asset base and an incredibly attractive PEG ratio of .92. All of the factors indicate that the company will keep its status as a dividend power house. In the previous year, Intel reported record revenue, net income and earnings growth on the strength in emerging markets and enterprise sales. In July, the company reported quarterly revenue of $13.5 billion, operating income of $3.8 billion, net income of $2.8 billion and EPS of $0.54. The company generated approximately $4.7 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.1 billion and used $1.1 billion to repurchase stock. However, for the current quarter earnings, the firm has revised its outlook from $14.3 billion +/- $500 million in revenues to $13.2 billion +/- $300 million. However, once the windows 8 is released by Microsoft (MSFT), I expect the revenues to pick up and the company should post impressive revenue figures for the fourth quarter of 2012. Thanks to strong growth in earnings, the dividend is boosted by 25% in the previous year. Cash Flows: Over the past three years, Intel has seen a massive increase in its operating cash flows. At the end of year 2009, Intel reported operating cash flows of $11.17 billion which have gone above $20 billion by the end of the previous year. At the same time, the firm has been investing heavily, and the capital expenditures have also shown an increasing trend over the previous three years. Capital expenditures more than doubled from $4.5 billion in 2009 to over $10 billion in 2011. Furthermore, the free cash flows have also increased significantly for the firm and now stand at over $10 billion. Balance Sheet: Intel has a very strong balance sheet and an impressive mix of assets. The firm has over $45 billion worth of long term assets along with about $26 billion in the short term assets. On the other hand, the short term obligations of the company stand at just above $12 billion; the firm has a current ratio of more than 2 and the liquidity position of the company is in prime condition. In addition, the company had long term debt of just above $7 billion at the end of June, 2012. However, total liabilities for the company were just above $20 billion, which also included deferred tax liabilities and accrued compensation and benefits liabilities.</Msg><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1347835897586</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 18:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347836330328-52</Id><Title>Motorola XT890 approved by FCC, may be next week's 2GHz Intel phone</Title><Msg>As one major event wraps, we look forward to what's coming up next: Motorola's Intel announcement. We have a hard time believing we'd see anything besides a smartphone with an Intel chip inside, but the biggest mystery is in what type of phone. Are we going to see something ho-hum, or mind-blowingly awesome? Whatever it is, we think we may have stumbled upon a clue. Motorola's XT890, which has been rumored to be a global RAZR M with a 2GHz CPU and 897 x 540 screen resolution, just wandered through the FCC with AT&amp;T-friendly 2G and 3G radios. There's no hint of LTE here, though the FCC doesn't require OEMs to mention non-US frequencies. The docs, however, indicate that we can expect dual-band WiFi -- no word on NFC, but we'd be very surprised if it didn't make the final cut. The supercharged processor seems almost too good to be true, but we wouldn't offer up any complaints if there is any truth to the idea.

Most aren’t interested in which chip powers their Android smartphone or tablet, either. That may bode well for Intel which now has Android 4.1, or Jelly Bean, ported to its chips. Only a few Android devices use Intel chips today and none have been major successes. But that’s not due to the performance or battery life of these; Intel’s Atom finally appears to be competitive with other smartphone chips on both aspects. I expect to see a major handset maker take a chance on Intel as early as next week: Motorola and Intel are planning a joint event and a new Intel-powered phone may be the reason why.

According to that, the Intel/Moto device will be powered by a processor clocked at 2 GHz. That sounds like madness to us, and, even though the CPU will most likely be a Medfield single-core unit, it will make the handheld Intel’s snappiest to date by a mile. We’re unsure how it’ll measure up against the dual-core 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4-powered Razr M, but we’re certainly excited to see that duel. That same benchmark reveals a pretty odd 897 x 540 pixels resolution for Blade’s future display, which will most likely translate into qHD (960 x 540) with soft buttons. As for the screen’s diagonal, different rumors say different things, but we’re certainly inclining towards the scenario of the phone being a 4.3-incher. The rumor mill would normally stop grinding at this point, but here’s a crazy thought: What if Intel made that announcement about the finishing of Jelly Bean ports to give out some sort of a clue about this new phone? Intel does need something special to wow us with after only unveiling modest low-enders from minor manufacturers; a Moto phone with a 2 GHz chip and running JB out of the box would certainly fit that bill. This is clearly only a wild speculation, but what if…? Does anyone else think such a scenario is possible? And if it were to happen, would you run out and buy the new Intel/Motorola phone as soon as possible?</Msg><Username>lucy_is_my_blitch</Username><Timestamp>1347836595719</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 19:03:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347836748976-55</Id><Title>Intel steps it up on mobiles, gets Jelly Bean on its chips</Title><Msg>Intel is increasing its efforts in fast-growing smartphone and tablet markets: It now has the latest version of Google Android software, known as Jelly Bean, running on its chips.

Hardly!</Title><Msg>PORTLAND, Ore. – What with AMD, Apple, Dell, Dialog, Freescale, Fujitsu, HP, LSI, Microsoft, Motorola, MStar, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments all licensing ARM cores for everything from smartphones to tablets to basestations to servers, one might be led to believe the boast of ARM CEO Warren East that designers are choosing ARM because it is a no brainer. [ARM TechCon 2012, the largest ARM design ecosystem under one roof, is Oct. 30 - Nov. 1 in Santa Clara. Click here to check out agenda.] The truth is that even though ARM is gaining market share in low-power embedded applications the company still has a long way to go to challenge the perennial microprocessor kings; that software compatibility hurts ARM as much as it helps; and that there are many vertical markets which will remain inaccessible to ARM cores merely because they are standardized. Intel in particular has a 20-year head start over ARM, resulting in a maturity, sophistication and veneration that will be hard to displace by a 22-year-old. Intel's ecosystem of support chips, subsystems and software is unparalleled in the industry and addresses many more real-world issues than the low-power and small die size that makes ARM a no-brainer for many new designs. From the mobile space where Atom offers x86 compatibility that even ARM's most sophisticated cores cannot match, to the server space where Intel's Xeon already solves the most vexing issues facing datacenters today, Intel versus ARM remains a brain-teaser. For instance, the fast-growing cloud computing space uses virtualization to offer mobile device users access to applications running on servers for which Intel has a top-to-bottom solution – VTx – which securely links x86-based mobile devices with Xeon-based cloud computers. ARM, on the other hand, is still pursuing virtualization extensions that could offer similar integration of mobile devices into cloud computing realms. "ARM is becoming more and more mature – its graduated from its initial light-weight processors for mobile devices to beefier processors like the A15 which can compete with Intel's Atom, but they are not yet in the Xeon class" said Sergis Mushell, principal research analyst at Gartner Inc. "The battle has just started – the relay gun has been fired, but the race has just begun." ARM has recently started penetrating the wireless basestation market with a vengeance, driving a stake in the heart of MIPS Technologies, and landing lucrative new accounts such as for Freescale's popular QorIQ basestation processors. However, standardizing on ARM cores may eventually hurt margins at TI, Freesale, LSI Logic and elsewhere, as they compete for the same sockets since one of ARM's advantages – interchangeable software – will also enable processor vendors to become interchangeable. "ARM is now threatening the ecosystem of MIPS – going into basestations, going into networking, and gaining mainstream licensees like Texas Instruments, Freescale and LSI," said Mushell. "But all these vendors are going to be competing for the same piece of business, and it will be really easy to replace one vendor's ARM processor for one of the others, which could drive the ASP [average selling price] down significantly." For many applications, proprietary architectures can actually be an advantage – witness HP's recent decision not to support ARM on Windows 8 tablets. Proprietary cores can also serve specific markets needs that do not fit into ARM's one-size-fit-all philosophy. For instance, Infineon's Tricore, Renesas' VH/RX and Atmel's AVR all serve specific market segments that will not be going away any time soon. "Though it's true that the ARM ecosystem for embedded microprocessors and microcontrollers is growing at a blistering rate, there are applications – such as in automotive microcontrollers or networking microprocessors, where manufacturers have found it useful to maintain proprietary architectures," said Adib Ghubril, research director at Gartner. The other dimension that ARM's "no brainer" argument is skirting is heterogeneous multi-cores. ARM currently has extensions aimed at addressing digital signal processing (DSP), vector processing and other specialized needs, but at least for now, chip designers are more likely be use an asymmetric architectures – an ARM core in combination with a non-ARM heterogeneous core – to meets their specific needs. "And a new war is about to begin – the multicore wars – and here ARM will likely not emerge supremely victorious, because devices are taking on what we refer to as asymmetric architectures to meet requirements specific to end-applications," said Ghubril. "These asymmetric architectures combine heterogeneous cores together such that an ARM may be sitting next to a proprietary DSP."</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347844824985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:20:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347845268029-62</Id><Topic><Title>Has ARM won the processor wars?

About 90 days ago, expectations for Apple's Q3 earnings was $10.38 EPS. After Apple's bad earnings report relative to expectations, analysts on average dropped expectations down to $8.69 EPS. A drop of about 16%. Yet the stock has risen during the same period from $572 a share to $693. Stock appreciated about 21% after Apple caused a drop in expectations by about 16%. Just because of the enthusiasm of the latest iPhone. As for Intel, expectations were 0.67 EPS about 90 days ago, and that to the latest revised guidance from Intel, they have dropped on average to 0.50 EPS. A drop of about 25%. As a result, the stock has dropped from $27, down to $23.37. A drop of about 13.5%. And Intel has announced quite a few new products and features using Intel chips during the latest IDF. So it's perfectly fine for Apple to guide much lower than expectations, but it is not for Intel to do the same. Interesting. And I will not buy the argument that iPads or tablets for that matter are cannibalizing PC sales. During the time that iPad sales went from 0 to 17 million quarterly sales, PC unit sales went from 83 million quarterly sales to 87 million quarterly sales. So none of the PC sales were cannibalized. They actually grew as well by 4 million units. And this during a bad economic condition worldwide.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1347850060598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 22:47:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347850185940-65</Id><Topic><Title>Has ARM won the processor wars?

As of now, their 45nm chip competes with Intel's 32nm. Intel's claim that they're going to accelerate the process node progression for mobile chips is a claim. It remains to be seen how successful they are with that. They're only at 32nm for SOCs. Besides, there's a lot more demand driven momentum behind the independent foundries to accelerate their process node ramps. So I don't see the competition heating up. ARM doesn't have market share now, but its only a matter of time. Fading fabrication? Why is it fading? Manufacturing probably won't play a role in this. Intel is ahead on process and behind on architecture. Trends suggest their process lead will shrink and there's nothing they can do about their deficit in architecture because they're too slow and frankly, quite stuck up.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1347853367085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347853531807-73</Id><Title>10-Watt Ivy Bridge and Other Surprises</Title><Msg>I've written a lot of posts on this year's Intel Developer Forum and will have a bit more to say about some of the other companies' hardware solutions later. There were a few things from Intel, though, that were a bit surprising and that I thought were worth mentioning in more detail. Intel is touting 2013 as the year the PC is re-invented with the fourth-generation Core microprocessor, known as Haswell. During his keynote, Intel Chief Product Officer David (Dadi) Perlmutter showed off the upcoming Haswell processor, saying that Haswell would consume 20 times less power in connected standby mode. He said a Haswell system running at 10 watts or less (the specific system running at about 7.5 watts) delivers similar performance to today's third-generation Core Processors (Ivy Bridge) running at 17 watts. This will enable extremely thin, extremely mobile form factors. But we may not have to wait until Haswell to see Core-based systems running at 10 watts. A new roadmap for Ultrabook systems shown by Intel Fellow Ajat Bhatt indicates that we'll see some Ultrabooks with sub-10-watt Ivy Bridge based parts early next year. When I asked Client Group General Manager Kirk Skaugen about this, he confirmed that there will be a limited number of such 10-watt designs early next year, based on Ivy Bridge. The number will be limited, though, because it was only late in the Ivy Bridge cycle that Intel realized the 22nm process was working so well it could enable 10-watt parts. There will be much more of a push for such designs, particularly for convertible Ultrabooks with Haswell. Intel is considering a new brand name for such processors, but Skaugen said it might still be called "Core." Skaugen also confirmed that the first Haswell designs will be out in the first half of 2013, but he wouldn't say which form factors those first parts would be for. I shouldn't have been so surprised to see better graphics in the fourth-generation Core, as Intel has been ramping graphics capabilities with each generation for the past few years. (Note that AMD's current Trinity-based A-series has generally been a better graphics performer than Intel's Ivy Bridge.) Intel has said Haswell will provide twice the graphics ability of Ivy Bridge, and there will be at least three levels of graphics available for Haswell. I saw one demo of a system with a Haswell with GT2 graphics playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 at a very high level. Another compared an Ivy Bridge system with a Haswell with GT3 graphics by playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and the latter system showed much more detail. There's always going to be a market for high-end graphics. My guess is hard-core gamers and workstation users will be using discrete graphics for years to come, but this means that more mainstream users will be able to play more games, even in smaller systems. There always was a lot of talk getting Haswell to work in very thin and light Ultrabooks, with some as small as 15mm thick. This requires improvements in many parts of the design, from the screen to the keyboard. But there will also be Atom-based tablets and convertibles, and casually playing with such systems from Acer and Asus showed these to be surprisingly responsive. These were based on Intel's Clover Trail platform, with a 1.8GHz Atom Z2760 and just 2GB of memory, running a 32-bit version of Windows 8. I won't say it was as fast as the Core systems I tried, but it looked like this could surprise many people.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347853531807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347853845315-74</Id><Topic><Title>Has ARM won the processor wars?
