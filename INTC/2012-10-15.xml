Come on fools, who declares a dividend then wanrs a few weeks later? GS warned what was coming a couple of months ago, remember? After Paul's good friends and neighbors are gonners, down goes the recently announced dividend along with whatever profits-if you have any-and Paul cashes out with a $35,000,000.00 parachute. Get wise to these guys. Sell your positions and go short before Paul &amp; freiends.</Msg><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1350273879294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 00:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350274199885-2</Id><Title>Instant computing</Title><Msg>Smartphones have gotten users addicted to instantly accessing online information. The future belongs to gadgets that you can carry with you all day and have available to access whenever you feel like. This trend suggests people will start using their desktops/laptops (and even their tablets) less because they're not instantly available. As the product matures, the smartphone can start providing all the uses that the desktop used to provide completely obliviating the need for less portable alternatives. This is why it's important for Intel to make a play at smartphones even if they are a smaller player at the beginning.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1350274199885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 00:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350274663330-3</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH: Just Saying...</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1350224692307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:24:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1350274663330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 00:17:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350283874146-4</Id><Topic><Title>The dividend gambit</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1350273879294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 00:04:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't have passed third grade if I had been your teacher.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1350283874146</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 02:51:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350284706033-5</Id><Topic><Title>Instant computing</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1350274199885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 00:09:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ha...i will never replace my laptop with a smartphone.

It is now under 22. I had no position in Intel between May and a week ago. I started buying at 22 and added shares at 21.50. Perhaps this will turn out to be a mistake, but if so, I will not be blaming high speed trading for it. The decision to buy was entirely mine, as will be the decision to sell when the time comes, and I had months to watch the situation unfold despite the fact that HFT accounts for the majority of daily transactions in the stock market. Could it be that looking for scapegoats is the endeavor of fools? Could that be the problem Wallus?

It is just not a squeeze. If he wants to call it one, that is fine. I presented my reasons for my thinking and I got a rude pre-teen insult response. I do not take pleasure when others suffer. I DO have a low opinion of those who take pleasure when others suffer. I reserve my lowest opinion for those who attempt to cause suffering for their own pleasure or gain. I simply do not believe that the short ratio is high enough in Intel shares to cause a "short squeeze". You and bull_no_bear disagree and that is OK. Why do you think it is a short squeeze? QUESTION: If you believe that there is a large short position, how many of those short shares are represented by the NET ASSET VALUE of the SHORT QQQQ ETF (PSQ)? In other words, this SHORT ETF has to actually short the shares. How many shares of the short interest in Intel are represented by the PSQ? I suspect that someone who BOUGHT PSQ to take a negative QQQQ position does not care about a 30 cent move in INTC.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350316293405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 11:51:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350316599140-87</Id><Title>Listen to #$%$ Alexander. #$%$$ spin it</Title><Msg>He calls people that enjoy the pain of others dirtbags.........while he shorts stocks and PROFITS from the pain of others while nobody is looking.

I have been an Intel fan since the first Pentium processor. It is still a leader in the PC market, even if the PC market is currently hurting. Maybe the release of Windows 8 can help. First, Intel has a 4.8% dividend yield. That is massive in the tech industry. Technology companies think they can avoid giving dividends as long as they stay on the cutting edge. Most of the companies are mistaken, and recently there has been a shift among the most mature companies to pay dividends. Usually they leave something to be desired. Intel's is extremely high, comparatively. The hit Intel has taken is due to macroeconomic circumstances beyond its control. The company itself seems to be doing very well. It has a lot of cash on hand. I am sure some of its cash is used to fund their venture capital arm, which will keep them innovating into the future. The companies do not need to be successful, but just need to create something that can have value. If Intel sees the value the company can be scooped up, and Intel can use its own distribution channels to make sales. I always like companies that fund innovation outside. I know it has become very common, but I love venture capital as a driver of innovation. The rest of Intel's business looks very strong. A 20% profit margin is great, especially considering Intel is not pure software, but actually does manufacturing. Debt is low compared to assets, but not cash. I would not make too much of that. I see no serious red flags in Intel's business. There might be some demand slumps, but if Intel can cut down on costs, profits can be maintained. Over the last 3 years the share price has been pretty flat; 7% over 3 years is not that great. With the dividend, sitting and waiting is a lucrative prospect. There is no reason Intel should not rise with economic recover, and if it enters more fully into the smart phone market.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350323298874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 13:48:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350323379765-121</Id><Title>How is Intel dying if they put over 2 BILLION in the bank just last quarter?</Title><Msg>AND that's their toughest quarter!</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350323379765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 13:49:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350323611024-122</Id><Topic><Title>Listen to #$%$ Alexander. #$%$$ spin it</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350316599140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 11:56:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I said that I thought TSM would be a "good comparison" and showed my work. I said it was just my opinion, You did not point out where you disagreed with my $30 assumptions or any math errors. I am open to alternate views of the universe. It seems I struck a nerve with my comments that I do not get pleasure from others pain. I expect to lose money when I make a decision that leads to a loss. I expect others to lose money similarly. The subtle difference is that I don't celebrate and taunt others for problem investment decisions. If you feel that it is OK, then that is fine. Go ahead. All it will affect is my opinion and it appears that my opinion has no value to you. That is quite OK too. I am long. I am not short stock. I AM ALSO SHORT PUT options (FYI, that is bullish). I have not said a single thing that would indicate that I am short or believe that a short position is the appropriate one for Intel. If you are having fun, please continue. If you are really upset, then you probably should re-read my postings. They do not lead to your conclusions.

They plan on shipping TWICE as many Haswell chips in 1H 2013 than they did Ivy Bridge. Twice as many !! _________________________________________________________ According to some internal info, Intel plans to ramp up Haswell at a much faster pace than Ivy Bridge. It will probably launch the complete portfolio at once, which is not the case with Ivy Bridge, which will first come in quad-core flavor, followed up by dual-cores. The transition to 22nm is not easy and this is why Intel is launching quad-cores and following up with dual-cores. Sometime in 1H 2013, or March to June as it's currently planned, Intel will master 22nm production and should not have the same issues. This means that Core i7, Core i5, Core i3 Haswell chips could launch at the same time. Intel plans to ships almost twice as many Haswell chips in 1H 2013 than it plans to ship Ivy Bridge CPUs in 1H 2012. Intel will still have manufacturing advantage over the rest of the world that now includes AMD, as well as the ARM alliance that will have tough transitioning from 28nm to 22nm. This will be Intel's key advantage in the future that will probably lead them to make some good mobile phone and tablet chips as well. They won't give up without a fight.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350355116157</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350355229855-189</Id><Topic><Title>All the Tides Rise Intel Corporation - Get on it Before it runs Aground...</Title><Username>brownelwood825</Username><Timestamp>1350308335717</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 09:38:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Consider it done.

They've all been made possible with taxpayer assistance, according to the latest survey of government waste put out by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. Known simply as the Waste Book, the report is a watchlist of eye-opening expenditures, which Coburn blames on a "let them eat caviar" attitude in Washington -- at a time when "23 million of our fellow Americans do not have good jobs," Coburn notes. Here are some highlights: - Though skeptics say there's no such thing as a free cellphone or service funded by the federal government, Coburn's report shows otherwise. It estimates that taxpayers are subsidizing phone service at a cost of nearly $1.5 billion a year. Though the roots of the program can be traced back to an effort in the 1930s to make sure all Americans had access to telecommunications, it has morphed into program that provided free cell service to some 16,500,000 participants last year. - Though NASA has no plans or budget for any manned spaceflights to Mars, the agency spends about $1 million each year on developing "the Mars menu." It's an effort to come up with a variety of food that humans could eat one day on Mars. - A $325,000 grant for the development of "Robosquirrel" - a robotic rodent designed to test the interaction between rattlesnakes and squirrels. - An estimated $70 million loss for producing pennies. According to the Waste Book, "The cost to produce a penny in 2012 is more than two times its actual value." After the pennies are manufactured and sold at face value, taxpayers are left to cover the loss. - The report spotlights widespread abuse of the food stamp system - including an exotic dancer who earned more than $85,000 a year in tips, but also collected nearly $1,000 a month in food stamps while spending $9,000 during that time period on "cosmetic enhancements." - Nearly $700,000 from the National Science Foundation to a New York-based theater company so it could develop a musical about climate change and biodiversity. "The Great Immensity" opened in Kansas City this year. Along with the songs one reviewer described as sounding like "a Wikipedia entry set to music," the audience was also able to experience "flying monkey poop." In all, the 2012 Waste Book report details 100 examples totaling nearly $19 billion. Coburn acknowledges that's a drop in the bucket in contrast to the overall federal deficit, which tops $16 trillion, but he says the items are snapshots of the bigger problem. "Would you agree with Washington that these represent national priorities, or would you conclude these reflect the out-of-touch and out-of-control spending threatening to bankrupt of nation’s future?" he said.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350358621208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350358818226-197</Id><Topic><Title>WE DESERVE BETTER LEADER.

But now he may also have to defend his right to practice medicine. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, a physician who opposes abortion rights, said in a letter that he was “deeply sorry” that supporters had to find out about the relationship with a patient that occurred while Mr. DesJarlais was separated from his first wife. But he said he used stark language about traveling to Atlanta to get an abortion try to get the woman to acknowledge that she wasn’t pregnant. “I appreciate that this was an imprudent approach to this situation and I’m not proud of it,” Mr. DesJarlais wrote in the letter. “In retrospect I should have dealt with these matters in a more diplomatic fashion. “I am not trying to justify my actions or say that I am without fault,” he said. “But I am not the hypocrite my opponents and some liberal media outlets are portraying me as.” Meanwhile, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on Monday filed a complaint with the Tennessee Department of Health arguing that Mr. DesJarlais engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a patient.</Msg><Username>pumpwad</Username><Timestamp>1350358818226</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350359676617-198</Id><Topic><Title>WE will trade over $25.00 by Friday....</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1350343297818</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:21:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you are optimistic.

On the back of all of the run up to earnings, Intel has warned! No doubt, intel is for sure snapping up its own stock at these prices. Hell, we're at 2009 prices, with NOW the float down near 15%, sales up near 100%, EPS up near 35%. Risk today is far less than it was 3 years ago. Yes, the market has reacted to slow down in PC sales. Though look at the facts. - Intel now selling phone chips. - Intel now selling Tablet chips. - Intel now selling security software - Intel now selling phone chipsets - Intel now has most advanced mass production manufacturing platform on earth, some 2 years ahead of its competitors.
