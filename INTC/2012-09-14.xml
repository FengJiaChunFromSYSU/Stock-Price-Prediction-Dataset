Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco, company senior fellow Mark Bohr presented a roadmap demonstrating Intel's continued leadership in semiconductor manufacturing process technology. Intel disclosed that its upcoming 14nm process nodes – codenamed P1272 and P1273 – are slated for production readiness by the end of 2013. The vendor added it will continue pouring investment into its D1X fab in Oregon, Fab 42 in Arizona and Fab 24 in Ireland. Intel previously confirmed that the three fabs are set for investment for 14nm and below processes. In addition, R&amp;D for 10nm, 7nm and 5nm processes will kick off on schedule starting 2015, Intel noted. In May 2011, Intel announced its three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistors, a breakthrough enabling chips to operate at lower voltage with lower leakage while providing improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous transistors. The new transistors have been used in Ivy Bridge-based Intel Core family processors with high-volume production starting around the end of 2011.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347600901117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:35:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347600970637-6</Id><Topic><Title>Intel says 14nm process ready for production by end of 2013</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347600901117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:35:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"In addition, R&amp;D for 10nm, 7nm and 5nm processes will kick off on schedule starting 2015, Intel noted."

Because they are fixing to bust a move on ARM, analysts and the big Wall Street firms...] Intel provided the first look at the system-on-chip variant of its 22-nm process technology in a talk at the Intel Developer Forum here Thursday. “It’s fair to say Intel didn’t have much of a focus four or five years ago on SoCs, but that’s changed,” said Mark Bohr, director of Intel’s technology and manufacturing group in a process technology talk. “The success of Medfield [Intel’s 32-nm smartphone platform] shows we are learning to do it right, and I think we will have a technology advantage at 22 nm,” he said. Intel showed at IDF six smartphones and four Windows 8 tablets using the Medfield SoC, made in an SoC variant of its 32-nm process. “There’s a lot more in the pipeline,” said Ticky Thakkar, a lead Atom designer in a separate talk on the mobile chips. The company is already shipping to OEMs a 2-GHz version of Clover Trail, a follow on 32nm dual-core processor with boosted graphics. A 1.8-GHz version for tablets is also in the works. Next up is Bay Trail, Intel’s first 22-nm SoC for tablets and smartphones, expected to debut at IDF Beijing. “You’ll have to wait until next year to hear about it,” said Thakkar. In a separate talk, Bohr described P1271, the 22-nm SoC process to be used for Bay Trail. It differs from the 22-nm CPU process now used for Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors by offering lower leakage logic transistors, higher voltage I/O transistors, denser upper layer interconnects and a set of precision resistors, capacitors and inductors. “It’s not one set of features, but a menu of feature options—transistors, I/O, interconnects, passive elements and embedded memory,” Bohr said. “The [SoC] transistors go down to much lower leakage levels, but give up some performance,” he said. The process has significantly better analog characteristics than Intel’s current 32-nm planar process. Designs make heavy use of 80-nm pitch features in lower metal layers, because they are the smallest features Intel can make at 22 nm without needing double patterning, he added. Intel is running the process at three fabs, two in the U.S. and one in Israel. It will ramp soon in two other fabs.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347601534391</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:45:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347602117986-8</Id><Title>Intel Plans to Get Rid of Desktop Cables</Title><Msg>From Fudzilla: IDF 2012: Lead by Wireless Gigabit alliance Intel has just demonstrated the 802.11ad wireless standard that will use currently unoccupied 60MHz channel. For a few that might be familiar with 802.11n and new coming and slowly adopting 802.11ac they both use 20MHz or 40MHz channels at 2.5 or 5GHz that are already pretty busy. The first demo didn’t work, but when they got it up a few minutes later, the notebook managed to communicate to two monitors via wireless and the wireless hard drive also connected without and performed fast enough to play Full HD content. The plan is to get rid of most of cables on our beloved desks. Again the problem remains the fact that wireless tends to fail when you get a lot of devices using the same 60MHz band, and sooner or later it will also get crowded over there and you don’t want your monitors to be disrupted because there are too many people at the trade show. The 802.11ad certification program is slated for mid-2013 and the certified parts can be expected a year later. Intel hopes that a lot of devices will end up using this new standard. The plan is to kill connectors in the next few years.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347602117986</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:55:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347602320714-9</Id><Title>IDF: Intel says low-power processors to fuel future of mobile computing innovation</Title><Msg>Intel's chief product officer has described how its low-power processors, starting with the company's fourth-generation Intel Core processor family available in 2013, will set a new standard for mobile computing experiences and innovative ultrabook, convertible and tablet designs. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco, David Perlmutter said Intel reduced the platform idle power of its fourth-generation Intel Core processor family based on the next-generation Haswell microarchitecture by more than 20 times over the second-generation while delivering outstanding performance and responsiveness. He also said Intel will add a new line of even lower-power processors based on the same microarchitecture to its roadmap starting in 2013. Both new products underscore the company's focus to aggressively drive power consumption down to enable longer battery life and a wave of new, more mobile designs, while delivering ever-increasing processor, graphics and media performance. Since Intel created and invested in the ecosystem for the new category of ultrabook systems in 2011, it has already inspired dramatic innovation in personal computing, the company claimed. More than 140 different ultrabook designs are in development, a number of which are convertibles, with more than 70 powered by third-generation Intel Core processors available today.

Just another analyst jumping on the bandwagon of the "death of the PC" group. As if Intel has not warned before. I wonder if Citigroup or other hold or sell analysts thought that Intel would reach a quarterly revenue base of $13.2 Billion for Q3 of 2012 when they made comments on Intel back in 2010. Back in 2010 Q3, Intel deliver revenue of $11.1 Billion. And that was an 18% year over year growth for that quarter. Did they think at that time that Intel will grow another 19% in the following two years for Q3? I think their expectations were much smaller for 2012 back then. Yet now, they complain that Intel is in trouble. That's when the iPad first came out also. So after the iPad grew to 17 million unit sales in 2 years, Intel's revenue still grew 19% in 2 years. Maybe because Intel is still enjoying some PC sales growth with higher ASP while enjoying huge growth in servers due to the high dependence on servers by iPads and iPhones or Android smartphones. Looks like they are choosing to ignore those facts for now.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1347603837918</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 02:23:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347606571315-12</Id><Title>Obama leads Slick Willard by 7 points!!!...</Title><Msg>Not good for the GOP. * Lead growing over past week * A tighter race on economic issues By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama widened his lead over Republican challenger Mitt Romney to 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters on Thursday, the latest survey to show the Democrat ahead in the run-up to the Nov. 6 election. The daily online poll asked 990 likely voters over the previous four days which candidate they would pick if the vote took place today, with 48 percent choosing Obama and 41 percent picking Romney. The gap has been widening since Obama grabbed the lead in the rolling poll on Sept. 7 when he scooped up 46 percent of likely voters to Romney's 44 percent after the Democratic convention. "What that really means is that Obama is in good shape," said Ipsos pollster Julia Clark, attributing some of Obama's uptick to the slowly improving sentiment toward the direction of the country shown in Wednesday's telephone poll. Among all 1,231 registered voters surveyed online, Obama led with 45 percent to Romney's 39 percent. Thursday's online poll also found far more registered voters preferred the incumbent's policies and approach on taxes (41 percent picked Obama, 30 percent Romney), healthcare (44 percent Obama, 28 percent Romney) and Social Security (39 percent Obama, 27 percent Romney). Asked which of the candidates had a better plan, policy or approach to the war on terrorism, more registered voters again favored Obama: 39 percent to Romney's 25 percent. Foreign policy moved to the center of the campaign this week after four Americans, including an ambassador, were killed in Libya as protests raged in Benghazi and Cairo in neighboring Egypt against an anti-Islam film made in the United States. The two candidates ranked closely on the U.S. economy: 36 percent said Obama's approach was better, versus 35 percent for Romney. Obama held a slight lead of 38 percent to Romney's 35 percent on jobs and unemployment, despite poor unemployment figures last Friday. But 35 percent of registered voters found Romney's policies and plans on the federal deficit were better than Obama's. Thursday's poll showed Obama with 31 percent. Independents - a key voting bloc - favored neither of the candidate's policies on many issues. "Neither candidate has established credibility on these issues," Clark said. "Neither candidate is really doing it for these independents." Asked for whom they would vote for in Thursday's poll, the small pool of independents preferred Romney with 35 percent to Obama's 26 percent, which Clark attributed to their high focus on economic issues. The precision of Reuters/Ipsos rolling daily online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points for all respondents.

In other words, the PC did not die. Collectively, Intel grew its earnings by 83%. As for TXN, they are expected to grow from an EPS of $1.15 in 2009 to a downward revised expected EPS of $1.68 in 2012. That's a 3 year total growth of about 46%. If what Intel is reporting is bad, then TXN is reporting alot worse. Yet TXN is trading at 17 times its 2012 earnings, while Intel is trading at only 10.9 times is 2012 earnings. Intel should deserve a higher PE than TXN given the fact that Intel could have a brighter future due to its 5 year lead in technlogical advancements in chip fabrication. Over the long term, it will all boil down to that chip fabrication advancements.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1347607500816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 03:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347619067616-14</Id><Title>$25,financial companies have money buying intel stock</Title><Msg>Intel's Haswell chips are engineered to cut power use</Msg><Username>oppsfin</Username><Timestamp>1347619067616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347622259615-15</Id><Topic><Title>How low do we go????</Title><Username>hedgecutter10</Username><Timestamp>1347569854590</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 16:57:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look for solid support around the 600 day (dividend adjusted) moving average currently $22.14. $23 is also holding up quite well which is nearer the unadjusted 600 day moving average.

Operating within regulations the technology can deliver high speed data but over very short range, as in the same room. Intel uses it for Widi. There are competing radio technologies that can do the same thing using licensed exempt spectrum.

For the past dozen years, the stock price has gone nowhere. I believe the current stock price is lower today than when Otellini was named CEO, and how is that for long term shareholders? Each new chip compression is supposed to generate new and bigger shareholder results, at least that is what management is preaching, and it isn`t, so what is wrong with this picture? Just maybe, could it be that INTC has become derailed and completely lost focus of what its mission is supposed to be?

Big, big news...] Intel has unveiled plans to transition to 14nm process technology for the manufacture of CPUs and SoCs at the end of 2013, and begin R&amp;D for 10nm and below processes on schedule from 2015. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco, company senior fellow Mark Bohr presented a roadmap demonstrating Intel's continued leadership in semiconductor manufacturing process technology. Intel disclosed that its upcoming 14nm process nodes – codenamed P1272 and P1273 – are slated for production readiness by the end of 2013. The vendor added it will continue pouring investment into its D1X fab in Oregon, Fab 42 in Arizona and Fab 24 in Ireland. Intel previously confirmed that the three fabs are set for investment for 14nm and below processes. In addition, R&amp;D for 10nm, 7nm and 5nm processes will kick off on schedule starting 2015, Intel noted. In May 2011, Intel announced its three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistors, a breakthrough enabling chips to operate at lower voltage with lower leakage while providing improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous transistors. The new transistors have been used in Ivy Bridge-based Intel Core family processors with high-volume production starting around the end of 2011.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347630870948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347630982945-33</Id><Topic><Title>Doom and Gloom Crowd Taking Big Losses</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347630427062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How's that doom and gloom worked out for you the last two days, Little Stew?

Intel is already in Smartphones - I don't think Motorola/Google, ZTE, and Orange would have adopted Intel (Medfield) just to humor Intel - and without a compelling roadmap. Regarding Tablets: I cannot imagine most buyers buying $150-500 tablets to the exclusion of PCs and MACs. Tablets are, in fact, just small display screens that can provide Internet access (entertainment, information, etc. ) and lets you play some minor games. After the initial couple of weeks, even kids pick up the tablets only occasionally. To me, it appears that Tablets are impulse buys for a bit of fun now and then. Over time, I expect most buyers to gravitate towards convertible laptops for their next purchase - laptop when you need the keyboard, tablet when you want to use touch. And all data stored in one place! Also, with its process lead, I think Intel can play both low power and high performance on a single CPU/SoC better than anyone else.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347634827855</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:00:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347634893092-68</Id><Title>INTC/MOT Deal</Title><Msg>LIKE TWO GARBAGE TRUCKS COLLIDING!</Msg><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1347634893092</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:01:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347634913904-69</Id><Topic><Title>Cockroaches Appear to be Upset Today</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347634696130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:58:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Must be the huge IDF bump that's got them upset.</Msg><Username>wallus_weener</Username><Timestamp>1347634913904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347635027276-70</Id><Title>any time you see wallybagger post on your board, you go short</Title><Msg>easy money... just read his post in hilt. stock tank 70% since he started to pump that stock</Msg><Username>nikiem5</Username><Timestamp>1347635027276</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347635056577-71</Id><Title>Great buy here if you can hold 1-3 years.

As was pointed out in the WSJ article when INTC warned of weakness, this is when manufacturer demand for CPUs should be strong as they ramp up for Win8 and Christmas, but it's not happening. That should tell you that demand for PCs among consumers is weak. Consumers will be buying smart phones and tablets for Christmas, not PCs. The "death of the PC" hyperbole is of course overdone, but the consumer switch to mobile devices is real. The average consumer has absolutely no need for a desktop computer or even a laptop once they have a smart phone. And businesses are certainly not waiting on Win8. In fact, indications are they will avoid it as it is not really designed for desktop use. Of course, since XP goes off extended support in 2014, businesses who have been holding out will upgrade to Win7, which will be good until 2020. This will be good for Microsoft, and of course, the upgrades will help Intel too, but the loss of consumer demand is a serious problem for Intel while Microsoft has its bases covered with Win8 (which, of course, could flop, but only time will tell). Obviously Intel has missed the boat on mobile thus far; the stock is reflecting this reality. Perhaps they can get back in the game, but certainly not for this Christmas. The good news is, there are other factors, such as the attractive div yield, that will support the stock price at these lower levels.</Msg><Username>byrons_weener</Username><Timestamp>1347636055984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:20:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347636546540-74</Id><Topic><Title>Doom and Gloom Crowd Taking Big Losses</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347630427062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The short interest as of 8/31 is the highest that I have seen in several years at 176m shares and has been growing 1mil shares a day since early April.

There were some small, weak REITs that were yielding in that range but it was well known that they would not be able to continue at that level since they were forced to pay dividends at high levels but did so by issuing stock to pay for the dividends. When the dividend yield of Intel reaches a certain level, it will be arbitraged by purchasing shares with borrowed money. When they can borrow money at a lower rate than the dividend, you will hit a floor. Intel even issued $5bil worth of notes to buy shares.

Well there are a lot of problems with this idea. First one doesn't want to send their individual palm scans to websites that would be the ideal opportunity for privacy invasion and allow site operators to associate every site, page, file and link an individual visits to a specific person. One might as well use their social security number as password. And secondly, whatever digital signature is created by a palm scan can be stolen by malware on the user's PC, just like fingerprint and other biometric scan signatures are already stolen by malware. Two factor authentication arguably delivers better security than single factor authentication but using a separate token in combination with a password at least doesn't permanently compromise one's identity in the process. In the larger picture though there is a worrisome and consistent attitude Intel seems to have developed regarding the flagrant use of one's identity and privacy as a foundation of their future. It started with the mandated use of Intel's Identity Protection and Anti-Theft Protection in Ultrabooks, it continued with their proposed settop box that would employ facial reconginition technology to monitor consumers watching TV in the privacy of their own homes, and it continues with the soda machine that photographs consumers making purchases of beverages. Would your health insurance company consider you high risk for diabetes because you chose a classic Coke instead of a diet drink? There are a lot of ways Intel can innovate and create new revenue streams but building a future by exploiting consumer's privacy should not be one of them.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1347640714172</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347641110533-81</Id><Topic><Title>Office for Windows RT Lacks Features</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347630705847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:51:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the business world will go with intel inside</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1347641110533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347641586240-82</Id><Topic><Title>PC is NOT dead, it's waiting on Windows 8</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1347624538945</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 08:08:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks. Royalty Trusts are high yield normally and normally have a high yield. I bought some LINE at $18 about the same time for high yield. It is now trading at $40 with a 7.3% yield. The TTM yield can get out of whack when the distributions drop. There is a case to be made that Intel vs. trusts is a valid comparison. I would be reluctant to agree that it is valid since Intel has stated that it wants to return 40% of profits as dividend. Intel is only at 30% now and has a wider cash flow buffer.

That would be silly. The palm print would be read at the client machine and then matched locally. The local machine could then generate or retrieve a VERY LONG and VERY SECURE password that the local machine uses to connect automatically to the remote machine. I expect that accounts may have more than one password. One reasonable one that you could type in and others that are unreasonably long with all kinds of special characters, .....

And even IF the second password is very long it can also be stolen by malware. In fact, malware makes password length almost irrelevant. Further it would be very dumb to use a palm scan's second password for every site because as soon as the password is compromised the cybercriminals could gain access to every account the user has. This is precisely the reason security specialists advise PC users not to use the same login credentials across multiple accounts. The reality is that palm scans won't eliminate the recommended practice to maintain separate credentials for separate sites so the notion that this technology is a revolution in PC security simply isn't true.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1347644008724</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:33:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347645201038-87</Id><Title>Wallis Always Plays the Dividend Card Because</Title><Msg>Because it's all he has to justify the fact that he has held this rangebound stock for 10 years.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347645201038</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:53:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>25</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347646060266-88</Id><Title>Buy bac</Title><Msg>Buy bac</Msg><Username>yawnfestblink</Username><Timestamp>1347646060266</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:07:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347647524858-89</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's key weapon - Digital radio - Why your next smartphone may have Intel Inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347643968973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:32:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ditto</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1347647524858</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347649352009-90</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's key weapon - Digital radio - Why your next smartphone may have Intel Inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347643968973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:32:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is not likely to happen if the "all digital" radio technology they're referring to is ultrawideband. Ultrawideband radios operate entirely in baseband and emit low energy pulses over a very wide swath of spectrum that can be as much 1GHz or more. Ultrawideband technology raises the noise floor of any spectrum it steps on. Therefore the FCC has restricted the parameters under which ultrawideband can operate for commercial applications and those restrictions normally limit the useful range to within a single room. This is how Intel's Widi works.

During the Intel Developer Forum, Intel CTO Justin Rattner said the company was looking into techniques that will connect everything that computes, from “the simplest embedded sensors to the most advanced cloud datacentres.” The Moore's Law Radio includes Intel’s latest 22nm tri-gate digital chip processes. The system-on-chip designs for smartphones and tablet computers will be the most likely spot for the all digital radios to be integrated, the company said. The small size and lower cost of integrated digital radios will allow new applications from wearable devices to "The Internet of Things" where devices such as home appliances with sensors can communicate with each other, exchange data and can be operated remotely. Rattner then introduced a next-generation wireless standard called WiGig that operates in the millimeter wavelengths of the radio spectrum and delivers bandwidths well over 5 gigabits per second. Intel said the standard will sharply reduce the number of wires and enable completely wireless docks and displays.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347653065968</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 16:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347654222230-95</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Worrisome Behavior Toward Consumer Privacy</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1347640714172</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:38:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is how Reuters is reporting Intel's announcement. "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Passwords for online banking, social networks and email could be replaced with the wave of a hand if prototype technology developed by Intel makes it to tablets and laptops. Aiming to do away with the need to remember passwords for growing numbers of online services, Intel researchers have put together a tablet with new software and a biometric sensor that recognizes the unique patterns of veins on a person's palm. "The problem with passwords -- we use too many of them, their rules are complex, and they differ for different websites," Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs, said at the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Thursday. "There is a way out of it, and biometrics is an option." Contrary to statements from Intel Labs, biometrics is not a panacea for PC security or reason to abandon the very sound practice of segregating accounts. If it were laptops with fingerprint scanners would have already stopped cybercrime because palms scans are just another from of biometrics. The primary advantage palm scans offer over fingerprint scanners is that the former has a slightly higher accuracy rate identifying the person in front of the PC. However fingerprint scanning error is rarely the cause of identity theft or bank fraud. Bank experts say malware contamination of the client's PC and theft of the customer's confidential credentials (in whatever form it exists) is by far the biggest contributor to fraud. It's fine for Intel to make some incremental improvements in biometric scanning but the claims made by Intel's presenters are way beyond what the technology is capable of achieving.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1347654222230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 16:23:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347654987481-96</Id><Title>IS INTEL OUT OF FAVOR???</Title><Msg>YES!!!

Intel is looking at HETEROGENEOUS designs with small core "x88" along with the main x86 CPU for lowering power consumption. Intel has a number of patents awarded on the big-little core design that date back to the 1990's. SAN FRANCISCO: CHIPMAKER Intel is interested in following ARM's "Big Little" design, though operating system support is needed. As Intel tries to make its way in the smartphone and tablet markets with Medfield and its upcoming Clover Trail processors, the firm is looking at ARM's Big Little paradigm for its low power processors. At IDF, Intel CTO Justin Rattner said the firm is interested in putting different cores on a single die. Rattner, who has overseen Chipzilla's push into wireless radio and system-on-chip (SoC) design said, "The other kind of heterogeneity we've seen on the ARM side is general purpose processors but smaller, slower ones and larger, more powerful ones and moving the workloads around when there is more stuff to do - that's another area of interest [for Intel]. Obviously operating systems must help there. Most operating systems tend to think all the cores are the same, but [they are] not in that case."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1347662334575</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 18:38:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347663366996-102</Id><Topic><Title>Otellini should be ashamed of himself</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1347655483971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 16:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC is UP 12% from a year ago.
