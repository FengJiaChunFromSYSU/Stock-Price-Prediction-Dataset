But how many has he lost through the RIM disaster along with the Nokia loss in share. And now some phone makers have decided to try Intel for the fist time. So ARM is seeing pressure from both the success of Apple causing other ARM based makers to flop and many going to the only real differentiator from Apple which is Intel. Yet many think the success of Apple is helping ARM grow. It is becoming evident that the success of Apple is actually hurting ARM.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1348028146094</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 00:15:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348029172488-2</Id><Title>Motorola Mobility with Intel Inside</Title><Msg>Here's the link: Just Google: Motorola Mobility Good news for Intel.</Msg><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1348029172488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 00:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348029237847-3</Id><Topic><Title>Oops, we completely screwed the dog in the mobile market</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1347975525846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 09:38:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's here with the "Motorola Mobility."

It designs the chips, but has to rely on Samsung to make them). To put matters into perspective: 12 months ago manufacturability of advanced 28nm/32nm was a NO issue in Foundry land - it took all the way to Q1 2012 before the #$%$ hit the fan - oh yeah the times are a changing. After discrediting TriGate the ARM camp just can't wait to get their fingers on it ; years ago Apple assumed Manufacturability was a NO ISSUE / A NO BRAINER - but times has changed since.... as said before it's unrealistic to expect short term Apple business - Intel just needs to hold the course regardless of WS monkeys and Apple will come. iPhone 5: Which semiconductor suppliers are the big winners? More Sharing ServicesShare Print Email Save 09/14/2012 By James Montgomery News Editor September 14, 2012 - Now that the initial dust has settled after Apple's debut of the new iPhone 5, industry watchers are taking a tally of which semiconductor suppliers stand to gain in the newest must-have smartphone. Below is a quick tally of the key features and which suppliers likely benefit. (As usual teardown firms prepare their knives, TechInsights has cooked up a preliminary calculation of the iPhone 5's bill-of-materials.) -- Dual-band WiFi. 4G LTE connectivity, which dramatically accelerates speeds vs. previous models This technology (similar to what the Kindle Fire now uses) increases test times at the module test level, which is a sweetspot for TER's Litepoint business, points out Credit Suisse's Satya Kumar. TER already indicated that this unit already saw a boost in 2Q12 attributable to both the iPhone 5 and Kindle Fire. Going forward, this likely means other smartphone vendors will adopt this technology, and eventually 802.11ac next year -- both of which "are particularly test-intensive" and thus positives for TER, he notes. Barclay's CJ Muse, meanwhile, calls out Qualcomm's 28nm 4G/LTE baseband and Broadcom's 40nm WiFi combo chip. -- Upgrade to the A6 logic chip. Apple's projections of nearly 300m iOS units for 2013 is such a sheer volume that "a seemingly benign metric like SoC die size for iPhone 5 [which is 95 mm2, 22% smaller than the A5] is actually meaningful enough to move the worldwide capex for semiconductor industry by 5% for every 10-sqmm variation," Kumar observes. He factors in 32nm capital intensity, Apple's unit growth and die size, and determines that Apple's chip partner Samsung could keep its logic capex spending flat in 2013 just to keep up with manufacturing the new A6 chips. (Apple also is using a dual-core ARM-A15 cores to run at 2× speed for the CPU, which Apple believes is better than Intel's SoC core roadmap. Barclays' Muse points out that anything that means more 28/20nm chips means more litho-intensive processing, which "should benefit ASML disproportionally." -- More DRAM memory content, no extra NAND. DRAM content in the iPhone 5 is doubled to 1GB; Kumar actually had expected an increase in NAND content in the iPhone 5, but apparently Apple's keeping it steady at 16-32-64GB, which underscores "the cautious commentary on wafer starts and capex from NAND companies," he writes. Among chip tool suppliers possibly affected, KLAC has higher exposure to logic/foundry and LRCX is more heavy into NAND than peers, but the extra DRAM content in the iPhone 5 likely makes up for that. Thus, the extra DRAM and no extra NAND means it's "a wash" for suppliers. -- Upgraded to in-cell display technology. Putting touch sensors inside the panel, vs. adding a separate touch layer on top of the LCD panel, helps reduce the display's thickness, which means the phone can be thinner or more features can be improved such as a bigger longer-life battery, explains Vinita Jakhanwal, director for small and medium displays at IHS iSuppli. LG, Sharp, and Japan Display are all potential suppliers of the in-cell display -- if they can keep up with demand. -- Audio, antenna upgrades mean more sapphire. Sterne Agee's Andrew Huang points to Cirrus Logic as a big beneficiary of a new "wideband audio" feature that can fill up more frequency spectrum to improve voice sound quality. Magnachip Semiconductor gets extra business tied to Cirrus Logic, points out Barclays' Muse. Another winner is Corning, whose Gorilla Glass 2 is likely used as the cover glass for the iPhone 5, he says. Huang also points out the iPhone 5's increased used of sapphire, both as a camera lens cover and as the substrate (silicon-on-sapphire) for the antenna switch to automatically switch antenna connections, is a trend worth watching: "Within the next 12-18 months, we believe sapphire content per mobile phones could increase," he writes, suggesting eventually it might supplant the cover glass material. The silicon-on-sapphire trend likely benefits Rubicon (SoS wafer supplier) and Peregrine Semiconductor (SoS switch component supplier). "Our checks indicate that Rubicon supplies ~30-40% of the market for SoS wafers," he writes, and although a number of other ingot makers are currently getting qualified, "it is much more difficult to core, slice and polish SoS wafers, which suggests margins for SoS wafers are comparable, maybe even lower than those of LED wafers." Muse adds that Magnachip gets a foundry-biz boost from Peregrine, too.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348031771380</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 01:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348032954108-9</Id><Topic><Title>IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO OUR CHILDREN TO VOTE OBAMA OUT IN NOVEMBER.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1347951727820</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 03:02:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFY..idiot.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1348032954108</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 01:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348033175569-10</Id><Title>Gawd forbid Slick Willard wins...</Title><Msg>We will get thrown right back into the Bush years.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1348033175569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 01:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348034517289-11</Id><Title>Intel Calmly and Consistently Moves Toward Success</Title><Msg>Ring another victory up for Intel as today they replaced ARM chips in a major smartphone and entered new markets.

Or TSMC and limited capacity and no state-of-the-art. 7.) If Intel offers its state-of-the-art technology to Apple competitors then Apple will sail into a huge competitive headwind. 8.) If Apple decides to stick with ARM fabrication, they will be unable to stay on the cutting edge of performance and power consumption efficiency. 9.) Wall Street doesn't understand the underlying dynamics within mobility. It's all about the fabrication and Wall Street just doesn't understand fabrication. This has led to significant misjudgments. 10.) Intel has built for the future. ARM is relying on the past. 11.) 14nm is the tipping point. The point at which there is no compelling reason to ever use an ARM processor again. Intel 14nm will have vastly superior processing power along with greater power efficiency. 12.)

But nobody is making Apple pay 30% margins it doesn't want to pay. The way they see it they have a loyal fan base that must buy their phones no matter what horrible processor they put in because they have their music and apps on these devices. When there is no new iPhone out consumers overwhelmingly buy Android based phones four to 1. What does this say? It says that in reality Apple is losing their momentum. You are blowing the horn of a company that is starting to decay. The iPhone5 is now playing catch up to Samsung. What is Apple's best response to better competition? A lawsuit. But let me tell you the ultimate test of knowing when Apple truly F'd. You know all those hotels that bought clock radios that have iPod docs on them? Those connectors work with iPhones, iPads, and all those little other Apple devices. Well, the new iPhone5 won't have it. They could have moved to the industry standard Micro USB. But, nope, Apple wanted to move to one similar, but proprietary. The hotels have a couple of years before this becomes an issue. But when they go Micro USB you'll know that Apple has lost it. Why would they go with Apple again? They've been screwed once by a company that has been losing market share. It's vote of confidence time, which way do you think it will fall?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1348062757105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348062882202-30</Id><Topic><Title>GS upgraded AMD just last week</Title><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1348037612161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 02:53:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They needed a little breathing room for investors to get out the lifeboats.

Sept. 19 (Bloomberg) -- New housing construction rose in August, boosted by the strongest pace of single-family home starts in more than two years that shows an improving real estate market. Beginning construction climbed 2.3 percent to a 750,000 annual rate, less than forecast and restrained by a drop in the building of apartments, from a revised 733,000 annual pace in July, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. Purchases of previously owned houses increased 7.8 percent to a 4.82 million annual rate, the most since May 2010, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for sales to increase to a 4.56 million pace. Another report showed construction began on more single-family homes last month than at any time in the past two years. Benefitting from record-low mortgage rates, more affordable properties and a growing population, the U.S. housing market is starting to climb out of a multiyear slump. Nonetheless, unemployment and tight lending conditions may impede a quicker return to the 5 million to 5.5 million sales pace that the real- estate agents group says constitutes a “normal” market. “Without a doubt, almost every housing metric is doing better than a year ago,” Guy Berger, a U.S. economist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, said before the report. “The fundamentals in housing look good. Inventories are pretty low.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348064944205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348065099468-36</Id><Title>Housing Starts in U.S. Climbed 2.3% in August</Title><Msg>New housing construction rose in August, boosted by the strongest pace of single-family home starts in more than two years that shows an improving U.S. real estate market.

The median estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 767,000. Building permits cooled. Mortgage rates near all-time lows and cheaper properties are driving sales at companies like Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) and propelling construction, one of the economy’s few sources of strength. Tighter credit standards and unemployment above 8 percent for the last three years are hurdles for the industry. “The residential construction industry continues to improve through year-end on low housing inventories and rising demand,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “Home sales are improving slightly and low mortgage rates certainly make housing far more affordable.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348065099468</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348065354790-37</Id><Title>Housing Spells Bad News for the Doom and Gloom Crowd</Title><Msg>Tough news for the big Wall Street firms who have bet heavy on and are trying to produce a US economic downturn.

This manipulation appears to manifest itself in two primary ways. One is what appears to be the use of a cooperative strategy by Wall Street’s largest firms to use a combination of analyst’s reports, reports to the media, timed upgrades/downgrades, and buy/sell strategies by their own trading desks in order to channel the direction of the stock price and to then unethically and perhaps illegally profit from this combination of methodologies. The other is a similar strategy by hedge funds. Hedge funds under current regulations provide little or no visibility of their trading patterns, strategies or activities, essentially allowing them free rein to manipulate stock prices in ways not compatible with the normal trends produced by supply and demand. Both of these situations work to the detriment of the average investor. They tend to drive the smaller or average investor completely out of the stock markets with the conclusion that the “market is rigged”. In fact this certainly appears to be the case in an unfortunate number of circumstances. Let us consider the case of Intel. Intel has been locked in a trading range for years. Even when they recorded five years of 27 percent annual growth, the P/E ratio was continuously and significantly below that of the average S&amp;P 500 company while they performance was hugely better. Every time Intel threatened to move to a higher level, Wall Street’s largest firms would apparently band together with a barrage of downgrades and negative media comments. The result was a continuous valuation under what any reasonable analysis would support as being fair. Whether these firms traded against Intel in addition needs to be determined. I therefore ask for consideration of the following: 1.) An investigation of the manner in which Wall Street’s largest firms internally trade, correlated against analyst recommendations, upgrade/downgrade releases, and reports to the media. 2.) An investigation of the manner of trading across Wall Street’s largest firms to determine if there is any pattern of cooperation or collusion in regards to particular stocks. 3.) The development of new regulations resulting in greater transparency of hedge fund trading in order to determine if they are using money and leverage to manipulate the market and stock prices in a manner inconsistent with stock market fairness and stability. 4.) An investigation of large Wall Street firm and hedge fund trading of Intel Corporation to determine if they are engaged in activities which unfairly or illegally deny Intel a fair valuation. 5.) An investigation into naked shorting of Intel. Thank you for your time and efforts in helping to establish a market environment free of fraud, manipulation and methodologies which disenfranchise smaller investors.

After few tries they finally got a significant design win. Still many want to see an Intel design win the US market and we were told that this can be expected at 2013 as the USA network providers demand a LTE capability for all their new phones. Now even the iPhone has LTE and it was getting hard even for Apple to convince people in the US that LTE is not relevant. Intel is aware of that and it is expected that Intel can finish its LTE modem in 2013 and that it will have a LTE enabled chip with its next generation. It’s interesting that this is the same timing for Nvidia LTE while Qualcomm already stunned the market with its S4 LTE enabled chip that everyone wants. The new Intel-based RAZR doesn’t have LTE support, but even in the US only major cities and metropolitan areas have it decent LTE coverage. Even the suburbs in Silicon valley and surrounding towns have weak and intermittent LTE coverage, while 3G has been almost everywhere you can have a cell signal. Intel got its first major designs out, and it plans to continue winning the major manufacturers with Intel inside powered phones.

You throw out these thoughts without anything to support them. And the bottom line is that they just aren't true. When called on it you just throw out more unsupported thoughts. All of the ARM foundries are struggling. All lack technology. All but Samsung have serious capital problems in funding new fabs. There isn't a lot of money driving these foundries now. GloFlo is not a contender. IBM is not a foundry. The absence of adequate capital for R&amp;D and expansion is the direct result of the fabless concept. That's what that means. Fabless means the ARM shops don't have to pay for fabs. So the foundries will always struggle with capital issues. Intel is facing less and less competition in fabrication and their lead is growing. ARM foundries have no clear path to 14nm and beyond while Intel is already producing. FinFET was an enormous, market-changing achievement. ARM has been in denial every since it happened. The ARM fabrication roadmap ends at 20nm. After that is a caption that says TBD: To be determined. Making things up doesn't change that.

This only proves that being Andy Grove's "gofer" doesn't qualify one to lead the world's largest semiconductor company.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1348072180664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:29:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348073372890-50</Id><Title>amd gaining market shares on intc.</Title><Msg>loadup amd now.</Msg><Username>timeisnowbelong</Username><Timestamp>1348073372890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:49:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348073456427-51</Id><Title>cramer..

Hewlett-Packard's Envy x2 'convertible' laptop uses Intel's new dual-core Clover Trail chip. (Credit: Hewlett-Packard) Intel is going to kick off the season of the Windows 8 tablet by hosting an event next week attended by virtually all of the major PC players. The September 27 event will highlight products using Intel's "Clover Trail" Z2760 (PDF) power-efficient system-on-a-chip (SoC) processor. "A media event to showcase the latest Intel-based tablet and tablet convertibles, and announce details about the next generation Intel Atom processor (formerly code-named 'Clover Trail')," Intel said in a note sent out to journalists. Related stories Intel's Erik Reid, general manager of Application Processor Platforms in the Mobile and Communications Group, will host the event at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Joining him will be executives from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE, according to Intel. Those companies will showcase new devices. Tablets and convertibles using the new Intel chip will come with the full version of Windows 8, which can run virtually anything a Windows 7 laptop can. This differs from tablets based on Windows RT: those devices cannot run so-called "legacy" Windows software.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1348106084400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 21:54:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348106937991-113</Id><Topic><Title>Attention all tech people</Title><Username>kblank657</Username><Timestamp>1348087981231</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 16:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The ignorant and uninformed will sell now at the bottom buying into the negative hype.

The bigger question is what is the trend that will play out in the future. With the huge success of mobile devices in the market, the demand for chips that power them which are all fabricated at these foundries has suddenly shot up. This is very different from the situation 5 years ago. The gap between Intel and the foundries that you are seeing today is a result of the fact that there was no significant demand for foundry fabrication resources 5 years ago. Fast forward and you see the foundries neck and neck with Intel. Low power is a new area for Intel and that's where all the action is in the future. Low power IA is an abject failure and Intel is taking its time realizing this. It's a bitter pill for them to swallow.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1348113567653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 23:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
