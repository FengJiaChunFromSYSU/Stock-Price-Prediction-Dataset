If this transaction is completed, Sprint will no longer be required by the terms of the Equityholders' Agreement to appoint at least one independent director. Also, Sprint, either on its own, or at the direction of Softbank if their proposed transaction is successfully completed, may elect to change its designees on our board of directors." - 10Q p. 51 How did everyone miss this? Because of the cause and effect of: "seven directors will be nominated by Sprint (one of whom must qualify, for so long as there are not more than two independent designees, as an independent director...)" As a result of McCaw's board seat becoming independent, there are now 3 (more than two) independent designees. Therefor Sprint can designate a full 7 of 13 board seats. This will not give them complete control as 75% vote is still required for a merger and must be approved by Intel and Comcast. And 10 of 13 votes are required for certain actions. But it will give them the ability to claim majority control of the board if they choose to. Re: Sprint will be able to take Majority Control of the Board after McCaw deal closes By nivegulu.Oct 27, 2012 4:03 PM.Permalink If that is true then it's a lawsuit waiting to happen!. It means that we have been sold out (for a fraction of the intrinsic spectrum value) for 3 years with the "make whole" clause ostensibly covering the transaction. Also, any third party cannot buy out clear or their spectrum fair and square in an unskewed fashion (without facing uncalled for resistance). I think this invokes the "breach of fiduciary duty" laws towards clear's shareholders, and the respondents would be clear's board incuding McCaw. Re: Re: Sprint will be able to take Majority Control of the Board after McCaw deal closes By nivegulu.Oct 28, 2012 1:48 AM.Permalink Also, that may be the reason intel and comcast are'nt selling their shares for a song. They know that if they do so wittingly (knowing there will be a tilt in control of the company's ownership) it would amount to a breach of fiduciary duty and cheating of the public shareholders. Moreover, if they have not voiced their vote of dissent over the ERH deal at the board level, the only way they (intel for now) can now redeem and indemnify themselves is to purchase McCaws shares under the ROFB for the "right price" -that which reflects the true asset value of the company (i.e. clear)."

And that didn't work. But now they are dancing around in glee because they figured out that the correct strategy is to make the PC operating system look like the mobile phone operating system. The problem, of course, is the lack of discipline, lack of confidence, propensity to panic, disregard for professional needs, and over-reaction to tablets such that they think a tablet operating system should be on all computers. They could just have a separate operating system for tablets. For instance, when sitting at a desktop the reach for the mouse is a shorter reach than for the screen. And so who would want to pay extra for a touch screen on a desktop ? Or who wants to have the large desktop screen so close to the face ? But Windows 7 is supported until the year 2020. So the PC makers might be making a mistake if they don't offer a choice of Win 7 or Win 8.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1351434664575</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 10:31:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351434815979-7</Id><Topic><Title>W8 Reviews - What They Don't Say</Title><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1351376841744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that ape, Balmer, still CEO of MSFT?

Nay, it begs to be touched. I checked out the standard version of Microsoft's latest operating system, which debuted Friday, on Dell's new XPS 12, a slick, powerful convertible that uses Intel's robust and road-tested Ivy Bridge architecture. Here's what I found. The XPS 12 and other convertibles give users the ability to easily switch back and forth between tablet and a clamshell/keyboard mode. Except for obvious applications like word processing, however, I didn't use the keyboard much. Windows 8's brightly colored Live Tiles invite touch and, despite some getting used to, I found it faster and more efficient to touch, tap and swipe my way around the system instead of clicking and clacking .. The first thing you'll notice about a Windows 8 tablet or PC is how fast it boots. The XPS 12, running a powerful Intel Core i7 chip and carrying 8 GB of RAM, was fully on about eight seconds after a cold boot. Shutting down was even faster--about three seconds. Microsoft and its hardware partners have clearly fulfilled their promise to deliver the sort of on/off experience that we've come to expect from consumer appliances.

Microsoft's Building Windows 8 blog has been buzzing the last few days. Today, Redmond is talking about Windows 8 boot times. Specifically, the company is addressing the fact that the operating system can boot too quickly at times. According to Microsoft, Windows 8 can boot in as little as seven seconds. While most people herald this as good news, Microsoft understands that some of us actually want to interrupt that boot. However, though we might want to go mucking around in the BIOS or boot from an alternative device, Microsoft's Chris Clark says there is no longer enough time for detect keystrokes like F2 or F8. Clark goes on to say that while Microsoft isn't about to sacrifice its fast boot time to preserve these functions, there is a solution for those of us that live for F8 or that little "Press F2 for Setup" message.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351478143115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:35:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351479802164-26</Id><Topic><Title>OMG, the 8 second boot time becomes the new In-Dell mantra</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1351470770364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:32:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, the infamous mantra of the Microsoft-In-Dell consortium.

A review unit landed on my desk this weekend, and I wanted to offer up some first impressions as a prelude to the eventual review. A demonstration of the Dell XPS 12 Flip Hinge Design A demonstration of the Dell XPS 12 Flip Hinge Design This hybrid design is one that, in tandem with Microsoft’s Surface and the plethora of convertibles on the horizon, is poised to kill the traditional laptop. At first glance its flexible form factor is not only physical but also symbolic: Dell has given equal attention to the business professional and the savvy consumer. (More on that in the final review.) Microsoft Surface: First Impressions and Shattered Misconceptions Jason Evangelho Jason Evangelho Contributor The first thing that jumped out at me was the insane boot speed. From power on to ready to work in 11 seconds. Primary credit for this goes to Samsung’s 256GB solid-state drive, but also to the 8GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-3517U. The XPS 12 is lightning fast, and it effortlessly handled importing roughly 50GB of music from a networked drive, syncing email and Skydrive folders, and browsing via Internet Explorer 10 with a dozen tabs open (simultaneously). I’ll run benchmarks in the near future, but this first impression didn’t disappoint. The XPS 12 display boasts a 1920 x 1080 resolution on a 12.5” screen, covered edge to edge with Corning Gorilla Glass. It emits as much brightness as Microsoft’s Surface (400 nit) and is stunning to behold. The aspect ratio results in an awesome movie-watching experience, and an equally enjoyable time flipping through magazines in portrait mode.

However, it did hitch when rotating between landscape and portrait position, taking just under 2 seconds to reorient itself. (I tested this with Word and a few other applications to be sure it wasn’t a software bottleneck. It may in fact be common across Windows 8, but more research is required). This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it is slower than the 3rd generation iPad or Asus Transformer Prime. Let’s briefly discuss the overall build quality. The chassis is made from machined aluminum, and the entire rim of the device (including the flip hinge) is composed of anodized aluminum. This combination lends the XPS 12 a wholly professional and sleek appearance. More importantly, every inch of this hardware looks and feels premium. Dell XPS 12 Metal Plate Something about this metal plate on the bottom of the unit screams quality The design decision I appreciate most is that the back of the display and bottom of the XPS 12 are both lined with a carbon fiber composite. It feels soft against your fingers and cool to the touch – important when it’s resting on your lap. One more bit of praise bordering on giddiness: The glass integrated trackpad feels downright luxurious. Seriously, head to your local tech retailer and touch the thing. Unfortunately there was one disappointing realization in examining the XPS 12 — no SD card slot, not even MicroSD. In all fairness, this could be a dealbreaker for some of you. During my first few hours with the XPS 12 I listened to a substantial amount of music. While ultrabooks and tablets definitely aren’t renowned for their superior audio quality, the maximum volume was surprisingly loud while remaining clear and without any distortion. This warrants a bit more exploration, but one thing’s certain: When this converts to tablet mode for media consumption, you won’t be straining to hear what you’re watching as with so many other products. Like my introductory time with the Surface, Dell’s XPS 12 will be a new experience for many consumers and those curious about Windows 8. My initial impression is nothing but delight. If this is the future of post-PC hardware, bring it on. I’ll reiterate that this isn’t a full review, but may serve as a tipping point if you’ve been curious about this particular Windows 8 convertible. Stay tuned for my final (and much deeper) analysis early in November.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1351480636273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351481308851-28</Id><Topic><Title>Dell XPS Ultrabook review - This guys loves it and loves the future of the PC</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1351480636273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:17:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm, this one boots in 12 seconds with a solid state drive, so who is lying? BTW, nobody wants tablets. This is a huge investment in absolutely nothing. NEC had the Versa in 1992 and nobody wanted it. Nothing has changed. You can't type comfortably on it, so there goes about 90% of your target market. Get a holographic keyboard and then you might have something.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1351481308851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:28:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351481443997-29</Id><Topic><Title>Dell XPS Ultrabook review - This guys loves it and loves the future of the PC</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1351480636273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:17:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have GOT to come into the correct CENTURY!!!
