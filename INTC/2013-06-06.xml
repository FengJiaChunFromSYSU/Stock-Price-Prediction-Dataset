Windows RT, the version of Windows 8 designed for more power-efficient ARM processors, made its official debut at last year's show on a convertible tablet by Asus. The operating system has suffered a shaky period since its October launch, with disappointed comments from partners, fire sales from manufacturers, and unflattering performance comparisons all contributing to a general sense of negativity. The Computex show floor has been dominated by devices running Windows 8 on Haswell and other chips from Intel, but ARM-powered units have been conspicuous in their absence.

Merrifield, which is an Atom processor based around a 22 nm design, is one such chip that Intel was showing off, and the silicon could have a huge impact in the smartphone market in 2014. Merrifield is for phones what Silvermont is doing for tablets in the Atom space for Intel. Designed to compete against ARM Holdings’ designs, which have dominated the mobile market due to Intel’s slow embrace for smartphone and tablet silicons, Merrifield will offer competitive features, especially when paired with Intel’s new 4G LTE modem that offers global compatibility with all LTE bands used around the world. The 22 nm architecture for the chip will mean that Merrifield should be able to deliver powerful performance while at the same time being conservative on battery life. Intel’s also promising that Merrifield will also incorporate a sensor support hub. The company’s press release says that Intel showed for the first time a “smartphone reference design platform based on “Merrifield,” Intel’s next-generation 22nm Intel Atom SoC for smartphones that will deliver increased performance and battery life. The platform includes an integrated sensor hub for personalized services, as well as capabilities for data, device and privacy protection.” And while Merrifield is now announced, devices won’t ship until 2014. CES 2014 could set the stage for a huge game changer in the mobile industry where Intel may be regaining its hold on the silicon market in mobile.

The new offerings included everything from phablets to tablets running Intel Atom and NVIDIA Tegra processors, to a surprising convertible device running dual processors and both Android and Windows 8 operating systems. The Transformer Book Trio features Intel’s latest 4th Generation Core i7, the 4500U series processor, and an Atom processor, the Z2580, in one device that can be a full-function notebook, tablet or a powerful desktop. The sleek design featured Asus’ traditional brushed aluminum with concentric circles swirl on the back. It includes more than a terabyte of storage split between the two components of the system, base/keyboard dock and screen. In addition to dual processors, and dual OS feature, it has dual batteries (a 33.5-watt/hour cell and a 19.5-watt/hour cell), a healthy amount of storage (1 terabyte and 64GB), and an 11.6-inch full-HD capable screen. When running on Atom, the detachable tablet runs Android Jelly Bean and will last up to 15 hours on a single charge. When running the Core i7 processor in full-feature mode it runs Windows 8. When connected to a monitor, the Transformer Trio serves as full-function computer even when the tablet is being used separately. Hence the three-in-one. “It’s a perfect combo of full-function notebook, mobile tablet and a very powerful desktop PC,” Shih said, adding that the device allows the user to switch between Windows and Android modes “instantaneously.” More innovation such as this is coming to market where Intel will provide the parts of choice. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Sanford Bernstein will all look like fools, once again for doubting Intel.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370508948668</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 04:55:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370512103474-16</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370237011973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Market is going to implode!</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370512103474</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 05:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370513381018-17</Id><Title>The bears have a point. We haven't seen 35 in over ten years.</Title><Msg>While I fully agree with Wallis and Ashraf regarding INTC's future, the market is taking a wait-and-see attitude. A "show me the money" stance before jumping on board. IMHO, this means that we won't see significant stock movement until late this year, or early next year. This also hinges on the PC refresh that was predicted with WIN 8 last year. Maybe this refresh will happen with 8.1, Haswell, and the tablet. The PC market we knew and loved, the one where people bought a new computer every two years is done. It's been replaced with a tablet/smartphone market that is akin to a subscription market. When your smartphone contract in done, buy a new phone. When the new tablet comes out, buy it. People can pop in a new CPU and Crossfire or SLI a graphics card to extend the life of their PC. Unfortunately, even though we are going to buy more than 1 billion (yes billion) tablets and smartphones per year for the near future and the pendulum is swinging into INTC's favor, we have to prove the multiple we deserve. 320 million PCs is not 350 million and Wall Street seems to think that a cheaper CPU just means less money. With the previous domination of ARM, this is essentially an untapped, new market. A market that will dwarf PCs sales. INTC has already taken the necessary steps to succeed. Unfortunately again, we won't see stock movement past 35 until we start showing some fantastic earnings growth. Or maybe I'm just #$%$ because it seems Wall Street can see what I see... I can't remember the last time I wanted to be totally wrong.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370513381018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 06:09:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370516066052-18</Id><Topic><Title>The bears have a point.

So Intel has developed products that make them competitive in the tablet and smartphone market. Early indications are promising but there are no gaurantees. And it will not happen overnight but the longterm prospects for Intel are good: Every new generation of processsors requires billions in capital investment, research and manufacturing and cost more than the prrevious generation. This leaves fewer and fewer players and no other company has Intel's vertically integrated business model-It captures all the margins. So if your outlook is short term this is not the stock for you.</Msg><Username>kip_castle</Username><Timestamp>1370516066052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 06:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370518687285-19</Id><Topic><Title>The bears have a point.

I would like to point out that Barron's has a great point that INTC could double over the next 5 years, but this begs the question that if this is true, how much will it gain in 2 years? While Haswell should assert Intel as one of the big players in mobile phones and tablets, I believe that next generation of processors coming out in the next 6 months to a year will show that Intel may not just be a big player but be THE main player. If this is the case, we could potentially see same pretty nice gains here over the next year or so. That would give Intel long enough to prove that this move into mobile is something they're adamant about. It's also enough time for Intel to prove that they're getting sales high enough to prove to investors (*cough cough* earnings) that this will be a highly profitable endeavor for the company. Over the last 10 years, my view of Intel has been that they make the best product in a dwindling market (desktop PCs). Now, Intel plans on transitioning their strengths as a CPU company and putting these CPUs into the next generation of "cool" products (tablets and smartphones). If they can capture the market and have numbers to prove this capture via actual sales numbers and profit margins, it'll be a great day for longs. I've heard many times throughout my life that "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." However, it seems like this old dog might have just found a way to do the same old trick in a different outfit. This is a CPU company not a PC company. There's a new and exciting genre of products to put the next generation of awesome CPUs into. The more the price can be decreased, the larger the reachable market. That oldskool glossary word "economies of scale" comes to mind...

They completely failed to understand the impact of FinFET and Intel's serious manufacturing superiority. They completely failed to understand how fast Intel was going to eliminate ARM's power efficiency advantage. While Wall Street may have a few temporary successes with counter-attacks attempting to construct an exit strategy for their massively unprofitable short positions, the deck is stacked against them. Intel gets stronger every day while ARM barely has a roadmap going forward. The tipping point has arrived. What we also know now is that ARM has a massive fabrication and manufacturing problem. In spite of press releases to the contrary, it is going to be years before their current efforts result in volume production. No one is sure if they ever will develop FinFET much less when. More and more every day it is clear what a disruptive tachnology FinFET is turning out to be. It has brought us the tipping point and the end of the ARM era. What we know now is that Intel is enjoying a massive advantage in press cycles because of their strong and continuous roadmap and product pipeline and that this advantage is reaching the most important group - consumers. As we know from Computex, ARM has nothing until 2014/2015 to generate press or excitement. What we also know now is that Intel's growing relationship with Samsung has hastened the tipping point. 2013: Year of the Intel Tablet 2014: Year of the Intel Smartphone</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370525450888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:30:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370525469326-44</Id><Title>HERE WE GO - SHORTS ARE GONNA GET FRIED TODAY</Title><Msg>COVER NOW SHORTIES!</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370525469326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:31:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370525878881-45</Id><Title>INTEL INSIDE GALAXY S4</Title><Msg>That was no mistake on the intel slide....it is coming</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370525878881</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370526078670-46</Id><Title>GALAXY TAB 3 10" WITH LTE 4G SUPPORT WORLDWIDE</Title><Msg>THIS IS BIG.

Another variant, the Galaxy S4 Zoom, could also be announced soon, possibly at the June 20 Premiere launch as well. However, a leak straight from Intel’s keynote slide suggests a Galaxy S4 variant may eventually be offered, with the device powered by an Intel powertrain, rather than the presently-available Exynos and Qualcomm processors. Samsung and Intel do have a bit of history with each other, and the leak points at the chance of an Intel-powered Galaxy S4 to join the recently confirmed Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 and 8.0, which will both contain Intel processors under the hood. Samsung has yet to confirm this report, and there has been no mention whether specifications of the purported Intel Galaxy S4 variant will be the same for the most part. However, the device is rumored to be part of Samsung’s IFA 2013 announcement, which may also include the Galaxy Note 3’s launch. Other interesting information spotted on the Intel Atom keynote slide include other devices that may also be powered by the chipmaker’s Atom mobile processors. The gadgets on the slide include the Asus MeMo Pad, FonePad and ZTE Geek, as well as a few ASUS notebooks running on the Windows platform.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370526284139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:44:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370526390481-48</Id><Title>The Galaxy Tab 3 Won’t Be The Last Samsung With Intel Chips</Title><Msg>Samsung is a pretty successful company, mostly because everything it puts inside its gadgets it builds in-house. That’s why it was pretty surprising when the Galaxy Tab 3 came out with an Intel Clover Trail+ processor. Why is Samsung paying for someone else’s chips? We chatted to Intel’s VP and GM of Mobile and Communications Group, Hermann Eul today about the new mobile processors, and he said that Samsung have included the Galaxy because ‘they’ve seen the sense’ of Intel’s ecosystem, and it won’t be the last Samsung device with Intel gear: "I have barely seen Samsung doing one-offs. I think Samsung has discovered the power and richness of our platforms. This is not a one off." Hermann spent an hour at a press conference this afternoon in Taipei laying out the road map for Intel’s next generation chips, showing off next-generation Atom chips — codenamed Bay Trail — on tablets which we’ll see around the end of the year, as well as Merrifield smartphone technology which we’ll see shipped to manufacturers in time for 2014 Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, Intel has Clover Field+, which is a bespoke system for Android tablets which is promising twice the performance of previous Clover Field tablets, as well as longer battery life with better graphics performance. Clover Field+ sits at the heart of the Lenovo K900 which has been shipping to developing markets for the last little while, and it’s also the chipset sitting at the centre of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Intel keeps crowing about its scalable architecture, especially in mobile with Silvermont, and that’s exactly what it’s counting on to see it through the core wars. Taking a swipe at processors like NVIDIA’s Tegra chips that burst out into their additional cores, Hermann said that: “Have you ever seen an eight cylinder engine that has another four cylinder engine next to it?” From Gizmodo Australia</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370526390481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370526394717-49</Id><Title>Samsung’s Galaxy S4 With Intel Inside Could Rule the World</Title><Msg>gottabemobileDOTcom/2013/06/05/samsungs-galaxy-s4-with-intel-inside-could-rule-the-world/ It looks like Samsung may be working on a new version of the Galaxy S4 flagship smartphone, this time eschewing the ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and the Exynos 5 Octa processors for a competing Intel Atom CPU at its heart. A slide revealed by Engadget from Intel’s presentation shows off new mobile devices that have been announced or are coming with Intel CPU inside, and on the slide deck is the Galaxy S4. Given that Intel had announced that it is now adding support for global 4G LTE bands, a Samsung Galaxy S4 with Atom CPU and Intel’s modem could help Samsung deliver one phone that will work on all 4G LTE networks worldwide. This would be a huge win as it will allow Samsung to simplify its products and not have to cater devices to specific markets because of specific radio bands and frequencies. One Galaxy S4 model could work anywhere in the world. The move would also be a huge win for Intel as it would have scored a partnership with the largest maker of Android phones and tablets.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370526394717</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:46:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370526428016-50</Id><Topic><Title>The Galaxy Tab 3 Won’t Be The Last Samsung With Intel Chips</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370526390481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:46:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OMG, that is so totally funny!!!

Intel’s mobile keynote slide had a device we were least not-at-all expecting, the Galaxy S4. So what if Samsung is using an Intel SoC in their newest Galaxy Tab 3, does that warrant for another Galaxy S4 edition using Intel’s Atom chip? Intel’s mobile keynote slide held something that picked everyone’s interest, more than the 9 other devices in the slide. If you count the numerous Galaxy S4 variants, the Galaxy S4 Mini, Active, (rumored) Mega, Zoom, it is completely plausible for Samsung to add yet another variant. If you count the Google Edition and the possible Intel Edition, you have 6 variants of the Galaxy S4. Add the fact that there are two variants of the flagship S4, one with Exynos 5 Octa and the other with a Snapdragon 600 chipset and you start wondering as to what the company is really trying to do. Flooding the market with products is one thing (that Samsung has achieved), this is more like a tidal wave. It is possible that Samsung was simply waiting for an Intel chip with LTE on-board. If our suspicions are true, this would mark the biggest triumph for Intel with Android devices till date.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370526503661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370526680493-54</Id><Title>And So Ends the Shorts Latest Attempt to Construct an Exit Strategy</Title><Msg>After one day.

According to The Verge, the Trio can be used in tablet, notebook, or desktop mode, and the device as a whole contains two Intel processors that are made to handle Android and Windows 8, depending on configuration When using the tablet portion alone, a 2GHz Intel Atom processor powers an 11.6-inch 1920 x 1080 display to run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Once the tablet is attached to the PC Station dock, the operating system can be switched to Windows 8 with the push of a button. In this mode, users have access to a full keyboard and the unit becomes powered by an Intel Core i7 Haswell CPU. Battery life in this configuration is said to last up to 15 hours, and 750GB or 1TB of hard drive space is available for use — up from the 64GB SSD found in the tablet. The PC Station dock can also be connected directly to an external monitor for a more desktop-like experience.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370530902311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:01:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370530933237-70</Id><Topic><Title>so much for Wallys tipping point, he is palpably stunned</Title><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1370529611913</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 10:40:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pig.</Msg><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1370530933237</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:02:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370531038674-71</Id><Title>INTC to be pinned at 25 tomorrow</Title><Msg>HIghest open interest in options is at 25 (17K).

Although it went unannounced in ASUS' Computex 2013 press conference, the Zenbook Infinity garnered a lot of attention from behind its glass case. I managed to come across a fully functional system, equipped with 13.3-inch 2560 x 1440 capacitive touch IPS panel. The back of the display panel is actually covered with Gorilla Glass 3: The Zenbook Infinity maintains ASUS' radial brushed finish, but thanks to the piece of Gorilla Glass 3 the feel is substantially improved. The combination of the metal and the glass cover results in an almost jewelry-like finish, which looks amazing in person. Photos really don't do this thing justice at all. I sincerely hope this marriage of Zenbook design and a glass finish is part of a new design direction for ASUS. If we had a best of show award, I'd totally give it to ASUS for the Zenbook Infinity. Although it looked black at the press event, in person the Infinity actually has a blue finish to it. The keyboard and trackpad both felt great, as did the build quality of the prototype machine. The ASUS logo on the back uses the display's backlight for illumination. The ultra high resolution panel would normally be a mixed blessing on a Windows notebook thanks to horrible DPI scaling in Windows 8 desktop mode, but I'm actually wondering if that's a problem Microsoft will address with Windows 8.1 later this year. Given the way the PC ecosystem works, I can't imagine notebook vendors and Intel putting this much effort into driving high DPI displays without proper support from Microsoft. We'll find out for certain shortly here, but I'm getting a good feeling that the solution to this problem may be close. Internally, the Zenbook Infinity is also pretty cool. Unlike all other Haswell Ultrabooks we've seen, the ZBI is home to a 28W Haswell ULT: the Core i7-4558U.

This 11.6-inch laptop touts an outstanding 2560 x 1440 resolution, plus its exterior is adorned in a carbon fiber weave and machined aluminum, yet the company is pitching it as something even more: a two-in-one device The hinge on the XPS 11 allows the screen to flip nearly a full 360 degrees, turning the workaday laptop into a fun-filled tablet — very much in the same vein as Lenovo's Yoga machine. You can't detach the display, but the sub-15mm thickness with the keyboard included makes this a reasonable device to use in tablet mode even with the keypad still attached. Intelligently, Dell has designed the keyboard so that once the hinge passes 180 degrees, it becomes insensitive to input. It is a curious set of buttons that Dell's opted for here — the prototype we saw had almost no travel to them, though touch was very quickly recognized. You might think of this as a Microsoft Surface with the keyboard cover left attached. Of course, that'd be doing the XPS 11 a disservice, owing to its amazingly dense display and freshly official Core i5 Haswell processor. Also on tap with this machine will be USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, an SD card reader, and an active stylus. There'll be a stylus-holding attachment that plugs into the Kensington lock. The battery size, RAM and storage options aren't yet being revealed by the cagey guys at Dell, and neither is the price, however we're told to look forward to more info trickling out as we move closer to the planned launch in the 2013 holiday season. And in case you were wondering about Dell's strategy going forward, company Vice President Kirk Schell told us that consumer products are just as important to its future as commercial ones.

Clover Trail and Clover Trail+ aren’t even a year old yet, but Bay Trail, which Intel says will be in consumer devices by the end of the year, blows them out of the water in terms of performance. In a live demo hosted by Intel’s Hermann Eul Ph.D., Vice President and General Manager of Mobile &amp; Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Intel showed a Bay Trail tablet catch up to pass a Clover Trail tablet in a benchmark. (Video of the live demo is here; skip ahead to about the 33-minute mark.) Intel promises a substantial performance upgrade over not just its own previous generation of Atom, but also the mysterious “Clover Trail Competitor A” and “Clover Trail Competitor B”, as you can see in the above image. Bay Trail is packing Intel Gen 7 graphics, which supports DX11,full HD resolutions, and a 3x graphics performance gain over Clover Trail. Note below the difference in GLBenchmark and 3DMark “Ice Storm” tests. There’s clearly a bit of marketing spin coming from ARM and Intel about their new mobile offerings, but both believe they have chips that are faster and more powerful than ever.</Msg><Username>cimt_gibbscam2</Username><Timestamp>1370538172903</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538651326-136</Id><Topic><Title>Always remember to take your gains before there gone, Profits go away very fast</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1370453652931</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 13:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you don't make enough money dividends can get cut also</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1370538651326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538778609-137</Id><Topic><Title>Always remember to take your gains before there gone, Profits go away very fast</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1370453652931</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 13:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will if INTC goes to 19 will see if you sell me back your shares</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1370538778609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538836543-138</Id><Topic><Title>LOOK INTC is already going lower, WOW going to give all them gains back.

Sold them a little while ago for a small profit. I'm going to try to get a better reentry point next week depending on how the macro environment is looking at that point. BE WEARY OF THE GAMBLER'S FALLACY. Because things have been going well in the macro environment the last few months doesn't mean this will continue (as we've seen over the past few days). Because it's going down this week doesn't necessarily mean that it will continue either (at the surface, knee jerk reaction). I had a great gut feeling about this in the short and longterm on Friday. Thanks to the uncertainty in the macro environment, today I can't help but feel unsure and unsettled. Sometimes it's best to sell for a smaller-than-expected profit or even cut your losses if you can't help but be confused/frustrated/worried by what's occurring in your trade plan. If you feel confused/frustrated/worried, it's quite probable that many feel the same way that you do. Sure, I might lose some potential profits if the market bounces back today. On the other hand, if we continue this multiple day downturn I'll have avoided a potentially heavy lost (I was in calls) and may even have earned myself a much more appealing entry point. Out for now, hopefully back later if/when the dust settles.

It’ll be unique in the fact that it won’t require active cooling – something that many thought wouldn’t be possible until Intel’s Broadwell (fifth generation) platform is ready. What’s more, the HP executive told Engadget the fanless Haswell tablet was actually on stage during Intel’s press conference at Computex but it didn’t receive any attention. To that end, we are told that an official announcement is expected later this year which makes sense considering Intel’s current Haswell lineup consists mostly of higher-powered desktop and notebook parts. A fanless Haswell tablet that can run a full version of Windows 8 is an interesting proposition if HP is able to pull it off with reasonable battery life. What’s more, the system would likely need a complex passive heatsink in order to properly dissipate the chip’s heat. But without a space-consuming fan, there’s likely plenty of real estate to make it happen. Microsoft’s current Surface Pro tablet runs an Intel Ivy Bridge chip but requires active cooling to do so. Most claim the fan is audible if you are in a quiet environment even while doing mundane tasks. It kicks up a notch or two under heavy load which, as I’ve heard from a few people, can become a little bit annoying. If HP can eliminate this annoyance, they could have a serious contender on their hands for the holiday season</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370546281005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:18:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370546610391-171</Id><Title>Please... stop the BS news stories about what ifs...l</Title><Msg>What a crock of #$%$!</Msg><Username>boiled_n_oil</Username><Timestamp>1370546610391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:23:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370546684945-172</Id><Topic><Title>The analysts will be proven wrong about Intel earnings.</Title><Username>angstromatic</Username><Timestamp>1370542912135</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 14:21:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Sterne Agee believes that Intel’s new chip for tablets, the Silvermont, could cause consumers to choose Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) tablets over Microsoft notebooks, essentially cannibalizing its own customer base.

Overall the energy usage and processor use graphs were broadly similar in the Windows 8 Modern UI. The Intel engineer then launched a game, Angry Birds Space to see how things fared within this type of application combining graphics rendering, CPU processing and sound effects. This time the Intel processor seemed noticeably better at conserving battery power when it came to the static scoring screen due to some “software, hardware, various optimisations”.

Intel devices have the benefit of being able to run the full Windows 8 software and all your old Windows apps on the desktop and it is there, rather than in Modern UI apps and games, that you might feel the limitations of the current Atom’s processing power.

The 16k volume was not someone selling them all because the OI was too small. Some could have been a roll out but that would be limited to 1.8k. High was 47 cents and low was 11 cents. Tomorrows open interest will tell what the mix of buys and sells were. There is no other nice clean big trade to match it up with and there were a couple of 4k option strikes. Hypothesis .... market is weak and stocks going to drop. When Intel was above $24.50, someone selling a call (like a covered or naked call) would be expecting to lose the shares this weekend if Intel stayed above $24.50. It is likely that the option market maker was the HOLDER of those calls. If he was the HOLDER, then he would pay a very thin premium, a penny or two. He would wait for Intel to pop a penny or two, short Intel to lock in a profit and buy the call. Selling an ITM call becomes a proxy for shorting. When Intel weakened later and shares dropped, it is like the original writer closed out the calls at a profit. Puts work the reverse. Buy and ITM put induces the OMM to short. SELLING an ITM induces him to BUY. There were a couple of drops. One at 10:30 and the other at 11:30. I can't see any connection with other trades. Looks like just buying/selling trading for day profit or trading to manage price.

Price level uncertain... but up for sure...</Msg><Username>jeffreyklotzlongmeadow</Username><Timestamp>1370554273285</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 17:31:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370554363421-198</Id><Topic><Title>New Article Coming</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1370552300305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 16:58:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've seen you write of your $48 price expectation...

Intel's CAPEX was a key reason he slammed Intel and gave it a $16 target. Yet his colleague at Goldman increased his target for TSMC after TSMC announced they would increase their CAPEX in 2014 &amp; 2015 by about the same amount Intel would spend. So when Intel spends the CAPEX to ensure its two year plus advantage over of its competitors CAPEX is bad, but when the competitors in the ARM camp try to overcome their competitive weakness with a similar investment two years after Intel - its good.

Being a MU and INTC long i see how on Monday MU got bashed to 11.44 and traded quite a bit there before a bounce. I believe INTC will be 27-28 by end of July and on the long term it should double from here, provided they capture about 80% of mobile market. Its still a long way but having followed how AMD was catergorically taken out of market, that will soon be the case with ARM as well. With regards to Analysts, the buffoons at Goldman downgraded TSLA on the day after earnings, purely because they were short and never expected that type of a rally. Considering MU (a close partner of INTC) is up primarily due to acquiring Elpida, I believe INTC (having provided moral and possible monetary support to MU) should also hugely benefit. There is a lot of rumor mill going around that INTC should also get Apple's business before year end for the tablets, and that would indeed mean they will control 80% of the mobile market by next year this time. This is a huge turnaround.</Msg><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1370557687166</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370557706601-206</Id><Topic><Title>You will be see 22 before 26 again</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1370554368958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 17:32:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correction: "18 before 22"</Msg><Username>backpain_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1370557706601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:28:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370557832399-207</Id><Topic><Title>HP to launch fanless Haswell-powered tablet later this year</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370546281005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:18:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will be much better if they ship a version running Linux at a lower pricepoint.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1370557832399</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370557862191-208</Id><Topic><Title>GET IN NOW.</Title><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1370543334674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 14:28:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow we will be close to 25 and till end of June we will trade in the 24.5-25.5 channel and then another leg up.</Msg><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1370557862191</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:31:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370558637096-209</Id><Topic><Title>HP to launch fanless Haswell-powered tablet later this year</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370546281005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:18:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True enough, the revenue doesn't hit until the products ship.

ARM tried to enter the PC space/server space without much success. I think if you look at it logically ARM looked like a larger threat some 2015 -17 timeframe if Intel didn't cut them off at the pass. . Now Intel will engage ARM at the tablet phone level and outpace ARM to the point that ARM will find it difficult if not impossible to move down to 20nm and lower. This will throw a major kink in their aggressive expansion plans. AMD was a strawman competitor. It was set up as a second source for Intel so that Intel could get government contracts 30 years ago. AMD wasn't really much competition at any point other than the days of 286 processors when you could drop an AMD processors and Intel processors in the same motherboard. That was pretty annoying for Intel. ARM on the otherhand is a cleverly designed RISC processor. But come on, we've seen RISC come and go before. What was different this time was that the ARM ecosystem developed exceptionally well over the last five years. I believe by 2016 ARM will be technically defeated in the high end low power processor market by Intel. But they will still be around, and probably larger than ever. I found that their growth cycle has been fairly lazy, mostly growth from new products Apple introduced and incremental sales. I think ARMs largest opportunity is the under $5 processor market. Anything that has a circuit can use an ARM processor. "The internet of things" as Warren East suggested. Instead of doing an AMD dying on the vine move, ARM will have to reinvent itself, but I have a feeling that there is big business in very low end embedded processors in ARM's future. Another question, can Intel manufacture all the processors for smartphones for the entire world ? I wonder if anything but the top 30% of this market is desirable anyway? It's not a question of what Intel can get, but rather, what it wants.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370566425786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 20:53:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370567362895-218</Id><Topic><Title>ARM is no ANd</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370566425786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 20:53:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These boards need more of these kinds of posts.</Msg><Username>eodsolo</Username><Timestamp>1370567362895</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:09:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370567886567-219</Id><Topic><Title>MS: Outlook coming to RT in Win8.1</Title><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370444664243</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:04:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Giving up, yahoo issues.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370567886567</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370570534413-220</Id><Title>Intel reminds me of a HUGE ORCA with no teeth</Title><Msg>Its just out there taking up space.

The official unveiling of the Thunderbolt 2 - code named Falcon Ridge - has come a couple of months after Intel first started teasing the next iteration of Thunderbolt technology in April this year. According to the information shared by Intel, while the 2011-released original Thunderbolt technology boasted four uni-directional 10 Gigabits-per-second (Gbps) channels, its next-generation successor will increase the throughput of the current Thunderbolt interface by two times, "combining the two previously independent 10Gbs channels into one 20Gbs bi-directional channel that supports data and/or display." As such, going by Intel's claims, Thunderbolt 2 will be capable of simultaneously pushing through 4K video and display, which amounts to "a lot of eye-popping video and data capability."

Microsoft officially showed the Start button in action during its Windows 8.1 demonstration at Computex 2013, and NetworkWorld apparently captured everything on camera. In the video below, Microsoft shows how the Start button switches between desktop and the Start screen. The Washington-based company also gave a good look at the All Apps view when the Start button is activated, as well as new support for Start Screen desktop wallpapers. Technology blogger Paul Thurrott in May first published leaked screenshots of the new Start button in Windows 8.1. Microsoft has since confirmed the software's preview release date for 26 June, following the Build developer conference in San Francisco.

[The deepest corner of nowhere is where people go after they bash Intel for years and then they capitulate saying, "I will now allow the stock to rise". You do remember saying this, right? I only ask because I have no idea from time to time who is in charge of your Sybil-like personality. And that's being kind enough not to say that you knowingly and deliberately post under all those fake IDs. Dunno, how would like for us to address your psychological dysfunction? And why do you keep bashing under all the other IDs when you have capitulated under this one? You really think we don't notice??? ]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370576429835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370576680890-237</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, InDell is groveling for design wins at ComputTex?</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1370576163614</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:36:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What is the Taiwanese translation for, "F these fools." 486SL disaster still looms large in the 5000 year Chinese plan."
