And by this I mean that I think that they are having trouble figuring out which direction to move in. What evidence is there for this? Well, months and months and months of doing absolutely nothing. And not even talking about doing anything. I think there is at least a reasonable chance that this reflects some kind of internal turmoil. If this were true, then it would not be a surprise for them to appear to continue to be headed in the same direction. If Apple should decided to stick with TSMC, then I truly believe that it will hasten their decline. I'm not seeing anything that will put them back on top of the food chain. Tim Cook has not demonstrated little innovation - he has demonstrated no innovation. He has played it safe at every turn, going for the incremental improvement. The results of this approach speak for themselves. Earnings growth has flattened and the stock price fell off a cliff. Best bet at this point in time appears to be the rumor we heard a while back about Apple spreading the work to three different fabs. I think they will try to mitigate their risk by playing all the options and then choosing which ever comes out on top. Apple can afford to take this costly approach. Should this occur, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where Intel doesn't come out on top. But it could take a couple of years to fully materialize. Of course, I wonder if Apple started using Intel for anything new whether they would actually tell anyone until they absolutely had to. This is a bit of a problem with where things currently stand with Intel. We know big heavy duty discussions are taking place with many companies. We just don't know if any of these deals have been finalized and when they might be announced. That's a lot of shoes to drop. But they are all positive shoes for Intel. It would be nice to have enough of them to drop to get the stock price up over 30...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368943252775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 02:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368943598710-6</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wallisweaver, EXCELLENT, content-filled post, sir.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368943598710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 02:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368943672922-7</Id><Topic><Title>MacBook Air stock shortage adds weight to WWDC range-refresh rumors</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368926815528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 21:26:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good stuff.

I am surprised that Paul Otellini, being a marketing guy, made this decision on dollars and cents. There are a huge number of marketing case studies demonstrating that when the low-end of the market was left open, competitors come in and move up the chain threatening your high-end products. Classic example is the auto industry where the Japanese manufacturers came into the US market with their econoboxes and moved to providing the entire range. I guess no one paid any attention to the basic marketing tenet - if you have the cash, don't let any competition get into any market niches. Guess this is what happens when you are an 800lb chipzilla...you can get pretty arrogant and cocky, and make fundamental marketing errors!</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368965050733</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 08:04:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368969859171-11</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe it was a StrongARM proposal and perhaps he had already made his mind up to get out of the ARM business.

Well when Steve Jobs walks up to you and offers you the contract to make the CPU for the Iphone, and you are too stupid to take it, that is what happens. Of course, ottelini had his head up his assshhhh. He should have been fired years ago for this screw up but it took until this spring for Intel to let him go early. The fantarrrrdsss here who endlessly defend stupid moves by Intel and say technology is all that counts are dumber than pig sheeet. The better technology does not always win and we all know it. So not Intel is desperately begging Apple and Samsung to go into using Intel CPUs in Tablets and phones. Problem is, massive software has been developed for the 2nd rate Arm based trash made by quallycommi and others. If Apple switches to all Intel CPUs as I believe they will. It will not be until Intel gets to 14 nm chips and 18 months from now when that is announced.Yes--Apple wants all their software on X86 because it makes it makes an Apple system of products work together easily but NOW, Intel has to beg and wait. Getting rid of Pauley dimmmmwit was likely a great step in getting the deal done with Apple. Apple remembers him and they do not much like the jerk who said no to them when Jobs asked Intel to make The Iphone CPU. But a new CEO can get the deal.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1368973379664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 10:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368975021421-13</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It seems to me that one demo phone from Samsung does not the adoption of Intel chips make.

Its lower-specced sibling, the Surface RT, was released on 26 October 2012, to generally unappreciative reviews and a largely uninterested audience. But where the RT offered an awkward mix of sub-standard hardware and demanding applications, the Pro beefs things up considerably, with impressive results. Specifications OS: Windows 8 Dimensions: 27.46 x 17.30 x 1.35 cm Weight: 910 grams Storage: 64GB or 128GB SSD Display: 10.6" ClearType Full HD Display, 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 (widescreen), 10-point multi-touch CPU: 3rd Gen Intel Core i5 Processor with Intel HD Graphics Memory: 4GB RAM-Dual Channel Memory Cameras: Two 720p HD LifeCams, front- and rear-facing Ports: Full-size USB 3.0, microSDXC card slot, Headset jack, Mini Display Port, Cover port Sensors: Ambient light sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass Power Supply: 48W power supply (including 5W USB for accessory (think smartphone) charging Bundled Apps: Windows Mail and Messaging; SkyDrive; Internet Explorer 10; Bing; Xbox Music, Video and Games One of the key differences between the Pro and RT versions of Surface is the processor. Intel's Core i5 is a seriously potent component, especially compared to the quad-core Tegra 3 found in the RT. Thanks to this desktop-grade processor, the user-experience on the Pro is uniformly fast and smooth, with apps and videos whizzing along very happily on an excellent screen. The screen itself is extremely crisp at 1,920 x 1,080, which while not quite up to the latest iPad's Retina display resolution of 2,048 x 1,536, is more than adequate. It's also as smooth and responsive to touch as you could wish. The 4GB of RAM helps the device cope with multiple browser sessions and apps being open concurrently - Computing experienced no slow-down despite several Office applications and browsers running simultaneously.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993039639-28</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro debuts in the UK Thursday, May 23rd</Title><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And it's these Office applications that will prove the big draw for enterprises. Everything the business user expects to find on the desktop is alive and present on the Pro - or at least a one-month trial version is. In what will be seen as a stingy move from Microsoft, the Office suite doesn't come free with the Pro. However, 2013 versions of Excel, Word, OneNote, PowerPoint, Access and Publisher are all available, optimised for the form-factor with touch interactivity and pinch-zoom present and correct. OneNote is especially pleasing on the device, as it's able to translate handwriting into text with reasonable accuracy - though proof reading is required - which will be a boon to anyone who's still faster at writing than typing. Speaking of handwriting, the pen that comes with the Pro as standard is a great piece of kit, and really helps to get more out of the Surface. Besides being able to write directly onto the screen, it's also something of a godsend for those with, to put it delicately, less than svelte digits. One of Computing's criticisms of the RT was that it often throws the user out into what basically amounts to Windows 7 when you want to do something non-tablet-traditional, like check why the Wi-Fi adaptor isn't working - and attempting to click the right button at high resolution with a finger that doesn't end in a needle-point is hard work. Fortunately, the pen simplifies that interaction considerably, and similarly helps hugely when selecting cells in Excel, or navigating menus across the whole Office suite.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993039639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993105255-29</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro debuts in the UK Thursday, May 23rd</Title><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bringing this business functionality to the tablet form factor is the Pro's huge strength, and should be the principal reason why CIOs will investigate the device. When on the move, at a conference or meeting, having seamless access to everything you'd want on your desktop can be crucial, and with Microsoft's cloud storage service SkyDrive packaged as standard, transferring files to other devices is extremely simple. Don't trust the cloud? The USB 3.0 port offers up the potential for the Flash drive of your choice to help you out. Back in the office or at home, Microsoft's contention is that users can plug in one of the available keyboard covers, prop it up on its stand and hey presto, you're basically using an Ultrabook. Alternatively, you could plug in a keyboard and monitor and it's a desktop replacement. That's the essence of Microsoft's argument, and leads in to a discussion of the device's drawbacks. As seen in the specs, the Pro weighs in at a fairly hefty 910 grams, just shy of a kilogram. It's thicker than both the RT, and the iPad's various iterations, and heats up noticeably during use, although stops short of being uncomfortable to hold.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993105255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993137519-30</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro debuts in the UK Thursday, May 23rd</Title><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sticking with the specs, it takes a fair amount of power to run that processor and integrated Intel HD Graphics chipset, so don't expect stellar battery performance. It will last something in the region of six to seven hours of general use, less if you play a graphics-intensive game, more if you dial down the screen brightness and stick to basic browsing or document creation. So, it's hotter, heavier and shorter-lived than the iPad, the tablet which so far has seen the deepest enterprise penetration. But, that's not comparing like for like, or apples with Apple, if you want to mutilate a metaphor. With its power, ease of enterprise management (how many IT departments aren't familiar with Windows?), and ease of file compatibility for any business running a Microsoft ecosystem, it's more relevant to compare the Pro to an Ultrabook than a tablet, and here it scores well. Compared to most Ultrabooks - defining the term as a modern, thin clamshell device with a solid-state drive (SSD) - the Pro is lighter and has a comparable battery life. This comparison also applies to the price. The 128GB iPad 4 will currently set you back in the region of £640, whereas you'll be lucky to get change from £1,000 for a touchscreen Ultrabook with specs comparable to the Pro. The Surface Pro itself will retail in the UK for £719 for the smaller 64GB SSD, whilst the larger 128GB version will cost £799.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993137519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:52:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993178807-31</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro debuts in the UK Thursday, May 23rd</Title><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So the hardware is impressive, but what of the software? Windows 8 has been knocked by critics since launch, so much so that Microsoft has announced Windows Blue, or Windows 8.1, in an effort to placate them. However, much of the negativity has stemmed from the operating system's suitability, or lack thereof, to its hardware. The Modern UI (or Metro, if you're a few months behind Microsoft's capricious naming conventions) is great with a touch interface, but less good on a desktop. The Windows 7 environment it dumps you in in order to download some software updates, check drivers, or use the Office suite is sometimes clunky with touch, but great with a keyboard and mouse. Windows 8 works best when you have both, and is the perfect engine for the Pro - and the fact that it also throws in a very capable tablet-pen further sweetens the deal. The tile-based front end works extremely well for the Surface, and the tiles' dynamic nature serves to draw users in to the apps in a way that doesn't happen on the iPad, or other devices. The photo tile rotates through pictures from its library, news stories scroll across the Bing news tile, updates from contacts appear on the social tiles - they each give you a reason to click on them beyond simply existing. For that reason, a quick glance at the front screen can sometimes be all you need.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993178807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:52:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993237216-32</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro debuts in the UK Thursday, May 23rd</Title><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368993017407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows Store Microsoft's own app store continues to grow, though it can't boast anything like the breadth of support of Apple's version yet. There are 532 business apps on Windows Store at the moment, ranging from cloud storage offerings like Box, various creative apps from Adobe, to financial packages from SAP. Given that the Pro is more likely to find traction with businesses than consumers, it's this area of the Store that's most likely to see apps proliferate and succeed, so expect to see the numbers swell in the coming months. Popular games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja are there for your down-time, but if it's a stellar collection of the latest games you want, you're probably not looking at the Surface Pro. Having said that, given that it's running a Windows environment, and the Windows PC has a strong legacy of games going back decades, the potential is there for this to become a popular device for enthusiasts too.

Intel Reportedly Lands Chip Orders from Cisco [04/03/2013 06:32 PM] by Anton Shilov While Intel Custom Foundry, the contract semiconductor manufacturing division of Intel Corp., officially has a limited amount of customers, the company has admitted that there are a number of unannounced contracts. According to a representative of the company in South Korea, the world’s largest maker of microprocessors will manufacture custom chips for Cisco, which can easily be the largest order for ICF ever. “Intel has recently signed an agreement to manufacture Cisco’s networking chips on a contractual basis,” said Lee Hee-sung, country manager at Intel Korea, during an interview with The Korea Times. The company did not reveal which chips it will actually produce for Cisco and which process technology will be used to make them. Previously, Intel signed contracts to produce field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as well as flow processors using 22nm and 14nm process technologies for various companies. Therefore, Intel can produce virtually everything on contract basis. The deal with Cisco seems to be a significant win for Intel, which needs to ensure maximum utilization of its leading-edge manufacturing facilities and maximize its earnings. Requirements of Cisco are very high, hence Intel will have to produce loads of network chips for the partner. Earlier this year rumours transpired that Intel was in talks to make custom chips for Apple on a contract basis. However, given that Apple needs extreme volumes of processors it designs, it is unlikely that Intel will have enough capacities to serve both Apple and itself until 450mm fabs are built and go online. Intel established its Intel Custom Foundry division within its technology and manufacturing group about three years ago, but it remains extremely tight-lipped about its ongoing endeavors, future plans, prospects and clients. Being the largest maker of semiconductors in the world, Intel has leading-edge process technologies and invests more than anyone else in research and development (R&amp;D) of new manufacturing processes as well as building new manufacturing facilities. Since it every new technology node costs more than the previous one and the cost of new fabs is growing as well (and with 450mm factories their cost will get even higher), Intel needs to constantly sell more chips and ensure full utilization of its factories. One of the ways to guarantee maximum utilization of production facilities is to make chips for others.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1368993296124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:54:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368996994560-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel will see 24 + before 18</Title><Username>itakebackrnyapology</Username><Timestamp>1368979855680</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 12:10:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you will see uranus before you see the light.</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1368996994560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 16:56:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368997317787-36</Id><Topic><Title>Wheeeeeeeeeeeee</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1368923690933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 20:34:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1368997317787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:01:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368999041117-37</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I had the same thought when I looked at Ashraf Eassa's comment on Apple hiring x86/Intel CPU experts.

They really think consumers are not only aware of SoC hardware specs, but anticipate new phones due to these specs. They feel that Intel has been to level one, level two and level 3 handset manufactures and so far there isn't a lot of interest. In my world I see no name third party carriers offering all you can eat talk/text/voice for $50 a month or less. Most of these are "Pay as you go" plans which means you're paying for service, and that's it. If you need a phone you need to pay for it, at retail prices. The free Galaxy S3 isn't free from them. Sticker shock may follow. But if you're saving $30 a month over two years that's over $700 in savings. In theory you could be able to afford just about any phone on the market. Then again, would you spend $500 of your own money for a cell phone even if you'll save $200 over two years? The new realities of smart phones is that they've been out for a while and the novelty is wearing off. We all have our favorite apps. Many of these apps don't tax the processor. A faster processor may feel a bit more springy and lively, but will it be enough for consumers (aside from iPhone fans) to dig into their wallets even deeper for the most cutting edge ARM technology? Intel has the specs for the carriers to offer their own private label cell phones with Intel co-branding (Sub $200 cost) . Intel will of course help pay for the advertising. Will everybody buy the Intel phone over the class 1-3 handset manufactures phones? No, but enough will to make it a huge concern. The phone segment hasn't had enough innovations to keep it fresh and exciting. Now consumers want to spend less. Cut throat carrier rates is the real catalyst. The question now is how to deal with Intel, as a partner or a loose canon at the carrier level/? I see plenty of opportunity for Intel!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1369012974717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:22:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369016095609-45</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf breaks the Intel-Samsung Galaxy win story</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1368975428539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 10:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Show me a link other than Seeking Alpo where Intel won the Galaxy business..."
