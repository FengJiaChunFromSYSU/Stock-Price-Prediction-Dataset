And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it," Otellini told me in a two-hour conversation during his last month at Intel. "The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do... At the end of the day, there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume.

Model number GT-P5200 has been spotted in GLBenchmark results both in Wi-Fi-only and 3G versions – we’ll remind you that the GT-P5200 is said to be the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, although this particular tablet version is yet to be unveiled by Samsung. According to the benchmarks, the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is said to pack a 10.1-inch display with 1280 x 800 resolution, a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Atom Z2560 processor with Hyper-Threading, a 400MHz PowerVR SGX 544 MP2 graphics processing unit and Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean under the hood.

He oversaw the development of FinFET, which is now effectively bringing about the end of the ARM era. FinFET is the single most important development in semiconductor history. It has paved Intel's path into the future while leaving ARM with no roadmap past 20nm. Even now it is killing ARM's ability to compete. Going forward its effects will be even more profound. It's development has allowed Intel to continue its every eight quarter die shrinks. It'a a pace that no other company on earth can hope to match. The Altera deal should have been the wake-up call for everyone. For the first time there was conclusive proof of Intel's fabrication, technology and manufacturing superiority and proof that the superiority is so large that it justifies the significant costs of companies switching foundries. We now know that significant discussions are taking place with many companies regarding the use of Intel's advanced processes. Given that Mr. Otellini was largely responsible for development of a dynamic significant enough to change the very face of the semiconductor business and to allow Intel to seize leadership in all of mobility, it appears exceptionally small-minded and petty to fault him for failing to seize the day on an Apple product that almost no one properly judged at the time it arrived. The Apple deal and no FinFET would not have allowed Intel the kind of future that now lies at its feet. Hats off to Mr. Otellini for his vision and hard work in bringing FinFET and the end of the ARM era to fruition...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368915034812</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:10:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368915365616-36</Id><Title>Updated May/June Intel Events Calendar: Haswell Two Weeks from Monday</Title><Msg>May 20: Lenovo K900 in India June 3: Intel to release Haswell - Buzz should last all year June 4: Computex Opening Keynote-Tom Kilroy, executive vice president and general manager, Intel's Sales and Marketing Group, will deliver a keynote on Intel's vision for continued innovation to reinvent people's computing experiences across a range of devices.

As per the latest benchmark results that have surfaced in GFXbench database, Samsung is using the Intel Atom Z2560 Clover Trail+ dual-core processor in its new 10-inch tablet. The benchmark listing also reveals the processor will be clocked at 1.6GHz and will come with PowerVR SGX 544 MP2 GPU. Other features of the tablet will include 10.1-inch WXGA (1280×800) display and Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. Apart from the GT-P5200 listing, a benchmark listing for GT-P5210 has also been spotted, which is going to be the Wi-Fi only version of the tablet. Other details were not confirmed in these benchmark listings but a previous report had suggested that this tablet will come with 5MP rear camera and 16/ 32GB of internal storage. Apart from the obvious tablet details leak, the presence of an Intel Atom processor in Samsung’s Android tablet is the more important news here.

Intel (INTC) is the company that can provide that advantage, a manufacturing advantage. It strikes me as funny that Apple, one of the most vertically integrated companies with extreme control over its supply chain may be able to use Samsung's vertical integration against them. You see, Samsung has already developed manufacturing facilities and is committed to that line of business. Actually they currently produce Apple's A6 chips a situation Apple is very interested in finding a solution for. Samsung has already sunk immense resources into its manufacturing capacity to the tune of at least $10 billion, though I don't have an exact figure, and would not switch gears and find a foundry for its chips. This means the advantage Intel brings to Apple in manufacturing is sustainable for the long term if Intel can keep ahead of Samsung.

I think that is because the senior management team knows they have leverage over Apple and want to take advantage of their position to earn both the design and manufacturing margin from Apple as a customer. Apple needs to get away from Samsung as its foundry but the next best option in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). Why would Apple settle for a company that is using the 28nm technology when a company with 22nm technology and 3-D Tri-gate Transistors is available in Intel? Intel has a manufacturing lead over both of these companies which will transfer an advantage to Apple in both energy efficiency and performance of the CPU. Again Intel is not interested in being the foundry for Apple so a deal will have to be made to transition to Intel designed chips.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368917892144</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368917972623-46</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Can Give Apple The Edge In Mobile</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368917738970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:55:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There have been rumors for the past year that Apple and Intel are working together to complete a deal that makes Intel the foundry for Apple. Outgoing CEO Paul Otellini has been adamant on not becoming a foundry for companies that ultimately benefit their competitors. It only makes sense not to give away your moat to build your competitors' chips and Intel's manufacturing leadership is that moat. I believe Mr. Otellini has been able to reject the idea of becoming Apple's foundry because he knew the new Atom processor with the Silvermont microarchitecture was coming out this year and that it would on a performance per watt basis handily beat the competition. Now with its release, Intel and Apple can spend the next year optimizing the chip for the iOS and customizing an Atom processor for the iPad 6 and iPad Mini 3 that could be released in the fall of 2014.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368917972623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:59:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368918107900-47</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Can Give Apple The Edge In Mobile</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368917738970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:55:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel gets the iPad business and instant market share in the tablet market. Apple sold almost 23 million units in 2012 and with the growth of the tablet market, even if it just holds its market share, it will be shipping something like 60 million units in 2014. That business is worth approximately $1.2 billion to Intel and provides the opportunity to expand the partnership into the iPhone easily tripling the revenues from Apple for Intel. Apple is expected to sell 75 million low-cost smartphones in 2014 along with the sales of the flagship iPhone 6. Both of these products are worth approximately $3 billion in sales to Intel and well worth the trouble of customizing chips for iOS products. I see 2014 as a stellar year for Intel with great growth potential in the mobile space due to growth in the Windows OS and taking on Apple as a new customer.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368918107900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 19:01:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368918486063-48</Id><Title>Now That Would Be Funny</Title><Msg>If Intel were to do a deal with Apple and a real deal as suggested in the Gregory Stuckey article, not an ARM foundry deal, it would be interesting to see what all of the Monday morning quarterbacks would say then.

NEC works on smartphone with liquid cooling Posted by alexander on 16 May 2013 The Japanese NEC will soon release a rather unusual smartphone that will rely on an integrated liquid cooling system inside in order to keep the electronics cool. The liquid cooling system will be placed on the back of the device and will count on a single heat pipe that circles a graphite radiator attached closely to the internal electronics of the smartphone. Thus heat gets evenly distributed across the phone for easier cooling. Dubbed Medias X the smartphone is aimed at women and is expected to measure 138 x 67 x 8.5 mm for total weight of 136 grams. Next to the liquid cooling the Medias X will come with IP58 certification, making it dust proof and water resistant, and DLNA. Inside the device will feature a quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor at 1.7 GHz, Adreno 320 graphics, a 4.7-inch sensor display at 720p resolution (1280 x 720 pixel resolution), 2 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, a microSD/microSDHC/microSDXC card slot (up to 64 GB), 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. In addition the NEC Medias X supports LTE and comes with a rear 13.1 MP camera with Exmor RS sensor and a 1.3 MP front camera. All this hardware will be powered by Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The pricing and the release date are still unknown.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368927113871</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 21:31:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368927129457-61</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"So what's Apple going to do :)" [Looks like Apple is planning on boarding the TSMC Titanic.

You can now get duct tape to match your background color and you will hardly notice it.

And Tim Cook will be tarred, feathered, and run out of town if he let that happen :) So I do think that Apple will go for the only other choice available - switch over to x86 very soon.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368933379497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:16:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368934906451-67</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 coming with Intel Atom Z2560 chip inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1368884240207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ideal_invst, Won't happen. I know for a fact Apple is actively hiring for their CPU teams - a few friends of mine at Intel have been contacted. Apple's sticking to its guns. Should be interesting to see how it plays out.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368934906451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
