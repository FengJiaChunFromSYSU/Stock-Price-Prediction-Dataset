Windows 8 was designed for tablets and is abysmal for traditional desktops and laptops. How Microsoft believed forcing W8 &amp; Metro on traditional desktops and laptops was a good idea is beyond belief. And many people don't like the security vulnerabilities Microsoft creates by pushing ads to Metro tiles as well as Microsoft's insistence in pushing its SkyDrive cloud on users. I know businesses that had planned to buy new PC's since the beginning of the year but refused to bring Windows 8 into their shops. Instead they are postponing their purchases, installing Linux wherever they can and some are buying MACs. Windows 8.1 preview seems to suggest a some improvement but so far it doesn't go far enough to correct everything wrong with W8 and the traditional PC market. Microsoft's is singlehandedly responsible for destroying much of the demand for traditional PCs.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1374332505004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 11:01:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374332562815-13</Id><Topic><Title>If Baytrail Ipads get 10-12 hr battery life, and ARM based Ipads get 7 hrs</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1374282591654</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, the iPads get either 9 hour or 10 hour battery life according to Apple website.

Only the version with 12 metal layer version could challenge Haswell while the "cheaper" versions go directly against ARM.

Also keep in mind that the Haswell and upcoming Broadwell micro-architectures target fundamentally different performance levels on both CPU and GPU. The top Haswell GPU SKU has 40 EUs, while the top Baytrail SKU has 4 EUs. On CPU, while Baytrail will come with up to 4 cores, per core Haswell is significantly more sophisticated (much deeper and wider OoO engine, L3$, and beefier execution units). There will be very little cannibalization. Baytrail is a small die aimed for low power and low cost, Haswell is significantly higher performance aimed at higher power envelopes.

PC world review of IPad has this to say. How much of the new iPad's battery drain is attributable to its beefier processor and how much is due to the brighter, higher-resolution display is unclear. Our colleagues at Macworld performed battery-life tests at full brightness and at 150 cd/m2, and the new iPad consistently ran for a shorter period than the iPad 2 did. In Macworld's tests, the new iPad at full brightness ran for one-third less time than its predecessor did, lasting 5 hours, 40 minutes to the iPad 2's 8 hours, 30 minutes.

This is sort of true for every NON-CASH investment. If you have a short term need for the cash, it is wrong to take more risk than you can afford. Duh!! You clearly don't understand what a Ponzi scheme is or you would not call Intel a Ponzi scheme. Your "wait for the bottom" strategy is rather simple minded and does not apply to investors nor many medium time frame traders. Example .... I also took A PORTION of my portfolio dedicated to LIQUID CASH and dedicate to Intel . When Intel drops down near $20-$22, I get shares and when it goes above $25, it tends to get sold. Intel is very liquid and yields are well above the sub-1% that savings is yielding. IN ADDITION to the "3.75% return per year", I take and sell $25 call options on the next QUARTERLY $25 call option. Today the Oct $25 call options are selling for 33 cents. That is an additional 11 cents per month. When the $25 stock gets ASSIGNED, I start selling $23 PUT options which are about $2 out of the money. It would be like selling an OCT $21 PUT option today. which are going for 48 cents. When the Intel price goes down, the put option premium I receive gets higher than the 48 cents and is usually double. The PUT options are a little higher than the calls since they are affected by the dividend. During that time, I don't get the dividend directly but partially through the put option. The dividend is about 7 cents per month and the options are about 10 cents per month so 17 cents per month on an investment of "$21.50" is $2.04 or 9.4%. For some, a steady 9.4% yield is pretty attractive. IMO, with pension funds and insurance companies looking for higher yield on their portfolio, I think that this may be one of the larger pressures on the Intel stock price that keeps it "range bound".</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1374346932043</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:02:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374347357790-28</Id><Topic><Title>If Baytrail Ipads get 10-12 hr battery life, and ARM based Ipads get 7 hrs</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1374282591654</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>According to CC ASML is now shipping 20nm equipment to TSMC and supposedly TSMC is the ONLY foundry ordering (significant) 20nm equipment.

If Intel agrees, that would improve the possibility (make it easier for Apple to convert) to an instruction set switch later on. They can plan the SW conversion and convert in a controlled fashion.

I would expect that the TSMC 28nm node is the most successful foundry node by far by revenue. I am not sure how it compares to the equivalent Samsung node which feeds both Apple and Samsung parts. Extracting Samsung information is harder due to the complexity of their financial filings. Successful ramp? Even harder to confirm across all foundries and nodes but not a real point to argue. How would you compare the "most successful foundry ramp on record" with the Intel ramps? 32nm? 22nm? I get the impression that the TSMC most successful would not fare favourably with any of the Intel ramps. "Intel is the #1 reader of SemiWiki by domain names" That is probably true of many websites. Lets see if Yahoo will publish these Alexa statistics. Alexa rank of Semiwiki is Rank:446,290, semiaccurate is Rank:108,370 and totallycrap is Rank:394,016. Semiwiki is less popular than totallycrap.
