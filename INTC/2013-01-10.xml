"At CES 2013 we've seen both Qualcomm and NVIDIA announce impressive new mobile chipsets and now to round out the major three manufacturers we have Samsung showing off a new Exynos processor. While it's not an entirely new generation of silicon, the new Exynos 5 Octa chip is set to bring interesting performance and battery life gains over the Exynos 5 dual CPUs that are already in the market. While this chip is technically an eight-core processor, it's actually four ARM Cortex-A15 CPUs paired with four ARM Cortex-A7 CPUs; the former for high-powered tasks and the latter for saving battery. The chipset uses ARM's reference big.LITTLE processor switching technology, will switch between the A15s and the A7s depending on the performance needs of the tasks, allowing for greater performance over Exynos 5 Dual chips, but also longer battery life. The Exynos 5 Octa should also be more efficient thanks to a slight die shrinkage from 32nm HK-MG (in the Exynos 4 and Exynos 5 Dual) to 28nm HK-MG. Clock speeds of the cores aren't known at this stage but the GPU inside should stay as the Mali-T6xx series (although the exact model wasn't confirmed).

The Samsung part is a Quad A15 with a Quad A7. The target will be a device needing a quad A15 target with the A7. Smartphone? Tablet? Computer? The BIG.LITTLE is the ARM way of trying to keep the power consumption low. I don't know of anyone that has them on the market now but would be surprised if Samsung is the first one. Die size will be larger and therefore cost will be higher. Samsung will not have to battle for TSMC fab and they can probably fill the void caused by Apple departure. I was hoping that coninmaker new more but it appears not.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357839574315</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 12:39:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357841417420-38</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think INTC is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>arieljca5392</Username><Timestamp>1357680063323</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:21:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got my own choice</Msg><Username>lorna.combs109e</Username><Timestamp>1357841417420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:10:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357841933613-39</Id><Topic><Title>Why is ARMH stock outperforming INTC so badly??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357838146159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 12:15:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>weren't there some guys yesterday bragging about shorting ARMH at $40?</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1357841933613</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:18:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357842577451-40</Id><Title>Jerry Blown had to can his Greggy Lynn alias after all that ARM trash talk</Title><Msg>Still gonna short it to single digits from 32, idiot????</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357842577451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:29:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357842628047-41</Id><Title>Canalys Analyst trashes Intel today</Title><Msg>Says tablets/smartphones are the 1st choice computing device.</Msg><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357842628047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:30:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357842672391-42</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung new 8 core cpu at CES, thats not good for INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357833493420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:58:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Do you know if Samsung will be able to run all 8 cores at the same time or is it a DOUBLE QUAD-CORE processor?

Does anyone have a BIG LITTLE version on the market today or is this the first? ----- You can run all eight at the same time, but this involves serious changes within the OS's kernel. With no/little OS change (and the main usage model), it's either all 4 A7's or all 4 A15's. The A7 is tiny, all 4 fit inside the same space as a single A15, so die space isn't much of an issue. The idea of the big/little approach is to smooth out the power/performance curve. We'll soon see how this works in reality:) It's likely that samsung will be the first to market with big-little.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1357842824901</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:33:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357842960617-44</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is very bad.

While the Surface RT is powered by Windows RT, the Surface Pro is the higher end Surface with Windows 8 and can run desktop applications (x86 and x64). The Surface Pro is set for release later this month and will come in two flavors, a 64GB model for $899 and a 128GB model for $999. The Surface Pro has a 10.6 inch display, with a 1920x1080 screen resolution. The Surface Pro is also .53in thick and weighs just about 2 pounds. The device runs on a third generation Intel Core i5 processor, powered by Windows 8 Pro. The Surface Pro also comes with integrated HD Graphics 400 and 4GB of RAM. Here are some key facts to note about the upcoming Surface Pro tablet: ■The Surface Pro is slightly thicker (0.53in/1.35cm vs 0.37in/0.94cm) and heavier (2lb/0.9kg vs 1.5lb/0.68kg) compared to the Surface RT ■It features an Intel Core i5 processor ■Has a higher resolution (1920x1080) compared to the Surface RT's 1366x768 resolution ■The Surface Pro has 10-point multitouch support, while the Surface RT only has 5-point multitouch support ■Has a higher-capacity battery (42Wh) compared to the Surface RT (31.5Wh) ■The Surface Pro comes with a pen, which can be attached to the side of the device in the magnetic connector ■The pen has a button to activate the right-click function in Windows 8, as well as an eraser at the top to delete content within apps. ■The magnetic connector itself is stronger than it was on the Surface RT ■Heat is ejected from a slot that surrounds the entire tablet for better device cooling ■MicroSD slot has been moved to the side of the device for easier access ■The Surface Pro supports USB 3.0 and comes with one port, unlike the Surface RT which does not have USB 3.0 support ■The Surface Pro does not come with Office 2013 Home and Student but can run any full fledged x86 or x64 software ■Comes in two flavors: 64GB model for $899 and 128GB model for $999 Microsoft is expected to release the Surface Pro in the coming weeks, so stay tuned as we keep you updated on anything new that comes out regarding the Surface Pro tablet.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357843314474</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:41:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357843528965-47</Id><Topic><Title>Jerry Blown had to can his Greggy Lynn alias after all that ARM trash talk</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357842577451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 13:29:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah...right.

This new system used an impressively quick graphic overlay, the ability to preview other channels before changing to them and even the ability to browse content on your phone and "toss" it to your TV. The software infrastructure is part of the iFeelSmart package but the PowerVR team was demonstrating the performance and use experiences that its low power graphics system could provide for future applications. And guess what we saw was connected to the TV? With all of the information filtering out on Intel's upcoming dive into the TV ecosystem, it shouldn't be a surprise that find hardware like this floating around. We aren't sure what kind of hardware Intel would actually end up using for the set top box expected later this year, but it is possible we are looking at an early development configuration right here. pcperDOTcom/news/Systems/CES-2013-Prototype-Intel-TV-System-Spotted-Imagination-Suite</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357847974564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:59:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357849118390-53</Id><Title>Fudds Give Back 13 Percent</Title><Msg>Since the low of 19.23 on November 21st, shorts have given back 13 percent.

The latest such device is Dell’s Latitude 10, which starts at $500. Well, not as much starts as will start in a matter of weeks, but this is still a promising sign Microsoft wants people to love Win 8 tabs. Now the slate’s name might confuse some people, as there’s already been a Latitude 10 released last fall, so Dell calls this the Latitude 10 “essentials configuration”. The “essential” comes with a 1.8 GHz dual-core Intel Atom Z2760 CPU, 2 GB of RAM, Intel Graphics Media Accelerator, dual 8 MP/2 MP cameras, Wi-Fi, USB and a 30 Whr battery. The 10.1-inch IPS LCD screen boasts a 1,366 x 768 pixels resolution and supports 5-finger touch, as well as an optional Wacom Active stylus. For $500, Dell is going to offer you a tab with just 32 GB of on-board storage, while 79 extra bucks will double the memory. There’s also going to be an optional productivity dock sold separately, but no words on the pricing there.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357858917700</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:01:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357859822810-93</Id><Topic><Title>10 Billion Global Foundries plant just announced...dagger for Intel</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1357845951926</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GF announced they were building a $2b development center and a fab "when they are ready".

East says the company is taking dead aim at the market for server processors. There’s plenty of room for gains in that market, where ARM at this point has no share at all. East says the interest among servers vendors in using ARM-based processors boils down to logistics: he says they require less space and use less power than conventional X86-based processors. East notes that by some estimates IT equipment now suck down 10% of the world electric power already; he also notes that there are estimates that in the next few years that the amount of data creates could increase 100x, or maybe 1000x. Even at 10x, he notes, we’re going to run out of power at the current consumption rates. “They are going to switch to ARM because it is all about the power,” he says. “The digital world is not going to become a reality unless servers and network infrastructure is designed in a different way….ARM is a tool in the toolbox for making this stuff more sustainable.” In network architectures, East says, we’re about a year away from seeing the debut of ARM-based server processors. But he says that the story here is much the same as it is in servers. But he notes that companies like Cavium, Applied Micro Circuits, Texas Instruments, LSI and Fairchild have all talked publicly about using ARM processors in networking infrastructure. The company also sees a growing opportunity in microcontrollers and “the Internet of things.” Now, I would point out here that ARM isn’t going to get a free pass to simply roll into market after market unopposed. Intel, for instance, is making a fresh push into the mobile device processor market, though so far the company has made only limited progress. East’s not writing Intel off, but he also doubts that Intel will ever become a huge player in smartphone chips. “We do anticipate they will get some share, but not massive share,” he says. “And why should they? We have 15 or so licensees shipping into the market now. There’s an ecosystem and ARM platform around those companies. Intel’s chip is a little more applicable to mobile devices than previous generations, and it can become one of the 15-20 semi companies in that space. They are a very capable company with lots of market money to spend. So I don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t achieve 5% share.” Couldn’t they muscle their way to more? East says it is unlikely. “Arithmetic says they win about 5%,” he writes. “They have lots of marketing money and they have capable technology, so maybe then they 10%. That still leaves us with 90%” And we’re looking to the server market, where Intel has virtually 100% share now.”</Msg><Username>backstreetboy_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357861603951</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:46:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357861699961-97</Id><Topic><Title>Dell Windows 8 tablet w/Intel for 500 bucks</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357858917700</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:01:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1357861699961</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:48:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357861751253-98</Id><Topic><Title>Dell Windows 8 tablet w/Intel for 500 bucks</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357858917700</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:01:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can Windows8 even run on a unit with those specs?

GF is in trouble IMHO due to large exposure to AMD and if I recall correctly GF had lay offs in S'pore (ex Charter fab perhaps).... Nov 30, 2012 – GlobalFoundries' plans to layoff 300 workers in Singapore won't impact its operations in Malta, New York, a company spokesman told.... GF too was hoping for Apple business but it looks TSMC has been selected and AMD cut back/paid GF money for taking less wafers. Samsung is OK because of captibe business - that leaves GF most vulnerable. And than there is talk about GF IPO and hoping to break even by 2015(?) Personally I think it's absolutely crazy that all (top notch) fabless US chip makers depend on this tiny island - one tsunami could cripple everything. So I think there is really a need for a financially and technical strong US foundry but try this to explain to an oxymoron like GS Covello who seems to be more or less brain dead. And I think Apple is crazy for not hedging by using Intel chips at least for some products. But Apple was dumb enough to give all chip business AP, NAND , LPDRAM and display to Samsung. So Apple is learning it the hard way. Apple and Samsung US (staffed with US engineers and techs) probably worked out very well - sometimes things like communication (in English) can become a problem.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357862473611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357862483283-104</Id><Topic><Title>PC sales fall 6.4% in Q4, worse than expected at MarketWatch06:28pm EST</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357861957466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:52:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What adult says things like HI-HO???? -------------- Hi-Ho, Steverino!: My Adventures in the Wonderful Wacky World of TV [Paperback] Steve Allen (Author)</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357862483283</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:01:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357862857842-105</Id><Title>Intc should be at $25 sometime before May, and $27 shorly thereafter.</Title><Msg>It will go back down to $20, but not before it reaches $28 sometime this year.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1357862857842</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:07:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357863252495-106</Id><Topic><Title>PC sales fall 6.4% in Q4, worse than expected at MarketWatch06:28pm EST</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357861957466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:52:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the most famous ratings wars in television history began on 24 June 1956. That night NBC debuted The Steve Allen Show opposite the eighth anniversary program of what had become a television institution, The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS. The two hosts were markedly different. Sullivan was a rigorous master of ceremonies, known for enforcing strict conformity for both his guests and the members of his audience. Allen, too, served as host, but he was also innovative, funny and whimsical. Whereas Steve Allen liked to improvise and ad lib on his program, creating material and responding to guests and audience on the spot, The Ed Sullivan Show followed a strict format. The appearances of Elvis Presley on the two programs serve to illustrate the differences between them. When Presley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sullivan instructed the camera operators to shoot the picture from the waist up only. On The Steve Allen Show, Presley appeared in a tuxedo and serenaded a bassett hound with his hit "You Ain't Nothing But a Hound Dog." Both strategies appeased nervous network censors, but each is emblematic of the show it served. Relations between the two prominent hosts were not cordial and reached a low point in October 1956. Allen scheduled a tribute to the late actor, James Dean, for his 21 October program. When he learned that Sullivan planned his own tribute to Dean for his 14 October program, Allen charged that Sullivan had stolen his idea. Sullivan denied the charges and accused Allen of lying. Allen moved his segment to October 14 when both programs paid tribute to the late actor and showed clips from his last movie, Giant. Much of Allen's work on The Steve Allen Show resembled previous performances on The Tonight Show, which he had hosted since 1954. He often opened the program casually, seated at the piano. He would chat with the audience, participate in skits, and introduce guests. Television critic Jack Gould considered the new program merely an expanded version of The Tonight Show and characterized it as "mostly routine stuff." Gould did concede that "more imagination could take the program far." The Steve Allen Show offered Allen a natural setting for what Gould termed his "conditioned social gift" of "creating spontaneous comedy in front of an audience in a given situation." Allen also continued something else he had begun on The Tonight Show, discovering new talent. Andy Williams, Eydie Gorme and Steve Lawrence got their starts on The Tonight Show. And on the new show, Allen's man in the street interview segments launched the careers of comedians Bill Dana, Pat Harrington, Louis Nye, Tom Poston and Don Knotts. Dana played the timid Hispanic Jose' Jiminez, and Harrington the suave Italian golfer Guido Panzino. Characters created by Nye, Poston and Knotts were the best known of the group. Nye portrayed the effete and cosmopolitan Gordon Hathaway whose cry "Hi Ho Steverino" became a trademark of the program.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357863252495</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:14:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357863353187-107</Id><Topic><Title>PC sales fall 6.4% in Q4, worse than expected at MarketWatch06:28pm EST</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357861957466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:52:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a flaming #$%$, but that was already known.</Msg><Username>backstreetboy_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357863353187</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:15:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357863602646-108</Id><Topic><Title>10 Billion Global Foundries plant just announced...dagger for Intel</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1357845951926</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel does not control any future technology with any monopoly anymore............

' Intel’s chip is a little more applicable to mobile devices than previous generations, and it can become one of the 15-20 semi companies in that space. They are a very capable company with lots of market money to spend. So I don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t achieve 5% share.” Couldn’t they muscle their way to more? East says it is unlikely. “Arithmetic says they win about 5%,” he writes. ' According to that simple math x86 should be sharing server marketshare equally with Power and Sparc and Itanium and IBM Mainframes but no it is the clear leader. 'East notes that by some estimates IT equipment now suck down 10% of the world electric power already; he also notes that there are estimates that in the next few years that the amount of data creates could increase 100x, or maybe 1000x. Even at 10x, he notes, we’re going to run out of power at the current consumption rates. “They are going to switch to ARM because it is all about the power,” he says. “The digital world is not going to become a reality unless servers and network infrastructure is designed in a different way….ARM is a tool in the toolbox for making this stuff more sustainable.”' Such a drama Queen lol ! Please ARM, save us from the World energy shortage soon to be caused by the evil power sucking Intel Empire lol ! What a clown. Get used to your 0% server marketshare Easty baby because it's not going to change much if not at all. Your crude simple architecture is not more power efficient than the most power efficient x86 server architectures and that won't change going forward. Nobody wants a huge cluster of slow 1 GHz 32-bit A9s or less power efficient A15s and your A57 will be DOA as a server chip when it is arrayed against the server version of Haswell but hey waste your clients money on these false hopes.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357864982402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:43:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357865016798-114</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH new 52-week high !!!!!</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357851376726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 15:56:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357865016798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:43:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357865083846-115</Id><Topic><Title>Why is ARMH stock outperforming INTC so badly??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357838146159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 12:15:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC's dividend alone represents more than ARMH can gross in a year,INTC is begining to focus on mobile,it will swat ARMH like the insignificant fly speck that it is.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1357865083846</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:44:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357865095235-116</Id><Topic><Title>10 Billion Global Foundries plant just announced...dagger for Intel</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1357845951926</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL when you are not leading future : Memory/Storage Technology chips So how can INTEL fill its foundry pipe line next? lol While Intel is still struggling to get into the mobile business, ARM continues to set its sights further afield.

Although the quarter marked the beginning of a new stage in the PC industry with the launch of Windows 8, its impact did not quickly change recently sluggish PC demand, and the PC market continued to take a back seat to competing devices and sustained economic woes. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2012 marked the first time in more than five years that the PC market has seen a year-on-year decline during the holiday season. The lackluster fourth quarter results were not entirely surprising given the spate of challenges the PC market faced over the course of 2012. IDC had expected the second half of 2012 to be difficult. Consumers as well as PC vendors and distribution channels continued to be diverted from PC sales by ongoing demand for tablets and smartphones. In addition, questions about the use of touch on Windows PCs vs. tablets slowed commercial spending on PCs. "Although the third quarter was focused on the clearing of Windows 7 inventory, preliminary research indicates the clearance did not significantly boost the uptake of Windows 8 systems in Q4," said Jay Chou, senior research analyst with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker. "Lost in the shuffle to promote a touch-centric PC, vendors have not forcefully stressed other features that promote a more secure, reliable and efficient user experience. As Windows 8 matures, and other corresponding variables such as Ultrabook pricing continue to drop, hopefully the PC market can see a reset in both messaging and demand in 2013." "As anticipated, the U.S. market had a rough ending, dropping 4.5% in the fourth quarter and contributing to a decline of 7% for the full year 2012," said David Daoud, research director, IDC U.S. Quarterly PC Tracker. "Consumers expected all sorts of cool PCs with tablet and touch capabilities. Instead, they mostly saw traditional PCs that feature a new OS (Windows 8) optimized for touch and tablet with applications and hardware that are not yet able to fully utilize these capabilities. Despite a generally weak performance, some leading brands managed do to well relative to the market. HP, Lenovo, Asus, and Samsung were among the top performers, taking advantage of some consumer interest in Windows 8, and a push to build up their presence ahead of 2013." Regional Highlights United States – The U.S. market struggled in the fourth quarter of 2012, although to a lesser extent than expected given the channel replenishment activity that occurred in December. Some consumer activity took place in conjunction with the release of Windows 8. However, limitations in product offerings, in particular for touch screen Tablet PCs, led consumers to once again delay purchases. Consumer-focused vendors like HP and Asian majors like Lenovo, Asus, and Samsung managed strong performances, partly in response to modest consumer demand, and partly due to channel activity in December ahead of the anticipated 1H13 Windows 8 push. The rest of the industry continued to take a wait-and-see approach as consumer attitudes toward Windows 8 are clarified. EMEA – The EMEA PC market performed in line with expectations in 4Q12, with shipments declining at a mid single-digit rate from a year ago. Although sell-in of Windows 8 systems accelerated by early December, helped by the new Ultra Slim offerings, consumers continued to shun PC purchases in favor of attractively priced tablets and smartphones, particularly during the end-of-year Christmas season. Commercial purchases also remained weak, softened by persisting uncertainty in the economic situation across the region. Japan – Japan registered growth that was slightly positive, but still several points below forecast. Consumer demand was expected to be weak as the first batch of Windows 8 machines was markedly more expensive than previous generation models. However, the impending ending of Windows XP support helped to boost commercial volume, where companies have been steadily upgrading to Windows 7 for the past several quarters. Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) – The Asia/Pacific region came in slightly below forecasts, as channels in most countries focused on clearing out existing Windows 7 inventory before bringing in fresh Windows 8 stock. China was not too far off target, though ongoing sluggishness in the economy as well as a slowdown in public sector projects kept the PC market there suppressed this quarter. Vendor Highlights HP continued to defend its top position in IDC's worldwide ranking, recovering somewhat from past weakness in key markets. An aggressive push for Windows 8 volume helped the vendor make gains in Asia/Pacific and its home turf in the U.S. HP struggled in EMEA but posted the first year-over-year growth in Asia/Pacific in four quarters. Total volume was nearly flat from a year ago, but better than the overall market. Lenovo outpaced the market with growth of over 8%. Volume reached a new record-high of more than 14 million units, with continued success in channel wins in the U.S. and EMEA. Despite the positive performance, Lenovo's gains remained significantly smaller than several quarters ago when the company was besting market growth by nearly 30%. Dell continued to lose ground as it faces aggressive competition from other leaders and looks for better margins. Worldwide shipments were down over 20% year over year – faster than declines over the past several years – with U.S. volume declining almost as much. The firm did manage sequential growth in most other markets. Acer Group, like a few other vendors, remains heavily dependent on consumer spending. As a result, it has continued to suffer as consumers focus on other products. At the same time, Acer's cautious approach to the Windows 8 transition has contributed to slower notebook shipments. ASUS held onto its top 5 spot globally and stretched the distance between itself and other consumer-focused vendors with growth of 5.6% year on year. The firm racked-up strong gains across many regions, where its often innovative yet price-conscious offerings still managed to take root in spite of an increasingly tough landscape.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357866545170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:09:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357866779765-124</Id><Topic><Title>Why is ARMH stock outperforming INTC so badly??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357838146159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 12:15:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>congrats, if you bght INTC in 1995, you would still have the same share price today.

Consumption is growing at a rate of two percent annually. In the last decade, between 29 percent and 42 percent of California’s in-state generation used natural gas. Another 10 percent to 20 percent was provided by hydroelectric power that is subject to significant annual variations. Almost one-third of California’s entire in-state generation base is more than 40 years old. Fifteen percent to 30 percent of statewide electricity demand is served from sources outside state borders. Peak electricity demands occur on hot summer days. California’s highest peak demand was 52,863 megawatts and occurred July 10, 2002. Peak demand is growing at about 2.4 percent per year, roughly the equivalent of three new 500-megawatt power plants. Residential and commercial air conditioning represent at least 30 percent of summer peak electricity loads. Privately owned electric utilities serve 80 percent of the load in California.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357876536057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:55:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357877275835-147</Id><Title>Qualcomm’s mess of a CES keynote</Title><Msg>Sylvie Barak (EE times) 1/9/2013 6:10 PM EST Cringeworthy keynotes at conferences are not new news. Nor are keynotes light on substance, and incoherent in messaging. Sadly, Qualcomm’s combination of all of the above, at its first ever CES keynote hit a low and almost ludicrous note; getting people talking… for all the wrong reasons. ........... The cynic in me was not surprised. After all, Qualcomm was late to ship with its Windows RT implementation, and the product has fast been losing traction. Frankly, it was more exciting as a concept than an actual product, and it’s clear that Microsoft was doing its damndest to prop it back up from its slump. Intel needed no such support for its own Windows 8 offerings. Once Ballmer eventually left the stage, Jacobs announced what would be the only news of the night, the already predicted launch of its slightly upgraded series of processors. No big whoop. They are slightly better, slightly faster, slightly lower power. If this is what passes for CES keynote news these days, it’s not surprising the big players are rethinking their commitment to the show.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357877275835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 23:07:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357878946719-148</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings could be spectacular</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1357853261750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 16:27:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would not doubt it.
