Intel will be shipping the Silvermont and the phones with it will be selling this Christmas and those phones will HURT Apple and Samsung. Just like Apple and Samsung killed off Nokia because Nokia failed to change fast, New Phone companies will rip into Apple and Samsung. Intel is the Apple killer. But really--it was inevitable because Intel HAS to sell to anyone who wants its chips due to its near monopoly in CPUs and past history. Intel could have never given Apple and exclusive deal even if it had wanted to--which it did not want to. Look at the benchmarks on the new Intel chip and then KNOW that it will be in the US market in Volume in phones late this year and early 2014. Intel does what it does. It shrinks chips and makes them in ungodly volume. NO company can do it better because Intel, unlike others, has been doing this for over 30 years now. Making CPUs is what Intel does. Now it will put the Intel X86 into tablets and phones and ARMH and companies that rely upon Armh designs like Qulllycom, will be Roadkill--just like AMD was.

Toshiba is going after that today with the launch of its KIRAbook laptop, a high-end machine that is designed to be nicer than Apple’s object of affection. For Toshiba, this isn’t just the launch of one computer. It’s the start of a brand, dubbed KIRA. The machine is made of high-end materials and it has a spectacular display that can rival Apple’s Retina Displays. But it’s pricey, starting at $1,599 for a 13.3-inch model and rising to $1,999 for a high-end version. That’s a very steep price for a Windows 8 laptop, which can be found below $600 these days. But it’s a statement that says Apple isn’t the only computer maker that can employ craftsmanship in its products. The PixelPure display’s native resolution is 2560 x 1440, giving you razor-sharp clarity. No other Windows 8 laptop has such ultra-high resolution, which delivers 221 pixels per inch on the 13.3-inch screen. That’s a 90 percent increase over standard high-definition displays (with resolutions of 1920 x 1080). When you turn it on and view a web browser with that resolution, everything seems tiny. You have to blow up the text to be able to see everything. That plain text is a lot sharper and easier to read. It’s great for looking at your own content, but it the machine uses Intel’s HD 4000 integrated graphics, so you won’t be playing heavy-duty games on this machine. You also won’t find 4K resolution content in large quantities to view on this machine, as Hollywood isn’t quite caught up with that technology yet.</Msg><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1368377679185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 12:54:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368377708805-41</Id><Topic><Title>Toshiba KIRA</Title><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1368377679185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 12:54:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple’s 13-inch Macbook Air sells for $1,200 for 128 gigabytes of storage and $1,399 for 256 gigabytes. The case is built with AZ91 pressed magnesium alloy and a honey-comb based that makes it feel solid. Toshiba says that is twice as strong as typical aluminum alloy laptops. It also uses Corning Concore Glass, and its exterior is resistant and durable. But the machine weighs only 2.6 pounds and it is 0.7 inches at its thinnest point. The edges of the laptop are stylishly rounded. The battery life isn’t great, but it’s acceptable. The KIRAbook uses a high-capacity lithium polymer battery. It also has a 256 gigabyte solid state drive (flash memory) and eight gigabytes of 1600 megahertz main memory. The machine is fast and responsive. One of the drawbacks is that Toshiba’s machine is using Ivy Bridge, the combo graphics-processor third-generation Core platform that is nearing the end of its life cycle. Intel is releasing code-named Haswell processors in June, but Toshiba couldn’t wait for that. It will update KIRAbook with Haswell, but not until late this year. The high-end models have touch screens and Intel’s fastest Core i7 processors, including the high-end 2.0 gigahertz Intel Core i7-3667U. the sound system has Harman Kardon speakers and DTS audio processing. The machine uses Toshiba’s AirFlow II technology, a thin multi-phase fan cooling system. The hinge is stabilized so when you pound on the touchscreen, the machine won’t lean back.</Msg><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1368377708805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 12:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368382803936-42</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting, does TSMC know this guy is very unprofessional?</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368295156886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I get paid for my articles, but not by Intel.

The ETF volume is over 40% of the Intel volume the last time I heard. If the 40% tilts down, there will be downward pressure. I am going to have to try to find a more current number for ETF volume responsible INTC trading volume. There are several things that should give INTC a stronger RSI than the market for awhile longer. "Stronger RSI than the general market" does not imply INTC price up. The short interest was growing from last May at a rate of 10m more shares every semimonthly reporting period. Short interest has been flat for the last 2 months. When short interest stopped increasing by 10m shares every 2 weeks, the share price bottomed and started back up. Share buyback at a rate of 300k shares per day last quarter. Haswell introduction in early June. IMO, there is a strong likelihood that Intel will do better than the market simply because the short interest increase has stopped.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368413032262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 22:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368413607452-70</Id><Title>Intel LTE</Title><Msg>"Recall that today Intel is shipping LTE basebands and is expected to ship LTE multi-mode voice and data baseband solutions by year-end.

ABI Research says the chip major Qualcomm is dominating LTE chipset sales with over two-thirds of shipments in 2012. Though established mobile baseband processor chipset vendors will remain key players as the shift towards LTE continues, some of the smaller LTE baseband vendors will grab a part of the LTE chipset market. ABI Research predicted that the size of the LTE chipset market will grow to well over 850 million shipments in 2018 for handsets alone. “We expect Broadcom and Intel to be significant challengers to Qualcomm over the next few years,” said research director Philip Solis."

"LTE vendors offering integrated platforms can allow OEMs to design products more easily and quickly. At the same time, however, companies that only offer stand-alone LTE base band processors can do fine if they are offering reference designs and related services."
