That's why it's so competitive on FPU performance. Haswell will double these synthetic figures. ----- Getting very technical now. Clutching at straws?:) Given that the application is downloaded and run on the users tablet (nexus 10, in the case of the A15) it's very unlikely that it uses the FMA family of instructions as the same app runs on any (ARM based) device. As a side, Apples Swift and the A9 itself has decent FPU numbers, even against the Ivy Bridge quoted in this thread. I'm not sure what the synthetic comment was meat to mean? The reality is that Geekbench is the best CPU benchmarking tool we have when trying to compare native performance of ARM V ARM (the various implementations across OS's [android/ios]) and ARM V x86 (in it's various implementations, Atom/Core/AMD etc). Yes, the suite is far from perfect and the lack of disclosure of compilers and the options is somewhat irritating.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354872060327</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 04:21:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354872183883-6</Id><Title>Windows 8 Touch PC Demand is Strong, Say Analysts</Title><Msg>From Toms Hardware: "Despite a number of industry figures and PC manufacturers expressing their doubts regarding the operating system's ability to succeed, Microsoft has seen strong demand for Windows 8 touch systems.

(Non-touch demand, not so much.) Retailers cannot keep them on the shelves and now there are shortages. As Touch gains momentum, we might be looking at a huge upgrade cycle in the next couple of years. I know the head of Intel's PC division did a presentation a couple weeks ago (its on the website), and towards the end he was asked what will be the biggest surprise in the PC world one year from now. His answer was that Touch will become the standard for PCs. This was based on thousands of interviews and focus groups they've done with customers over the past few months who loved it. He might be right.</Msg><Username>dundarra</Username><Timestamp>1354873030298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 04:37:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354877229210-9</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Touch Demand</Title><Username>dundarra</Username><Timestamp>1354873030298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 04:37:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows 8 requires touch.

Lucian ArmasuThursday, December 6 2012 Doesn’t sound exactly like big.Little to me. ARM’s low-power and high-performance cores are on the same SoC/chip. This just sounds like they will use both Atom and Xeon chips in a server rack or something. I doubt it will be as efficient switching between them. Anyways, the problem for Intel is that they are very reluctant to even promote Atom for micro-servers, and it shows from how they talk about it. They have a conflict of interest, because they’d rather sell the much more profitable “bigger” chips. The reason why this is a problem for Intel is because ARM has absolutely no problem trying to sell ARM chips for servers. In fact they have all the incentive in the world to do it, while Intel has the least incentive to do it. As Clayton Christensen puts it, Intel will be “happy to concede the low-end, non-profitable (for them) market to their disruptive competitors”. This is why Intel will ultimately lose all markets to ARM (could take a decade or more, though). Because ARM thrives on extremely cheap cores, while for Intel it’s absolutely VITAL for the company’s long term survivability to be able to sell high-margin chips, because that’s how their company is built. As ARM chips get ever more powerful and “good enough” for most devices (that includes laptops, desktops, in the coming years), that means Intel will need to compete with $20 chips, instead of $200 chips with ARM. Look at their IVB 17W laptop chips right now. They are like $250 a piece right now. That’s absolutely unsustainable for Intel in the long-term. ARM is very close to reaching that performance level (only ~3x behind), and their chips will be an order of magnitude cheaper. Intel simply can’t survive in that environment – not in the consumer market at least. They’ll probably manage to survive as a company for a decade or more in supercomputers and whatnot, but it’s only a matter of time before ARM chips get them there, too. In fact Nvidia’s Project Boulder is already oriented towards super-computers, too.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354878218282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 06:03:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354880369763-11</Id><Topic><Title>It's obvious why CNBC won't touch Intel</Title><Username>foxnewzz</Username><Timestamp>1318976726000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-10-18 18:25:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cramer not libearl?

Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs So my follow-up question stands specific to the Data Center Group, some of the ARM based server players are arguing that they can now address a significant part of the workload from the Google’s and the Amazon’s and Facebook’s data centers. Is that some competitive dynamic that you're seeing in that area or do you think that ARM still isn't competitive in that realm? Paul Otellini - President &amp; CEO They need to add features sets like 64-bits and ECC and RAS features to be particularly in those environments to be considered, so that maybe a roadmap planning opportunity that they are pushing but the products that are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets. You can look at some of the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim that would be conducive to let me say in a ray of micro servers, and those can easily be run on Atom; we've got our second generation of the Atom micro server chips out now, the first one is on 32-nanometers. Now we’re now sampling the 22-nanometer one and what we’ve decided that we are just going to push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about all the reliability features.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1354888643988</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:57:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354889456155-14</Id><Title>Might still have some traction today...</Title><Msg>Would be nice if the 'TARDS in D.C. would work things out...

'This is why Intel will ultimately lose all markets to ARM (could take a decade or more, though). ' ROFL. There is less than a 1% chance of that happening ... in about a hundred years at current rate of progress if you start from ARM's creation in the 1980s.

'Because ARM thrives on extremely cheap cores, while for Intel it’s absolutely VITAL for the company’s long term survivability to be able to sell high-margin chips, because that’s how their company is built.' Not exactly vital, it could aways fall back to being a foundry if a miracle actually happened and nobody wanted x86 processors. High margins are determined by product desirability and efficient manufacturability something Intel has been very good at ever since ARM slinked off to the cheap sockets in the 1990s with its tail between it legs.

I think that people have underestimated the power optimization that Intel has incorporated into their chips and especially Haswell. Intel may be guilty of missing the dramatic shift in low power that ARM enabled, but they are not guilty of ignoring it. My source indicates that Paul ordered a Haswell redesign to chop power consumption. We will find out more in 5 weeks at CES2013. I doubt that there will be a $20 ARM server chip. This has the same problem that the BIG.little has. It takes too much silicon. I think that many will skip the microserver hardware and implement virtual machine instances on a Xeon server.

Do you really think that as arm designs get more and more complex, that they will still have the power consumption advantage? Do you think arm can compete with Intel in designing high performance CPUs? IBM couldn't even compete with Intel and Intel has a 20 year lead. You hear arm chips coming out with major performance improvement but remember, performance improvements gets harder and harder with every new iteration. On the manufacturing side, TSMC and GF are not even manufacturing tri-gate chips yet, while intel is into their second generation tri-gate platform. Remember also that Intel designs, manufacture their own chips. They also have all the components (LTE, GPU etc.) for a mobile SoC. So they do not have to license from anyone. qaulcomm, nvidia and apple still have to license from arm and get manufacturing done from TSMC or GF. Do you think arm's license will go down in the future? do you think that as TSMC and GF move to tri-gate technologies, that it will cost less for qaulcomm and nvidia ? Look at the phones coming out now, they are priced at $700! not cheap. Further more, do you think it is easy to get into the server market? Which corporation in the right mind would switch to an untested arm server with lower performance and minimum power/cost advantage and then have to update all their software to run on them and risk that there may be bugs in them.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354893174451</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:12:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354893951918-27</Id><Topic><Title>Maravian and Alexander, if you get time</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354878218282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 06:03:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Williamdavs, you are dead wrong and you are really agressive while hiding behind a PC.

By Sascha Segan September 15, 2012 11:30am EST VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Apple couldn't engineer itself out of the global LTE mess, but maybe Intel can. The new iPhone 5 features 4G LTE, which is going to dramatically improve Internet speeds for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone owners. (Sprint subscribers are left waiting for LTE to arrive where they live.) But globally, the iPhone LTE picture is a disaster. There are two different iPhone models. The AT&amp;T iPhone will work on LTE on T-Mobile USA and in Canada, but not in the rest of the world. The Verizon/Sprint iPhone will work in some European and Asian countries. No iPhone will work on the existing LTE networks in Austria, Brazil, Columbia, Denmark, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland, as iMore points out. The phones will still roam where they can't get LTE; they'll be on 3G, which isn't fatal, but it's a night-and-day difference in terms of speeds. The incompatibility is because there are way too many frequency bands being used for mobile phone networks right now. Apple's a popularizer and refiner of technologies; they're not introducing any radical new RF breakthroughs here, so they're stuck in the same LTE band whirlwind that everyone else is. Between Apple's two models, it's already supporting seven different LTE bands, known as band 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 17 and 25. But European operators have three more bands they use: 7, 20 and 38. They may also use band 8 in the future. Some Asian operators appear to be on Band 40. Here at home, Sprint also plans to use band 26, and some smaller US carriers have band 12. It's a mess. It means phone makers have to put together lots of different models for different countries, and those units will have trouble roaming well in other countries if they travel. It also means small carriers on obscure LTE bands, like 12, have trouble getting phones that work well with their networks because there are no huge carriers placing large orders for them. Can Intel Fix Apple's Problems? Fortunately, across the street from the iPhone event, I saw a potential solution. Intel's Developer Forum was going on just across the street from Apple this week. Up on the second floor, the company was showing off the four relatively lackluster Intel phones so far, as well as a modem technology that could really change things. Intel's XMM6260 modem, which has been in the market for a while, uses a single power amplifier for multiple bands, and it can be extended in software to support as many bands as necessary. It doesn't support LTE or CDMA, which is part of why we haven't seen it in many U.S. products. But the point here, an Intel engineer told me, is that the company will be able to put an unlimited number of bands on a single LTE modem, possibly as soon as late next year. Intel's modems will be able to mate with processors from Samsung, Nvidia, TI, and others. Apple used its modems up until 2010, when it switched over to Qualcomm in part to get Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Modems are only half of the solution, though. Dermot O'Shea, co-founder of antenna firm Taoglas, said antenna design gets difficult when you're covering such a wide range of frequencies. Active antennas for smartphones, which have just started to hit the market this year, can adapt to different bands without being huge, although they add to the cost and complexity of smartphones. We're likely to see more of them next year. Between active antennas and multi-frequency power amplifiers, it looks like phone makers are starting to get their hands around the riot of LTE frequencies; they're just not there yet. Maybe we'll see them in the iPhone 7.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1354898251361</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:37:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354899023459-42</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's next product</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354896105749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:01:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds good, what do you realistically see the price of INTC hitting by the end of next year?

If they buy in Q4, it will be applied to the Jan earnings. As of September 29, 2012, $6.3 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. It is a simple arbitrage. Intel is taking the 2% spread between the interest on borrowing and dividend yield down to the bottom line. They lower share count which bumps the EPS by 6%. 2% of $6b is $120m per year increased pure profits to the bottom line.

Intel has the repurchase program underway and I don't see them changing the existing plan on the $6.3. That plan is probably several $100m per month. I expect them to use a big chunk of the new $6b this quarter and probably has started. I think that there will be 100m short shares covered to get the short number down to the 100m share level and the 300m share repurchase. The shorts will probably cover to take advantage of lower taxes this year and an expectation that share repurchase will mark bottom.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354903432811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 13:03:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354905090403-48</Id><Title>Paul Otellini's record at Intel.</Title><Msg>The guy has done alot business wise for the company and as a result, Intel has a very strong position to benefit from its advancements in the foreseeable future.

The US-based chipmaker is partnering two handset-makers in India to develop a range of smart-phones that use Intel chips . The handsets will be priced from Rs 7,000 onwards and include premium offerings. Intel, which entered into the mobile chip making segment in India through a partnership with Lava, has developed the ‘Lava Xolo’ that was released earlier this year. It now competes with other chip-makers such as Qualcomm, Samsung and Mediatek. According to Debjani Ghosh, Managing Director, Sales and Marketing Group, Intel South Asia, the handsets will be available from the middle of next year. The phones will be touch-screen. It will be based on Google’s Android operating system (OS). “The first handset with Lava that we launched was a premium one. We learnt that it was important to have a portfolio and offer choice to the user. We will not have entry-level handsets ,” Ghosh said while speaking on the sidelines of Infocom — an IT summit. She, however, did not specify whether the tie-ups were with Indian original design manufacturers (Indian handsets vendors) or international original equipment makers. The partnership with Lava will continue. Globally, Intel has a tie-up with handset-makers and telcos such as ZTE, Motorola, Lenovo and Orange among others. Partnership model According to Ghosh, the company follows a reference design system where it provides the handset-maker with all the specifications, including the handset design. Manufacturers can build their own smart-phone incorporating Intel’s chipset. This model is followed in India. The other one, followed globally, is the kit model where the company sells the technology to the handset-maker. Tablet space While Intel has dominated the PC and laptop segment, its entry into the smart-phone space has been delayed. The company is also eyeing an entry into the tablet space . The new tablet PCs, Ghosh said, to be developed on the Android OS will be ‘competitively priced’ and are likely to be launched around early 2013. “We are working across multiple platforms; very soon you will see a product portfolio across different price ranges,” Ghosh said, without divulging details. Intel has already developed chips for tablet PCs manufactured by Acer and Samsung that run on Windows 8.</Msg><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354908579500</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:29:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354909306319-56</Id><Topic><Title>Agree</Title><Username>kermit_the_hogg</Username><Timestamp>1354907900120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:18:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see it closing tomorrow at $36, but instead of selling on Saturday, I'm going to wait till Monday and sell out at 20.10...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1354909306319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:41:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354910352888-57</Id><Title>Here come the sellers</Title><Msg>Here come the sellers</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1354910352888</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:59:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354910740252-58</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Touch Demand</Title><Username>dundarra</Username><Timestamp>1354873030298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 04:37:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot to mention that it was written by paid shill that no one cares about.

With support from open source, the cloud could become a lot more ARM and in general low cost alternative friendly.

Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs So my follow-up question stands specific to the Data Center Group, some of the ARM based server players are arguing that they can now address a significant part of the workload from the Google’s and the Amazon’s and Facebook’s data centers. Is that some competitive dynamic that you're seeing in that area or do you think that ARM still isn't competitive in that realm? Paul Otellini - President &amp; CEO They need to add features sets like 64-bits and ECC and RAS features to be particularly in those environments to be considered, so that maybe a roadmap planning opportunity that they are pushing but the products that are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets. You can look at some of the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim that would be conducive to let me say in a ray of micro servers, and those can easily be run on Atom; we've got our second generation of the Atom micro server chips out now, the first one is on 32-nanometers. Now we’re now sampling the 22-nanometer one and what we’ve decided that we are just going to push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about all the reliability features.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1354913026890</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:43:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354913078121-67</Id><Topic><Title>INTC will rule the cloud</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1354911571979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:19:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>khitchdee, 1.

ARM licensees are startups. They are also pushing their offerings as hard as possible. If its a race between a startup and a bureaucratic huge organization, whom do you think is going to win. Secondly, at the starting point, right now, ARM based chips such as Apple's A6 have a substantial lead over Intel's chips such as Medfield in smartphones. That doesn't bode well for Atom going forward either. As I said earlier, OpenStack is fully ARM compliant. A cloud customer if they use OpenStack doesn't have to worry at all about software and best of all its free.

Nikon plans to have ArF immersion 450mm prototype tools in 2015-16. Other 450mm-related news during SEMICON Japan came from Opening Keynote speaker Kasumasa Yoshida, representative director and president of Intel, K.K., who confirmed Intel’s new 450mm Japan Metrology Center (JMC) in Tsukuba. Ushida said that requirements for 450mm lithography include higher throughput, improved overlay accuracy, and improved imaging performance. The industry’s expectation for high-volume 450mm EUV lithography insertion in 2018 will likely be delayed due to insufficient light source progress, mask infrastructure and EUV photoresist development challenges. Furthermore, Uchida said that the very steep curve of EUV technology improvement required is not realistic in the timeframe. Lithography has been a serious concern among other wafer process equipment tool providers, who have been reluctant to invest in 450mm research and development ahead of a viable advanced node patterning solution. Other equipment companies have been interested in a 450mm litho solution for process development reasons and also as an assurance that chip makers will actually be ready to implement a complete manufacturing line in the timeframe that tool development is being requested. Uchida’s pledge aligns with the G450C roadmap. G450C vice president and general manager Frank Robertson, also speaking at SEMICON Japan, said that the consortium plans for nano-imprint litho and pitch doubling capability over the next two years and “real” 193 immersion litho capability for tool demonstrations at the unit process level by mid-2014. Robertson said that G450C has now negotiated a full set of wafer process and metrology tools with the exception of lithography. In addition to 14nm tool demonstrations, G450C is focused on providing test wafers. Test monitor 450mm wafers are expected to be available in 2Q13, prime wafers in 2Q14 and epi wafers in 1Q15. G450C is giving priority to consortium members and the participating tool makers. They will also provide 450 test wafers to others via a wafer loan program. Robertson pointed to a wafer loan request process on the G450C website. According to economic analysis from Akira Minamikawa, vice president, IHS iSuppli Japan, NAND memory and microprocessors warrant the larger wafer size, but DRAM will not require 450mm manufacturing. Minamikawa estimates that twenty 450mm fab lines (to as many as 50 “at the most”) will be built in a ten-year period. He contrasts that figure to 160 fab lines for 300mm and 240 8” fab lines that were built in a similar timeframe. The need for innovation and collaboration to achieve the cost and time objectives was a common observation from G450C, Nikon and TEL representatives speaking at the Forum. Each speaker pointed to the important role of SEMI Standards in achieving a successful transition and the need for chip makers, consortia and equipment companies to collaborate in new ways. Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) VP and general manager Akihisa Sekiguchi commented that equipment makers face inordinate challenges in the 450mm transition. Concurrent 300mm/450mm R&amp;D and prolonged 450mm startup impose significant financial risk and he warned that it may take years for equipment makers to see an ROI. TEL’s proposal is to unify its various internal platforms for 450mm, and establish an open platform alliance to share previously proprietary information with the supply chain. Concepts for harmonizing facility connections have been well-received by the G450C as a means to reduced installation costs and complexity. Intel’s new 450mm Japan Metrology Center (JMC) in Tsukuba was referenced in an earlier industry presentation at SEMICON West and operational since July, but has not been publically announced. Yoshida said that mission of the new facility is to support the 450mm network by providing “quick turn” metrology, improved supplier R&amp;D velocity and a link to the G450C activity in Albany, New York. Yoshida said that the semiconductor industry is spurred by silicon innovation and penetration. He referenced smartphone demand, which is expected to grow at a 24 percent compound annual growth rate over the next several years, and tablets with a 53 percent CAGR, as key market drivers. He further commented that 15 billion intelligent connected devices will be present by 2015 and contribute to an estimated 35 trillion GB of data traffic. He said that the combined market drivers potentially yield semiconductor industry sales with greater than 50 percent upside by 2020 — meaning a worldwide market of about $450 billion. He anticipates that Intel products will represent a 25-26 percent share of the total and therefore the company requires aggressive investment to increase capacity. The next SEMI 450mm Transition Forum will occur at SEMICON Korea on January 30, 2013.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354940222915</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 23:17:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
