Desktops and laptops using Intel’s chips will likley surge in Southeast Asia’s largest economy since increasing incomes will allow more people to purchase computers. Intel has struggled in more-developed markets, due to increasing sales of smartphones and tablet computers not using Intel’s processors. Intel’s global sales saw a 5.5 percent decline from the previous year’s last quarter, but the company’s Indonesian sales has the potential to climb over 20 percent during the year, stated Uday Marty, who is Intel’s Singapore-based managing director of Southeast Asia. Now, fewer than one in ten Indonesians own computers, and there is a lot of possibility to keep growing at that rate, he said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354106436154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 07:40:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354108360309-7</Id><Title>India: Intel's next big opportunity</Title><Msg>Roughly 10 million PCs are sold in India yearly. In a population of 1 billion, that's only about 1%. Intel has the opportunity to penetrate this virtually untapped market. If they can get some of their lower cost models in the hands of say half the population, that would mean roughly 500 million chips which would keep some their newer high tech fabs busy. Intel has a strong presence in India with a head office in Bangalore and several sales offices all over the country. They have the reputation of being the employer of choice for countless Indian engineers. By giving employment and that too cutting edge high tech employment to local engineers, they are doing their bit in being good corporate citizens by giving back to the communities where they sell their products. Their TV ads appear on national television frequently and even in India they are approaching the brand status of household name.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354108360309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:12:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354108937052-8</Id><Topic><Title>Indonesia: Bump for Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354106436154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 07:40:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds positive... however, I wonder how much their margins are suffering... that could have a negative impact on their earnings...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1354108937052</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:22:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354109025520-9</Id><Topic><Title>12/12/12, end of the world is near</Title><Username>cinqolok</Username><Timestamp>1354056702778</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 17:51:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world already ended, this is all imaginary...

First, there is no way that congress is going to agree to spending cuts and tax increases that are anywhere near as large as the cliff. Second, most of the cliff changes are actually things that we should have already done. Third, even after the cliff we will continue to run huge deficits. Yes, we will probably have a recession, but that is something that we have needed for a long time. Borrowing our way around and out of recessions just puts off the inevitable and that comes back in the end even worse. I do not expect revolution and I suspect that while congress approval rating will drop even further (is there really room for it to drop?) we will continue to reelect the same idiots to congress.</Msg><Username>cynicalanddisgusted</Username><Timestamp>1354110881868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:54:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354112117710-15</Id><Topic><Title>INTC would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Username>hopperrobert35</Username><Timestamp>1354104495623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 07:08:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes man</Msg><Username>changcrombie</Username><Timestamp>1354112117710</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:15:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354113053447-16</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses in first month</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354053461554</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 16:57:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the biggest plus is the support of touch input.

So, he shouts over to the bartender so loudly that everyone can hear, "Drinks for everyone in here, bartender, but not for the Republican." Soon after the drinks have been handed out, the Republican gives him a big smile, waves at him, then says, "Thank you!" in an equally loud voice. This infuriates the union boss.

According to Nvidia, the current model is unsustainable. Here’s the company’s projected analysis for transistor costs at current and new nodes.... As the process nodes shrink, it takes longer and longer for the cost-per-transistor to fall below the previous generation. At 20nm, the gains all-but vanish.

Intel is desperate to acquire ARM as its chips are much faster than its own, which are in danger of becoming obsolete. Paul Otellini, chief executive of Intel, steps down in May of next year, a crucial time for the company as it tries to win market share in smartphones and tablets, which are much faster-growing areas than its core PC market. This is expected to shrink this year for the first time since 2001. A move for ARM could prove to be Otellini’s swan-song and word is he would be prepared to go hostile should the two boards not agree on a ‘friendly’ deal." Much faster than their own ? obsolete ?

I'm doing ok. I saw the writing on the wall for print media a long time ago and sold all my Media General in 2005 for $69 a share. It closed today at $4.20. Many of my coworkers lost most of their 401k by putting it all in one basket and holding forever. That was what all the wall street experts said. "Buy and hold". Which we all know is a losing strategy. Print media has gone the way of the typewriter and many other industries after the internet. In my opinion Buffett has a little sentimental thing going for the newspapers. His dad was editor for the Washington Post and he was at one time a paper boy. He'll make money on the deal but not because he's smart but because he had the money to buy at the right time and like the old Kmart trade Eddie Lampert did the real estate is worth what he paid. He could be buying INTC again but i doubt it very seriously because he doesn't like to pay full price when he's got the money to make 10% or more on layup deals like the one with the newspapers.</Msg><Username>bob_dylan_64</Username><Timestamp>1354146294943</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 18:44:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354149490273-80</Id><Title>Alexander</Title><Msg>I'm guessing you understand the tax increases so had a question: If My total household income is 45k and say 1 make 4k a year in Dividends.........what will my new tax be?

Answer, a complete monoply on the 2 instruction sets used for almost all computing. What would that do to the INTC is dead because they don't have any mobile presence? They then would have 100% of mobile and 99% of desk tops, tablets, and others. The only other competitor not beholding to INTC would be AMD's 5 billion in sales. What would that do to INTC's stock price. At the historic level of 22PE and a 3/share profit, we could easily get $66.00/share. Far fetched, but it would turn the hedge funds and shorters world upside down overnight. Matbe, god wiling, this would happen to give the big boys what they so justly deserve. Just my thought!

No. Hell even Apple wouldn't allow it and would outbid Intel just for fun if it even attempted such a ridiculous move.

What this slide states — we can’t even call it a suggestion — is that smaller processes no longer improve yields by leading to a greater number of chips per wafer. Instead, the complexities and difficulties of manufacturing at the new process create a cost structure that provides precious little incentive to manufacture at the new process. As for wafer costs, they’ve become part of the problem.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354164273007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 23:44:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
