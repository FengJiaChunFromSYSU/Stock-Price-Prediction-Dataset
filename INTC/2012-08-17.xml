Assuming the price points are correct, W8, Ipad, and Android will have tablets around $200-$250, which will move a lot of number crunching to non-intel CPUs. My concern for Intel is gigaflops per dollar. Intel has the best CPUs by a long shot, but they cost $200, while these little ARMs cost ~$20. Data center will be fine, but consumer may be flat. W8 will help, and Intel is already discounted, so who knows.</Msg><Username>awaytocar123</Username><Timestamp>1345205118000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:05:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345205898000-5</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Tablets to cost 300 bucks less than Intel Tablets</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1345160386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 19:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An ARM tablet should cost less than a PC tablet because an ARM tablet is just a big smartphone.

I especially like the PUT WRITING sections. I like to write at the money puts (60-90 days out where the price is $1-$1.50) on intel after several big down days. VIX is high, bounce is building up and Intel options are pretty liquid with small spread. The VIX comes down (option price drops), Intel bounces (option price drops) and time value premium decreases (option price drops). Depending on what happens, I cover when they drop to 25 - 50 cents.

The Iranians know this. Try to keep some common sense before getting more people killed needlessly and devastating the economy. Like in the needless Iraqi war based on trumped up threats of weapons of mass destruction. It's funny - conservatives kept us out of WWII (a war that really needed to be fought) as long as possible. And now conservatives want to start a war at every opportunity. Conservatives have more testosterone than brains. Why don't they show some of that bravado with the economy which they have continuously tried to beat down just for political gain. I'm sick of the doom and gloom crowd. The only thing conservatives have enthusiasm for is wars and tax cuts. Let's hope the American public just says no.

"During that period, Marriott engaged in a series of complex and high-profile maneuvers, including 'Son of Boss,' a notoriously abusive prepackaged tax shelter that investment banks and accounting firms marketed to corporations such as Marriott," states the op-ed, which was published this week on CNN.com. The authors –Peter C. Canellos, former chair of the New York State Bar Association Tax Section, and Edward D. Kleinbard, former chief of staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation–wrote that the "Son of Boss" tax shelter marked "perhaps the largest tax avoidance scheme in history" and cost the U.S. "billions in lost corporate tax revenues." While Romney did not face criminal charges, unlike others linked to the scandal, the authors wrote "his endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into Romney's professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1345216653000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345216747000-25</Id><Topic><Title>We're Good for 30</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1327420596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-01-24 10:56:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>marriage in his cards? legal is some states now.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1345216747000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:19:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345216764000-26</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Moves Into the Mobile Market</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345211669000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:54:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've heard of Apple, Samsung, HTC and Nokia.

So far, nada. I ran across this fairly non-technical article yesterday. As you know the tablet is powered by the Tegra 3. There were two points that stood out from the article (the article was a mostly glowing review of the tablet) "Carrying around the Nexus 7 everyday quickly revealed one of the Nexus's weaknesses. At an advertised 9.5 hours, the Nexus 7's battery is fine - beyond fine maybe - but I never got that much juice out of it, and it's standby lasts nowhere near Google's advertised 300 hours. The Nexus is more inline with a phone battery than an iPad battery, which means you'll have to charge it every day." This is interesting because the design of the Tegra 3 is a quad core processor and then one slower baby core that runs at a much lower clock speed and sips energy. Wasn't the superior battery life a selling point of ARM? Here's another iPad overheating when playing games issue with this tablet. "This has the same internals as the Ouya, and can handle heavy processing pretty well - though I never experienced it, some users have noticed touch response dropping during intense gaming sessions, an unfortunate side effect of what looks to be overheating." The Tegra 3 is positioned by ARM as a goal so high that there is no way that Intel can reach it. After reading this article I think that the bar has been knocked down a few places and in the real world ARM isn't as far ahead as they claim to be. http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/16/the-nexus-7-review</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345233168000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345233181000-51</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Tablets to cost 300 bucks less than Intel Tablets</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1345160386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 19:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM64... ________ Like you've said 1,000 times before regarding Intel upcoming products.......WHEN ??!!!??????

Still, Microsoft is banking on ARM devices to be successful for maximum profits even though they could always fall back on Intel in mobility and even AMD if they decided to enter the space. Keep in mind that Microsoft’s decision to invest in ARM came at the cost of not investing additional functionality and usage models into the desktop, and therefore Microsoft needs to get something out of ARM to assure this payoff.

Is Intel competing in the $199 market ? Not yet, but they will. All I am saying is that the ARM being two years ahead of Intel statement that the ARMH CEO made just doesn't seem to be true. The Tegra 3 looks to be a nice processor, but the fact remains that a 12.5 day standby time which in reality turns out to be a one to two day standby time I get kinda skeptical. If those are the real world specs that Intel must meet to be in the game it suddenly looks much easier. Most of the tablets on the market don't have replaceable batteries. I know people who can't live without their tablets and will buy a new one when the battery starts to die. But, in general I am wondering how many original iPad owners there are who put up with worsening battery performance. Just because they shelled out $500 at one point will the do it again? The article made a good point about how portable the Nexus 7 was, and how little effort went into using it. I am thinking that smaller and cheaper and larger and more powerful is where the industry is heading. Going from 10" to 7" is something that the industry can do especially with jaded consumers who don't care to take another $500+ trip to the Apple store. For those who demand power I can see them moving into Core processors with larger screens. They can game for a few hours between charges which may be good enough for them.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345244962000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 19:09:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345245132000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Apple moving to Intel IMO</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1345241216000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:06:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see Apple as a company reluctant to change a formula that is working.

With the growing manufacturing momentum behind the ARM camp, this is unlikely to change. Otellini's claims on extending the process lead don't check out.' A single-core first generation in-order Atom competes successfully with the latest dual-core ARM out-of-order chips. How do you think the brand new second generation version will do on the most advanced 22nm process ? There will also be dual-core and quad-core variants with the latter to become the premier tablet performance chip. Sure Samsung and Apple will survive with their proprietary in-house chips but the other ARM chip merchant vendors may be in for a bit of trouble ;-). 'Likely scenario -- Intel remains a fringe player in mobile for a while then gracefully exits as it has done on countless projects before this that are outside of its comfort zone.' Likely scenario -- Intel eventually makes ARM the AMD of the mobile world ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1345257689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 22:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345259399000-77</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 3 issues?</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345233168000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:52:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"All I am saying is that the ARM being two years ahead of Intel statement that the ARMH CEO made just doesn't seem to be true."
