Once AMD finally folds the Intel will be the sole company supporting x86 while arm has numerous - that's a lot of r &amp;d to contend with.' Yawn this is not a new situation Intel finds itself in, having beaten all the RISCs silly for the last 2-3 decades (DEC Alpha, IBM Power, SUN Sparc, HP PA-Risc, SGI Mips etc) in both client and server and all the R&amp;D put in them. For some strange reason a few large OEMs have decided in their very finite wisdom to pick the weakest and barest featured RISC to all have another go e.g. ARM. Having seen their efforts so far and their future roadmaps they have come up short ... again. Like Otellini said, micro-architecture is hard and Intel have the right architecture, CISC e.g. x86, and the right experience and patents to continue winning pretty easily.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358745272480</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 00:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358745362408-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why Intel will prevail against ARM over the next few years.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1358724803287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 18:33:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup them and dozens of others like apple, qcomm, atmel, nxp, Sony, ad etc...

Two years ago they couldn't wait to talk about 20nm planar. Now they never, ever talk about 20nm, much less when ARM will have FinFET (never or so close to never it won't matter) in production. So, they have to crow about something. They can't talk about the fabless foundry model. It's broken. They can't talk about their power efficiency advantage. It's gone. They can't talk about Intel not being able to make a competitive smartphone. They already have. They can't really talk about 28nm. It's already obsolete with Intel in full-volume production on 22nm. They can't talk about ARM Windows RT. It's a disaster. They can't talk about ARM's 80 P/E ratio and it's bubble trouble. The result is that they are left with talking about the ARM64 vaporware that will be DOA whenever it arrives. But at least it has to arrive before it can be declared totally DOA, providing a tiny bit of room for discussion. Such is the new life of the fanbois.

That isn't the case anymore with the growing popularity of non ms content that's not RISC adverse. The content is what made intel and x86 and it is now leading to its downturn. Cisc has advantages but everbody else went RISC for a reason. As for CISC vs RISC I don't see how cisc gives u any advantage as u shrink the die as RIsC typically requires fewer transistors. That being said x86 is not a pure a CISC chip anymore and the lines between the two have been blurred for some time so many of the comparisons made years ago don't even hold true anymore.

To say it is an endurance test is putting it mildly - close to 150,000 attendees predicted and ~5,000 media/analysts, so we (there's two of us from Chipworks) spend more time standing in line than actually seeing the show. Be that as it may, Tuesday morning we went to one of TI's suites at the show, and lo and behold, a working OMAP5430! Announced last year, this is something we've been anticipating at Chipworks for a while. The silicon came out of the fab two or three weeks ago and is going through phase one testing, but so far it's "live, stable and 100% functional". Testing has gone well enough that samples are already in customer hands. There was a mobile demonstration unit showing graphics processing at 64 fps (using Android's Ice Cream Sandwich), which compares with 47 fps for the OMAP4470. Other exercising is obviously being performed, but the space was pretty crowded so we didn't get a chance to get an exhaustive display. There was a palpable feeling of achievement in the room, and the folks showing us around were like new parents - great to feel that buzz! Given that Huawei just announced a phone with the OMAP4460 in it, things are going well for TI. It's too early to have a great deal of detail (so no pictures!), but essentially the part is meeting the published specs , and on track to be a 2GHz processor. Fabbed in UMC's 28LP process, it utilizes two ARM Cortex A15 cores, and two low-power Cortex-M4 processors (taking the "big-little" approach discussed at the ARM Techcon last year). It has 2 MB cache, and the graphics side is covered by dual POWERVRÃ¢Â&#132;¢ SGX544-MPx graphics accelerators. Initially it will be shipped in a 14 mm x 14 mm PoP with 980 balls on 0.4mm pitch, and the stock photo below looks remarkably like the Amkor Thru-Mold Via technology that we first saw with the OMAP4430 in the RIM Playbook. TI Stock Image of OMAP 5 Platform Given that first silicon is only just out, it's unlikely that we'll see the 5430 in a downstream phone or tablet for a year or so, but who knows, if things pan out well, some OEM may want to accelerate that and we'll get it earlier. I hope so! Thanks to Brian Carlson, Mike Blaskovich, and Heather Ailara for hosting us and letting us be among the first to see this hot new device. We have been posting blogs from CES, mostly commentaries on the press sessions so far, at our Chipworks blog , and follow my occasional tweets at @chipworksdick.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1358747748786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 00:55:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358747925533-11</Id><Topic><Title>Why Intel will prevail against ARM over the next few years.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1358724803287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 18:33:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pure conjecture!

Picture Apple waving buh-bye. Hmmm. Still no 20nm planar news. I wonder if TSMC is even working on it??? Oh, wait - there is some news. Apparently TSMC will introduce 20nm at the end of the year. Hmmm. Wonder if anyone told them they would turn into a pumpkin if they didn't have it ready in the middle of the year. Guess not. It therefore appears that TSMC won't have the volume production it needs in the middle of the year but will have maybe a couple of samples instead by the end of the year. They didn't want stinky ole Apple's business anyway... Here are some of my favorites from the latest news: "TSMC did struggle with its 28nm supply for Qualcomm early last year, but it eventually caught up later on, and Chang stated that TSMC now owns nearly 100 percent of the 28nm process market." [Of course this means no other ARM foundry has been able to make 28nm successfully. Now that's really bad ARM news...] "Chang predicted last week that the follow-up, more advanced 20-nm process generation will ramp up even faster." [I absolutely love this comment! I only wish I had been there to ask, "Um, Morris, based on what? Because we see tons of evidence that TSMC's ramp is slowing with each new node and absolutely no evidence that it is speeding up or that TSMC has the ability to speed it up. So, it would be great for Morris to trot out a few details just so we know that the marketing department isn't writing all of his material these days. And feeding and dressing him. Well, he is getting old. Nor did Morris happen to mention 20nm's lousy planar performance and economics. Guess the marketing department doesn't really know enough to discuss those issues...] "The threat posed by Intel is nearly on par with that of Samsung. Should Intel achieve its goal of adapting its industry-leading wafer processing prowess from microprocessors to more power stingy system-on-chip devices, the chip giant would be in a strong position both to steal market share from TSMC’s key mobile chip clients with its own products. Reports this week that networking equipment giant Cisco (said to be a TSMC client) has become a foundry client of Intel’s only serve to underscore the latter point. But while Intel by has a long way to go before being able to duplicate the design infrastructure and broader foundry ecosystem that TSMC has fostered, a surge of recent Intel job postings for related disciplines suggests that Intel is spending aggressively to build up its contract manufacturing business." [Funny how the mainstream tech press virtually ignored the Cisco news last week in favor of pronouncing the PC to be dead for the 50th billion time...] [Just more evidence that the ARM fabrication fade will be the pin that deflates ARM's P/E and stock price to about a third of where they are now...] [Let the countdown resume...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358749370103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:22:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358749657841-18</Id><Topic><Title>The world is porting to ARM</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358701719693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 12:08:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm.

But my conjecture relates to an article I read suggesting that from a competitive basis TSMC would need to have 20nm available by the middle of this year in order to meet Apple's future needs. For Apple the tough decision is after 28nm which I think is the last hurrah for ARM. TSMC needs to demonstrate that they will have something (anything?) competitive after 28nm in large volume. To do this they have to be on a fast track. They aren't. As you say they are working on 28nm. These decisions take a long time to put in place. So Apple is planning for two years from now. Why would anyone want to risk a company on what TSMC might or might not have in two years? Some of the press and analysts have indicated that Apple has made a commitment to TSMC for 20nm.

Hahah...yeah ok you must be desperate. WinNT might has well been called WinRT. "It allows you to do more complicated efficient procedural instructions. " Hahaa!

"It is no accident that the two most successful computer architectures of all time" Actually it was. In the case of the x86 it was essntially, as I pointed out, the content. There was no VIABLE windows solution for RISC pc's and Intel had a virtual monopoly. As for the IBM mainframe, and I must say I spit out my drink when I read this (you really are desperate), that had more to do with RAM. Because RISC architectures are limited by the availability of RAM. Back then in the ANCIENT DAYS of computing RAM was slow and expensive so it made sense to use a CISC instruction set as a RISC one requires the op to be loaded into memory retrieved and the up loaded again....(the load-store loop).

In-order, Out-of-order means whether instructions are executed in the order or out of the order in in which they come into the processor pipeline. Being out of order means the cpu can process a later instruction earlier than a stalled previous instruction thus improving processor throughput and performance. You also seem to think that all computer instructions boil down to loads and stores which I suppose you would do just looking at just RISC processors. Each ISA has a list of instructions at each implementation, I suggest you do some research and see the big differences between each rather than just wave your arms around, flapping your gums and revealing your gross ignorance. The IBM mainframe chip is now up to a 5.2 GHz quad-core so it is still doing great with asps for a single chip still measured in the tens of thousands of dollars. realworldtechDOTcom/z196-mainframe/ 'IBM’s zArchitecture mainframes have a long and storied history and occupy a unique place in the computing landscape. The starting point, the System/360 was envisioned as a family of computers that could serve any potential customer – from business to scientific computing. The first systems were released in 1964, after years of development and a budget that reportedly grew to $5B. The S/360 introduced the concept of compatibility by defining an instruction set architecture that was separate from the initial implementation. In addition to the first ISA, it was also the first system to use microcode and subsequent models were the first computers to use virtualization in production. The technical achievements yielded tremendous commercial success for IBM well into the next century. As recently as 2006, mainframes and related products and services were responsible for a quarter of IBM’s revenue and half of the profit. The mainframe significantly predates the concept of RISC, which was pioneered in the 1980’s. zArchitecture, along with x86 are classic complex instruction sets and ironically, amongst the most commercially successful. This is most likely due to the unwavering commitment to software compatibility from IBM, which was subsequently inherited by Intel and the PC. Mainframes evolved over time from 24-bit addressing, to 31-bit addressing in 1982 and eventually the 64-bit zArchitecture in 2000. The latter signaled the end for most mainframe clones, which were predominantly 31-bit. One of the more unique elements of the mainframe is the I/O architecture. I/O is managed by a dedicated channel processor, to offload work from the main CPU. Channel programs are invoked with a single instruction on the main CPU and executed by the I/O processor. In some ways, this is the ultimate form of CISC – a single zArchitecture instruction might be the equivalent of millions of simple operations. The emphasis on I/O and system architecture is the hallmark of IBM’s mainframes. IBM’s mainframes are expensive computers, priced well beyond proprietary RISC/UNIX systems, but they can often be an economically attractive platform due to the overall efficiency and stability. The high cost of a mainframe has given the processors a reputation as engineering projects with infinite budgets. This reputation is not entirely true, but it is understandable how this myth developed. The name ‘mainframe’ stems from packaging all the components of the computer into a single frame. Early mainframes were designed with bipolar logic and spanned multiple chips. The first mainframe based on a CMOS microprocessor (i.e. single chip processor) was the 9672-G1 in 1994. The microprocessors have subsequently evolved to integrate greater system level functionality, mirroring the path of Moore’s Law. Given the cost of the overall mainframe and the relatively smaller role of the microprocessor, it is eminently understandable that IBM would consistently choose to design large CPUs with exotic packaging and high power consumption, in order to maximize overall performance. This gives IBM’s engineers a unique opportunity, since most other microprocessor design teams are constrained by the economics of a component, rather than system, business model. The z196 is the latest mainframe microprocessor from IBM. It is a 5.2GHz, quad-core, 3 issue, out-of-order execution design that was released in late 2010. The z196 is manufactured on IBM’s 45nm SOI process with 13 layers of metal and deep trench capacitor eDRAM. IBM’s process technology was slightly customized for the z196, with two extra layers of metal and a 4th Vt option for critical paths. The z196 has roughly the same 15 FO4 pipeline depth as its predecessor, the quad-core z10. The new cores are 25% more power efficient and IBM’s engineers relied on process technology improvements to increase the frequency from 4.4GHz up to 5.2GHz.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358755399650</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 03:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358756226842-38</Id><Topic><Title>brokeagain73</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358755209156</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 03:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't even know what he means by 'parallel computing'.

In other benchmarks and other OS's you'll see a different result:) As for architectural arguments, you are right about the details (BTW, the A9 is only partial OO, the S4 more so, real deal is with the A15) but architectural differences/changes are really about transistor budgets driven by power and cost constraints used for the design and how many of those transistors light up as the ISA flows through them. If we look at the A8/A7 (2 way, in order) they are tiny compared to Atom, and in the A7's case, it would give it a run for it's money in some specific like-for-like benchmarks.. Even the larger A9 is much smaller than Atom. How many A9's can fit into the same die size as an Atom CPU core for example? As we're talking about different ISA's it's not as straightforward as using high level architectural constructs as a means of comparison. A simple example is branch prediction, relatively simple on x86, but difficult on ARM (due to conditionals, nearly every instruction can branch). Another example is hyper threading, perceived as an advantage to Intel. Yet it in new Atom designs, it gets dropped for actual cores.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1358764282942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 05:31:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358764572562-41</Id><Topic><Title>Why Intel will prevail against ARM over the next few years.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1358724803287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 18:33:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're wrong.

It's actually quite difficult to get any figures from Intel, I've seen a vague mention of clovertrail's die being larger than tegra 3 (5 A9's and and ARM7 on die) but nothing firm. I've no idea on the size of the GPU on both SoC's. b) It all comes down to how you measure performance (workload dependent) :) ----- High level architectural constraints are still important because they highlight what is left architecturally as future POTENTIAL. Atom can gain in the future from both out of order processing and 3-way issue and gain 30-40% performance increase from each step. A15 is already there and frankly compared to past x86 3-way OoO processors it is disappointing. ----- True, but in the constrained world of power consumption I'de be shocked that you'de get both 30-40 increase from 3 way and OoO and still be inside your power (and die) budget. ------ Bay Trail will be the Conroe of the tablet world. ----- We shall see:)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1358775063943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:31:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358775095768-49</Id><Title>LTE in late 2012, early 2013 they told us</Title><Msg>Now no talk of it this year AT ALL and they even said no meaningful Mobile revenue AT ALL this year.

Tablets are useful to a degree for consuming some types of information but by the time one buys all the external accessories to overcome their limitations, they've spend as much as not more than a laptop and they've got a kluge of extra devices to carry around. Android tablets and iPads are further limited by the apps they can run. The range of convertible Windows 8 Pro devices shown at CES were impressive. These new products point the way toward a "best of all worlds" approach giving users legacy Windows support, tablet convenience and laptop functionality when work needs to get done. These will come in at a higher price than most standalone tablets but they are infinitely more useful. There is a saying, "if you buy cheap you buy twice" and that certainly applies here.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358780125085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:55:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358780715949-54</Id><Topic><Title>Are You In or Out???</Title><Username>pearliekollaremr8054</Username><Timestamp>1305301359000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-05-13 11:42:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glad you shared this with us.</Msg><Username>emiwilliam</Username><Timestamp>1358780715949</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:05:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358781358798-55</Id><Topic><Title>Tablets won't last for long</Title><Username>basicknowledge</Username><Timestamp>1358778945263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:35:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I definitely agree. I think most of the success was Apple's because it was one of their new products they offerred to customers that wanted access to their apps. I already had that through an older iPhone. I got an iPad for my girlfriend which I got to play with. Even she spent more time on her Sony netbook rather than the iPad. Most of the time spent on the ipad was for games and to download itunes stuff. I'm glad I didn't buy one for myself, because it probably would have collected dust most of the time, except for my plane rides during trips. The $500 I saved could pay for a huge chunk of the ultrabook hybrid that I am in the market to buy. The Lenovo Yoga 11S is gonna soon be sold for only $799. Only $100 more than its Windows RT version, yet it has full windows capability and it comes with an Intel chip. Many of the Apple ipad owners may be happy they got their iPads to have access to Apple apps, but very little reason left for them to upgrade their iPads. Smart thing now would be to go to an Android based tablet to get access to Google Apps as well, or save their money to get a windows based ultrabook/tablet model that gives them enough apps to keep them busy while allowing them the full function of a laptop. Intel certainly has the right idea. In time, things will go Intel's way.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358781358798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:15:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358781388672-56</Id><Title>Will Dividend Growth Rate Stall?</Title><Msg>With the topline retracting, I suspect the dividend will be held fixed for a while.

What Is Wrong With Intel? CONCLUSION: The stock closed at $21.25 on Friday, January 18, 2013, trading at a 7.6% discount to fair value; not a large margin of safety. However, there is another attribute that makes INTC attractive; the dividend along with the dividend history as shown below. The company generates enough cash to support massive capital expenditures ($13B in 2013) with enough free cash flow left to support the dividend and share repurchases. So what is wrong with INTC? Nothing based on the fundamental analysis presented above, but the low expectations, massive capex and PC market visibility appear to be spooking investors. If macroeconomic conditions improve, if not in the second half of 2013 as hoped for by management but in 2014, INTC is paying the investor an attractive yield of 4.1% to wait. This is not an exciting stock for those looking for growth. It may be a better fit for the dividend investor.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358793627428</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 13:40:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358795760631-77</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's ARM blunder: 7 reasons why Windows RT was DOA</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358793466358</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 13:37:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed with all of this but don't be so foolish as to think Pro won't have the same fate.

The silicon wafer was presented to Professor Hawking as a follow-up to a symposium, held to celebrate his 70th birthday and contributions to fundamental physics and cosmology. The event was streamed live by Intel on the Internet. Intel also announced it plans to provide sponsorship for an International Conference on Particle Physics and Cosmology, to be held in Cambridge on Sept. 2 to 6, 2013. "This is a very special gift for an extraordinary scientist and an extraordinary man," said Professor Martin Curley, Intel vice president and director of Intel Labs Europe, as he presented the award. "Professor Hawking's ground-breaking scientific contributions and his remarkable resilience are an inspiration to us all." Professor Stephen Hawking is director of research and founder of The Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge. The Centre has recently received a Cosmos Mk IX supercomputer that is based on Intel processors and is being applied to complex mathematical challenges facing researchers in cosmological research. The supercomputer features 1,856 Intel Xeon E5 processor cores with 14.5-terabytes of globally shared memory. The supercomputer will contribute to answering key questions such as: What happened in the first moments after the Big Bang? What were the primordial seeds that lead to the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and, ultimately people? "We have a long standing relationship with Professor Hawking," said Justin Rattner, Intel Chief Technology Officer and managing director of Intel Labs, in a statement. "We are very pleased to continue to support the work of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology and to work closely with Professor Hawking on improving his personal communication system."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358804177841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:36:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805244786-103</Id><Topic><Title>Is Anyone Making Money WIth INTC?</Title><Username>newtontodd714</Username><Timestamp>1358014743482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am.

As a newcomer in the smartphone market it appears Intel prefers to prove itself in the emerging market and entry level products initially. Since the ROW still heavily uses 3G, there is not a particular rush for Intel to have LTE, at least until they are ready to enter the U.S. market with the full package they are ready to compete head-to-head against Apple and Samsung's finest. Also smartphone growth in the U.S. is beginning to slow as most consumers that can afford smartphone plans have purchased already. In contrast, ROW and emerging markets is growing faster than the U.S. market where subscribers are mostly in the replacement cycle. In short, I believe Intel's LTE plans are coordinated with its market entry strategy because: 1). The growth is faster outside the U.S. 2). It's initial products are a better fit and the competition is still open for new brands 3). LTE is not a driver for ROW today 4). Ottellini's comment suggests that Intel is preparing to put its LTE product lineup against the top tier smartphones early next year, roughly concurrent with its 14nm parts.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358811916885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:45:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358812545861-113</Id><Topic><Title>0.8 GHz Celeron 847 $199 Acer 7 Chromebook mauls 1.7 GHz ARM A15 $249 Samsung Chromebook in cpu and gpu</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358801906253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:58:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I previously posted some Linux HPC comparisons and you posted a Geekbench comparison, the result was not any different.

They currently have a $22.00 target price on the stock. Zacks‘ analyst wrote, “Intel is one of leading producer of microprocessors in the world. We think that weakness in mature markets, economic headwinds in some emerging markets, and pressure from tablets and other competitors are taking a toll on the company. However, Intel’s $0.03 positive surprise versus the Zacks Consensus in the fourth quarter was encouraging. The business continues to be driven by strength in the server and software businesses, supported by a moderate PC business. Moreover, we remain positive about Intel’s dominance in the high-margin server segment and promise of success in the mobile segment, although competition from ARM-based devices continues to intensify. We therefore have a Neutral rating on the shares.” Intel traded down 6.31% on Monday, hitting $21.25. Intel has a 52-week low of $19.23 and a 52-week high of $29.27. The stock’s 50-day moving average is currently $20.88. The company has a market cap of $105.7 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.89. Intel last issued its quarterly earnings data on Thursday, January 17th. The company reported $0.48 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $0.45 by $0.03. The company had revenue of $13.50 million for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $13.76 billion. During the same quarter in 2012, the company posted $0.64 earnings per share. The company’s revenue for the quarter was down 3.0% on a year-over-year basis. On average, analysts predict that Intel will post $1.93 earnings per share for the current fiscal year. INTC has been the subject of a number of other recent research reports. Analysts at Barclays Capital reiterated an “equal weight” rating on shares of Intel in a research note to investors on Friday. They now have a $20.00 price target on the stock. Separately, analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their price target on shares of Intel from $22.50 to $20.00 in a research note to investors on Friday. They now have an “underweight” rating on the stock. Finally, analysts at Robert W. Baird reiterated an “outperform” rating on shares of Intel in a research note to investors on Friday. They now have a $26.00 price target on the stock. Sixteen research analysts have rated the stock with a buy rating, two have given an overweight rating, twenty-six have issued a hold rating, three have issued an underweight rating, and five have given a sell rating to the company.

That is why all the analysts estimates are piled up on the Intel forecast numbers. When the analysts change them, they only bump the estimates by $100m or so. Intel met their Q4 forecasts. Many times Q1 is lower than Q4 and Q3 which are driven by holiday and year end sales. That happed in Q4 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. Only Q4/2010 to Q1/2011 was not down from Q4 to Q1. A lower Q1 should not have been the big surprise that it seemed. I think the $13 capex was the surprise but I am surprised at the impact of the share price drop. There are plenty of issues for negative spin and there are plenty of issues for surprises. New products and important milestones. One very interesting comparision is when you look at the same revenue numbers of TSM. TSM numbers show the impact of 28nm ramp and TSM numbers are not that much different.
