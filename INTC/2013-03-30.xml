Bonehead I NEVER said nor implied ALTR was TSMC largest customer - but ALTR is one of the top five customer in particular when looking at advanced technology (fyi I follow TSMC and UMC for almost 15 years - that's what you do when you invest in equipment stocks) ALTR is an FPGA company, so they usually went first with a new fab since they have a lot of redundancy in their fabric, and use conservative design parameters... I know ALTR is FPGA - FYI ALTR and XLNX were both EARLY adopters of TSMC 28nm HKMG "But ALTR is still committed at 20nm..." yeah ALTR already started designing TriGate version - you think ALTR is stupid and #$%$ away the advantage they obtained going with Intel ? If Apple is smart they do the same like ALTR in order to outsmart Samsung. a lot of redundancy in their fabric, and use conservative design parameters... can you elaborate ARM is toast - why would anybody allocate millions/billions of $ to manufacture an off the shelf/commodity design ?

Too Bad It’s Not True</Title><Msg>Intel Still Trying to Make Us Believe Its Atom Chips Are Superior to ARM. Too Bad It’s Not True Intel has been trying to get into mobile since a few years ago. The problem has not been performance (at the time), because Atom was much more powerful than the 400-600 Mhz ARM11 CPU’s we were having in smartphones back then. The problem has always been power consumption (cost, too, but that’s another issue). They are now trying to convince us that Intel has finally cracked the code, and its chips are not just good enough for mobile, but actually superior. Well, I think that’s nowhere close to being true. Intel may have cracked the power consumption code for Atom, but only because they’ve kept the performance of Atom pretty much the same over the years, so they can work on making it more efficient. Working on increasing performance is in conflict with working on increasing efficiency, in general. When a chip maker builds a chip, they have some choices. Do they keep the power consumption the same as last year’s chip, but increase the performance as much as they can? Do they keep the performance the same, but try to lower the power consumption as much as they can? Do they lower performance, but lower power consumption even more? Do they increase power consumption, but also increase the performance more? Or do they just increase the performance a little bit, and also reduce the power consumption a bit (a compromise)? These can all be design goals for chips, and a chip maker has to make a decision for that specific chip, depending on what type of market they want to address. Since they wanted to address the mobile market, and since they already had a huge (not to be understated) advantage in performance with Atom, then they decided to just focus on power consumption. The problem is that during all this time, ARM chips have made incredible gains in performance, and now the latest Cortex A15 or latest Qualcomm custom ARM chips can easily beat Atom chips in performance, whic</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364618211007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 00:36:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364618441076-7</Id><Topic><Title>Singhlion has said this several times.........</Title><Username>foxnewzz</Username><Timestamp>1364607983522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 21:46:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Singhlion = Nuff.

The price seems to have reached a bottom, showing signs of reversal as it has broken upward after a period of uncertainty or consolidation. The diamond bottom pattern begins during a downtrend as prices create higher highs and lower lows in a broadening pattern. Then the trading range gradually narrows after the highs peak and the lows start trending upward. When the price breaks upward out of the diamond’s boundary lines, it marks a significant reversal to a new uptrend. Diamond patterns usually form over several months in very active markets. Volume remains high during the formation of this pattern. Support can be found at the turning point of the lows and resistance at the top peak of the Diamond. http://finance.yahoo.com/mb/forumview/?&amp;v=m&amp;bn=70e9dbe2-4ba3-33f2-925a-c34d3ae945c5# Recommendation: Buy INTC for a $24.40 – $25.00 target, with a $19.45 stop.

As the smartphone and tablet markets have matured the demand for greater performance has increased beyond ARM's original power efficient design, 2). As ARM attempts to match performance of Intel chips ARM's power efficiency declines. ARM chips are now made that are too power hungry for use in smartphones, and 3). For the tablet market and above vendors don't just choose between ARM and Intel's Atom, they choose between ARM and the entire x86 product line including the much faster Core architecture that scales all the way to supercomputers. And the last line about A15 performance advantage against Atom offers zero data to back up the claim. It's amusing how ARM supporters now resort to comparing its chips using the power envelope of a tablet against Atom with a power envelope of a smartphone. Vendors won't be tricked by this.

For the record this is how the ARM argument has changed over the years. #1. Intel will NEVER have have a power efficient X86 processor in the mobile space. #2. Well Intel has something now that can work, but it's two years behind. #3. Okay, Intel has something that works in the power envelope now but everybody knows that ARM processors are superior . Intel still can't match performance. #4. (My favorite) Oh Intel shouldn't sell these low cost processors because it will ruin their margins. (very desperate). Are we really supposed to get our investment advice from this guy? I mean Merlot_1 pretty much spelled out the flaws in his argument. But I love how ARM fans are now preaching the gospel a bit louder as the market tries to make sense of the mixed signals coming out of the ARM camp. Quadcore smartphones that may or may not be leaking power at 28nm are what consumers are demanding? Windows RT sales are 'Really Terrible'. The dream of taking over the Wintel empire has died on the vine. The ARM64 is still not a reality. To top it off Warren East unceremoniously leaves ARMH one afternoon like a villain leaving town with the loot. Across the board people are wondering if ARM's fabless Cinderella story has the flaws that Mr. Weaver has been preaching for years. So, ARM is in it's desperate mode of reaching the hearts and minds of nervous investors who aren't liking what they are reading on the ARMH boards. Intel on the other hand will say this.

Surface RT is priced at CNY3,688-4,488 plus CNY800 for a touch cover, the source indicated. According to previous estimation by market observers, Surface RT and Surface Pro shipments to the global market would have reached one million units and 500,000 units respectively so far since their launch, but the actual volume for the two models so far is estimated at about one million units in total, the sources said. Viewing that Microsoft has not placed additional orders for Surface RT, an estimated one million units of Surface RT remain in the inventory, the sources indicated. Microsoft has talked with partners about developing second-generation Surface models, but those partners have generally been conservative, the sources noted, adding that Microsoft is inviting notebook and chip vendors to co-develop tablets based on Windows-ARM platform but those vendors have been reluctant." _______________________________________________________________ Looks like Microsoft is expanding the distribution of the X86 Surface Pro rapidly!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364663403980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364663774058-33</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>burkejosh93</Username><Timestamp>1364663774058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:16:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364664992094-34</Id><Title>singlion2001 = getanid61</Title><Msg>same douchebag different id</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1364664992094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:36:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364665103633-35</Id><Topic><Title>China market: Microsoft to launch Surface Pro, say Taiwan makers</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364663403980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:10:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's great for both Intel and Microsoft.

Most of the attention centers around lithography, gate stacks, interconnects, strain engineering and design-for-manufacturing (DFM). Lost in the conversation are two other critical but overlooked pieces in the manufacturing puzzle—wafer inspection and metrology. For years, inspection and metrology tool vendors have managed to stay one step ahead of the defect curve. But as chipmakers migrate toward finFETs, 2.5D/3D chips and other complex structures, process control will become even more challenging and costly. In fact, three key process control tools, CD-SEMs, brightfield defect inspection and optical scatterometry, may soon run out of steam, prompting the need for a new class of 3D metrology gear. “When we get to the 14nm node, we may be able to get by with what we have,” said John Allgair, senior member of the technical staff and Fab 8 patterning metrology manager at GlobalFoundries. “As you get to 10nm, we might need a new technology.” Next-generation 3D metrology tools exist to some degree, but the industry must make substantial investments to bring these technologies into production. And that’s precisely where the problem, and tension, exists between chipmakers and tool vendors. To develop new tools, equipment vendors want a bigger piece of the R&amp;D pie and want customers to assume more of the risk. “Different business models are definitely needed,” said Chris Talbot, senior director of strategic licensing at Applied Materials. “As the industry consolidates, with 450mm and EUV on the horizon, the amount of R&amp;D that needs to be done not just in metrology and inspection, but right across the equipment industry, is enormous.” One idea is to replicate ASML Holding’s recent and blockbuster business deal. Intel, Samsung and TSMC recently invested millions of dollars in ASML to speed up the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and 450mm tools. The three chipmakers also took minor stakes in ASML. “The investments made by Intel and others in ASML are huge to solve an enormous problem,” Talbot said. “This is maybe one of the things we need to look at for other segments of the industry.” Wanted: New business models</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364671888229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:31:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364672203684-46</Id><Topic><Title>To sum it up - comments made by QCOM and Synopsis</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364621160041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 01:26:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>keep pumping but EUV still not ready till 2014 lol In theory, DSA is attractive because it could reduce the overall cost of lithography. And compared to EUV, DSA requires less R&amp;D funding. “We don’t need billions of dollars,” said Ralph Dammel, chief technology officer for AZ Electronic Materials, a supplier of materials for DSA and other applications. “Materials development is inherently cheaper than tool development. The current funding is probably adequate to get the industry going for the 14nm node with DSA. If we’re talking about high chi polymers, which will be needed for the 10nm node and beyond, the industry should think about different funding mechanisms. But even so, we are not talking about huge sums.” Meanwhile, over the last year, Albany Nanotech, CEA-Leti and IMEC have set up 300mm R&amp;D pilot lines for DSA. Major chipmakers are doing their R&amp;D work within these organizations. “Basically, DSA is still in the R&amp;D stage,” said Charles Pieczulewski, director of strategic marketing for Sokudo, a wafer track supplier. “The industry is still working through the bugs with the materials.” Going forward, the challenge is to bring DSA into the IC design and production phases. “The main challenge is device integration,” said Ben Rathsack, strategic marketing and technology manager at Tokyo Electron Ltd., the world’s largest wafer track supplier. Last year, Applied’s Bencher listed defectivity as the top challenge for DSA, followed in order by registration, design flexibility and positional accuracy. For 2013, positional accuracy—or the ability to align the block copolymers in the proper place—has moved to the biggest challenge for DSA, Bencher said. Bencher expects memory makers will be the early adopters for DSA, followed by logic and foundry vendors. The prediction is based on the ability to generate IC designs using DSA. “You hear people saying: ‘We need a whole design ecosystem to enable DSA.’ That might be true for logic, but these are the last people that would implement DSA. This is because you need the most flexible designs in logic,” Bencher said. “Memory makers don’t really need that whole design ecosystem. They need maybe 1% of the EDA ecosystem, compared to the logic people.” Currently, there are several design approaches for DSA. One idea is using 1D gridded arrays, but the problems are obvious. “Designers don’t want to be restricted to having contacts only on a grid or vias on a grid,” Bencher said. Another concept is laying down a sea of holes or fins on a pattern. “In the chemical epitaxy approach, you make holes everywhere to start with. Later, you will do a lithographic step, where you select which ones you want to keep and which ones you want to get rid of. But the problem is that the aerial image can be very sloppy,” he said.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364672203684</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:36:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364672602626-47</Id><Title>ZILLION $ QUESTION:Can Intel Foundry Growth Offset PC Weakness and Evolution to Mobility?</Title><Msg>A news announcement earlier this week has gone largely unnoticed, even though it might be a game-changer for Intel Corp.

A news announcement earlier this week has gone largely unnoticed, even though it might be a game-changer for Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) now that the computing world for processors is changing so much toward smartphones, tablets and other devices. Altera Corp. (NASDAQ: ALTR) confirmed that future manufacturing of Altera FPGAs would be on Intel’s 14 nanometer tri-gate transistor technology. Intel’s foundry business does not disclose all of its partners and clients, but the clients that have been named to date have been very small. They are Achronixm Netronome and Tabula. Adding Altera to the list is a big win, and it can ultimately help Intel lead to other larger companies as well. It is not as important that their next-generation products will target ultra-high-performance systems for military, wireline communications, cloud networking and computing and storage applications. What matters here is that chip and programmable logic companies may be able to get the best of both worlds by utilizing Intel’s manufacturing prowess while saving on their capital and manufacturing expenses. What can come from this is a faster move to silicon convergence, integration efforts and economically flexible alternatives. Intel’s greatest advantage over other traditional processor makers has been that it has been its own manufacturer for the most part. If outside companies are going to take advantage of this, it represents a new business model and means that Intel will not have to lighten up on its deep technology workforce ahead. The move may not get Intel any farther along in the race to win processor orders for smartphones and tablets, where it is still trying to gain a foothold. That being said, it may make up at least a part of what has been an eroding business loss from the PC side of the business. The processor business totally dominates Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE: AMD). AMD has even moved to a fab-lite model. The mobility side of the competitive equation is the ongoing challenge from Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and from ARM Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: ARMH). Both of those companies are beating Intel, and other entrants want a piece of that space too. Intel’s shares remain stuck around the $20 mark. After a 2.6% gain to $27.76 today, its 52-week range is $19.23 to $29.27. The long and short of the matter is that Intel remains very pressured, and new markets may be the only way that Intel can find real growth. Sales in PCs remain under pressure by almost all reports, and analysts only expect sales growth of almost 2% in 2013 and almost 5% in 2014. For Intel’s sales growth to resume, it will require more processor sales on the mobility side of the operations or on the foundry side of the equation. Intel is at least proving that the latter case is possible. Jon C.

X86 vs RISC: There is no significant difference between instruction set code with respect to power consumption. 2. ARM traditionally produced designs for a mobile device using much lower core frequancies(approx 600mhz), with the resultant much lower power consunsumption. 3. By Apples genius play they realised that an ARM powered phone could fundimentally also power a limited capability large ipone without phone capability, ie a tablet. This led to the realisation that a "just good enough" device could create a niche market in the portable space. 4. Esentially, Intel in the past have had a desktop part (Atom) with far higher performance (1.2ghz) though with much higher power consumption. 5. ARM's A15 (28nm Process) supposidly delivers ATOM like performance at moderate power consumption (1.9W). 6.Intel's latest Clovertrail+ Atom (32nm Process) performance at moderate power consumption (1.7W). Simply look at the facts - ATOM Clovertrail+ comparable in power consumption to ARM A15 even though Intel is using 32nm 5 year old process to produce the product. Add in capability to ONLY run RISC coded applications. - ATOM Clovertrail+ superior in performance to ARM A15 even though Intel is using 32nm 5 year old process to produce the product. - ATOM next generation will feature NEW architecture + shrink in process node to 22nm. Add in capability to also run x86 software, with most if not all RISC applications also enabled. ARM camp has to face up to the facts that in a maturing (tablet/Smartphone) market the notion of "just good enough" will not be good enough.Performance and feature will prevail.

Nvidia is very shy with respect to publishing TDP results for this product, though benchmark testing indicates the A15 Tegra4 achieving a Antutu score of 32K consumes 4W. Intel on the other hand ATOM 2760 TDP results for this product, though benchmark testing indicates achieving a Antutu (pre production)score of 27K consumes 1.7W. Conclusion: A15(28nm) is approx 20% faster than Atom 2760, though is produced on a 20% smaller process node, and LISTEN...consumes 100% more power.

I don't expect for them to get either one for the following reasons: 1.) Intel likely set the bar pretty low for Q1. So, I don't see Intel having trouble getting over it. The shills expected an earnings warning last quarter and didn't get it. They expected one this quarter and didn't get it. It's them that doesn't get it. 2.) The economy has continued to gradually improve. This will likely affect Q2 guidance the most. 3.) Intel's gameplan has evolved and there is starting to be some recognition of this. Absolutely nothing positive has been included in the stock price. Mr. Market is still working on the "PC is dead" stupidity and is unable to see any of the many other positive factors in Intel's future. 4.) Intel's roadmap looks fabulous for the next two years and ARM has nothing to match it. Haswell, Bay Trail, Airmont, and the like will come in waves, each lifting Intel's mobility future. 5.) ARM's fabrication is going absolutely no where. They are stuck at 28nm while Intel gears up 14, 10 and 7 nm. 6.) Intel's foundry efforts are bearing fruit. The Altera deal changed many attitudes about Intel's future. 7.) Intel has many big deals that could break their way. I would be surprised not to hear about some of them in the next conference call. 8.) Intel's tablet future has improved dramatically. 9.) Intel's web TV venture has a chance to be a real break-through and has a chance to generate excitement and profits, while lifting everything in the Intel ecosystem. 10.)

WEBTV: a great laugh Intel plans to offer a selection of live and on-demand TV programming, "catch-up" features and a programming interface that makes it much easier to find shows than with existing guides on set-top boxes from cable and satellite companies, said Erik Huggers, who heads a new group at the company called Intel Media. But there will be several unique elements, he said. For one thing, the set-top box the company plans to offer—which will be powered by Intel chips—will include a high-definition video camera and microphone that will enable several novel applications. For example, Mr. Huggers said, the camera and facial-recognition technology will be able to identify who is watching the TV and tailor programming appropriately—such as blocking children in a household from watching adult TV shows. Families in multiple locations will also be able to conduct videoconferencing more easily, without laptop computers or tablets that can only easily show one face at a time, he said.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364686887005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 19:41:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364687049084-69</Id><Topic><Title>Still Nothing Reflected in the Stock Price</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364681450573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 18:10:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how can MM's manipulate glut of shares in billions?lol Shares Outstanding: 4.95B Float: 4.94B Can you clowns be realistic?lol</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364687049084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 19:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364687547860-70</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody who can't grisp what the ALTR deal means</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364580292992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 14:04:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>semi_equip_junkie To the contrary: How will Intel afford Billions in Capex, when margins and market share shrink at very rapid pace?LOL DOUBLE EDGE SWORD: don't be blind sided junkie it is now West vs ASIA West civilization aging and busted by fraud street Casino Banksters in the west &amp; ASIA now rising with younger population consumers and wealth effect rising in ASIA DO you think All Asian Manufacturers are not going to keep funding FABS in ASIA? and imagine when PETRO US$ crashes next, what will unfold?

So why is Altera doing this? Answer is in the above...design for finFet/tri-gate is totally different than designing for planar. It will take Altera (and everyone else) a longer time to figure out how to redesign on finFET. So their plan is to start their design for finFET (14nm) at the same time as they are starting their design for 20nm with TSMC. This way, they will be able to quickly release their 14nm products after their 20nm products. Compare this with their closest competitor, Xilinx, who would design on 20nm planar like Altera, but then have to *wait* for 14nm finFET to be available and then *start* their design which, as the article says, is a complete redo. As you can see here, Altera has a clear advantage. In fact, it's possible that when they release their 14nm products, they would be two generations ahead of what Xilinx will have.
