Intel's four fabrication plants in the Arizona area are all reportedly running below capacity, with one not even operational. Fab 12, which makes processors, has been below capacity; Fab 22, which makes chipsets, is also running below capacity, as is Fab 32. Fab 42, the newest, isn't even running. "The walls are up, and they took in some equipment, but they are delaying outfitting it. They don't want to call it mothballing it. They are delaying taking equipment orders until they are needed, and some equipment has been rerouted to Oregon," said McGregor. Intel's two biggest fabrication sites are Arizona and Oregon, but there are other plants as well around the world. McGregor says his contacts within Intel manufacturing put the company's global utilization capacity at around 60%. Normally, Intel's fabs run at 95% and only come down when the equipment is being upgraded. Quite a few of the fabs were taking 50% as many orders in Q4 as they did in Q3, said McGregor, and that's not just Intel, it's across the industry, he said. "It's happened to memory, processors, anything that went into PCs. Demand wasn't shaping up, and the outlook wasn't looking rosy," he said.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365942821691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 08:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365942833422-12</Id><Topic><Title>Wally's been chasing shorts and his tail since 2008, LOL</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1365942722835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 08:32:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel was at 21.10 when he posted this, 5 plus years ago.

China's largest publicly listed telecoms equipment manufacturer released its financial report for last year on March 28 and the news was grim. ZTE posted a net loss of 2.84 billion yuan, making 2012 the first year it did not make a profit since it listed in Shenzhen in 1997. Company chairman Hou Weigui blamed an overly aggressive strategy aimed at expanding markets overseas. He implied corporate governance and management were major factors. Several telecoms industry analysts said that some of ZTE's orders from abroad made little money and some made none at all. They said the company's governance could not support the rapid development ZTE sought. "Actually ZTE made some adjustments to try to solve these problems back in 2011," a source inside the company said. The source added that the huge loss in 2012 was prompting the company's leadership to be more aggressive in fixing the problems. Changes would include trimming the workforce, which company documents show stood at 85,232 in 2011; improve assessments of worker performance; and close unprofitable offices. 'Strategic Investments' ZTE put a lot of human resources and investment into foreign markets in recent years, said Huang Leping, an analyst at Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., a major securities and investment banking company. However, it did not get the returns it expected. A researcher at Rising Securities in Inner Mongolia said that from 2009 to the end of 2011 "the gross profit margin for many orders was quite low, and some even posted a loss." The researcher added that ZTE did not sign many new orders in 2012.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365947737029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 09:55:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365948617117-14</Id><Title>tell your story..Has WW nonsense lost you money ??</Title><Msg>Did you buy before earnings last QTR. and lose money ?

Intel to go into direct sales of products.</Title><Msg>TV broadcast provider. A New CEO is coming and that old Intel business plan is dead and gone. By this, I do not mean Intel is not still the number one chip maker on the planet because it still is. Yes, Intel will attack back against Arm based chips and in doing so it will leave more dead and wounded competitors to be laughed at just was AMD. What will be the same though? 1) Intel with great Fabs far ahead of any other company. 2) The number one CPU maker for Personal and notebook computers. 3) Number 1 in server chips What is NEW to come? 1) Intel content provider for TV. 2) Intel phone chips will domminate in a few years. 3) Direct sales to people from Intel in multiple products as does Apple. Why does this market hate Intel so so much you ask? try 13 years with NO growth for a starter. Then add the idiotic failure to get into phones so far. of course, when you are down, the street loves to kick you and Intel has foot prints all over its rusting body. It needs that new CEO fast. So would I tell my friends and family to buy Intel now? NO BUT---I would gambal on a move myself. I know Intel fans would point out the dividend as a reason to own and it is good but I look for growth and Intel has been dead that way for a long long time. But all of this said, Take a look at this board and ask yourself this. Is it dead? YES is the street often a great counter indicator for when yo get into a stock? YES! When all is said to be hopeless. one should take a look. Also--I do agree with the Intel fans that in time, Intel will pull massively ahead of others in chips. The shrinks to come in the future from Intel will make it very difficult for others to keep up. BUT--when it comes to stocks, I think it is best to take one that is for sure than wait for better later. So what would happen if Intel were to make a deal with Apple? 40 Is it for sure? NO BUT---a new CEO and Intel could be shipping Intel phones it makes itself sooner than we think.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1365948940590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365950253655-16</Id><Topic><Title>ARM foundries start dogfigting each other</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1365921288033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 02:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QCOM won't have 14nm chips out for a while then.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365950253655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365950928954-17</Id><Topic><Title>Inflection point is here.

Couple problems for them there: Miss - Intel didn't warn. Therefore it is unlikely to see a miss. Also it is likely that Intel low-balled the estimate. Guidance - Haswell has been shipping and a lot of people have been waiting on it. The economy continues gradual improvement. Both of these point to stronger guidance not weaker. Big Announcements - We know they are coming, we just don't know when. It wouldn't be much of a surprise to learn that Intel has been holding something back. Conclusion: It looks like most of the risk is on the short side of earnings. And there's the chance of an explosive announcement that would crush shorts. It would be a nice way to send Paul off.

They certainly didn't anticipate the Altera deal and how it would affect Intel's potential revenues going forward. They totally missed the impact of Intel's highly superior fabrication in providing a substantial foundry opportunity. For some reason (and this is still happening) many judged that excess capacity as a bad thing. Is the Altera deal a bad thing, Wall Street? They also didn't anticipate ARMs efforts on both the high end and low end of PCs to dissipate so quickly. They believed East when he said ARM would have 25 percent of the PC business by 2015. Instead we watched RT go up in smoke in three months. And we have promises of ARM servers but they are one to two years out and will only compete for 2 percent of the market. Strikes two and three for the Wall Street analysts. And they didn't plan for the impact of continuous big announcements. We still are waiting on confirmation of the Cisco deal although it's not really in doubt. And we have the announcement of a big mobility player deal that will likely send Intel up significantly and ARM crashing below $40. Strikes four and five, Wall Street. Nor did the Covello mentality conceive of Intel getting strong traction with its web TV project - a project that has the potential of $19 billion a year in revenues. Strike six. In spite of all this faulty positioning, Wall Street has continued to maintain its party line that it's business as usual and nothing has changed with Intel. Ignoring, of course, Haswell, Clover Trail, Bay Trail, Airmont and Intel's 14nm FinFET volume production due at the end of the year. Strikes seven through eleven. The only question is with all of these swings and misses, who let these guys in the game?

I mean - what else have you got? You have no traction issues. With Haswell, Clover Trail, Bay Trail and Airmont on the way, Intel will have a lot of uses for that excess capacity. With its choice of high end foundry customers, Intel will have lots of uses for that capacity. With ARM still unable to meet 28nm demand, Intel will have lots of uses for that excess capacity. With a major mobility player already having been lined up for foundry work, Intel will have a lot of uses for that excess capacity. Extra state-of-the-art capacity is a wonderful thing as we found out with all of the coverage of the Altera deal. And it is likely that Intel already has customers lined up for a lot of that capacity but are simply unable to announce it yet. That's the real story behind the excess capacity and the one you don't want anyone to know. Intel has excess capacity. ARM doesn't. Intel has the ability to take on much more business and generate new revenues. ARM doesn't.

The Apr 20th options have a very large open interest of PUTS at $21 ( 110k contracts ) and CALLS at $22 ( 150k contracts ). The option market maker opened up the $21.50 late last week. Without news, I would expect little movement. Negative ratings weigh on the stock. Earnings optimistic risk providing some lift. You can buy an APR 20th (expire at the end of the week) $21.50 STRADDLE for BID/ASK of 87/91 cents. If you buy the 91 cent $21.50 straddle, your breakeven price if you held till expire would be Higher: $21.50 plus .91 = $22.41 Lower: $21.50 minus .91 = $20.59 The biggest loss would be if Intel finished at $21.50 when you lose all 91 cents. Alternative strategy, to lessen a 91 cent loss, would be to sell (close) the position early to recover most of your 91 cents volatility bet if market is flat after earnings. IMO, there will be a lot of these straddle/strangle option trades on Monday and Tuesday. They will tend to cause Intel to orbit the strike prices. Expect Intel, without news, to trade pretty close to $21.50 or $21 or $22 on Monday/Tuesday. Without earnings, I would expect a finish near $21.50 on Friday close.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365972457307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 16:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365972496985-69</Id><Topic><Title>(Ha, ha, ha...)

Does it change the time table for when Intel will be a growth story once again? A) The data doesn't surprise me at all. PC sales have been soft for quite a while now, and even as we were entering Q1 expectations were the quarter would be softer than usual. However, that doesn't stop financial writers from leveraging the data for sensational headlines. So IDC says PC shipments in the first quarter were down a record 13.9% sequentially to 76.3M units. Gartner disagrees and says PC unit volume was 79.2M, which represents an 11.2% decline. According to Gartner, this is the first time unit volume has been below 80M units since Q2 2009. Both IDC and Gartner say Hewlett-Packard was the big loser, and I believe that. Both also say Lenovo gained the most market share, and I believe that too.

China's largest publicly listed telecoms equipment manufacturer released its financial report for last year on March 28 and the news was grim. ZTE posted a net loss of 2.84 billion yuan, making 2012 the first year it did not make a profit since it listed in Shenzhen in 1997. Company chairman Hou Weigui blamed an overly aggressive strategy aimed at expanding markets overseas. He implied corporate governance and management were major factors. Several telecoms industry analysts said that some of ZTE's orders from abroad made little money and some made none at all. They said the company's governance could not support the rapid development ZTE sought. "Actually ZTE made some adjustments to try to solve these problems back in 2011," a source inside the company said. The source added that the huge loss in 2012 was prompting the company's leadership to be more aggressive in fixing the problems. Changes would include trimming the workforce, which company documents show stood at 85,232 in 2011; improve assessments of worker performance; and close unprofitable offices. 'Strategic Investments' ZTE put a lot of human resources and investment into foreign markets in recent years, said Huang Leping, an analyst at Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., a major securities and investment banking company. However, it did not get the returns it expected. A researcher at Rising Securities in Inner Mongolia said that from 2009 to the end of 2011 "the gross profit margin for many orders was quite low, and some even posted a loss."

The headline claim is that TSMC will start "initial production" of FinFETs in 2013. Now, TSMC's 16nm is actually using the same backend as its 20nm process, but with 16nm FinFETs on the front end. What this means, in a nutshell, is that while performance and power will improve from the 20nm process, the scaling benefits won't be there. This is in contrast to Intel's upcoming 14nm process (which goes into high volume production this year) that will scale both the front end as well as the back-end to achieve the traditional scaling benefits (primarily cost/die reduction). So while TSMC (and the headline of the article) claims that FinFETs "go into production" during 2013, this doesn't mean "high volume and ready to ship to customers worldwide." What it actually means is that the company is probably beginning to run initial wafers to begin trying to debug the process. For example, Intel demoed its initial 22nm FinFET wafers all the way back at IDF 2009 (both high performance as well as SoC transistors), but it didn't go into high volume manufacturing until 2011 (and we didn't see products on the shelves until 2012). According to TSMC's latest conference call, there will be minimal 16nm volume during 2015, and it is really 2016 when we will see a high volume ramp up of products on the process.

So, TSMC is still waiting to get silicon back on a 20nm test device based on ARM's (ARMH) Cortex A15? This means that high volume production on next generation designs from Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and others based on the 20nm process are not likely to hit the market until mid- to late 2014, roughly in line with TSMC's statements that 2014 is when the first 20nm chips will ship.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365977056541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 18:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365977172824-85</Id><Topic><Title>Shills Not Content</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365975326198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is from EE times.

Linux 64-bit can support larger memory spaces but only for some of the server EX versions because you need to run the memory buses slower and have lots of sockets to plug in the DIMMS. The largest DIMMs today are 32gb so it would take LOTS (I am too chicken to do the math) of DIMM to yield 1tb. Which ATOM chip did you think has a 1tb max address size implemented?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365986631126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 20:43:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365987565520-133</Id><Topic><Title>Wall mart Wally part of the 29 to 21 dream team</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1365922783986</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 02:59:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you continue to cite this kind of stupidity. Anyone can play this silly game of manipulating statistics in a lame effort to look right. Here: Shorts have lost 2.40 since November. Listening to Dana Blankenhorn or any of his myriad IDs like aladiesright would have lost you 12 percent of your investment. You should have covered back in November but because you listened to these idiots you are down 12 percent. You are incapable of making a post with any substance. You are incapable of discussing the technology or performance. This is apparently a feeble attempt to prop up the bottomless pit of your ego. Surely you know that this just makes you look like more of the board punching bag than you already are. What's the purpose? Are you really this psychologically damaged? Has your life really devolved to the point where constant little dog type ankle biting is the substance of your existence? Come on, Dana.

They retained an independent seismic consultant to analyze the building design to make sure that SC4 met the 9.0 earthquake standard that the building was supposed to meet. The analysis indicated that the building was only safe for an 8.9 earthquake. The contractor had to put reinforcement struts around the bottom floor. If you look at a photo of SC4, you will see these ugly 45degree posts added to the building. It took a year and when CASH in the bank had some value, it saved a lot of money by retaining the cash. Mothballing? No. Staging availability? Yes.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365987763366</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 21:02:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365988392753-135</Id><Topic><Title>well well so it looks like FAB 42 is being MOTHBALLED</Title><Username>wrightwhoe</Username><Timestamp>1365971559119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 16:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kind of humorous that the shills gave up on RT as an arguing point, gave up on servers as an arguing point and now have moved on to when the plant in Ireland will come on line as a arguing point.
