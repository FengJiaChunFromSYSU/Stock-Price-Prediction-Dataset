Already iMac is behind in spec, why? Because it dosen't have touchscreen! Once apple catches up to Ultrabook touch screen capability, they will need to port over their legacy ARM phone/tab apps to also run on X86. Microsoft/Samsung/Acer/HP/Lenovo have all proven an ARM based notebook is a flop, and for that matter apart from iPad and Galaxy unsucessful ARM based tablets. There will be little desire to have an iPad as well as a macbook touch. Apples saving grace is the adoption of their apps, though this will have little benefit one X86 translaters are fully developed. On the flip side MS's weakness is the failure of it's ARM based apps. POINT IS: What if someone makes a convertable Laptop/Tablet with full touch interface, which seamlessly communicates with your SmartPhone, and sooner or later both of these devices will fit into a single form factor. All of the above to run productivity and legacy X86 apps, and further develop and run iApps/Android apps. Intel is near this situation now, and will be in the next 3-6 months. Ultimately let the market decide, even the loyal Apple follower, will be disappointed if apple stays with ARM design, as it will be so behind the comp, it will be funny, watching apple fans convince us their apple product is better......because Apple says so.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1362728529546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 02:42:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362734688992-6</Id><Topic><Title>ARM, Intel Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362629054994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 23:04:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A6X in iPad4 is about 25% bigger than CloverTrail+ (123 sq mm) with about double the gpu performance, both being at 32nm HKMG. A5X was the problem chip for IPad3 because inferior transistor performance at 45nm Bulk meant relatively high power consumption even though cpu and gpu performance was about half the A6X and its larger die size of 165 sq mm helped cooling. As Apple sells the whole device stack the die cost of its chips are not important but transistor performance is very important i.e. chip performance/power and will be the main reason they go Intel for foundry if they do plus the quicker process roadmap cadence would allow for quicker future upgrades. Intel's process lead is not just the nominal size e.g. 22nm, 14nm etc but in the excellent current/leakage characteristics of the trigate process.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362734688992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 04:24:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362735163021-7</Id><Topic><Title>ARM, Intel Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362629054994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 23:04:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was actually about 6W and the fact I mentioned CoreMark should have given you a clue I had already seen it as that was the benchmark being measured.

One is transistor dominant while the other exploits routing path redundancy to optimize. You need to check your facts again. The cache is not power gated on a cache line basis. That would be the only way to achieve the result you've out-lined. Secondly, if the benchmark is cache bound, it means the entire cache is warm. Thirdly, all compilers warm the cache as an optimization technique -- this means its all active once its been warmed. You have much to learn about the predominant role the cache plays in the optimization of mobile targeted SoCs. It's obvious from your comments that you are yoused to ICs that are constantly plugged into the wall. In mobile, power comes at a heavy price.

If it broke that, I would feel more comfortable shorting it.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1362748673656</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 08:17:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362748699404-34</Id><Topic><Title>ARM, Intel Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362629054994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 23:04:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where are all the ARM TDP, SDPs ?

The 17 millimeter thick device was shown at CES for the first time, and Intel has built only four units like this one. The processor manufacturer has made it easier to detach the touch display by adding a button and a green light to unlock the docking connector (see the demo in the video). When detached, the display is 10 millimeter thick, it becomes a Windows 8 Tablet and provides 10 hours of battery life, when attached to the keyboard, it can run for 13 hours on one charge, according to Intel. Additionally, there is a “magic” button that allows to extend the touch display area up to the edges: when you detach the tablet, the black bands surrounding the screen are not sensitive to touch, so you do not trigger any task when you take it off the dock, and when hitting the button at the top, these black bands disappear and the touch area becomes larger.</Msg><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362753600852</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:40:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362754617849-47</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell Ultrabook sighting, 10 to13 hours of Battery Life</Title><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362753600852</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:40:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the reality is anything reasonably close to the claims Intel is making regarding battery life it is an absolute game changer.

I guess Intel clearly sees the picture in the same way you do. So why would Intel NOT be integrate a "lot of things on die (network, disc controllers)" - even memory (like what are called interposers that Charlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate mentioned)? Why would Apple be able to go more radical than Intel can? If anyone can do this well, I would think it would be Intel given their extremely close integration between design and manufacturing?

SoC,s however, are still taking those components to the extreme. “It’s a matter of degree,” Bohr said. Indeed, Intel’s SoC is almost identical to its CPU version in terms of structure, including only some “minor tweaking” to provide either the lower leakage or higher volatage. It could even be described as a “superset” of the CPU version with expanded features. The SoC and CPU versions share many of the same process features; the same transistor structure and pitch along with similar interconnect and fab process equipment. “These two technologies can be run side by side in the same factory,” said Bohr, noting that all the yield learning for Ivy Bridge had been translatable. Bohr acknowledged that SoCs had presented Intel with new challenges. “When you talk about leakage, once you get down into the below 30 pico amp range, you have to deal with multiple sources of leakage, whether it’s through the gate oxide or leakage from source to drain or leakage from the drain to the substrate,” he said, adding that it had taken a lot of “tweaking an balancing” to finally get it right. The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said. In terms of how Intel’s 22-nm SoC process stacks up against the 28-nm low power or forthcoming 20-nm processes from TSMC, Bohr claimed Intel had “far surpassed” the performance and low leakage capabilities of competitors. “We have a significant lead over our competitors,” he asserted.

Analysts said rumors that Intel may be a foundry for Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) was not a catalyst. "We believe that Intel being a foundry for large customers such as Apple would dilute its margins and increase the long-term risk of excess supply (given high capex and potential share shifts among foundries). . . .

Although HP will have the strongest on-month shipment growth among the top-5 notebook brands in March, the US company's shipments will still fall behind those of Lenovo in the first quarter, losing its leading position to the China-based vendor. Lenovo's shipments will enjoy a 10% growth on month in March, while Dell is expected to suffer a drop. Since most suppliers of upstream components, especially touch panels which are suffering shortages, still give supply priorities based on a vendors' shipment market share, if they do not push their shipment volumes, brand vendors have a higher chance of falling behind competitors. In the second quarter, HP is expected to enjoy a sequential shipment growth of 33%, Asustek 41%, Toshiba 42%, Lenovo 20%, Dell 19% and Acer 10%.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1362763888743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:31:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362763962361-84</Id><Topic><Title>INTC to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>almeda.mosley</Username><Timestamp>1362591601010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:40:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>williamsharold655</Username><Timestamp>1362763962361</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:32:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362764049556-85</Id><Topic><Title>novelty or next new technology</Title><Username>manylumen</Username><Timestamp>1362759425140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:17:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.

ET . Intel: Goldman Sees Margin Hit if They Took Apple’s Foundry Biz By Tiernan Ray Goldman Sach‘s James Covello late yesterday reiterated a Sell rating on shares of Intel (INTC) in a note to clients that wades into the discussion over whether the chip giant might get some of Apple‘s (AAPL) contract manufacturing business away from Samsung Electronics (005930KS), a prospect, he writes, that should concern investors if it were to come to pass. Writing that he has been fielding “a significant amount of investor interest regarding Intel becoming Apple’s foundry given Intel’s current excess capacity and Intel’s manufacturing ability,” Covello goes on to opine that getting Apple’s business would be bad for Intel’s gross margin, at an estimated 25% to 30%, or what he deems a “drag of about 400 basis points” to Intel’s gross margin, on a blended basis with the rest of Intel’s business. That’s assuming total revenue of perhaps $8.9 billion come 2016, if it were to happen. Covello relies in part on estimates from Goldman’s Samsung analyst, Michael Bang, who predicts Samsung will see as much as 80% of its foundry business with Apple go away over the next five years. The rumors about such a deal remind Covello of the bounce Intel saw when it started making NAND memory chips with Micron Technology (MU) in 2005, only to be followed by an 11.5% decline in the three months that followed. Covello thinks that rather than going after foundry business, Intel ought to just rein in capacity to boost margins: We believe that Intel should reduce capex and capacity, which should allow margins to recover to 60% plus during the next cycle by keeping its factories full with its own higher-margin MPUs.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362766077020</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 13:07:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362766084242-102</Id><Topic><Title>Beware of Harry836</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1362765512880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:58:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, you said you had ME on perma-ignore...but you lied as usual.

Additionally, there is a “magic” button that allows to extend the touch display area up to the edges: when you detach the tablet, the black bands surrounding the screen are not sensitive to touch, so you do not trigger any task when you take it off the dock, and when hitting the button at the top, these black bands disappear and the touch area becomes larger.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1362772747229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 14:59:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362772776781-132</Id><Topic><Title>HP, Acer, Asustek to ship 2.0, 1.7, 1.1 million notebooks in March, say Taiwan makers Aaron Lee, Taipei; Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES [Friday 8 March 2013]</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1362763888743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:31:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CeBIT 2013] Yesterday, I met with Karen Regis, Director, Ultrabook Marketing at Intel and she showed me a reference design prototype for an Ultrabook featuring the Intel fourth generation of Intel Core i-series processors (codenamed Haswell).

XOLO is one of them, and the company is now said to plan on announcing a new smartphone on March 14, one that would sport a new Intel processor inside. The phone is currently being teased on XOLO’s official website and on its Facebook page, and AndroidOS suggests that it might sport the new Clover Trail+ dual-core Atom processor inside when launched, although no confirmation on this has been provided. The teaser, which points at a March 14 unveiling, mentions the device as “Mission X” and, with the company’s X-Series devices being powered by Intel chips, it appears only natural that the new phone would follow the same pattern. ================================== XOLO website states "The speed barrier is all set to be shattered. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for Mission X. 6 days to take off."

As a long time follower of Intel and a former co-founder of an FPGA startup (Cswitch), it has been surprising to me that Altera and Xilinx had not signed on with Intel at 22nm two years ago after the two ended up sharing space at TSMC. Although perceived to be in balance, the two FPGA players have had opportunities to sway the market in their direction and now I believe there is an opportunity for an Altera breakout. For many months I have argued that as the world turns mobile Intel’s future is tied to its Foundry. The x86 legacy client and the Growing Data Center will fund this move as Intel remains cash flow positive and profitable. In addition, Intel appears to have unlimited access to the debt market to create deals that are attractive for new customers. The “Mobile Foundry” will ramp to billions of units across a multitude of suppliers which in the end could be an order of magnitude larger than the roughly 400MU PC TAM, albeit at smaller die sizes. There is however another growth market whose significance is under appreciated and yet could reshape the semiconductor field on the High Speed Communications side of the equation. The roping in of Cisco and Altera as Intel’s first major foundry customers is intriguing in that neither is a competitor of Intel and the combined could end up sharing key IP that accelerates growth at the expense of other communication suppliers.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362794679920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 21:04:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362794707694-167</Id><Topic><Title>Intel and Altera Sign on for 14nm by Ed McKernan</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362794679920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 21:04:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As part of the 14nm bring up, there will be a common focus on building high performance, low power, dense SRAM blocks as well as next generation high speed Serdes, Memory Interfaces, Ethernet and PCI express interfaces. Imagine all of them shared such that compatibility will be guaranteed between Intel, Cisco and Altera chips used to build 100G/400G systems as well as High Performance Computers. Also consider that early 14nm Altera FPGAs will be used by Cisco and Intel in the development of systems with a Hard Copy Path to production ASICs. It has been the goal of Xilinx and Altera for several years to be able to not only be the prototype vehicles for Cisco, Huawei, Ericsson and others but also to enter high volume production. However, this is usually reserved for ASICs or networking ASSPs from the likes of Broadcom. If, however Intel provides a two-year plus process lead over the likes of TSMC, then it can be argued that the economics tip more in the favor of Altera in some of these situations. In addition to the above, I suspect that at 14nm, Altera will be willing to lay down more hard blocks of IP that are extremely area and power efficient. At 28nm both Xilinx and Altera were wary of making the move for fear of selling parts that were hampered with extra logic that went unused and therefore not valuable to end customers. If Altera gains a 2X or more advantage, expect them to come with more hard IP that is feature rich and yet can undersell their rivals.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362794707694</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 21:05:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362794731764-168</Id><Topic><Title>Intel and Altera Sign on for 14nm by Ed McKernan</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362794679920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 21:04:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The business model for the Altera-Intel Foundry deal to me is intriguing. An analyst contacted me and asked if Intel would have to sell wafers at 40% margins. I think not. Rather this model will allow Intel to sell wafers at 60%+ margins in year one of an FPGA ramp, which is typically low in volume and then slide in scale to 50% over the products lifetime. One should remember that Altera and Xilinx sell their high-end parts for thousands of dollars during the first year of prototyping. If they end up paying Intel $300 or even $500 per chip, it is worth it has they themselves usually gain over 70% in margins and are targeting for design wins that lead to higher volumes. Finally, it is important to note again that traditional legacy foundry where the IP is provided by the Fab is much different than the direction Intel is headed. In some cases the customer will bring their own IP and in other cases, Intel will gladly collaborate in order to get a lead on the same IP as in the case of Serdes. The agreement with Altera is significant for the performance side of Intel's foundry business, however, the level of Capex that Intel has signed up for in 2013 suggests that there are more, much higher volume announcements to come and these must come from the Mobile side of the compute equation.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362794731764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 21:05:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362795483068-169</Id><Topic><Title>So, Who Is It Then?</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362790535973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 19:55:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could be Nokia. Nokia has partnered with Microsoft on Windows phones/Windows 8. This past year Nokia has had supply problems with Snapdragons, and has previously worked with both Intel and Infineon. Nokia holds a lot of patents in mobile/LTE, and has a large R&amp;D portfolio, so Nokia brings something to the table aside from simply being a potential customer.

The Sell rating is largely based on the growing threat that Intel Corporation increasingly poses to ARM. "ARM currently has almost 100% share in the smartphone and tablet markets and we do not think Intel's potential share gains are reflected in ARM's share price. We reiterate our sell recommendation on ARM Holdings," says Menon. Apple Inc and Intel Corp - stirrings of a foundry deal? We note fresh talk this morning of a tie-up between Apple Inc and Intel Corp concerning AAPL's use of the x86 offering from INTC. Appel currently relies on a foundry model between Samsung and ARM Holding's for the supply of its application processors. However, the attractions of moving to an Intel-based offering are compelling: "Intel has long been and is likely to remain one to two generations ahead of everyone else in terms of process node," says independent tech industry analyst Dr Richard Windsor, "combine this with its lead in 3D transistors and one can start to see how its x86 chips may come within spitting distance of ARM when it comes to power consumption." Intel Corp making 'slow but steady' progress into ARM territory "Intel's announcements and our subsequent interaction with company executives at the mobile world congress suggested that it is making slow but steady progress in its bid to gain share in the ARM dominated smartphone and tablet markets," says Menon. Intel launched its Clover Trail + dual core chipset family (Z2580, Z2560, Z2520), capable of running at upto 2Ghz, but still manufactured at 32nm. Intel claims twice the processor and graphics performance for the product at similar levels of power consumption."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362802614556</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 23:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362802652012-175</Id><Topic><Title>Should the ARM Bull-Run be Questioned?</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362802614556</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 23:16:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ZTE has rushed to Intel Corp with open arms Signs that some developers are keen to push for the Intel offering continue to grow with ZTE announcing a strategic collaboration with Intel focused on the new Intel atom processor. ZTE states that the collaboration with Intel is an important part of ZTE's strategy for product development, time-to-market and providing customers with a great handset experience. According to Liberum Capital ZTE is currently working with Intel to develop unique smartphones based on the Intel processor and build a multi-year relationship between ZTE and Intel. ZTE is ranked amongst the top five smartphone and mobile phone manufacturers in the world and has about 5% smartphone share. Last week at the Mobile World Congress Lenovo had announced its K900 smartphone powered by Intel’s new Z2580 processor. Intel had also previously signed a multi year multi device agreement with Motorola, apart from gaining design wins from a number of smaller handset manufacturers and operators worldwide. "While we expect further design wins for Intel with top tier OEMs in both smartphones and tablets, a significant part of Intel’s early market share gains in smartphones is likely to come from Chinese handset manufacturers," says Menon.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362802652012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 23:17:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362802863534-176</Id><Topic><Title>Beware of Harry836</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1362765512880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:58:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Taking your guns will be easy!!!! yDOTahooDITit/2SLGE</Msg><Username>getanad61</Username><Timestamp>1362802863534</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 23:21:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362802996114-177</Id><Topic><Title>James Cavello for next Intel CEO.
