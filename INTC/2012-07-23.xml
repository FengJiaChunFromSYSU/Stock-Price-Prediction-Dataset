The “tactical” data center will consist of 11 rooms and 21,030 square feet of high security that will house server clusters. The new “tactical” facility will not be used to house any employees, but it will have one unisex bathroom. It will also have a “man trap” and an 8-foot high chain link fence to secure the facility. Apple, of course, has no comment on what the facility will be used for or what information might be housed within it. Apple is also continuing work on a massive renewable energy project that will see the entire facility able to run on 100 percent renewable energy by the end of this year. Once completed, the new solar array that Apple is planning will be the largest end-user-owned array in the United States. http://fudzilla.com/home/item/28010-apple-to-add-second-tactical-data-center-in-nc</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343016244000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 00:04:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343016894000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Angry old whiteamn syndrome invades again.</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1342963328000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 09:22:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Obama 101 fund raisers yet Zero meetings about jobs." *** And what is your plan to create jobs?

That's the sentiment among investors as they digest last week's smorgasbord of quarterly results from technology companies that included Intel Corp., IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. Although reports from the industry bellwethers all featured some troubling signs, their performances indicate the technology sector is largely holding up, even as Europe's debt crisis undercuts sales and threatens to topple a still-shaky U.S. economy into another recession. "What you are hearing now is a huge sigh of relief," said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. As they exhaled, many investors latched on to Intel, IBM, Microsoft and Google. All four of their stocks ended last week higher than they began. That was good news for the Dow Jones industrial average, which also edged upward. The index includes computer chip maker Intel, corporate technology specialist IBM and software maker Microsoft in its basket of 30 stocks that are supposed to reflect the state of U.S. industry. As a whole, the technology sector is in better shape than Wall Street envisioned. That's especially heartening amid signs that Europe's debt woes could cascade into a financial crisis similar to the 2008 meltdown in the U.S. that deepened the Great Recession. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index ended last week 7 percent higher than where it stood at the beginning of June. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-stocks-rally-early-070304653.html</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343045715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343046200000-10</Id><Title>Margin call Monday - the market is fixed</Title><Msg>Only the brokers are making any money in this market</Msg><Username>suckerborneverysecond</Username><Timestamp>1343046200000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:23:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343046313000-11</Id><Topic><Title>"technology sector is in better shape than Wall Street envisioned"</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343045715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does Wall St. expect when they use AMD as the barometer of tech industry health?</Msg><Username>Merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1343046313000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343049864000-12</Id><Topic><Title>40% of TSMC's revenue is generated by processes at least ten years old</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343015959000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:59:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I realize this is news to you but that is the way the semiconductor cycle works.

You will see limited 20nm production in 2013 thus beating Intel to 20nm SoC. Bottom line: You are a shameless INTC pumper with zero industry experience and superior cut and paste spin skills.

I suspect that TSMC's charge per wafer policy will keep any potential at bay as they don't want to help fund the development cycle for the benefit of their competitors." Actually it does. A tape-out costs millions of dollars, mask sets etc.... Companies like Broadcom, Qualcom, Oracle, Xilinx, Altera, Nvidia, AMD, etc only tape-out when they are confident the process is ready. TSMC 20nm tape-outs will begin in Q1 2013 and you will see first silicon 6-9 months following. 20nm production ramp will be first half of 2014.

I still will follow up. I was planning on posting their reply. IMO, the unfunded liability is much lower than Fitch states. I may dig through Fitch releases to see how they arrived at their numbers if the information is publicly available. It would be pretty hard to reproduce the Fitch numbers without knowing some pension plan information about employee 401k plans. Intel funds annual contributions to employees 401k plans. Intel also matches some extra employee added contributions. The Intel pension plan is a defined benefit plan that pays based on years of service and only in the event of the employee 401k not meeting the computed service-time pension payout. So, the Intel pension plan only pays if the employee does a very bad job of managing his investments in the plan. Since Intel controls the mutual funds and ETF that are available, they are pretty conservative and pretty much track the markets. I doubt that Fitch has access to the balances in the employee 401k's so they probably computed the plan short fall assuming that it was going to have to pay everyone.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343060434000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 12:20:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343061481000-44</Id><Title>I think this nation is sick.

Cut taxes for the rich and raise them for the working poor says Romney and he might win. But remember Rich boys--OB is your best friend. He can keep the sicko system you now have alive for awhile. The extreme left wants Romney to win. They want you rightwing nuttttttjobs to go too far. They want to take your covers off for the poor to see clearly who the real enemy is. It ain't some poor man in China hurting American workers. it is the rich scumbag here who uses the near slave labor in China and closes down American factories who is killing America. Go to the poor area of any city in America and then say how proud you are of America. Watch how we fight war after war after war and then leave our fighting men to go homeless on the streets and then say how proud you are of our nation. Yes--I love America. I love the land. I love baseball. I love lots of the things here but the bad is going to override the good sooner than we think and the rich are going to run and hide in other nations. Can you picture what will happen during the next economic downturn? And make no mistake, it is coming soon. We will have 25% unemployment and shooting on the streets. What? You think you can hide from it? NO--the men with assualt rifels will come to your towns too and 10 men in a gang armed will simply shoot you down for your wallet. No banksters went to jail for what they did. So why is that? Romney pays 12% or less on his taxes and he thinks it is all good. Do you think he is helping poor people in LA or Chicago? NO--but he is giving to the Mormon all white church. But oh well--Mitt is not to blame. Americans are sick. Mitt is not shooting assault rifles is he. Neither is OB. Hey--two months from now or less--I bet there is a 50% chance that another nut goes off and kills more than this last one. it might become a regular thing soon.

My guess is that the pension plan is completely separate from 401(k) accounts (they usually are) --- especially since there was a mention in one of your quotes to a "define benefit plan" (which are PRECISELY the type that run into problems in the later years if the contributions and investment earnings do not keep pace with the assumptions under which the plan is being administered (which is also the problem with Social Security as it is defined benefit also)). Many (if not most) companies switched from defined benefit to defined contribution plans for this reason. Anyway, I am not a pension expert by any means, though I was married to one for many years, and my guess is that all public corporations are required to divulge the status of their pension fund plans since it represents a future obligation of the corporation, and I would guess Fitch used that publicly available data. SOOOOOOOO, I imagine the info is available somewhere from Intel. I'm still thinking it will turn out that while the % unfunded (which is what the article cited), the actual dollar amount may be negligible, and I was hoping that one of you diehard Intel investors could readily debunk or verify the article. emo 77777777777777</Msg><Username>win_dex_it</Username><Timestamp>1343068681000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 14:38:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343070219000-66</Id><Topic><Title>"technology sector is in better shape than Wall Street envisioned"</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343045715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor Waldo.

Well they are already here on the South Side of Chicago at night. The cops simply stay out of there unless called and then they go in with huge groups. yes--we can expect more mass killing and we can expect riots should the GOP start forcing people into hunger. My bet is those gangs with the assault rifles will make it out to the suburbs should they get desperate for cash and food. Hungry people with assault rifles is a funny picture. Only a complete Nazi, Krupp for example, could make this stuff up. So the gangs in Mexico already have control. I am betting the gangs here will be even more violent and crazy. Given how easy it is to get their hands on assault rifles and bazookas and grenades, they might be a little too much for the police. Then we get what? Marshall law of course comes. Democracy? The rich run both parities and so we have no real democracy now. But since they do coups for the GOP not just once but twice, we can assume they will do anything they can to stop a real teddy Roosevelt like candidate being elected in a third party. It will take riots and street fights to take out this mob we now have running both parties and the supreme court.The funny thing is that the rightwing idiots who run the government and make so much money on weapons and wars will have armed the American public for a violent revolution. The rich will run and hide in other nations and all heeeeaalll will break lose here. how it ends, who knows but it is coming if we get to 30% unemployment and we well might should the world economy crash. What nation would you hide into? I am too old to fight and I am a gandi kind of guy. I would prefer shutdown strikes like Gandhi did but our people are far too violent by teaching here to go for that. Every major city could be burned to the ground by mobs in just a week should people get hungry and angry. The army would break apart and refuse to shoot on their own people. I just hope, if the nation breaks apart, that Joe Bob whitetttrash boy in OKC joins Mexico.

Obama has a history of killing terrorists and pirates alike. Romney's history is all about his 'business experience'. That's what Dumbya's selling point was, remember? Seems like the Rebulitards have conveniently forgotten how important national security is. In 2000 it was 'business experience' (as if Bush actually had any success at this), then in 2008 it was 'national security experience' and now we are back to 'business experience'. When will Republitards understand that running the country is NOT and never was a 'business'. Romney will either drop out of the race or get cornholed in November. Either one is fine with me.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343085315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 19:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343085526000-97</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Other Tax Secret...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343081590000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 18:13:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bob_dyldo_6" just keeps repeating the same Repulitard rubbish.

TSMC CEO Morris Chang claims “some” production of 20nm parts will start next year, but on a very small scale. “Very low, what we would call a risk type of production basically,” he said. Chang added that 2014 will be a “ramp year” for 20nm SoCs, which means we are unlikely to see 20nm phones and tablets anytime soon. This also means that roughly two generations of upcoming GPUs will probably stick to the current 28nm process. Interestingly, TSMC will offer only one version of its 20nm process to partners. The new tech will have to fit all applications, from high-performance GPUs to power efficient smartphone chips.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343093231000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 21:27:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343093307000-118</Id><Topic><Title>ARM grabs TSMC's 3D FinFETs for future 64-bit PC brains</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343075208000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Looks like no 64-bit ARM at the 20nm process node.

Completely made up BS numbers on both sides i.e QCOM actually state 0.75W per core not per chip and those Medfield numbers are plucked from his posterior.

The dumbass doesn't realize that Medfield has two threads on its single core which sums up his general ignorance. Medfield still the SunSpider King ... http://www.anandtech.com/show/5868/htc-one-s-review-international-and-tmobile/3</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1343100165000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:22:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343100790000-126</Id><Title>Obama's 2012 Campaign slogan:</Title><Msg>We're gonna build roads and bridges, America !!!!!</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1343100790000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:33:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343100915000-127</Id><Topic><Title>"we are unlikely to see 20nm phones and tablets anytime soon..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343093231000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 21:27:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think Motorola will finally launch some Intel based smartphones by October or November, to be ready for Holiday season. I'm still anxious to get one. My iPhone which I only use once in a while in Wifi locations, has very little batterly life since its battery cannot be replaced. It would be great to try something that is really different such as a more performance based Intel smartphone.

It hardly gets used unless I travel. But it does come in handy during my trip. I mostly am comfortable using a desktop with at least a 24" screen. So when I get my smartphone, I see no reason to own a tablet. As for my netbook, I would be very interested in updating it with an ultrabook. An ultrabook with a comfortable conversion to a tablet mode would be interesting but not a must. I usually go with what makes common sense. So over the long run, I think Intel has it right as to what model will have sustainable growth over the next 5 years or more. As for my thoughts on tablets, or the iPad, I consider it a total waste of money. The only way I will buy one is if somebody does what HP did with the touchpad. I would be will to pay around $100 for some entertainment use along with Wifi internet use. That's it!</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343102097000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:54:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343102370000-130</Id><Title>At Last It Makes Sense</Title><Msg>I finally figured it out. Wall Street has Alzheimer's. That's why Greece got priced in 23 times. Wall street just got up each day and said, "OMG, look what is happening in Greece!!! We've never seen this before. We had better price it in." And why last quarter's miss got priced in 5 times. And why Lucy says the same exact thing again and again and again. And doesn't understand why we say it wasn't funny the first time. Lucy thinks every time is the first time. Warning to board: Watch out. Wall Street is going to want to price Greece in for the first time tomorrow...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343102370000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:59:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
