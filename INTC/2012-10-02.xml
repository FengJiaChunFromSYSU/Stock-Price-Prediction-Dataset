You still have touch capability...only it is on the trackpad, not the screen/display! Intel can just make Ultrabooks lighter, thinner, smaller while focusing on a really good trackpad with great optimization - and dumping the touch-screen which adds about $100 to the cost. While playing Android games on Bluestacks, I realized that there is a great benefit to using the trackpad for the touch-interface instead of a touch-screen: (1) You still have touch capability...only it is on the trackpad, not the screen/display (2) The laptop is comfortably rested on the lap, no need to hold a Tablet that constantly slips and slides (3) Everyone is used to the keyboard/trackpad which is within nice reach ergonomically...with the touchscreen, you need to reach the screen and constantly hold your arm up...after a bit, that can get tiring (this happens even with a regular Tablet) (4) If the trackpad is very good and optimized well, it can provide the capability that a touchscreen provides (5) With the trackpad providing all the touch functionality, the display will be fully visible all the time (6) The screen doesn't get smudged and dirty (7) Using some of the savings by ditching a touchscreen, Intel can specify higher-res screens for its Ultrabooks which is great for entertainment and gaming value (what Tablets provide) It is up to product experts to push this further. But focusing on a great trackpad and a high-resolution screen may help Ultrabooks provide great Tablet functionality.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1349184535640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:28:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349185554914-5</Id><Title>Zeroes on Wall Street</Title><Msg>Here are just some of the things Wall Street has valued at zero in the Intel stock price: 1.) Intel's new tablet reference design. It has a dockable keyboard option. It represents the best blend of entertainment platform along with real computer capability. It should be a strong performer - especially in the enterprise market. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 2.) Intel's smartphone strategy which continues to get traction with Intel replacing ARM chips in a major smartphone release. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 2.) Intel's roll-out into the US market in 2013 when LTE capabilities are finalized. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 3.) Windows 8. Yeah the reaction is muted at this point.But how much of this is reflected in the stock price? Zero. Really? Zero, Wall Street? 4.) The arrival of new form factors with Windows 8:: hybrids, detachables. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 6.) Apple has no good ARM fabrication choices. Samsung and the lawsuits and no state-of-the-art. Or TSMC and limited capacity and no state-of-the-art. At some point in 2013 this favors Intel. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 7.) If Apple doesn't move to Intel, its competitors will. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 8.) Intel has built for the future. ARM is relying on the past. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 9.) 14nm is the tipping point. The point at which there is no compelling reason to ever use an ARM processor again. Intel 14nm will have vastly superior processing power along with greater power efficiency. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 10.) The turn is happening now and will pick up speed throughout 2013. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 11.) The UK variant of the Motorola RAZR M phone is powered by an Intel chip instead of a Snapdragon S4. Just the beginning of the ARM replacements with Intel. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 12.) Intel price points look better and better. Recent deals show notebooks and lap tops starting in the $300-400 range. Expect real impact on ARM tablets. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 13.) Fill in the blank. If you can't find something else that Wall Street hasn't valued, then you are not trying very hard...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349185554914</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:45:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349185749484-6</Id><Title>Intel - How 22nm Yield Changes The Industry</Title><Msg>During Intel's (INTC) fourth-quarter 2010 conference call CEO Paul Otellini first told us about the Intel 22nm process. He also told us about "Intel's three fabrication manufacturing model." The surprising thing was that he next said that the company felt the 22nm process would be in such high demand that it planned to build a fourth fab center for 22nm. The combination of the process shrink from 32nm to 22nm and the additional fab center would nearly double the potential chip output. Back then Intel was placing a wager, betting the company could build these revolutionary 22nm Trigate products in very high volume and with a yield that would continue high profitability for Intel. No one knew what the yield would be, and I think that uncertainty is the real reason Intel built the fourth fab. The extra capacity would provide insurance that if yields on the new 22nm process were low, the company could brute force extra wafers through the factories to insure there would be no shortages of Ivy Bridge processors to end customers. Now we are ending 2012 and the four 22nm fabs are online. According to Mark Bohr's comments during multiple interviews at the recent Intel Developers Forum, "22nm yields are excellent," "22nm yields are better than we expected," and "22nm yields are the same as 32nm." Bohr is an Intel Technical Fellow and Chief Process Technologist. Bohr, like many technical professionals, is genetically incapable of lying or even fibbing. Now, if Bohr were a marketing guy, his comments might be suspect. It appears that we have a major new fact: 22nm yields turned out to be much better than expected. That means that the fourth fab was unnecessary and will be empty or under-utilized. Ottelini's next step could be to go to Apple (AAPL) and offer to build the A6 chip in 22nm Trigate at the cost (yes, the cost) of the A6 chip now being built on Samsung's 32nm process in Austin. The A6 chip is about a 97 sq mm chip now; on Intel's 22nm it would drop down to about 55 sq mm, or about a 44% size reduction. The A6 chip built on a 22nm wafer will produce approximately 78% more chips than on the Samsung 32nm wafer. 22nm Trigate wafers cost more to manufacture than 32nm wafers. Nevertheless, Intel's cost to make an A6 chip would be at least 30% lower than Samsung's cost. This means that Intel could sell its version of the A6 chip to Apple at or near Samsung's cost and still make 30% gross margin and fill that fourth fab center in the process. Samsung, which has about 50% of the smartphone SoC business (Apple's A6 and Samsung's own requirements), would suddenly lose 50% of its SoC business. Intel would go from "zero to hero" in one stroke. When the industry recovered from the shock of this single action, the pundits will understand very clearly that one node, let alone two nodes (14nm next year), is such a smothering advantage for Intel that the fabless semiconductor model (at least for these very high volume, leading edge chips) can't compete against an aroused Intel. During 2013-14 Intel would have such an overpowering advantage in new SoC design wins over Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and even Samsung that it would go on to ultimately dominate the mobile SoC business. Other than the Apple chip, these SoCs will be Intel Atom-based, because in the real world customers don't care anymore about processor architecture as long as the chip does what they want at very low power and at a low price. That means ARM (ARMH) gets nicked in the long run as well. While all this is going on, and since the cost of Ivy Bridge processors is lower than expected, Intel will likely cut prices on selected devices in order to put more pressure on AMD (AMD). That will allow Intel to pick up the 20% of the PC CPU business still at AMD. A great deal of the current Nvidia discrete GPU business will just quietly migrate into the Ivy Bridge chip with "good enough" graphics, leaving Nvidia in a very precarious position. The next Intel CPU architecture, due to ship in late 2013, with even better graphics could well kill off AMD and Nvidia. All this happens because Intel's 22 nm yields exceed expectations. It's a crazy business! Action: Buy Intel or Intel LEAPs and watch the story unfold. Sell or short AMD, Nvidia, ARMH, and QCOM, since there is no reason to own them.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349185749484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349185794529-7</Id><Topic><Title>Wallis Aliases</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1308751698000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-06-22 10:08:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>adding "buffet_graham" to the list of wallis aliases. wally reveres warren buffet and billy graham!

CoreLogic, a private real estate data provider, also said Tuesday that prices rose 0.3 percent in August from July, the sixth straight monthly gain. Steady price increases, combined with greater home sales and rising builder confidence, suggest the housing recovery may be sustainable. Other measures of home prices have also increased. The Standard &amp; Poor's/Case Shiller index rose in July compared with a year ago, the second straight yearly increase after two years of declines. And an index compiled by a federal housing regulator has also reported annual increases. Housing prices are rising in most areas, according to CoreLogic. Only 20 large cities out of 100 tracked showed declines in the 12 months ending in August. That compared with 26 in July. "The housing markets gains are increasingly geographically diverse with only six states continuing to show declining prices," said Mark Fleming, chief economist for CoreLogic. States with the biggest price increases in the past 12 months were Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. Prices soared 18.2 percent in Arizona, partly because the supply of homes for sale is low and foreclosure sales have slowed. Prices have risen 10.4 percent in Idaho.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349186346792</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:59:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349186818626-10</Id><Topic><Title>Measure of US home prices rises by most in 6 years</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349186346792</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:59:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can anyone be this dumb?

While I know that it's fashionable to hate on Intel, along with the entirety of the PC space, I think that Mr. Cramer is absolutely, positively, without-a-doubt dead wrong. There's absolutely a bull case for Intel, and in this article, I intend to outline it. The PC Is Dying - A Lot Of Media Hype The centerpiece to any anti-Intel argument is that the traditional PC is going the way of the dodo bird and that tablets and smartphones will become the computing devices of the future. Make no mistake: smartphones are here to stay and tablets are likely to find their places in the computing spectrum, but to say that traditional PCs are going to be supplanted by tablets is ignorant at best and fear-mongering at worst. First off, I think that there's a large media misconception when it comes to the notion of the "PC". We're not talking big, bulky desktop computers for home use. Instead, the PC refers to a whole gamut of computing devices including ultra-thin and sleek notebooks, traditional-sized notebooks, home theater PCs, gaming desktops, and high-performance workstations for professional content creation. While tablets are wonderful for watching YouTube videos or surfing the web, it is ludicrous to believe that programmers, digital artists, journalists/writers, engineers, college students, and musicians will find that tablets will provide the level of flexibility, performance, customization, and value for the dollar that more traditional PC form factors offer. Further, despite the media hype over the last several months, a recently released piece from DigiTimes noted the following: "Notebook shipments to Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in September are estimated to increase on month by 70%, and those to Asustek Computer and Acer to go up by 50% and 30% respectively" The piece further goes on to state that the weakness in sales during July and August were primarily due to the ODMs looking to clear out inventories of Windows 7-based laptops, and that Windows 7-based models stopped shipping in mid-September. So, wait? PC sales slumped because the entire world plus dog knew about the arrival of Windows 8 PCs? What a shocker! The PC isn't dying, the iPad isn't going to take over the computing world, and Intel isn't going to go bankrupt tomorrow.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349199880510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:44:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349199973832-36</Id><Topic><Title>Guess What?

Is this necessarily a bad thing for Intel? Intel's Atom Z2760 For Tablets - Looks Rockin' To Me Intel's tablet strategy is very closely tied to Windows 8. In particular, the goal of Intel-based Windows tablets is to bring the traditional notebook/Windows PC experience to the tablet form factor in order to make sure that any customers that do want to trade their notebooks for tablets have a painless transition. The most attractive option to move to the new form factor is to keep the familiar, useful parts of the old whilst adding the necessary "new" parts. That's the motivation behind Windows 8. Intel recently released its Atom Z2760 code-named "Clover Trail" for the tablet form factor. Now, despite all of the doom-and-gloom from the naysayer crowd that Intel's chips don't have a prayer against ARM (ARMH) based tablets in terms of battery life and power consumption, Intel was kind enough to release some performance and battery life data against the Nvidia (NVDA) Tegra 3, Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon S4, and ARM Cortex A9 clocked at 1.8GHz. A quick summary of the results: The Atom Z2760 was faster in the industry-standard SPECint benchmark than any of the ARM based solutions. The Intel-based tablet was more power efficient than the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity (Nvidia Tegra 3-based) and the 2012 Apple (AAPL) iPad whilst coming in slightly less efficient than the iPad 2. While the individual data points don't matter all that much, the point here is that Intel, with its 4-year-old Atom core, built on its 32nm process, is able to hang with any of the ARM-based solutions available. It's officially in the game. The Main Concern - Pricing With all the nonsense about "X86 vs. ARM" out of the way (expect a full piece on this within the next week) with Intel's product offering strong performance and power consumption characteristics, it's time to talk about my real concern with tablets based on these products - pricing. While the ability of Intel-based tablets to run Windows 8 versus the more gimped Windows RT, it seems that these devices will go for $650 to $1,000 - putting them into iPad territory. Granted, these designs will have a faster processor, more RAM, and compatibility with all existing Windows applications, but it is still unclear whether the "tablet" form factor itself will be worth the premium to most users. Android tablet sales have only really happened at the low end with the higher end tablets going exclusively to Apple. In short - are tablets an Apple-fad, or do they represent a fundamental paradigm shift in personal-computing much as the shift from the desktop to the laptop was for the mainstream? The answer to this question will become clearer over the next several years. But wait: there's a lot more to Intel's tablet story than "Clover Trail." I'm going to dig deeper into the official road map as well as the leaked road maps to give investors an even clearer picture of just where Intel is going on tablets.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349199973832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:46:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349200053781-37</Id><Topic><Title>Guess What?

Despite this, the product is still likely to be very competitive with the very best ARM-based chips available this year - and it'll run full Windows 8, not the more limited Windows RT. But make no mistake: the current Atom isn't exactly several leagues above the solutions from the ARM-based vendors in terms of performance, functionality, or power consumption. Further, as the competition in the space heats up, margins will come under pressure, meaning that all the competitors in the space will need to look for ways to stay differentiated and improve margins. That brings us to "ValleyView" - the next generation Intel Atom. Thanks to our friends, EXPreview, a wealth of information was leaked about the next generation Atom via a number of PowerPoint slides that I will interpret from the investor's perspective: Slide 1 - The Highlights (click to enlarge) The first thing we notice is that the 2013 Atom line-up will have one, two, and four-core models rather than simply 1-2 dual-threaded cores. Another fact that stands out is that the graphics performance will improve by a factor of 4-7 times. Impressive! The next slide gets into some more technical details, but don't worry, I'll guide you through them. Slide 2 - More Nitty-Gritty (click to enlarge) All right, so there are a number of things we note here: Chip is built on the 22nm tri-gate process (well-known) 64 bit support Support for up to 8GB of DDR3 Intel is moving to its own "Gen 7" graphics - the same graphics cores found in the mainstream "Ivy Bridge" and "Haswell" processors rather than technology licensed from Imagination Technologies Memory Controller is integrated on-die The support for 64 bit is crucial as this will allow the Atom lineup to compete head-to-head with any potential threats from the ARM-licensee camp in the low power server space. More importantly, we see a move from licensed graphics technology from Imagination Technologies to Intel's internally designed graphics architecture. This is advantageous for a number of compelling reasons. First and foremost, this will improve the gross margin profile of the Atom chips relative to the current lineup as well as compared to peers. In fact, for the sake of constructing a tighter bull case, let's dig a little deeper into Intel's gross margin advantage with its Atom chips over the Snapdragon or Tegra: Intel owns its own, leading edge fabs that are also used to build PC and server chips - leveraging existing infrastructure while keeping things in-house. Qualcomm and Nvidia both rely on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and margins take a hit here. Intel is now in control of both the CPU design, CPU instruction set, and the graphics architecture. Qualcomm designs its own ARM-compatible CPUs as well as its own graphics, but still has to pay ARM for the instruction set license. Nvidia uses ARM's off-the-shelf CPU designs coupled with its own graphics, so its gross margin profile likely looks worse than Qualcomm's. This now leads us to the next slide: Slide 3 - Market Segment Targets (click to enlarge) For the "Bay Trail" platform, it seems that there are three major segments: embedded, netbook/PC, and tablet. The interesting thing is that Intel is pursuing the car infotainment and industrial segments. While these won't push the volume or have the average selling prices of notebook/desktop chips, it is good to see Intel aggressively expand the Intel architecture everywhere. Further, the PC versions of ValleyView will give the lower end notebook and desktop spaces a kick-in-the-pants, likely in response to the threat of ARM chips trickling upwards into these segments. Finally, the tablet model seems to be the "cream-of-the-crop" with 4 cores running at 1.6GHz+. While it is still as-of-yet unknown what kinds of architectural changes that Intel has implemented in the latest "Silvermont" core, it is clear that with a clean-slate micro-architecture coupled with the very real threat from the ARM-licensees as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel will be very aggressive on the performance per watt metric. In short, Intel seems to be bringing its "A-Game" to the tablet space. This is all too reminiscent of the PC space back in 2003-2006, when AMD had a firm lead against an aging, lazy Intel micro-architecture. When Intel decided to start coming at it in full force, however, AMD lost its lead and has struggled to compete on a performance/watt basis since. Now, no bull case for Intel would be complete without a discussion of its high margin bread-and-butter: servers.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349200053781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:47:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349200116359-38</Id><Topic><Title>Guess What?

Sure, it competes with AMD (which has a roughly 5.5% market share in the space) or the dregs of the former "RISC-era" such as IBM's (IBM) Power and Oracle's (ORCL) SPARC, but at this point, Intel isn't suffering from any significant pressure from these competitors. The company expects its datacenter division (server processors) to grow at a 15% CAGR, and even in the company's recent warning, the datacenter guidance was reaffirmed. Now, there are some threats here. Some companies such as Nvidia and Applied Micro (AMCC) are looking to get in on the server action with custom ARMv8 (64 bit ARM) based processors. While the technologies that these companies have talked about seem promising enough in PowerPoint slides, it is unclear how these products will fare on a performance-per-watt basis, so until products from these companies hit the market, it will be unclear as to how potent the threat is. The fact that Oracle's SPARC and IBM's Power, both excellent processors, have failed to gain share is telling about the prospects of server chips from lesser competitors. In any case, as more smartphones and tablets go into use, they will need to be backed by a strong cloud backbone. Right now, Intel owns that high margin backbone, and until a credible threat arises, this will continue to be a very strong source of revenue and profits for the company. A Note About ARM - Wake Up, Wall-Street The final point that I have been meaning to clarify is that the ARM instruction set isn't "magic." It seems to be that a good portion of the press has got it into their heads that ARM-based processors are inherently more efficient than an x86 processor. To a very, very small degree this is true - the need for X86 processors to decode X86 instructions into RISC-like micro-operations does introduce a small overhead. But this is not enough to make an X86 tablet or phone chip impossible - see Medfield and Clover Trail. The micro-architecture, the circuit design and layout, and the process technology are the real determinants of performance here - not the differences between ARMv7 and the latest iteration of X86-64. More importantly, the phrase "free and open ecosystem" is tossed around quite a bit with respect to the ARM processors. Yes, it's true. Anybody can go to ARM holdings, promise to pay a royalty fee per chip, and be allowed to develop an ARM-compatible chip. That's nice, but this doesn't automatically mean that ARM-based processors will take over. Did you know that back in the early 90's, there were countless players in the X86-compatible space? Intel, AMD, IBM, TI (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ST-Micro (STM), Fujitsu, OKI, Siemens (SI), NexGen, NEC, Cyrix, and Via all developed X86 compatible processors. Eventually, the strongest players survived, and the weaker ones either exited the business, went bankrupt, or were acquired. The same thing will happen to the ARM application processor space. TI's exit from the smartphone/tablet space is a testament to the fact that there's not really room in the space for too many competitors. Right now, the serious smartphone and tablet chip players are Samsung, Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia. Samsung is a device maker and owns its own chip fabs, so it will very likely stay in the game. Apple, too, will continue to develop its own chips for its iPhone line. So that leaves three major players left for the less vertically integrated device makers: Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Intel. Qualcomm has the advantage of having scored the design wins in the latest Nokia (NOK) phones, the next RIM (RIMM) BlackBerry, and essentially all of the high end phones. It also designs its own CPU, GPU, and baseband, giving it a high level of vertical integration. Windows RT will enable Qualcomm to compete in the Windows tablet space as well with its Snapdragon S4 processors, which are currently the fastest mobile system-on-chip solutions available. Intel has the advantage of being highly vertically integrated as well as having years of high performance CPU design. With its full control over the instruction set, CPU architecture, GPU design, baseband courtesy of its purchase of assets from Infineon (IFNNY.PK), and its ownership of chip manufacturing plants, it is likely to be able to win on pricing at any given feature set, hurting margins for competitors and quickly taking the lead. Further, Intel Labs does awesome things like developing a digital Wi-Fi radio that can be integrated on-die (nobody else has this technology). Nvidia is the longer-shot here and is likely destined to be the #3 player in this space. It's not as big as Qualcomm or Intel and it will have a hard time keeping margins acceptable, but its graphics expertise is quite valuable. If Intel is unable to produce competitive graphics against the Imagination Technologies "PowerVR" or the Qualcomm "Adreno," then I could see Intel gunning to acquire Nvidia to bolster its graphics portfolio. That being said, the rapid clip at which Intel has improved its graphics processors on the PC side could make such an acquisition less attractive.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349200116359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:48:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349200238582-39</Id><Topic><Title>Guess What?

That was a time when people believed in truth and regarded truth as an independent power and not as an auxiliary for government, class, race, ideological, personal, or financial interest. Today Americans are ruled by propaganda. Americans have little regard for truth, little access to it, and little ability to recognize it. Truth is an unwelcome entity. It is disturbing. It is off limits. Those who speak it run the risk of being branded “anti-American,” “anti-semite” or “conspiracy theorist.” Truth is an inconvenience for government and for the interest groups whose campaign contributions control government. Truth is an inconvenience for prosecutors who want convictions, not the discovery of innocence or guilt. Truth is inconvenient for ideologues. Today many whose goal once was the discovery of truth are now paid handsomely to hide it. “Free market economists” are paid to sell offshoring to the American people. High-productivity, high value-added American jobs are denigrated as dirty, old industrial jobs. Relicts from long ago, we are best shed of them. Their place has been taken by “the New Economy,” a mythical economy that allegedly consists of high-tech white collar jobs in which Americans innovate and finance activities that occur offshore. All Americans need in order to participate in this “new economy” are finance degrees from Ivy League universities, and then they will work on Wall Street at million dollar jobs. Economists who were once respectable took money to contribute to this myth of “the New Economy.” And not only economists sell their souls for filthy lucre.

USA .....sudden troubles erupts and Massive riots are foregone conclusion in USA 2013 DHS gears up for civil unrest prior to presidential elections The Department of Homeland Security has ordered masses of riot gear equipment to prepare for potential significant domestic riots at the Republican National Convention, Democratic National Convention and next year’s presidential inauguration. The DHS submitted a rushed solicitation to the Federal Business Opportunities site on Wednesday, which is a portal for Federal government procurement requisitions over $25,000. The request gave the potential suppliers only one day to submit their proposals and a 15-day delivery requirement to Alexandria, Virginia. As the brief explains, “the objective of this effort is to procure riot gear to prepare for the 2012 Democratic and Republican National Conventions, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration and other future similar activities.” The total amount ordered is about 150 sets of riot helmets, thigh and groin protectors, hard-shell shin guards and other riot gear. Specifically, DHS is looking to obtain: - “147 riot helmets” with “adjustable tactical face shield with liquid seal” - “147 sets of upper body and shoulder protection” - “152 sets of thigh and groin protection” - “147 hard-shell shin guards” with “substantial protection from flying debris, non-ballistic weapons, and blows to the leg” and “optimized protective design for severe riot control or tactical situations.” - “156 forearm protectors” - “147 pairs of tactical gloves” The riot gear will be worn by Federal Protective Service agents who are tasked with protecting property, grounds and buildings owned by the federal government. The urgency of the order can be explained by the fact that there is a growing anticipation that many demonstrators will travel to the Republican National Convention (RNC), scheduled for August 27-30 in Tampa Bay, Florida, and Democratic National Convention (DNC), planned for September 3-6 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The RNC itself, for example, will have free speech zones, which will serve as containment quarters for the protesters by not allowing them to leave the designated areas and cause trouble. Another recent DHS move to gear up was back in March of this year, when it gave the defense contractor ATK a deal to provide the DHS with 450 million .40 caliber hollow-point ammunition over a five year period. On top of that, the DHS has recently purchased a number of bullet-proof checkpoint booths and hired hundreds of new security guards to protect government buildings.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1349213061210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:24:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349213287606-54</Id><Topic><Title>Singhlion burst in here crushing Intel down to single digits..........then got stopped out of his short at 23 just hours later.

Permalink 5 Million Volt Cattle Prod Developed For “Crowd Control” October 2, 2012 As law enforcement agencies and the federal government accelerate their preparations for civil unrest, a new 5 million volt tactical cattle prod has been developed for the purposes of “crowd control” and pain compliance. In the video above, Donovan Hunter of Stunning Developments, Inc. showcases the new BattleProd, the world’s first weapon-mountable pain compliance-inducing stun baton which Hunter says is designed for use in “crowd control applications.” The weapon was on display at the recent 2012 SOFIC (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference), described as “the defense industry’s premier event,” and attended by military and police professionals. The event was sponsored by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. According to a write-up of the BattleProd by Defense Review, the weapon is “intimidating” and “loud”. “This thing is just too much fun. I mean, what’s not too like? It gives you 3-5 million volts of compliance-inducing electricity either in your hand (handheld variant) or at the end of your weapon (rifle/carbine, weapon-mountable variant). Touch the BattleProd anywhere on the rod (front, sides, etc.), and you’re goin’ down like a sack a’ potatoes. Actually, you’re probably goin’ night-night for a little while,” writes David Crane. The most powerful Tasers can only reach around 50,000 volts and despite being described as “non-lethal” have killed at least 500 Americans. Given that the BattleProd can achieve 5 million volts, concerns surrounding the safety of the device will obviously be paramount. However, in the clip Hunter claims that the weapon cannot kill and that victims fully recover after around 20 minutes. The fact that the weapon is being developed for use by both police and military assets who are increasingly being re-oriented to carry out homeland security operations will increase fears that the BattleProd will be another tool of domestic oppression in the event of widespread civil unrest. As we reported last week, LRAD sonic weapons which are also designed to disperse crowds via non-lethal pain compliance are being deployed “throughout” America in readiness for upcoming national emergencies and other crises. The Department of Homeland Security, the US Army, US Military Police, as well as law enforcement bodies across the country are all making preparations for riots and civil unrest in light of domestic disorder that has gripped Europe as a result of the financial crisis, most recently in Greece and Spain. A recently leaked US Army Military Police training manual for “Civil Disturbance Operations” outlines how military assets are to be used domestically to quell riots, confiscate firearms and even kill Americans on U.S. soil during mass civil unrest.

(and see this). Given that Goldman obviously knows how to use its own program - which it paid many millions for - isn't that a virtual admission that Goldman has been manipulating markets? ------- I heard of a guy a few years ago that went on record about a software that could manipulate and HIDE traces of market manipulation. he is out of job now and dirt poor- he was fairly rich and succesfull business manager untill he found this software to be doing something illegal and reported it to his boss.. it's a long story, a MP3 audio file, maybe someone know what i am thinking of? -------------------- Goldman Trading-Code Investment Put at Risk by Theft (Update3) By David Glovin and Christine Harper - July 6, 2009 23:47 EDT July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may lose its investment in a proprietary trading code and millions of dollars from increased competition if software allegedly stolen by a former employee gets into the wrong hands, a prosecutor said. Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer, was arrested July 3 after arriving at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. officials said. Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v.

A number of crimes committed by organized groups are done so for the purposes of financial gain. This is called racketeering, which is a felony crime. Characteristics of Organized Crime Groups Organized crime offenses vary greatly, but, there are some generalizations that apply to the groups as a whole. They are all developed based on a hierarchy of power and importance associated with the individuals in the group. They are stable organizations that usually exist over very long periods of time. They may use violence to defend the interests of the group.

(and see this). Given that Goldman obviously knows how to use its own program - which it paid many millions for - isn't that a virtual admission that Goldman has been manipulating markets? ------- I heard of a guy a few years ago that went on record about a software that could manipulate and HIDE traces of market manipulation. he is out of job now and dirt poor- he was fairly rich and succesfull business manager untill he found this software to be doing something illegal and reported it to his boss.. it's a long story, a MP3 audio file, maybe someone know what i am thinking of? -------------------- Goldman Trading-Code Investment Put at Risk by Theft (Update3) By David Glovin and Christine Harper - July 6, 2009 23:47 EDT July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may lose its investment in a proprietary trading code and millions of dollars from increased competition if software allegedly stolen by a former employee gets into the wrong hands, a prosecutor said. Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer, was arrested July 3 after arriving at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. officials said. Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

A number of crimes committed by organized groups are done so for the purposes of financial gain. This is called racketeering, which is a felony crime. Characteristics of Organized Crime Groups Organized crime offenses vary greatly, but, there are some generalizations that apply to the groups as a whole. They are all developed based on a hierarchy of power and importance associated with the individuals in the group. They are stable organizations that usually exist over very long periods of time. They may use violence to defend the interests of the group. They usually have political or social protection that keeps them safe from retaliation from the surrounding community, including law enforcement. Their purpose is to accumulate capital which is then reinvested into the operations and businesses run by the group.

Companies like Spreadtrum Communications, RDA Microelectronics, Leadcore Technology, and Innofidei are among the semiconductor design firms that could be snapped up, DigiTimes reported Tuesday. Meanwhile, those mainland China-based companies may also be considering merging with each other in different combinations to better compete with Qualcomm and MediaTek, the Taiwan-based tech journal reported, citing unnamed industry sources. Qualcomm and MediaTek, which both have quad-core chips for smartphones and feature phones that support an array of wireless technologies, are "becoming increasingly competitive" in the Chinese mobile device market as local chip makers with less tech at their disposal struggle to keep up, according to DigiTimes. MediaTek, a Taiwan-based company known for its feature phone chips has been pushing out more powerful smartphone solutions this year. The chip maker's products support EDGE, WCDMA, and TD-SCDMA, while U.S.-based Qualcomm has CDMA 2000, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, and LTE at its disposal for its mobile chipsets. Chinese mobile chipset makers generally specialize in a wireless technology like TD-SCDMA or Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but not both, incentivizing a local merger or a sale to a big foreign company like Intel, according to sources cited by DigiTimes. The baseband solutions built by Chinese companies like Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics could be attractive to a pair of big U.S. chip makers that have come somewhat late to the mobile device party. Nvidia has had a lot of success with its Tegra line of products for tablets but hasn't done nearly as well in the smartphone market, probably because it's still playing catch-up with the likes of Qualcomm on baseband technologies. Intel, though it remains the runaway leader in PC chips, has struggled to penetrate the mobile device market in any capacity, though the company is banking heavily on the introduction of Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system later this month, as well as the evolution of ultrabook-based hybrid tablets to change that pattern.</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1349231101170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 22:25:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349236524549-67</Id><Title>I stated boldly ten years ago.
