It is hence hedging its bets on the early arrival of DDR4, and the only company that can make that happen is Intel. Samsung is not only a major supplier of DRAM memory, but also a big player in server memory. It had its first DDR4 UDIMM ready as early as in January 2011. Reports of Intel slating DDR4-equipped platforms in 2013 has Samsung perturbed. Samsung and Hynix are the only two DRAM majors with developed DDR4 products. According to DigiTimes' analysis, DRAM vendors see DDR4 as the only way they can pull themselves out of their ailing situation. http://www.techpowerup.com/164134/Samsung-Urges-Intel-to-Launch-DDR4-Systems-Ahead-of-Schedule.html Samsung Samples Industry’s First DDR4 Memory Modules for Servers. Samsung Begins to Sample 16GB DDR4 RDIMMs [07/02/2012 10:10 PM] by Anton Shilov Samsung Electronics has announced that it had begun sampling the industry’s first 16GB registered dual inline memory modules (RDIMMs), designed for use in enterprise server systems. The world's largest maker of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) plans to start making DDR4 modules for servers next year. Samsung currently samples 8GB and 16GB DDR4 memory modules that are based on chips made using 30nm-class process technology and which operate at 1.2V voltage. While Samsung does not directly states clock-speed of memory modules, the company notes that by next year the DDR4 will reach twice the current 1600Mb/s of DDR3 memory, which points to 3.20GHz effective clock-speed. Samsung sampled new 8GB and 16GB DDR4 modules in June, in addition to providing them to major CPU and controller makers. The modules will bring the highest density and performance levels to premium enterprise server systems. Samsung previously introduced the industry’s first 30nm-class 2GB DDR4 module in December, 2010.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1343364504000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 00:48:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343364625000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Next-gen Intel Atom delayed to end of 2013</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343357346000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 22:49:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"provide one post of mine where I talk about the stock ARMH..." *** What kind of cheap semantic game are you playing at now?

Motorola phones with Intel inside will be announces before the end of this summer. 60 days. Did you happen to know that Motorola is owned by Google? It is. Did you know that Intel CEO Paul Ottelini sits on the board of directors of Google? He does. Intel chips are coming that will fit very well into phones and Apple will go Intel in phone chips before you see the spring 2013. That is just the way it is. Apple is feeling the heat from Samsung in phones now. It saw a drastic drop in phone sales this last quarter and it has to be NUMBER 1 in technology to get the premium prices it wants in phones. That leaves Intel 22nm chips coming soon inside an Apple phone. You will not want to be short Intel when that announcement comes. Intel will go above 50. PS--Did you see that idiot, Romney, in London. He is a complete idiot and makes GW Bush look like an Einstein--and as you know, GW was no Einstein. Another way of putting it is to say that Romney is a spoiled rich boy with shhhieeet for brains.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1343368190000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 01:49:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343391055000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Leixlip plant expansion could pave way for 450mm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343365005000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 00:56:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope, intc not interested in 450nm.</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1343391055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:10:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343392745000-12</Id><Title>Five Cool Things About Google Fiber</Title><Msg>[Gonna take a whole lot of servers to make this happen.

The Fed previously said it intended to sell $7 billion to $8 billion of short-dated Treasuries on Friday. The sale was part of the Fed's latest stimulus program, dubbed "Operation Twist" - a program that extends the maturity of the central bank's Treasuries holdings in a bid to lower mortgage rates and other long-term borrowing costs.

Here is some new news though. On the upswing, by contrast, was China’s ZTE, which made it into IDC’s Top 5 smartphone vendors for the first time. It did so due to strength in its home market, as well as growth internationally, including in the U.S. where it is shipping under both its own and carrier brands. Also--Apple is feeling hurt from Sammmysung. Samsung shipped about 50.2 million smartphones in the quarter, according to IDC, while Apple sold approximately 26 million iPhones in the quarter. Now given this PAIN from Sammysung onto the Apple boys, you can well assume that Apple is talking with Intel. After all, Samsung is making the Apple chips for phones and tablets and is sticking it to Apple big time on sales at the same time. Look to when Intel opens the new 5 Billion dollar super fab, and you will be in the ballpark as to when it is Apple will switch to Intel as its manufacturer. Intel will even make the Arm based chips for Apple for a time giving Apple time to do the 100% switch over to Intel chips. Motorola announces in just a few months that is is shipping phones with Intel chips. All and all, there seems to be a huge upside from Intel in revenue and net profits. The stock trades as if Intel were a loser clown company, AMD for example, but Intel is kicking buuuuttt and taking no shheit from anyone these days. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, Intel is talking softly and carrying a BIG STICK. Super Fabs coming on line with Chips that will shrink in volume shipments at 14 nm. You might wonder what will happen to Arm and the idiots who make their chips? Who cares? I mean do you wonder about companies from the dotcom bust of 2000? NO Intel will destroy Arm and laugh to the bank in doing so.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343412055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:00:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343412368000-44</Id><Title>Island Reversal</Title><Msg>What say you, backbay?

Apple or Intel?</Title><Msg>The only negative sentiment about Intel is how the iPad from Apple is going to cannibalize Intel's PC sales. But what story is earnings telling us in terms of current expectations. Apple missed estimates by 10% while Intel beat estimates by 3.8%. Apple gave guidance lower by 25% of next quarter's estimates while Intel only gave guidance lower by 9% of next quarter's estimates. So things did not look as good as people on average thought of Apple while things did not look as bad as people on the negative side thought of Intel. As for Amazon, that thing makes no sense. Their kindle sales were less than a million, their bargains are not that great anymore, and sales taxes are coming for them soon. Still, they barely make money. Yet investors are still in love with their story. We will see how than goes in the next year or so.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343445574000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:19:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343446088000-71</Id><Topic><Title>Intel presents new smart-phone chips, partnership with ZTE</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343412055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel investors have alot to be positive about regarding the possibility of future smartphone domination by Intel. As for Motorola, I hope it's only a few months for Motorola smartphones with Intel chip to be sold. I'm waiting patiently and am very interested in owning one.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343446088000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:28:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
