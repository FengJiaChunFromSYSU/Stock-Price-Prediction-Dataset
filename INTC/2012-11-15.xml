There is always risk and the Apple "maps" decision is the most recent example of something that appears simple but can go very wrong. Historically, the conversion from 68k to PowerPC was with the same vendor, Motorola. The motivation was driven by a substantial increase in performance of the PowerPC over the 68k. The conversion from the PowerPC to the x86 was pushed by the lack of investment by IBM in a low power PPC part and attraction to Intel for their commitment to investment. The conversion of MAC to ARM in 2014 will happen in an environment where Intel will make the power/performance/cost difference decision very tough for Apple. It would be stunning if Apple did not have ARM prototypes of all MAC flavors and have a good idea of what the issues are in converting MAC's to ARM. Apple has a couple thousand employees dedicated to designing and building their smartphone and tablet ARM products. Those semiconducter employee costs are added to the burdened cost of their ARM chips. The Apple executive leading that group of employees has been lobbying to supply ARM chips to their PC division for years. The most likely scenario (my thinking) would be that Apple will continue their x86 product lines but will probably introduce some type of "MAC OS" ARM product and blur the lines between the two product worlds.

With cloud computing on the rise and corporate spendings to increase as "fiscal cliff" story subsides, revenue will sure increase for INTC in this space. ARM trying to come into this marke? don't bet on it, which company in their right mind would switch to untested hw with minimum cost savings and performance decrease and then have to turn around and make their sw compatible with the new hw and risk that there may be bugs in the code somewhere? - INTC coming out with z2580 Atom chip for smartphones (with 4G LTE support) that will be faster and have better battery life than current ARM offerings including new A15. They spent the last year perfecting Android for the x86 platform so that when they do roll out phones to US market everything will be silk smooth. - INTC's new Haswell chip will come out with first half of 2013. Will be faster than current Core i chips but require waaayyyy less power. Hardware manufacturer, including AAPL, are, no doubt, working on new PCs, PC convertibles and tablets right now. You will see massive PC ad campaign once these devices come out. Anyone who has an old non-touch-capabible, heavy, bulky laptop (most people) will upgrade! That includes consumers and corporations alike. - Buy end of 2013, they will roll out newer chips on 14nm technology, meaning the chips will be even more powerful but require even less power!

It's only the beginning. Motorola announces Intel-powered RAZR i, launches in Europe next month By Mat Smith posted Sep 18th 2012 5:09AM Motorola teams up with Intel, announces RAZR i in the Europe packs 2GHz Medfield processor, launches next month Motorola's revealed the first smartphone to be borne from its team-up with Intel. Here in London, UK, it's a familiar-looking Android smartphone with an important internal difference. The RAZR i will be running on one of Intel's latest mobile chips (2GHz processor), differentiating it from what we saw from the Google-owned phone-maker a few weeks earlier. Motorola's calling the phone its biggest launch in the UK since the original RAZR. Motorola's touting the (almost "edge-to-edge") 4.3-inch AMOLED display, 2,000mAh of battery and the same Kevlar coating -- it's water repellent this time. But this event is also about Intel's 2GHz processor inside. The chipmaker says it's optimized the architecture for web browsing, especially for Java-based activities. It's also pushing for power consumption even on processor-intensive activities like gaming -- but we'll have to wait for our own tests to check it out. The RAZR i also packs a similar 8-megapixel camera and interface to those other new Motorola phones, with under a second start-up to get the camera app running -- we bet that dedicated camera button helps there. Intel made similar promises with the Orange San Diego, but were already intrigued by that Vanilla-looking interface. NFC is already baked in, with Android Beam taking control of what you need, while its bootloader arrives unlocked. The RAZR i appears to be packing some iteration of Android 4 -- but we're still checking on whether it'll be coming with ICS or the newer Jelly Bean. The phone will arrive in the likes of UK, France, Germany and Brazil -- but no news on whether it'll appear inside North America's borders. In the meantime, you'll find a galley of pics below, plus a press release and publicity video right after the break.</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353001584171</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:46:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353001639050-67</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to buy Intel?</Title><Username>encana101</Username><Timestamp>1352919388827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 13:56:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know little, but as far as I'm aware, Intel does not OWN them.

Intel has managed to convince server giant HP to eschew ARM-based chips in favour of its own Atom processors as part of the low-power Project Moonshot effort. Originally announced back in November 2011, Project Moonshot is HP's attempt to create low-power high-density server systems packing as many as 2800 server blades into a single rack. The company partnered with ARM, AMD, Calxeda, Canonical and Red Hat on the project - a list of companies in which Intel, you may note, does not appear. The original plan was to create servers based around Calxeda's EnergyCore dual-core chips, which feature a class-leading thermal design profile (TDP) of just 1.5 watts. Using these low-power chips, HP claimed it could create servers drawing 89 per cent less energy and taking up just six per cent of the space of a traditional server installation. That equates to massive improvements in efficiency for high-volume datacentres and a dramatic saving in power and heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) costs for everyone else. It also marked ARM's first major foray into the world of the server since the company departed the desktop market following the industry's switch away from ARM-based systems like the RiscPC and towards IBM-compatible x86 devices. For ARM, HP's decision to use its instruction set in Project Moonshot was a major validation and a win which could be used to great effect in convincing other high-density server makers to investigate ARM-based solutions. That's a situation which Intel, clearly, has found untenable - and it has convinced HP that Atom is the way to go. According to HP's latest announcement, the initial production servers to come out of Project Moonshot - codenamed Gemini - will be based around Intel Centerton Atom chips, rather than Calxeda's EnergyCore products. Intel, naturally, is saying that HP's made the right choice. 'The unprecedented value of the Intel Atom processor codenamed Centerton — with features like 64-bit support, ECC and an established software x86 ecosystem — will offer customers the increased flexibility and drastically reduced total cost of ownership required to compete in the fast-growing hyperscale computing space,' Intel's Jason Waxman, general manager of cloud infrastructure at the chip giant, claimed of HP's move. HP's decision to support Intel despite the latter company's refusal to become an official partner in Project Moonshot is no real surprise: back in November HP announced that the second-generation Moonshot servers, codenamed Redstone, would include an Atom option - but it was always planning on using ARM chips for its first-generation Gemini product. HP isn't giving up on ARM in the datacentre altogether, though: the company has confirmed that, while Gemini will launch later in the year using Atom chips, processors from other, unnamed vendors will be produced for use with the blade infrastructure. The company did not, however, provide a timescale for their release.</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003099093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:11:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353003156167-77</Id><Title>HP ditches ARM yet again</Title><Msg>HP reportedly first to ditch Windows RT tablet plans over Microsoft’s Surface Chris Davies, Jun 29th 2012 Discuss [82]</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003156167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:12:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353003191073-78</Id><Topic><Title>HP Ditches ARM for Intel</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003099093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:11:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chump, more, even older articles... keep looking backwards...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003191073</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:13:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353003216709-79</Id><Title>VMware boss says ARM servers not happening anytime soon</Title><Msg>VMware Boss Puts Brakes on ARM Server Revolution By Cade Metz</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003216709</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:13:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353003349207-80</Id><Topic><Title>VMware boss says ARM servers not happening anytime soon</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003216709</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:13:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why are you embarrassed of the article's date ??? you neglected the date of old articles...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003349207</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:15:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353003430149-81</Id><Topic><Title>HP Ditches ARM for Intel</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353003099093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:11:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Potential Intel investors reading this board would appreciate reading things that aren't saying ARM is taking over the world, as you try to preach.

So where is Surface Pro? Microsoft's much-hyped, business-friendly Windows 8 tablet is nowhere to be seen. The delay, according to industry sources, has thrown the company's tablet plans, and indeed much of its strategy around Windows 8, into disarray. The situation may even have contributed to former Windows chief Steven Sinofsky's sudden exit this week. Here's the background. Microsoft unveiled Surface earlier this year, revealing two versions. Surface RT, which runs Windows RT and shipped on Oct. 26, and Surface Pro, based on Windows 8 Professional. Windows RT is a Windows 8 derivative designed for consumer tablets. All Windows RT tablets are powered by ARM chips, and are designed to be light and long on battery life. The downside: They won't run regular Windows applications and are incompatible with many Microsoft security and management tools, including Active Directory. That's where Surface Pro comes in, or was supposed to. It runs full-blown Windows 8, and was intended for business users and others who want legacy application support and compatibility with corporate IT environments. It's powered by Intel's Core i5 x86 chip. It promises full support for legacy Windows software and Microsoft's back-end admin, security and cloud tools. So which version of Surface is Microsoft currently pitching to businesses? If you guessed Surface Pro, you'd be wrong. Sources tell me company reps are pushing Surface RT to enterprise accounts because, frankly, they have no clue when Surface Pro will be ready. A Microsoft spokesperson I contacted on Wednesday would say only that the tablet will be available within 70 days, which could put its release into next year. Microsoft isn't saying what's causing the delay. Other Windows 8 systems that run Intel's Core chips have already hit the market. Not surprisingly, enterprise buyers aren't interested in Surface RT. "What the hell are we going to do with it?" said one source I talked to. The source works at a major financial institution, where Microsoft reps recently pitched Surface RT. "You can only run them in an unmanaged environment -- we'd have to be crazy" to use them, my source said. There's another mess on the Windows 8 tablet front. Computer makers that developed systems based on Intel's new Clover Trail Atom platform are also scrambling. Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and others have announced Clover Trail-based tablets. But try and get any of them to commit to a specific ship date. I faux-ordered Dell's Latitude 10 Windows 8 tablet and received a "preliminary" date of Dec. 12. The problem is Clover Trail. Intel just doesn't have it ready for mass production. Insiders say that, among other things, there's a problem with the chip's power management software. Intel ignored my request for a comment yesterday. Most of these OEMs were smart enough to hedge their bets on Clover Trail, and also built Windows 8 tablets and convertibles that run Intel's proven Core architecture. I tested Dell's Ivy Bridge Core-based XPS 12 during Hurricane Sandy -- it stood up to the storm. But the whole point of Clover Trail was that it was supposed to provide the Wintel ecosystem with a platform that could match ARM-based Android tablets and the iPad on power consumption, battery life and instant on/off, while still running Windows applications. Now it appears Clover Trail systems might not arrive in time for the crucial holiday shopping season. Lest Microsoft try to claim it was never its intention to have Surface RT systems compete with Surface Pro and Clover Trail-based OEM tablets simultaneously, here's a quote from the company's Building Windows 8 blog, published on Feb 9. 2012. "Our collective goal is for PC makers to ship WOA PCs [i.e. Surface RT and other systems that run Windows on ARM] the same time as new PCs designed for Windows 8 on x86/64, using the latest generation of those platforms from low-power [i.e. Clover Trail] to high-performance [i.e. Core]." Who authored that piece? It was none other than Sinofsky, who in making unkept promises may also have authored his own hasty exit from Microsoft. Ironically, his words were meant more as an assurance that development of the brand new Windows on ARM platform would keep pace with development of Intel-based systems, not vice versa. Microsoft will undoubtedly insist otherwise, but there's a quiet little disaster in the making for the company and its partners.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353011177940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:26:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353011211113-126</Id><Topic><Title>INTC turnaround story of 2013!</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1352996791437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:26:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that was decided nov 6th, 2013, 14, 15, 16 unless we get a Booth reprieve</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1353011211113</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:26:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353011261636-127</Id><Topic><Title>Intel spits in Getanid61's face in his own back yard</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353001584171</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:46:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>armh 34.13, that says you're FOS so far.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1353011261636</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:27:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353011286573-128</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Windows 8 Tablet Plans In Disarray</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353011177940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:26:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worth a repeat for all the ARM fans ...

Well, they can certainly know which cell tower the phone is closest to. That's a five mile radius or so. More accurate triangulation is possible depending on the system. Also, the mobile phone should register a signal to the towers as long as the battery is in. If I was on a coast I would think about borrowing a little boat. But really, there is no country in the world that will protect someone from being questioned by the police. This person in hiding just needs to hire a lawyer and say that they held back until finding a lawyer. If the country has a death penalty then it might be an advantage to go to a country without a death penalty (like France and its territories) and then extradition has to be negotiated.

As for the "top", intc's lower top was set way back at 29.20, by the time Waldo hits 65, he might get to see it again, fool that he has been thinking semiconductor stocks are great long term investments.

OK. I am not sure how that affects the internal Apple employee overhead on their ARM CPU costs. "ARM64..." Maybe. We will know for sure when they announce it. "How long did PowerPC stick around when they converted to x86..." As long as Apple customers purchased it in sufficient quantities to make it worth while. When volumes became low enough Apple cut it off.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353041493284</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 23:51:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
