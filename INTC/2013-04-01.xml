Plus, you only need to reboot it three or four times a day, depending on how many times it overheats or blue screens. But, if you move, you don't have to change service providers. Wow!! What a relief!! All INTC has to do now is find suckers to sell content to it, change a few laws and get people to break their cable contracts.

Give me some reasons that Qualcom will stumble???? _______ Comment from SA Article: I really would like to own Intel in my DGI portfolio because their fundamentals are great, but as a Software Engineer I am worried for Intel in the future. Intel tries to get in the mobile market with their Intel Atom processors, but that can't catch a break comparing to Qualcomm S4 processors and Qualcomm's future line-up. The desktop and notebook market is collapsing. Another 'problem' with Intel is that their current desktop processors (i3, i5, i7) are so good, that customers don't need to replace them very often. A Core i7 released in 2010 is still enough for most consumers. The new generation (Haswell) is great, but do consumers really need this new chip? The 'old' Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge are still fast enough and do they need to be replaced in about 2-3 years? I don't think so. With the new game consoles around the corner (PlayStation 4, Xbox 3) some traditionally PC-gamers will not upgrade their PC and instead switch to a next-generation game console (both powered by AMD). so I really like Intel as a company and their fundamentals are great at this moment, but I'm afraid they can't keep it this way.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1364816777352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 07:46:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364818426920-64</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great job!</Msg><Username>wilmalangley</Username><Timestamp>1364818426920</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 08:13:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364819827009-65</Id><Topic><Title>Help Settle A Stock Bet - WHO WON?</Title><Username>jorlev1164</Username><Timestamp>1364754304249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:25:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citibank and congressmen and senators trading on insider information won, Bob and Bill are now broke, unemployed and collecting food-stamps...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1364819827009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 08:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364820159498-66</Id><Topic><Title>This guy nailed it.

Posted: 01 Apr 2013, 04:55, by Daniel P. "What's the holdup? Well, it turns out that Samsung went with the simpler and cheaper way to design 28nm chips like the Exynos 5 Octa, called gate-first, while the competing foundry TSMC designed its production capacity with the harder to implement gate-last process, developed by Intel. The problem stems from the fact that gate-first might be easier to transition to, but gives yield problems later on, especially with complex SoCs, and that's exactly what seems to be happening with Exynos 5 Octa." "Long story short, it might be a while before Samsung ramps up enough 28nm yield for Exynos 5 Octa to be implemented on a broader scale throughout its portfolio of mobile gadgets. Granted, only performance geeks would care about the benchmark difference between the Snapdragon 600 and Exynos 5 Octa chips, as today's mobile processors are already more powerful than Android needs, but this little episode might be a hint that the touted 14nm and even 20nm chips that Samsung says it has tapped out already, might remain in the labs longer than we thought, of which the main beneficiary will likely be TSMC, exactly where Apple is heading to build its proprietary A6 and A7 chipsets."</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364824033873</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 09:47:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364824047961-72</Id><Topic><Title>To sum it up - comments made by QCOM and Synopsis</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364621160041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 01:26:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>semi_equip_junkie Your ID tag is a Joke Clown has no understanding of SEMI-EQUIP Intel has slight light in 14nm but competition same tools/equipment available that Intel has... 2013 is bad for Intel and 2014 will be far worst</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364824047961</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 09:47:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364824226962-73</Id><Topic><Title>To sum it up - comments made by QCOM and Synopsis</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364621160041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 01:26:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go away nuff, nobody cares what you have to say.......................</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364824226962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 09:50:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364824322720-74</Id><Topic><Title>This guy nailed it.

Yes Are you thinking that a deal with Apple to act as a fab is needed soon? Yes Now about the downgrade. It is based really upon the believe it when we see it attitude that is hitting all when it comes to thinking about Intel. Of course things look uncertain. They are. It is a gambol now to be long Intel. The ship has no captain and no direction. It needs to get its head out of its rump and make moves NOW! It has hit, as Andy Grove is famous for saying--An Inflection point. It will either sink or swim in the next 6 months and JPM simply wants to wait and see before making a bet. For now--Intel is ROADKILL. Huge moves need to be made and all of them have risk. But to not move is to be certain of a slow steady decline in revenue.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1364825975576</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364826069876-86</Id><Topic><Title>will no longer pursue the Haswell architecture, JMP Securities said</Title><Username>patjoecon2</Username><Timestamp>1364825024771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:03:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thank you, hope u r correct</Msg><Username>patjoecon2</Username><Timestamp>1364826069876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:21:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364826107407-87</Id><Topic><Title>JPM downgrade.

Cutting power consumption in notebooks and tablets is crucial in INTC's battle with rival ARM Holdings (ARMH:$42.07,00$-0.30,00-0.71%) . JMP says sources' talk of INTC dropping such technology from future chip lines "calls into question Intel (INTC:$21.485,0$-0.35,00-1.60%) and its partners' ability to field a next generation" of computers "to staunch the tide of ARM-based tablets."

Top company executives such as senior vice president Kirk Skaugen, vice president Hermann Eul and CTO Justin Rattner will give speeches about the latest platform products and business developments in China. Beijing IDF will promote computing technology, chip manufacturing, application experience, end market conditions, and cloud intelligence. China became the world's largest PC market in 2011 and growth continued in 2012. In addition, for the past five years, the server market in China grew at rates above the global average and has become the world's second-largest data center market. According to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China is the world's largest handset market with more than one billion users. Intel has been developing the China market for years and has been aggressive in cooperating with local governments and schools on R&amp;D. Intel plans to display its latest technologies at Beijing IDF while its partners will display products such as smart systems, software ecosystems, ultra speed USBs, and ultrabooks. Wintek, a Taiwan-based touch panel firm and a supplier of Intel, will also participate at the event.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364830165467</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:29:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364830328687-120</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to showcase latest technology in IDF 2013 Beijing</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364830165467</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:29:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are they showing off the new Volatge problems too ?

Assuming the absolute worst case scenario that this will involve a voltage regulator redesign which is not a big issue in itself (6-9 months) this would put Haswell forward into 2014.

Our discovery of this issue came from discussions with multiple power management partners at the APEC (Applied Power Electronics Conference) trade show that was held March 17-21, 2013, and we were also informed that they had only just become aware of Intel’s change of direction in prior weeks. To be clear, the industry sources we spoke with indicated Haswell is working, but that “the new power approach did not live up to expectations.” It was the consensus view that timelines were also slipping, both for the Haswell refresh for PCs in 2H13 and likely down the road for the next two-socket Xeon server move to Haswell that is known as Grantley and expected in 2H14 […] Sources declined to elaborate on (or didn‟t know) the exact performance implications; however, integrated VR was touted as a key feature that will afford the Haswell platform improved power efficiency without compromising performance. We also know from speaking with senior Intel engineers that integrated VR had been “an area of great debate internally.” It seems evident at this juncture that this debate was won by integration proponents, but then lost in terms of benefit yield. Writes Guana, “If the new VR approach does not work as expected, it calls into question Intel and its partners’ ability to field a next generation of Ultrabooks, convertibles and tablets with appealing enough form factors and battery life to staunch the tide of ARM-based tablets.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364832363091</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:06:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364832476831-148</Id><Topic><Title>Out for now</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364830986883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:43:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>part 3. Guana also notes any Haswell power issues could reduce one of the purported benefits to Intel’s server shipments as well: It was the consensus view that timelines were also slipping, both for the Haswell refresh for PCs in 2H13 and likely down the road for the next two-socket Xeon server move to Haswell that is known as Grantley and expected in 2H14. These concerns, he notes, come amidst a backdrop of Intel not having made gains in mobile computing, which is where computing demand is shifting: The unfortunate thing for Intel is that overall computing demand appears generally healthy. The demand, however, is heavily skewed toward tablets and smartphones where Intel has yet to establish a material presence. Intel has been able to make only modest progress in smartphones and tablets to date, and there was no evidence out of the 2013 CES or Mobile World Congress trade shows to suggest this is likely to change this year. The end results, he thinks, is, We expect 2014 gross margins to be weighed upon by under-absorbed capital spending expenses, and operating margins to be impacted by ongoing levels of elevated spending as Intel continues to pound away on its mobile initiatives in smartphones and tablets.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364832476831</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364832567017-149</Id><Topic><Title>Out for now</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364830986883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:43:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't believe that an unethical firm like GS or JPM can plant a rumor &amp; cause DOW components price to drop,people are fools IMO to believe in GS/JPM</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364832567017</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:09:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364832750510-150</Id><Title>They attacked qtrly sales targets until now.

Posted: 01 Apr 2013, 04:55, by Daniel P. "What's the holdup? Well, it turns out that Samsung went with the simpler and cheaper way to design 28nm chips like the Exynos 5 Octa, called gate-first, while the competing foundry TSMC designed its production capacity with the harder to implement gate-last process, developed by Intel. The problem stems from the fact that gate-first might be easier to transition to, but gives yield problems later on, especially with complex SoCs, and that's exactly what seems to be happening with Exynos 5 Octa." "Long story short, it might be a while before Samsung ramps up enough 28nm yield for Exynos 5 Octa to be implemented on a broader scale throughout its portfolio of mobile gadgets. Granted, only performance geeks would care about the benchmark difference between the Snapdragon 600 and Exynos 5 Octa chips, as today's mobile processors are already more powerful than Android needs, but this little episode might be a hint that the touted 14nm and even 20nm chips that Samsung says it has tapped out already, might remain in the labs longer than we thought, of which the main beneficiary will likely be TSMC, exactly where Apple is heading to build its proprietary A6 and A7 chipsets</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364835781644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:03:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364835839478-169</Id><Topic><Title>New CEO announcement should be good for a couple of bucks to the upside</Title><Username>jj88810</Username><Timestamp>1364833331692</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iam not nuff numbnutzz</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1364835839478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:03:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364835945573-170</Id><Title>I Told ya, Wall St hates this pig, and will take it down any chance it</Title><Msg>gets.

CCUR is extremely undervalued fundamentally with the strongest possible technicals/chart! Currently $7.91 per share with 9.2mm o/s $24.6mm in cash no debt enterprise value of $48.17mm or 0.77X trailing revenue of $62.59mm. CCUR's EPS last quarter was up 100% from previous quarter and up 300% from two quarters ago. CCUR is now paying a big 3% dividend yield. CCUR is the global video on demand (VOD) leader with 212 deployments across 4 continents. CCUR's servers that have been deployed worldwide support 2.4 million+ concurrent VOD streams and reach 54mm total households. CCUR is rapidly expanding into the now rapidly growing multi-screen space to delivery video to tablets, smartphones, and other IP connected devices with its MediaHawk platform. Some of CCUR's largest clients like Time Warner Cable (TWC) are on their 6th generation of MediaHawk. CCUR won an Emmy Award for their "start over" technology deployed for TWC. CCUR is about to launch their innovative new patented cloud-based network DVR technology, which will revolutionize the industry and make today's DVR boxes in more than 50% of U.S. homes obsolete! CCUR is getting ready to break $8 resistance this afternoon and afterwards it could skyrocket to $12-$15 range extremely fast over the next couple of tradnig days! CCUR's main competitor Seachange (SEAC) is $11.89 per share about to report fiscal year 2013 revs of $157.37mm and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40. SEAC has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.89, which would value CCUR at $15.53. SEAC is also trading with a P/E of 30X projected full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.40. CCUR's non-GAAP EPS last quarter of $0.125 equals $0.50 annualized and a P/E of 30 would value CCUR at $15.</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1364837083159</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364837322443-179</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for sharing this!</Msg><Username>loganmartindc87</Username><Timestamp>1364837322443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364837344509-180</Id><Title>TSMC to Ramp 20nm in Two Months LOL</Title><Msg>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Also curious is that the he offers nothing to corroborate any of the claims. Separately I've seen unconfirmed articles describing an issue with Haswell's USB 3.0 implementation. It was also reported these would be resolved in the second stepping. The second point by a different obscure analyst saying Intel would lose a significant amount of Linux server business to ARM. Again, the analyst offers no data to support the view despite the fact there is no 64 bit ARM and Intel already makes x86 chips with equal or greater performance/Watt than ARM. This claim sounds like its based on the popular but overused ARM argument , "Intel has near 100% of the server market and that can't last" logic, even though far better companies have tried to take it away from them.

Oh, the once glorious ARM story with the notion of changing the industry once and for all and freeing up the consumer from paying the Intel tax has finally run out of steam. Now weary investors are growing more skeptical of ARM's long term chances of success. The ARM camp has gone to phase two known as "If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, bazzle em with BS." For the record I don't think this is the ARMH's people or any of the FABS starting these rumors. I think these are institutional investors who woke up one day and realized that they were too heavy on ARMH. Instead of dumping their shares at market rate they are selling it off over a couple week period. But they need suckers, I mean investors to buy what they know is an over inflated stock at near record high prices and not disrupt the apple cart as they get out. From today's move you can clearly see they they aren't afraid to use rumors to help prop up their struggling investments. For all your friends who want to buy Intel on the dip, this is it. Free of charge. I fully expect more to follow in the next few weeks and then once the investors are out you'll see glorious Intel upgrades to help move the ARMH down to the 20's again where they can once again jump on and "try" to BS it back up to 40. Try is the operative word. Haswell will be out soon enough and the ARM story won't look so glamorous once it is.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364839337214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:02:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839799771-193</Id><Topic><Title>ARM investors officially out of ideas.</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364839337214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:02:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wall Street never hands a bargain to anyone, today is one IMO,buy when there's blood in the street !</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364839799771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839867400-194</Id><Topic><Title>ARM IS KICKING INTC BUT</Title><Username>henrya1228</Username><Timestamp>1364839336892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:02:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All rumor nothing else...............</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364839867400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364840756099-195</Id><Title>Cramer said buy Intel the other day</Title><Msg>Kiss of death EVERY.SINGLE.TIME.</Msg><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364840756099</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:25:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364841232250-196</Id><Title>REALITY FOR WALLIS</Title><Msg>Pump 24 x 7 x 365 for 10 years and realize no financial gain be it paper or real.</Msg><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1364841232250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:33:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364841347808-197</Id><Topic><Title>REALITY FOR WALLIS</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1364841232250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:33:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a jealous little maggot, aren't you?

Said Mulloy in a phone call, Haswell is healthy and on track for an announcement. There’s no problem with the Haswell part at all. Also, we would expect that with Haswell we will see the biggest improvement in battery life in the company’s history when you compare it to the previous generation. It is expected to be a major milestone breakthrough. The key point is, it’s healthy and it’s on time. Malloy was referring to previous remarks about Haswell made by management during the company’s January Q4 conference call. At that time, the company said “We started production on Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale this quarter [Q1] [...] This resulted in an increase in inventory write-offs [in Q4]. We expect to be production-ready in the current quarter.” The remark about record improvements in power efficiency were consistent with previous promises by Intel regarding Haswell, said Malloy. Intel shares are down 46 cents, or 2%, at $21.37.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364842300921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364842467777-202</Id><Topic><Title>CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri predicted that Intel would lose a significant amount of the Linux server market to ARM chip vendors.</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1364836238444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:10:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No clues..No facts...</Msg><Username>gsstreasurer09</Username><Timestamp>1364842467777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:54:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364842965447-203</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Rebuffs JMP Warning About Haswell; ‘On Track and On Time’</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364842300921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:51:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, there's GOT to be something that can be done about this #$%$ with the analysts.

So here's a little inside info about this integrated VR stuff. I'm not involved with IVR technology, but I do have some insight into the Haswell project. First of all, the primary benefit of an integrated VR is cost savings. It's integrating yet more things that used to be on a motherboard into the chip itself, and that means a lower BOM for OEMs. Not that there aren't other benefits as well, but those other benefits by themselves probably wouldn't be enough to take on the technical challenges (and they are numerous). Secondly, there were indeed some problems identified with Haswell's integrated VRs when silicon came back over a year ago. You know who found those problems? The team in Israel. I've been told that the folks on that team do not like some aspects of the IVRs on HSW (I don't know if it's the implementation, or the whole concept, or whether they doubt the ROI, or what). One of the benefits of having two world class design teams at your disposal is that they are always pushing each other, always questioning each other, not to mention the friendly competition that always goes on. Well, the folks in IDC wrote a funky power virus test that showed some holes in the IVR circuit performance on Haswell silicon. This did indeed cause an all-hands-on-deck response, and various circuit improvements that were already done on the Broadwell IVRs were pulled back into the Haswell design, along with some other potential fixes that were identified. I won't go into details on the problem, the impact, or the solution, but continuous improvements were put into each successive stepping, and my third-hand knowledge is that the problem is 99% contained." cont-</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1364843540401</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364843653914-212</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Rebuffs JMP Warning About Haswell; ‘On Track and On Time’</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364842300921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:51:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Intel investors should prepare themselves for a lot more of this nonsense the closer we get to the earnings release.

Every year on International Consumers’ Day, China‘s biggest state-run television network broadcasts an investigative report on how companies operating in China cheat or mistreat consumers. This year, on March 15, one of the targets was Apple. China Central Television criticized the American company’s after-sales iPhone customer service in China because it only gives a one-year warranty while in China the law is two years. It also said that phone owners have to pay about $90 to replace a faulty back cover.. Apple did not immediately respond to some of the allegations, but other state media outlets stepped up their criticism over the next two weeks, raising the stakes for Apple in China, which is now the company’s second-biggest market after the United States. Soon after the segment aired, several Chinese celebrities piled on, posting harsh comments on China’s Twitter-like service called Weibo. Then People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, published a series of editorials and articles, including one paper titled “Defeat Apple’s Incomparable Arrogance.” Other state organs also joined the fray. China’s State Administration of Industry and Commerce, which has oversight of business practices in China, called for “strengthened supervision” of Apple. And in recent days, television evening news broadcasts have included images of Chinese journalists being turned away from Apple’s offices in China. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., issued a statement in Chinese Monday. “We realize that a lack of communication in this process has led the outside to believe that Apple is arrogant and doesn’t care or value consumers’ feedback,” Mr. Cook wrote in the open letter. “We sincerely apologize...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364845623291</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:47:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364846031674-237</Id><Topic><Title>bacbacker</Title><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364845513915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:45:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What can i say...I admit they fooled me.

If successful, Intel’s launch could provide a competitive shakeup not seen since cable TV appeared on the scene en masse in the 1980s. The silicon giant is in talks with Time Warner (News - Alert), NBCUniversal and Viacom to license TV shows and films, according to Bloomberg, citing “people with knowledge of the situation.” The Big Media stalwarts—three of the six that are critical (Disney and FOX/News Corp. and CBS are the others)—have signed off on the concept of what Intel is trying to do, the sources said. But the devil of course is in the details. Intel has made no secret of the fact that it is looking to leverage a set-top box (Intel inside, naturally) to offer a sort of super-Roku proposition. Yes, it would be a box-based OTT play that consumers would buy at retail. However, it would have the look and feel of a traditional IPTV (News - Alert) service, with access to all the channels one would expect from a pay-TV provider. In addition to live TV, there would be on-demand option and a cloud-based DVR, and subscribers will have multiscreen access across TV sets, computers and mobile devices. It all sounds fairly straightforward—with one exception. Erik Huggers, Intel’s vice president for media, said last month that Intel expects to provide “smarter” network bundling for consumers. Viewers will be able to simply pick and choose which niche blocks of channels they would like to include in the service, thus determining their own programming lineup (and subscription cost)—to a certain extent. That approach, if successful, would mean that Intel is exploring a final frontier in TV business models, boldly going where no TV operator has successfully been able to go before.</Msg><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364847610235</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:20:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364847632771-244</Id><Topic><Title>A bet about CC and JPM</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364846517340</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:01:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The JPM analyst is also a problem for Intel but this is JMP Securities and he has been pretty postive until this goof.

With true "a la carte" consumers have the option of selecting only the channels they want which could potentially save consumers money compared to the oversized bundles cable companies offer today. Intel's Huggers has said multiple times that Intel's Web TV is not intended to lower consumer's programming cost. And "smart bundling" that makes the consumer pay the same as they're already paying may offer some flexibility but it is far from "a la carte". Given the plethora of obstacles Intel faces in making this venture successful, true "a la carte" would at least get the attention of consumers with a real value proposition, but this doesn't appear to be it. Right now Intel's Web TV is about at the same point Microsoft was with Windows RT just before the holiday season. It started with a valid concept but by the time they got it ready the circumstances had changed and now what do you with it. Fill it or kill it.

So much of their value has been attributed to the iPhone and iPad. As Apple's stock price takes a nose dive how can ARMH not get taken along for the ride? Look at the share prices for strongly tied suppliers to Apple's iProducts such as Ciirus Logic (CRUS). True ARMH is spread out across the industry which helps deflect one major supplier downturn but you would expect that if Apple sneezes ARMH would catch a cold? The problem is that I don't believe that in the big picture ARMH really isn't that diversified from Apple. Apple basically started both the smartphone and tablet revolution. They have a loyal fan base that will wait in line all over world for each new iProduct they think up. Yet with all of this going for it, the stock is dropping? The real question is why? Why is this very cash rich company with a possible book value of $285 a share (what I read, don't quote me on it) selling for such a low premium? Apple's P/E Ratio is now lower than Intel's! The biggest question, can you honestly say or suggest that the problems with Apple have absolutely nothing to do with ARMH or the rest of the fabless model? Don't forget that analysts were blowing mad kisses at this concept not even a year ago stating that boutique processors were the wave of the future and how much more money could be made if you didn't share it with Intel. Now that the largest success story has hit rough waters why isn't ARMH sinking like a stone?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364851305828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364852622592-253</Id><Title>Nenni calling out TSMC</Title><Msg>Lifted from his post at the ARMH board. "Et tu Nenni! So TSMC shall fall" What's an ARM pumper to do? "What's the holdup with Samsung Galaxy S4's Exynos 5 Octa version? Posted: 01 Apr 2013, 04:55, by Daniel P. Not the LTE , "What's the holdup? Well, it turns out that Samsung went with the simpler and cheaper way to design 28nm chips like the Exynos 5 Octa, called gate-first, while the competing foundry TSMC designed its production capacity with the harder to implement gate-last process, developed by Intel. The problem stems from the fact that gate-first might be easier to transition to, but gives yield problems later on, especially with complex SoCs, and that's exactly what seems to be happening with Exynos 5 Octa. " "Long story short, it might be a while before Samsung ramps up enough 28nm yield for Exynos 5 Octa to be implemented on a broader scale throughout its portfolio of mobile gadgets. Granted, only performance geeks would care about the benchmark difference between the Snapdragon 600 and Exynos 5 Octa chips, as today's mobile processors are already more powerful than Android needs, but this little episode might be a hint that the touted 14nm and even 20nm chips that Samsung says it has tapped out already, might remain in the labs longer than we thought, of which the main beneficiary will likely be TSMC, exactly where Apple is heading to build its proprietary A6 and A7 chipsets." source: DanielNenny (SemiWiki), CPUBoss &amp; Maltiel-consulting"</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364852622592</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:43:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364852740987-254</Id><Topic><Title>MR ASHRAF</Title><Username>henrya1228</Username><Timestamp>1364832906931</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol, why would I sell at $23 with a cost basis of around $21?

Apple is marketing 40nm and 32nm processors and staying clear of 28nm. You would expect that they would be the first in line for 28nm and offer the latest and greatest.

The company led by CEO Rosen Sharma said Intel is working with it to make sure that its technology is optimized for hardware that uses Intel chips. "Intel is a massive force in the valley and we're happy to have Intel Capital backing us," Sharma said in a press release. "There are huge benefits to working closely together as we can engineer BlueStacks products to work exceptionally well on Intel-equipped devices." BlueStacks also recently announced distribution partnerships with Lenovo and several other large original equipment manufacturers. The company’s App Player product won Best Software at CES 2012 and an Innovation Award for its Mac version at CES 2013. The company said that over 5 million people use App Player to run mobile apps like Instagram, Subway Surfers, Kik Messenger and more on PC and Mac. It boasts that its technology can run any mobile apps full screen with no pixelation on screens that are 80 inches big or larger. The company was founded in 2009 and before this funding had raised $15 million. Its backers include Andreessen-Horowitz, Radar Partners, Redpoint, Ignition Partners and Qualcomm. bizjournalsDOTcom/sanjose/news/2013/03/05/bluestacks-gets-big-backing-from-intelDOThtml</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364866466204</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 21:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364866613025-285</Id><Topic><Title>Intel TV about to rock you to the core</Title><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364847610235</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:20:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, it's not fully implemented a la carte but it's significant progress towards that.

"We [will] offer a rich menu of options to pick and choose from, both different transistor options and different interconnect options,” said Bohr. Bohr said that when Intel had first announced it would be using tri-gate devices, other companies had argued that FinFET transistors would not aid analog design. “Well, they’re wrong,” declared Bohr. For analog designers, he asserted, an important transistor metric is trans-conductance by power out (GM x Rout). Bohr said that while this value had been steadily degrading over the past few generations, it had shot up again in 22-nm trigate SoCs, making it easier for analog circuit designers to use than Intel’s previous three generations of planar technology.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364871428564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 22:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364871573816-296</Id><Title>Intel: sue Guano</Title><Msg>else you have no cajones.</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1364871573816</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 22:59:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364871624959-297</Id><Title>INTC raises Dividend to $1.00</Title><Msg>Great news!!!.... if only</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1364871624959</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364871905986-298</Id><Topic><Title>So much for intel and Lenovo longterm, LOL</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364867611717</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 21:53:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SO... you didn't answer about INtel's attempt to sell a PoP as an SoC... are you avoiding answering ??
