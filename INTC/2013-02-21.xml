In such a scenario its highly likely Intel will downsize its fabrication capacity and skip future targeted optimizations like 450mm wafers. It may also need to delay or completely curtail development of future nodes such as 10nm. The economics can't support all this excess. Intel's market has been booming for quite a while now. It cant follow that trajectory anymore.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1361422865064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:01:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361422874078-2</Id><Topic><Title>Marsavian:</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1361402746156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:25:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ Butkus.

That's why Intel invested $4 billion in litho? Bruck, during his presentation, noted that fewer companies are capable of delivering Moore's Law -- and fewer capable of 450mm production. He showed that about 20 semiconductor companies have the $3-5 billion revenue "threshold" (measured in 2011 dollars) to build a 200mm fab. Only nine have revenue, in the $9-12 billion range, which is the threshold for a 300mm fab (those being Intel, Samsung, TSMC, Toshiba, TI, Renesas, ST Micro, Qualcomm and Hynix). "In 300mm configurations, there's a much smaller group that can afford a reasonable capital cost as a percentage of revenue," Bruck said. "If you extend this 300mm model out a few more years, anticipating the next few nodes that come, the list of participants who can afford to build these factories gets even smaller. Somewhere beyond 2015 will be a 450 number which suggests even further concentration."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361423249461</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:07:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361425163942-4</Id><Topic><Title>Intel’s Post-14nm Future Begins to Take Shape</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361421536671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 23:38:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can only keep growing as long as the market supports your growth.

Samsung does not disclose it. The workload that is being run to get the power curves is DMIPS. The Dhrystone benchmark will have ZERO cache misses after its first iteration. Cache misses will generate memory accesses and turning those memory bus transistors will really burn the power. I will be interested in looking at how they design their scheduling algorithm to switch back and forth. When they switch CPU, they will transfer control from the 512kb cashe to the cold 2mb cache. It will take some time and power to warm the caches up. anandtechDOTcom/show/6536/arm-vs-x86-the-real-showdown</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361427903864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 01:25:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361428172752-9</Id><Topic><Title>Exynos 5 Octa is a 6W chip</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361401313022</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:01:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a valid point.

Here was a company that was exiting 2012 with 50% utilization of their advanced 22nm process and yet signaling more building was to come. Furthermore, this increase seems counter to the claim that most of its current 22nm tools can be repositioned to the 14nm Fabs that ramp later this year. It was Paul Otellini who spoke the words of the strategy that likely came from Intel Chairman and Manufacturing Guru: Andy Bryant. Could Intel be saying that to ultimately win they had to hit the gas pedal guessing that only they could get to 14nm and then 10nm with cash still in the bank? Or is there something else at play (i.e. a Breakup of x86 from Foundry followed by the signing of multiple large customers)........ Or maybe Intel is in total disarray?

This chip still can still go in a phone. Yes, running all 4 A15 at full clock will soon blow the thermals on the SoC, but this is NO different from existing Atom phone SoC's with their 'turbo' function. ARM's turbo is just a lot more complex:) There is still lots of questions here and for me one of the biggest is is how well big/little works in practice especially as all 8 cores can be scaled by clock and be turned off. As a side, it looks like 1 A15 can run at full pelt within the thermal budget, giving some impressive single threaded performance. One thing is for certain, benchmarking is going to get more complex if all 4 A15's can be active at full clock for the period of the benchmark.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361449480647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:24:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361449748519-29</Id><Topic><Title>Intel’s Post-14nm Future Begins to Take Shape</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361421536671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 23:38:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah...blah...blah...blah</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1361449748519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:29:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361450236402-30</Id><Topic><Title>The A15 is a Powerhog.

The Tegra 4 was unveiled last month at CES but has so far been left to stand at the altar by the smartphone makers, like the intimidatingly powerful bride it is. That’s set to change now and could bring smartphone users significant leaps in graphics capability courtesy of those 72 custom GeForce cores. This will obviously make for smoother, more realistic gaming on the mobile but also, as The Reg pointed out at CES, improved photos with High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging support. The quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU is not a huge performance leap up from Tegra 3 by comparison but the SoC apparently manages to consume 45 per cent less power than its predecessor, thanks in part to a “second-generation battery-saver core”. As per Tegra 3, this extra (fifth) CPU core runs the phone during normal operation, allowing the A15s to take over when some serious processing power is needed. Improved web browsing and app download times are also promised by Nvidia. There’s no detail yet on which handset models will sport the new chips, although one of them will be an LTE version featuring Nvidia’s i500 chipset, ZTE said. That chipset has been crammed inside a new smaller SoC, the 4i, which was announced on Tuesday. Nvidia explains its performance efficiency benefits and why the i500 is likely to be around for a while to come, in a blog post here. Sadly ZTE was unable to confirm if or when the upcoming Tegra 4 handsets would make it out of the People’s Republic. Nvidia isn’t the only chip firm looking to set its stall out ahead of MWC next week, however. STEricsson announced on Wednesday what it claims to be the world’s fastest smartphone processor – the gargantuan 3Ghz NovaThor L8580. The 28nm, Cortex-A9 chip is being touted by ST as a disruptor in the wireless space, although it remains a prototype so won’t be in devices for some time yet</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361454449535</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 08:47:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361454638541-43</Id><Topic><Title>First ARM-based servers in production support Baidu’s cloud storage</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361373833085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>more details for those with a tech interest: --- Marvell notches another design win after Dell and Codethink boxes By Timothy Prickett Morgan • Get more from this author Posted in Servers , 20th February 2013 21:05 GMT Free whitepaper – HP 3PAR storage efficiencies that unlock green savings Chip maker Marvell has notched up its third public design win for an ARM server, this one at Baidu, one of the two big search engine giants in China. Avi Liebermensch, manager of server products at the maker of ARM processors and other kinds of chips, tells El Reg that the Baidu server is based on the company's Armada XP MV78460. This is the same quad-core processor that Dell chose for its "Copper" ARM sled servers announced last May and purchased by unspecified customers of its Data Center Solutions bespoke server business unit. The Baserock slab ARM server from Codethink also uses this Marvell processor as its main engine. Baidu has deployed an ARM server for cheap and dense storage with local processing Liebermensch was not at liberty to give a lot of details on the Baidu machines, and China is celebrating its New Year right now so people in Beijing are not around to answer calls. But Marvell did sneak us a picture and gave us some insight into the machine that Baidu has worked with Marvell and an unspecified ODM to create. As you can see, the Baidu ARM box has six sleds that slide into a 2U chassis, and Liebermensch says that this box has a total of 24 drives and supports a maximum of 96TB. That almost certainly means it uses 4TB SATA drives. The Dell copper sled crammed four of these Marvell Armada XP processors, four SATA drives, and a baby Ethernet switch linking the four processors to each other and to the outside world for the Copper sleds, and it could be that the Baidu box is built by Dell or is a knockoff of the Copper design. The processor count on the Baidu server sled was not divulged. What Liebermensch did say is that Marvell had grabbed a storage controller that can handle SAS or SATA drives over a PCI-Express controller built into the chip and an Ethernet switch that implements two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and six Gigabit Ethernet ports. This sounds like the Baidu box has a slightly different network and storage setup than the Dell Copper box. Block diagram of Marvell's Armada XP MV78460 chip The Armada XP MV78460 uses Marvell "Sheeva" PJ4B cores, which are a variant of the 32-bit ARMv7-MP design that has the 40-bit memory addressing added to it. That means each socket can address up to 16GB of main memory, in this case, which is more than enough for a lot of workloads. Baidu has opted for a version of the chip running at 1.6GHz, just like Dell. The Armada XP chip has a crossbar interconnect that links all of the elements of the SoC together, which might be out there on a much larger motherboard if this was not an SoC. Each Sheeva CPU has a floating point unit and is linked over a coherency fabric to a 2MB on-die L2 cache. The memory controller has ECC scrubbing and runs at up to 1.6GHz, matching the clock speed if you want. There are four PCI-Express 2.0 controllers on the chip, as well as controllers to drive two SATA peripheral ports and four Gigabit Ethernet ports. There is also a 4Gb/sec packet processor (handy for some things, not so much for others) and a security engine for encrypting and decrypting data. All in a 15 watt thermal envelope. It is not clear which "Cheetah" switch module that Baidu has embedded on the sleds in the server, but it could be the same as the "Cheetah 3" 98DX5156 Layer 2/3 network switching that Codethink is using in its Baserock Slab, an eight-node system that comes in a 1U chassis that is based on the same processor from Marvell. What Baidu was looking for in this particular server was to get computing power right next to the storage, not to create a JBOD that then hooks into an external server. Given this, it is reasonable to assume that the Baidu box has four Armada XP chips nodes talking to four drives on each sled. The servers run Ubuntu Server 12.10, which is the Linux from Canonical and which is the second release to formally support ARM servers. Marvel has also cooked up a systems management tool for Baidu that speaks IMPI 2.0 that can work with its existing control freakage. Marvell is very excited, calling this the first real deployment of ARM in the data center, and says that Baidu is not just experimenting with machines, but actually installing these machines to run some of its "cold storage" software, known internally as Pan, after months of development and testing. When pressed about how many machines Baidu had installed, Marvell would not say. That would irk its customer during the holiday. But what Marvell could divulge is that the setup had a 25 per cent lower total cost of ownership compared to previous x86-based servers used by Baidu for the same purpose.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361454638541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 08:50:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361455800066-44</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corp bounce prediction</Title><Username>perkinslynn113</Username><Timestamp>1361449841856</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>adorable post, thanks!</Msg><Username>jonesherman118</Username><Timestamp>1361455800066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 09:10:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361456313693-45</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's x86 - Foundry Breakup Comes into View</Title><Username>semiconductorguy</Username><Timestamp>1361445193860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 06:13:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting speculation.

If Samsung is able to tune their OS scheduler, they will look good on the: idle tests when the LITTLEs are running and they will look good when a single thread benchmark is running (1 BIG) and they will look good when the MP benchmarks are running (4 BIGs) and they will look good when the light loads are running (4 LITTLEs). There will some time delay in the core switching and power overhead. The scheduler tension will be to turn on the BIGs quickly which will cost power but not too quickly.

Bay Trail is a mobile Atom system chip, suitable for inclusion in mobile phones, due to be announced in 2013 and made using Intel's 22-nm FinFET manufacturing process. Steve Smith, director of tablet platform development at Intel said the Dialog PMIC would help deliver energy-efficient Atom-based tablets to market. The DA6021 is included on the Bay Trail reference design board that is provided for software development, test and measurement as well as on a "form-factor" enclosed reference design that demonstrates tablet computer functionality, Dialog (Kirchheim-unter-Teck, Germany) said. "The performance and energy-efficiency gains that we expect Intel's next-generation processor will bring to tablets are complemented perfectly by the system-level power management capabilities of our PMIC, which has been designed to operate with both the processor and its peripherals," said Jalal Bagherli, CEO of Dialog, in a statement. In addition, Dialog has said that Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. has adopted the DA2083 PMIC with integrated audio functionality for use in the Samsung Galaxy Fame smartohone GT-S6810, due to ship in 1Q13. The DA2083 integrates over 30 different power supply domains and analog functions. Dialog already provides PMICs for the Samsung’s S5368 and Galaxy Pocket S5300 smartphones.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361461534670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:45:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361461820901-67</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corp bounce prediction</Title><Username>perkinslynn113</Username><Timestamp>1361449841856</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's worth checking</Msg><Username>hansenmicah</Username><Timestamp>1361461820901</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:50:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361462248349-68</Id><Title>TSM vs. INTC</Title><Msg>It does not make sense that TSM can have double the PE of INTC.</Msg><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361462248349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361462259837-69</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Alexander, look at your very angry Liberal friend Wallisweaver</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361442619433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 05:30:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, the liberals are estatic.

They continue to increase Capex and don't explain why, all they have to do is say if the 86 processor falls on its face, we have a license to manufacture ARM processors and we will. That alone would give us a PE equal to TSMC.

Another example of a virtual monopoly, Intel has an 80% share of the semiconductor market. The giant trades at a measly P/E of 10x, and a PEG of 0.8. Last year, Intel earned more than $20 billion in cash. With this huge profit, Intel spent more than $16 billion returning capital to its owners via cash dividends ($4 billion) and share buybacks ($12 billion). In short, shareholders at Intel kept 80% of the profits.

The conceiver of the project happened to be none other than Francois Piednoel. The company’s maiden dual core offer comes with the name of Clover Trail+, is not being shipped yet and it’s ability of beating ARM chips from Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Samsung is questionable at best. The device which is going to be powered with new INTC’s new power source is going to make a difference in many lives that are depending on the company’s software in order to operate their hand held devices. The featured device is an Android-based Lenovo K900, which has a 5.5-inch 1,920×1,080 IPS display (that yields about 400 pixels per inch), a 13MP camera with Sony’s new Exmor RS BSI sensor and a 6.9mm profile. The new device will be made available in Asia during its introductory stage. The company is believing in Clover Trail+’s ability to circumvent the authoritative position of leading chipmakers around the globe. The newer chip will take away market share from ARM chips in a matter of months. The true potential of the new micro-architecture is yet to be seen. But, it may pose a significant challenge for the current market leaders in the near future. In the last trading session, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock traded at the beginning with a price of $21.09 and throughout the trading session climbed to a high of $21.10 and later, when day-trade ended, the stock finally plunged -1.68% to $20.73. INTC current year earnings per share experienced a decline of -10.83%, while its current quarter performance remained +3.75%. INTC has 4.98 billion outstanding shares, among them 4.97 billion shares have been floated in the market exchange. INTC stock institutional ownership remained 63.29% while insider ownership was 0.05%. The stock is ahead of its 52 week low +8.98% and is lagging behind its 52 week high price -27.06%. The Company’s beta coefficient was 1.02. Beta factor measures the amount of market risk associated with market trade.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361467678825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:27:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361467843517-138</Id><Topic><Title>I would really wait to buy this pull back is just getting started, Wall Street always slaughters the suckers and pigs that don't take profits</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1361462536145</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 11:02:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anyone think 19 will hold this time</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1361467843517</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:30:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361467909026-139</Id><Title>INTELLL GOD PUC YOU USA</Title><Msg>SHORT IT MORE</Msg><Username>ericmedina2000</Username><Timestamp>1361467909026</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:31:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361467928191-140</Id><Title>Does anyone really think $19 is going to hold this time? or maybe $17</Title><Msg>Does anyone really think $19 is going to hold this time? or maybe $17</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1361467928191</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:32:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361467955161-141</Id><Title>Traders are hilarious</Title><Msg>Yesterday this stock was over $21 and people were buying.

And that is what it is doing. The company has come out with a new video where it boasts about the superiority of its mobiles chips compared to those of ARM. Intel has just released its first dual-core phone chip Clover Trail+ though they haven’t started shipping yet. So it is difficult to find proof that they can indeed be superior to the new ARM chips from Qualcomm, NVidia and Samsung. How Should Investors Trade INTC Now? Let’s find Out Here But that has hasn’t stopped d the company from captioning the video as `a little demo of x86 superiority over ARM’. The Intel video goes on to say, “They told you we could not do it…they were wrong” — a distinct reference to the ARM-vanquishing Clover Trail+. For its debut the Clover Trail+ ill first be inserted in Lenovo’s Android-based smartphone which has a 5.5 inch screen, 1,920×1,080 IPS display (that yields about 400 pixels per inch), a 13MP camera with Sony’s new Exmor RS BSI sensor, and a 6.9mm profile. The Lenovo K900 will initially be sold only in Asia. Cnet said that in making all thse claims, Intel may well be getting ahead of itself. “The silicon that probably has the best chance to challenge ARM is the upcoming “Merrifield” system-on-a-chip, which will be based on an entirely new microarchitecture and be the first phone chip to tap Intel’s 22-nanometer 3D chip technology.” Tags: intc, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NASDAQ:INTC</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361468049269</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:34:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361468061482-143</Id><Title>Intel Talking Smack - I Love It</Title><Msg>[Intel has a preview video out on the Lenovo K900 with the caption "they told you it was not possible". ] ["Intel's François Piednoël is no fan of the competition making claims about what his company can and can't do, so he's taken to YouTube to post a video to showcase what the company's upcoming Clover Trail+ SoC is capable of.

That leads into Intel's teasing, "They told you it was not possible", before revealing the Lenovo IdeaPhone K900, first announced at last month's CES."] After announcing their new Lenovo K900 back in early January of this year, Lenovo have now released a preview video revealing a little more about their new Clover Trail+ Lenovo K900 Smartphone. The new Lenovo K900 preview video has been released ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) show next week and shows what the new Lenovo K900 smartphone is capable of.

Minimizing I/O cost, area and power are crucial to achieving a practically realisable system with large bandwidth. To meet these needs, Intel has developed a low power, dense 64-lane I/O system with per port aggregate bandwidth up to 1Tbit/s and 2.6PJ/bit power efficiency. In addition to the interconnect Intel has also developed a high density connector and cable attached to the top side of the package. We have previously seen fast interconnects, but the news this time around is the density as well as the scalability. It is possible to vary the lane data rate from 2Gbit/s to 16Gbit/s on the fly. This provides scalable aggregate bandwidth of 128Gbit/s to 1Tbit/s with a power efficiency of 0.8PJ/bit to 2.6PJ/bit, or to put it very simply, you can adjust the bandwidth to whatever your needs are - and when you don't need a lot of bandwidth you save power instead of running at full tilt. The cable that Intel uses has a maximum length of 50cm and can be used either to connect processors or to connect a processor to a DRAM subsystem in order to feed the processor with data.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361471318945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:28:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361471348052-162</Id><Topic><Title>C at 4.20 per share is a disgrace to humanity while the CEO makes millions</Title><Username>dc10050</Username><Timestamp>1361469473404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:57:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So why do you people continue to hold the stock?

Hybrid Memory Cube Enables 7 Times Higher DRAM Power Efficiency [09/15/2011 04:27 PM] by Anton Shilov ....probably @ 10nm “We knew that future high-speed memory will need to conquer a challenging set of tradeoffs and achieve low cost and power as well as high density and speed. We came to the conclusion that mating DRAM and a logic process based I/O buffer using 3D stacking could be the way to solve the dilemma. We found out that once we placed a multi-layer DRAM stack on top of a logic layer, we could solve another memory problem which limits the ability to efficiently transfer data from the DRAM memory cells to the corresponding I/O circuits,” said Bryan Casper, an Intel official. Getting the data out of the memory cells to the I/O is analogous to the difficulty of navigating the streets of a crowded city. However, placing the logic layer underneath the DRAM stack has a similar effect to building a high-speed subway system underneath the streets, bypassing encumbrances such as the DRAM process as well as the routing restricted memory arrays. Additionally, the adjacent logic layer enables integration of an intelligent control logic to hide the complexities of the DRAM array access, allowing the microprocessor memory controller to employ much more straightforward access protocols than what has been achievable in the past, according to Intel.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361472361672</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:46:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361472387970-169</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Down 3.36% Today on the London Exchange</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361471764206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:36:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor Waldo never figured INTC would drop RIGHT along with ARMH.

Each of those DRAMs has its own interface so when you go to access data, you go to a very local area of DRAM [...]It's a more directed access." Then, "we move that down the Z direction on a TSV." When asked about the impact of 3D stacking on memory performance, Jeddeloh responded: "When you think of a DIMM, maybe it has 4, 8, 16 [memory cell] banks in it, ...once you go to a memory cube where you have these tiles and partitions, each of those has its own bank structure. So instead of 8 banks, you have 128 banks, 256 banks and each of these are put into parallel DRAM structures so you have a tremendous amount of concurrency available. You can think of a many-core processor coming at a many tiled memory system that marries up and can handle a lot of concurrent transactions." In terms of mating this memory to today's and future microprocessors, Jeddeloh commented that "As we go to more and more cores on processors [they become] more and more bandwidth-hungry. In this generation, you can't stack the DRAM on top of the processor because the processor is too hot. That means the processor has to go off-chip to get that bandwidth [and] you need to connect a pipe to that processor that can bring in as much bandwidth at the lowest amount of power." Micron's HMC technology, he explained, "can put more density in a very local area and put that right next to the processor." He also characterized power as the No. 1 theme going forward: "Once we reduce that power, we can create a smaller, more efficient I/O structure when the processor and the memory system are right next to each other. If you have, say, eight cubes hooked up to a processor, there's a tremendous amount of bandwidth and concurrency that can happen in a very small area."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361475318654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 14:35:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361475410666-179</Id><Topic><Title>Intel says faster processors need faster I/O</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361471318945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:28:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then, "we move that down the Z direction on a TSV."

To a large degree it's a zero sum game. At least that's how Wall Street looks at it. Once Wall Street starts to get its head about ARMs fabrication failure, it will realize that any ARM failure to perform results in a benefit to Intel. Half the reason the Intel stock price is where it is is because of the totally irrational exuberance Wall Street feels for ARM as reflected by the ridiculous P/E ratio. Once that disappears Intel will move up significantly. So, I will continue to attempt to pop the ARM fantasy bubble. Don't get me wrong - ARM is a fine company, just like AMD, but it deserves a P/E no higher than that of Intel and I feel I'm being generous by saying that.

Nevertheless, options traders are gambling on a quick recovery for the blue-chip tech stock, as evidenced by today's appetite for weekly calls. In afternoon trading, INTC has seen about 55,000 calls change hands -- a 74% mark-up to its average intraday volume. For comparison, roughly 41,000 INTC puts have traded thus far. Most popular is the weekly 3/1 20.50-strike call, which has seen close to 8,700 contracts cross the tape at a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $0.18. With not a single contract open at the strike, and considering most of the calls traded on the ask side, it's safe to assume that bulls are buying the calls to open. By doing so, the traders expect INTC to muscle back atop the $20.68 level (strike plus VWAP) by the closing bell next Friday, March 1, when the weekly options expire. At last check, delta on the call stood at 0.35, or 35%, implying a roughly 1-in-3 chance of finishing in the money. However, even if INTC extends today's downturn, the most the buyers have risked is the initial premium paid for the calls. From a broader sentiment perspective, bullish bets have become par for the course for INTC. On the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), investors have bought to open more than two calls for every put during the past couple of weeks. What's more, the equity's 10-day call/put volume ratio of 2.49 stands higher than 80% of all other readings of the past year, indicating that option buyers are picking up INTC calls at a faster-than-usual pace. As a result, the stock sports a Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.73, implying that calls outnumber puts among options with a shelf-life of three months or less. Furthermore, this ratio registers in the 12th percentile of its annual range, suggesting near-term options players are more call-skewed than usual at the moment. At last check, INTC has given up 2.5% to explore the $20.21 level, and -- as alluded to earlier -- is in danger of ending south of its 10-week and 20-week moving averages for the first time in 2013. This duo of trendlines ushered INTC significantly lower in 2012, and could reemerge as resistance. However, the security could find a foothold in the $19-$20 neighborhood, which has contained the bulk of INTC's pullbacks since late 2009.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361476345972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 14:52:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361476385397-191</Id><Title>Nice Buying Opportunity Ahead of MWC 2013</Title><Msg>And fun to watch all the chicken littles running around today.

"We [will] offer a rich menu of options to pick and choose from, both different transistor options and different interconnect options," said Bohr. Why FinFET is good for analogue design Bohr said it was now abundantly clear that 22nm tri-gate SoCs outperformed 32nm planar devices by a margin of 20 to 65 per cent, while covering four different orders of magnitude in current leakage. Intel said its 22nm tri-gate product also exhibits superior short channel control, with optimum sub-threshold slope and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). The sub-threshold slope allows for low leakage but could also function well at low voltage, making them "much better than the very best planar devices," Bohr added. Bohr said the low numbers for DIBL seen in testing were a measure of good performance in short channel control, with the new SoC pulling in DIBL numbers of 30 to 35mVs, while comparable products had DIBL's closer to the 100mV range. Bohr said that when Intel had first announced it would be using tri-gate devices, other companies had argued that FinFET transistors would not aid analogue design. "Well, they're wrong," declared Bohr. For analogue designers, he asserted, an important transistor metric is transconductance by power out (GM x Rout). Bohr said that while this value had been steadily degrading over the past few generations, it had shot up again in 22nm tri-gate SoCs, making it easier for analogue circuit designers to use than Intel's previous three generations of planar technology. Bohr also touted the technology's advanced passive features, including precision resistors, MIM capacitors and high Q inductors.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361477186976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 15:06:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361477397634-203</Id><Topic><Title>The A15 is a Powerhog.

I had to go to CBOE and look at their extended view. The orders were sprinkled around the exchanges with 5k of them on the AMEX exhange. When the execute comes at the ASK, it could be from someone buying at the ASK price. Option prices move slowly so it could also be someone submitting a LIMIT SELL like I would for covered calls. If the price of the stock goes up, the OMM might just harvest my calls as their pricing become atractive to him. It is VERY HARD to determine if a transaction is BULLish or not without some background information. I tend to use the BID SIZE and ASK SIZE to see if their is a big imbalance. The large size tells me if they are selling or buying. Good to see that Schaeffer thinks it is bullish.

Unlike previous Chromebook versions, the Pixel is aimed at power users who fully live in the cloud. The device features an impressive array of hardware specs. It has a 12.85 inch high-density 2560×1700 screen (that’s 4.3 million pixels) with a 3:2 aspect ratio, an Intel Core i5 processor and a whopping 1 terabyte of free storage on Google Drive for three years. Google will also soon launch a version with a built-in LTE radio and has partnered with Verizon to offer 100 MB/month for two years of mobile broadband and with GoGo to offer 12 free in-flight Wi-Fi sessions. The Pixel’s screen, which is obviously the highlight of the device, features a pixel density of 239 pixels per inch. That’s a bit higher than the 220 pixels/inch on the Macbook Pro with a Retina display, so Google proudly notes that its laptop “has the highest pixel density of any laptop display.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361481872675</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 16:24:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361481897195-222</Id><Title>Heavy Volume and a significant drop doesn't look well right now...</Title><Msg>May maintain this level and lower for the next week or two, if we get to $19.50 and if I've managed to free up some funds, I'm going to grab some more...

The company disclosed the figure in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, without elaborating. The company ranked among the world’s top three notebook computer vendors in the fourth quarter of last year, cracking the top three for the first time ever, according to data from International Data Corp (IDC) yesterday. Asustek had an 11.5 percent share of the global portable PC market — defined as notebook and netbook computers — placing it third behind US-based Hewlett-Packard Co (17.1 percent) and China-based Lenovo Group Ltd (聯想, 15.9 percent), IDC said. Trailing Asustek were Acer Inc (宏碁) and Dell Inc, with market shares of 10.4 percent and 9.4 percent respectively, IDC said. Worldwide shipments of notebook and netbook PCs totaled 51.3 million units in the October-December period last year, down 1 percent from the units shipped in the previous quarter, the researcher said. Meanwhile, Quanta Computer Inc (廣達), the world’s top contract laptop maker, said in a separate filing to the stock exchange that its consolidated revenue was NT$70.2 billion last month, down 7.02 percent from the previous month and 15.63 percent from January last year.

Unusually for the relatively staid laptop marketplace, it quickly sold out upon launch on February 9th, with new orders now forecast to arrive from March 1st onwards. This is an impressive reversal of the Surface RT launch in November. Despite being available on launch day to most developed markets, and despite being around half the price of the Surface Pro ($499 upwards), the Surface RT struggled to make an impact, with estimates suggesting less than a million sold so far. To put this in context, Asus, a relative lightweight in the tablet world, sold three times as many in Q4 2012. The contrasting successes of the Surface line present an unexpected problem to Microsoft, which will necessitate a strategic shift by the company. If Microsoft fails to recognize what has occurred within the next few months, it will lose the tablet sales war for another software generation. To help the reader gauge for themselves the true scope of this problem, a quick recap of how this came about is in order. Microsoft's Strategic Choice In November 2012, Microsoft launched two operating systems: "Windows 8" and "Windows RT". The former is designed to take advantage of the x86 instruction set architecture. This market, traditionally dominated by Intel (INTC), has supplied most of the world's PCs for the last 30 years. Historically, the x86 family's chief strength could be characterized as delivering the raw power required for complex applications. Almost unnoticed at first, however, the ARM (ARMH) instruction set architecture has grown in prominence. Chances are, if you're reading this from a tablet or a smartphone, you're using it right now. Characterized by energy efficiency, this simple instruction set has become the platform of choice for vendors such as Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (BRCM), NVidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM), creating products where space is at a premium, such as the archetypal tablet. As tablet sales exploded, Microsoft had been left out in the cold. With Windows 7 unable to operate on ARM and not being designed for touch, over 97% of tablets sold in 2012 relied on non-Microsoft solutions. To establish a presence in this market, Microsoft created Windows RT, specifically designed to work in energy efficient situations. This supposedly stripped-down version of Windows 8 nevertheless requires a massive 8 GB, taking up over twice the space of iOS or Android. To show the capabilities of these two sister operating systems, Microsoft created the Surface Pro -- running Windows 8 and the light-weight Surface RT -- running Windows RT. What Microsoft Envisaged Happening Microsoft envisaged Windows 8 and Windows RT complementing one another through classic market segmentation. The full-blown W8 OS would run on advanced PCs and laptops. RT would run on tablets and small hybrid machines. This would enable Microsoft to establish a presence on tablets and create a viable 3rd ecosystem alongside Apple's iOS and Google's (GOOG) Android. Then, through having a shared marketplace (known as the Store) for W8 and RT, they would achieve economies of scale and make it a profitable venture for 3rd party app developers. This marketplace would then slowly make the existing "desktop" applications obsolete, with most new apps bought and downloaded from the "Store." Most pertinently, this Store is curated by Microsoft, which for its trouble, takes a rather generous 20-30% cut (see 5b) of any sale made. The Reality The good news for Microsoft is that W8 sales are strongly on track, with 60 million licenses sold to date. Just like its predecessors, one can predict that this will become the world's biggest operating system (though it may be under the different moniker of Windows Blue). RT sales, on the other hand, have singularly failed to take off. To give an insight into the popularity of the Surface RT, the device supposed to showcase RT's capabilities, the following Google Trends graph is illuminating: (click to enlarge) I believe this graph is a direct inverse of what Microsoft had predicted. This mistake is probably based on the very simple supply/demand principle that the lower the price, the higher the demand. One can see how the Surface RT may sell twice as much as the Surface Pro, being half the price, for example. However, this is not happening. Microsoft's poor demand forecasting system made around 1.25 million Surface RTs available at launch, but extrapolating from the small number of Surface Pros distributed to retail outlets throughout the U.S., I estimate only 50,000 units for the Surface Pros. The result was predictable. An overabundance of Surface RTs with a launch possible in many countries simultaneously (expect many of these to be discounted for sale shortly); and not enough Surface Pros for sale, despite being available only in North America. I do believe, however, this number will greatly increase over time as Microsoft's supply chain shifts production to the Surface Pro in preference to the Surface RT to tap the unmet demand. What Microsoft Needs To Do Next I believe that Windows RT is an engineering solution to a problem that didn't need solving. Microsoft strategists, in a classic piece of MBA-thinking, evaluated Intel and its low-power capabilities and compared them with the ARM chipset makers and their capabilities. One can very clearly imagine a boardroom wracked with the political intrigue Microsoft is famous for, where strategists far from Microsoft's centers of innovation agreed that this market position was static. They did not foresee that Intel is making giant strides in low-power chips, as it has fully recognized that ARM presents an existential threat and needs to be responded to. Despite hiccups along the way, one can fully expect Intel, which spends $2.5 billion on R&amp;D per quarter, to eventually catch up with ARMH, which spends 50 times less on R&amp;D. Effectively, this means, even with the most pessimistic forecasts, within two years, Intel will be able to fully compete in the tablet marketplace, negating the entire raison d'être for Windows RT. Just as importantly, Microsoft's strategists did not foresee that a Windows RT tablet, with the core capabilities of Windows removed (i.e., the capability to run desktop programs), is not a very attractive proposition at all. This unattractiveness is increasingly apparent with Samsung (SSNLF.PK) giving up on a global rollout of the Samsung Ativ RT, and Nokia apparently cancelling the launch of its Windows RT tablet entirely. I did voice my doubts in an earlier article about Nokia's (NOK) RT tablet, and I do believe it has made the right choice if it has switched to developing a tablet running the full Windows 8. With other industry leviathans voicing doubts about RT, I believe ultimately this platform must be regarded as stillborn. Microsoft's next steps are thus crucial for investors and interested observers in the stock. Windows RT was an interesting experiment, which can be considered a failure. If Microsoft persists in trying to bludgeon its way into an incredibly competitive tablet market with Windows RT, it will not succeed. It will lose money, and it will take away valuable developer time from ensuring the success of Windows 8, where Microsoft actually has demonstrated a competitive advantage through the Surface Pro. It needs to continue with spreading the usage of Windows 8 on tablets through optimizations. If Microsoft instead persists with RT development, this will call into question whether Microsoft will ever be able to out-innovate Google and Apple and stop its decade-long oscillation around the $27 stock price mark. Google especially has the brilliant ability to drop products that are not working in its annual "Spring Cleaning". This is perhaps a key reason why, as of today, Google's market capitalization has overtaken Microsoft's, and is likely to stay that way for the medium term. The ideal reaction for Microsoft then would be to quietly shift emphasis away from Windows RT. If this does occur, perhaps we really are seeing a new more determined Microsoft, which seizes opportunities when it sees them and divests itself of failures quickly. If it doesn't, expect continued share-price stagnation.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361482802813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 16:40:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361482983633-232</Id><Topic><Title>Breakout on INTC</Title><Username>plazekgregory80</Username><Timestamp>1361459871114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:17:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great , i just subscribed!</Msg><Username>ikayoya42</Username><Timestamp>1361482983633</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 16:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361483159649-233</Id><Topic><Title>OPTIONS for INTC</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361476345972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 14:52:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The HPQ announcement was a positive influence.

Achronix’ FPGAs are built on a foundry basis by Intel, as part of a major agreement announced in 2010. Intel has been offering foundry services for select customers, who are leveraging the chip giant’s 22nm finFET or tri-gate technology. Basically, Intel is providing a turnkey solution. It is providing both front- and back-end manufacturing services for the startup. Achronix’ initial device, the Speedster22i HD1000 FPGA, is a six-billion transistor, 2,600-pin FPGA. Another company, Tabula, will also have its 22nm FPGAs made on a foundry basis by Intel. With the help of Intel, Achronix has leapfrogged its bigger rivals in Altera and Xilinx in terms of process technology. The two FPGA giants have been separately shipping their respective 28nm devices, and are still developing their 20nm planar parts. Still, Achronix will arguably have a substantial lead. “At the 22nm node, I think it’s almost two years,” said Robert Blake, president and chief executive of Achronix. “It might even be three.” The gap could widen when Intel moves to 14nm by year’s end or so. “As (Intel) marches down the technology path, we will too,” Blake said. Achronix is going after the high-end, FPGA market, which was roughly a $3 billion business last year. In total, the PLD market hit $4.6 billion last year, according to the company. Shift to finFETs Over time, Achronix could turn the FPGA market upside down. For decades, chip makers have been making use of 2D planar transistors. But as a device scales, planar transistors begin to experience undesirable short-channel effects, prompting the need for 3D-like finFETs. In 2011, Intel rolled out a finFET or tri-gate structure. The chip giant has put tri-gate transistors into production for its processor designs at the 22nm node. Tri-gate transistors, according to Intel, provide up to 37% performance increase at low voltage versus Intel’s 32nm planar transistors. In Intel’s tri-gate structure, the traditional “flat” 2D planar gate is replaced with a thin 3D silicon fin that rises up vertically from the silicon substrate. Control of current is accomplished by implementing a gate on each of the three sides of the fin—two on each side and one across the top—rather than just one on top, as is the case with the 2D planar transistor, according to Intel. While Intel is shipping its finFET transistors, the company’s rivals and the foundries are playing catch-up in the arena. Unlike Intel, the foundries will extend planar transistors at 20nm, with plans to move to finFETs at 14nm. The foundries are not expected to bring up their 20nm and finFET processes in volumes until 2014 or 2015. Officials from Altera said the FPGA maker is scheduled to ship its first 20nm devices before the end of this year. So, until the foundries can ramp up their 20nm planar and 14nm-class finFET processes, Altera and Xilinx are arguably behind Intel’s foundry customers--at least in terms of process technology. In the overall FPGA market, however, Altera and Xilinx currently dominate the business in terms of share. “While Xilinx gained share in new products in 2012 overall, Altera has outgrown Xilinx at 40nm over the last three quarters,” said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates, in a recent research note. “Our view is that Altera has the edge at 40nm in 2013 and likely well into 2014.” The 28nm race is still to be determined. “With 28nm, we certainly have a race,” Mosesmann said. “Xilinx clearly has the quarterly sales momentum at this point and thus we are looking at 2H ‘14 or even 2015 before we see a clear winner. We must say that for Xilinx, 28nm is not a missed cycle, and as such Xilinx has the opportunity to reverse the 40nm trends that favor Altera in our opinion.” At the 22nm/20nm node, Achronix has the early lead. Built on Intel’s 22nm, tri-gate technology, the company’s Speedster22i devices are said to consume half the power and are half the cost of competitive parts. The specs Achronix is targeting its parts for high-end applications, such as high-end computing, networking, security, telecommunications, and test and measurement. To compete in those markets, the parts consist of a suite of hardened interface IP, including 10/40/100G Ethernet, 100Gbps Interlaken, PCI Express Gen1/2/3 and 2.133Gbps DDR3 controllers. Additionally, Achronix will leverage Intel’s vertically integrated offerings, such as wafer fabrication, device packaging, testing and production device qualification. Sunit Rikhi, vice president of the Technology &amp; Manufacturing Group and general manager of the Custom Foundry unit at Intel, said: “The delivery of the first Speedster 22i FPGAs is an important milestone in a multi-year strategic relationship with Achronix.” The Speedster22i HD1000 is the first member of the Speedster22i family. It includes over 1 million LUTs, consisting of 700,000 programmable LUTs and 300,000 LUTs of additional functionality provided by the fixed-function hardened IP. The device also integrates 86Mbits of RAM, 960 programmable IO and 64 lanes of 12.75Gbps SerDes. The Speedster22i HD1000 development kit includes a PCI-express form-factor, HD1000 development board, ACE software, programming pod and power supply. Engineering samples are available. The HD1000 development board is available for purchase at a price of $13,000, including ACE development software. The next device, Speedster22i HD680P, is currently supported in ACE and will be available in Q2 2013. The HD680P has 660,000 LUTs. Meanwhile, the HD1500 is the largest member of the Speedster22i family and will include 28Gbps SerDes. With 1.725 million LUTs, the HD1500 will be available at the end 2013. In the first quarter of 2014, the company will ship the HD210, a device with 265,000 LUTs.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1361489692076</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 18:34:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361489804298-250</Id><Topic><Title>OPTIONS for INTC</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361476345972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 14:52:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No need to check the options this will re-test the lows.

A Pixel model featuring built-in connectivity to Verizon mobile Internet service will hit the market in April at a price of $1,449, according to Google. The version available Thursday allowed connections to the Internet with wireless hot-spot technology or cables. “It’s a great looking product,” Om Malik of technology news website GigaOm said at the Pixel debut in San Francisco. “But Google is facing a selling problem, they have to compete on price originally and build a developer base for a high-end product.” Google hoped people look beyond comparing Pixel prices with competitors such as MacBooks or laptops built on Windows 8 software to see the value the touch-screen and the massive terabyte of Google Drive online data storage included. “It is clear that touch is here to stay and that it is the future,” Pichai said. “I am sure every laptop will have touch in the future.” He described the Pixel screen resolution as superior to that on any laptop being shipped today, including Apple’s premium MacBook models. Google also set out to remedy a complaint by Chrome notebook users frustrated when trying to work with documents or spreadsheets made with Microsoft’s widely-used Word or Excel software. Within three months, Google will release Quickoffice software for handling those types of files, according to Pichai. The announcement adds a new dimension to the rivalry between the two tech giants, which are in a fierce battle over smartphones and tablets.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361493939367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 19:45:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361494205410-256</Id><Topic><Title>Achronix ships 22nm, finFET FPGAs</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1361489692076</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 18:34:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"With the help of Intel, Achronix has leapfrogged its bigger rivals in Altera and Xilinx in terms of process technology.
