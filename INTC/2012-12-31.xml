TXN is down for mobile processors. Qualcomm is next. Not much left for ARM camp after Qualcomm eats the dust. This is from a recent article and it does make sense. It seems like the war between semiconductor manufacturers is never ending. PC sales have been declining, which has made it essential for companies like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and AMD (NYSE: AMD) to innovate and branch out. This year both AMD and Intel launched their Trinity APUs and Ivybridge processors, respectively. Trinity APUs offers integrated graphics performance at par with mid-range GPUs. Intel’s revolutionary 22nm manufacturing process, showcased in its Ivybridge line-up further boosted its performance/clock, with up to 50% ramp up in graphical performance. According to scores of benchmarks, it’s clear that AMDs Trinity loses out to Ivybridge CPUs in terms of raw processing power, but offers higher graphical performance. However in this battle, there were a few casualties: mid-range GPUs from AMD and NVidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). However, despite having better integrated graphics, AMD has failed to attract consumers, as its targeted consumers are cost and performance conscious. Even the highest Trinity APU offerings can’t compete with Intel’s most basic i3, and consumers feel left out on processing power. It is due to this reason that 2012 has been a good year for Intel. Additionally I believe that Intel’s technological advantage will continue in 2013, as the company is due to release its Haswell range of CPUs mid-year. According to recent announcements, Haswell series CPUs will deliver up to twice the graphical performance as compared to its Ivybridge series. This would give Intel a serious advantage over AMDs iGFX, and would further cause problems for NVidia. 3-4 years ago, dedicated graphics were required to support the most basic PC operations, but with integrated graphics getting more power, only gaming enthusiasts would feel the need for dedicated graphic cards. To further bolster its growth, Intel also released its Medfield processors, to compete with Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon and NVidia’s Tegra 3 offerings. Though its mature rivals beat Intel’s processors in terms of performance, Medfield somehow manages to win the “performance per $” battle. Additionally, Intel plans to launch its Merrifield range of processors in 2013, to succeed Medfield processors. Merrifield processors would enjoy Intel’s revolutionary 22nm manufacturing process with trigate technology, and going by the success of Ivybridge series, significant ramp ups in graphical and processing capabilities can be safely expected. A new entrant in mobile processor market would further strain NVidia’s market share. However it’s the Broadwell range that seems to be interesting. Several reports have popped up recently indicating that the Broadwell range would be Intel’s first line of non-replaceable CPUs. According to tech reports, Broadwell would have locked features, and users will have the option to unlock them with a software patch by paying extra. This would ease out the upgradability procedure and also generate better margins for Intel. Additionally Broadwell is expected to boast a 14nm manufacturing process which would be 36% thinner than current Ivybridge series and 50% thinner than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 series. If Intel decides to port the 14nm manufacturing process in its range of mobile processors, it would get a serious performance advantage over Qualcomm’s upcoming “Prime” and NVidia’s upcoming “Tegra 4” processors. No doubt that the mobile chip market competition is heating up, and according to Intel’s roadmap, the company seems to be well on track to take on the competition. Intel has been the king of desktop/laptop processors, and it would be unwise to think that this beast would remain overshadowed by its peers for long.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1356954494222</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 06:48:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356955532732-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel on Track for 5nm Process</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356302099613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:34:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never thought of that, but it makes sense.

Claiming an unnamed source in the video distribution industry, the rumor suggests a plan to deliver a set-top box with DVR, rolled out on a city-by-city basis as it negotiates channel agreements. Despite a number of demos through the years, the Intel-powered TV boxes that have landed in our living rooms so far have been the first gen Google TV and Boxee Box units. Both struggled to make a significant impact and switched to ARM CPUs for the second generation of their products. Based on some of the tech demos we've seen and earlier rumors, Intel's plans could include using facial recognition to personalize the experience for (and target advertising towards) different viewers, and offering smaller, cheaper bundles of channels than traditional providers. Another element from the TechCrunch post indicates a plan to provide a Catch Up TV-style service that lets users view anything that has aired in the last month on the channels they're subscribed to, although there's no word on what will power this technology. Intel's participation in Comcast's Reference Design Kit program is also referenced, although given Big Cable's traditional reluctance regarding alternative delivery models, any sort of tie-in here seems like a long shot to us. A combo package of pay-TV channels and internet VOD has been tried before, although Sezmi's antenna-connected solution failed to catch on and fizzled late last year. Like recently rekindled Apple HDTV rumors, the potential of Intel's service may rely just as much on its success negotiating with content providers as any technology it's cooked up. Check out the rest of the rumor at the source link and a video from Intel's 2009 IDF demo after the break, we'll have any official announcements as they happen from the press conference January 7th.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356962181971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 08:56:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356962377797-19</Id><Topic><Title>Intel rumored to launch set-top box, 'virtual cable TV service' at CES</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356962181971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 08:56:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot of people hate cable.

The first offering really doomed the platform for a little while, and while Logitech’s name was plastered on the side of the Revue, most of the time the finger of blame is pointed at Intel for the lackluster performance the box offered. To accompany Intel’s push into Android land, the company looks to succeed where everyone else has failed by releasing a superior set top box. The biggest problem set top boxes have right now is the disconnect between service provider and television. Not since the TiVO has anyone really been successful in creating a gap between the provider and the TV, but that is where the sweet spot lies in the US. To circumvent this, cable cutters have adopted streaming boxes to try and cut the provider out of the equation altogether. As a result, services like Hulu Plus were depricated to force users into a subscription and limit certain shows to web only. While Netflix and Hulu are attempting to drum up original content to provide an additional reason to switch to the platform, there’s still plenty of hoops to jump through if you want to attract the users who are still paying for television. Intel’s set top box plans include a city by city rollout in which users will be able to select individual channels or bundles of channels that they will pay for, instead of the current solution being offered by cable providers. Additional details on this are expected to be made clear during the Intel event at the Consumer Electronic Show in January. The service looks to offer a solution for everyone by coupling benefits for TV subscribers as well as streaming only users. In addition, Intel plans to offer an On-Demand style DVR for primetime television that was broadcasted within the last 30 days, making it possible for users to recall a show without needing to set up a DVR recording. This functionality has been seen with services like the Dish Network Hopper boxes, only this service doesn’t plan to record all of these shows and store them locally. Given Intel’s relationship with Google and Android right now, it seems likely that Google TV will play a big part in this service, unless Intel has decided that they would be better off with their own software. Considering the work Intel has put into their line of mobile friendly processors and their current support for Android, it would be much easier for Intel to rely on Google TV to offer much of the background functionality that is needed for a successful set top box of this nature. Whether or not Intel has what it takes to make an attractive Google TV and be able to successfully market it to users is another matter altogether.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356962571721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 09:02:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356962692926-21</Id><Title>Broadwell will be the shovel Intel uses to bury Qualcom and the rest</Title><Msg>However it’s the Broadwell range that seems to be interesting.

Wells Fargo raised estimates, reiterated it as a top pick and said the company has many strengths heading into 2013. Wells Fargo analyst David Wong said secular themes like cloud computing and data traffic created by mobile computing could drive x86 server-related processor growth in the mid-teens percentage range over the next several years. "In our view, Intel's Atom platform provides opportunity to gain share in the smartphone and tablet markets. Intel typically leads other advanced logic manufacturers by 1-3 years in linewidth transitions," the analyst said. On the stock, Wong notes at forward P/E of 10-11x, the multiple remains suppressed despite record margins. Also, Intel has one of the highest dividend yields paid by chip companies, with a yield of above 4% currently. The firm raised its 2013 EPS estimate to $2.10 from a prior $2.02 The firm maintained their Buy rating and valuation range of $28-$33 on Intel.

Intel's set-top sounds to me is like it goes a couple of steps above Apple's iTV and other streaming devices. 1) it offers streaming services such as Netflix, hulu. And it probably has movie rental service as well. However it goes a couple of steps above this: 2) Allows customer to pick which TV channels they want rather than the bundle packages offered by cable providers. This make sense because most people don't even touch half the channels that are in some of those bundles. 3) offer cloud-based DVR; so you don't even have to remember to set the recordings or take up local hard drive space. It sounds interesting and we should learn more about it at CES.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356975277749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 12:34:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356976516767-39</Id><Topic><Title>To prove to all that I control the share price I will not let go over 20.45 today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1356974873032</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 12:27:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really ?

Washington – As Americans brace for across-the-board tax hikes, President Obama is giving members of Congress -- and his No. 2 -- a pay raise. Obama signed an executive order last week that will lift a ban on pay freezes for federal employees. So who benefits? Vice President Biden, for starters. According to disclosure forms, Biden made $225,521 last year. After his raise which goes into effect March 27, 2013, he’ll be taking home $231,900. Rank-and-file members of Congress, meanwhile, will see a $900 bump -- up from $174,000. Congressional leaders will receive a slightly higher raise, with the House speaker receiving a $1,100 salary increase to $224,600. The top two Senate leaders will see pay rise $1,000, to $194,400. They aren’t the only ones who will see a bump in their paycheck. Obama also OK’d raises for circuit and district court judges. Some have questioned why the president would give Congress a pat on the back at a time when neither Republicans nor Democrats have been able to come to a compromise on how to head off $600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will kick in Jan. 1, which could possibly drag the U.S. economy into another recession.

On the server front, revenue and gross margin are going up and up, for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) combined, helped by the flood of mobile devices and the consequent rise in cloud computing, writes Wong: We think secular themes such as cloud computing and data traffic created by mobile computing (notebooks, tablets and smartphones) could drive x86 server-related processor growth in the mid-teens percentage range over the next several years […] the server processor market has grown from below $2 billion in 2002 to a run rate of the order of $10 billion a year in 2012 […] Intel’s server processor revenue growth was 7% for the three quarters of 2012 reported so far, though [sic] September 2012, compared to the company’s total revenues being down 1%. Intel’s server division benefits from the growth of smartphones and tablets. Intel has suggested in the past that 122 tablets generate enough data traffic to occupy 1 server, and 600 smartphone generate a similar amount of traffic. Gartner numbers suggest that about 170 million smartphones shipped in the September 2012 quarter, we estimate that for the full year 2012 more than 650 million smartphone might ship. Similarly with Apple (AAPL) reporting about 43 million iPad shipments in total for the first three quarter of 2012, ongoing growth of Android based tablets and the recent launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT tablets, Gartner estimates that worldwide tablet shipments in 2012 could be of the order of 110 million. Assuming about $1,000 of Intel content per server, these numbers imply that smartphone and tablet sales in 2012 alone could drive up to $2 billion of future Intel server chip revenue, though this number should perhaps be discounted somewhat to allow for some of these sales being replacement devices.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356983370234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:49:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356983445652-63</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Wells Pounds Table on Server, Mobile Prospects</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356983370234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:49:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wong also notes that the “Data Center Group” at Intel, which makes the server microprocessors, and which is currently 20% of revenue, has an outsized affect on Intel’s overall profit, which he illustrates in the following slide: WellsIntelDataCenterProfitDec2012 Wong also thinks investors are too negative about Intel’s prospects in mobile computing. For the last three year’s, Intel’s revenue from “client” devices — personal computers, mostly — has outperformed the rate of growth of the total integrated circuit field, he notes, up until the September quarter, when it fell below. Still, The weakness Intel saw for the September 2012 quarter results in year-over-year comparisons for Client Segment revenues (and total Intel revenues) that were only a little worse than global IC sales in terms of year-over-year growth. From a sequential point of view, a 1% sequential decline for Client Segment was to the lower end of the range for most chip companies (many of which were up slightly on a sequential basis) but conversely Intel’s December 2012 quarter guidance midpoint for 1% sequential growth overall is several percent better than most chip companies which have guided for sales to decline sequentially by several percent. Wong acknowledges the concerns of investors that tablets and smartphones are going to harm notebook and desktop sales. However, he notes that sales of personal computers ultimately bounced back after a brief period in 2008 and 2009 of being harmed by low-cost netbooks. Today’s tablets, he thinks, don’t have the processing power to displace netbooks: In our view, most tablets currently available on the market do not have sufficient computing capability to replace notebooks. However, there is a class of devices which we view as essentially notebooks put into a tablet form factor, which arguably could capture some customers that might otherwise buy traditional notebooks. For example, the Microsoft Surface Pro tablet uses an Intel notebook processor (an Intel Ivy Bridge chip rather than an Intel Atom chip) and in general has the components, the price and the capability of a notebook. Given these various data points and considerations, in our view the PC chip segment in general has future secular growth potential that will probably be comparable to overall semiconductor growth.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356983445652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:50:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356983494350-64</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Wells Pounds Table on Server, Mobile Prospects</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356983370234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:49:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lastly, Wong thinks Intel will capitalize on the weakness of those current phone and tablet processor offerings from competitors with a superior roadmap for its mobile “Atom” chips: We expect, as Intel builds out its smartphone product offerings to include dual core chips, LTE modem support and chips with integrated modems, its presence in the smartphone space will grow. We also expect that Intel will re-engage in the Android tablet market in 2013 with higher performance chips. Figure 9 shows how the transition to 22nm and an “out-of- order” architecture (and possibly additional processing cores) might contribute to an approximately 3x increase in CPU performance.

When you repeat that mistake, others might think you are an uneducated twerp. If you meant--I could care less. I would then ask you--How much less could you care? Do not say that in front of your boss. He WILL judge you. When one says--I could care less--it might mean in fact that they care at least a little about it. I think you wanted to say you could not care less about it. But about you post. You are right on the mark. We are all so so sick of this nonsense. Just here to help. I was not putting you down.
