My words but a whisper your deafness a SHOUT. I may make you feel but I can't make you think. Your sperm's in the gutter your love's in the sink. So you ride yourselves over the fields and you make all your animal deals and your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick. And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away in the tidal destruction the moral melee. The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers the newfangled way. But your new shoes are worn at the heels and your suntan does rapidly peel and your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick. And the love that I feel is so far away: I'm a bad dream that I just had today and you shake your head and say it's a shame. Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.

The author seems to have a medium level knowledge of HFT and his writing should be taken as only part of the picture. He did not know that exchanges pay the HFT a rebate for trades to lure the liquidity. That is an important part of the picture. The video he cites as a JNJ video is titled MRK video. Just a minor error but is one clue of the care he takes. There are several other similar NANEX videos on Youtube. I really like colorful displays like these. 4th of July reminders. AUTHOR FROM COMMENTS SECTION: "Thanks for that insight! I didn't know that HFT firms were rebated for their flow. That makes a whole lot of sense as to why they trade so much and are so consistently profitable. Thanks again, Elliott " In my limited reading on HFT, there was also an issue of the HFT being able to see the trade books. If he can see the trade books, he can get more information about the state of the market. If the HFT firms are getting rebates on both sides of the trade, they can buy and sell in the middle and they can see SELL or BUY orders piling up. If they see a LIMIT ORDER that is converted to a MARKET ORDER when the price drops, they can pressure the price into that limit order by shorting and then cover their shorts from the lower prices. IMO, being able to view the order book is a key part of the equation. HFT does provide liquidity but at some level of risk. thanks</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1369575475429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 09:37:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369577990781-16</Id><Topic><Title>Wheeeeeeeeeeeee</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1368923690933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 20:34:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another highly mature, high content post from WheeeeeeeeeeWEAVER.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1369577990781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:19:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369579561395-17</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver appreciation thread</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369559524749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 05:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you 2 have lost most everyone that listened to you a lot of money. and now you are in a mutual admiration society !

With the exception of the DJ Utility index all the major averages remained well above their respective 50-day moving averages, which is a positive and keeps the major trend intact. Increased volatility is probably back as investors try to interpret the Fed speak and what taking away Bernanke's backstop could do for the market. There continues to be a swarm of investors that are waiting to get in to this market at lower prices which should limit the downside. Although stronger economic data could hasten the tapering of QE, the trick remains how to exit the arena and leave stocks standing on their own two feet.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369593809253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 14:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369596111020-42</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver appreciation thread</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369559524749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 05:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wdblawgrow, Appreciate the kind words.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369596111020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:21:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369597840351-43</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver appreciation thread</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369559524749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 05:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least AE, Alex and WW garner enough respect for some people to read their comments and see what they have to say.

Everyone has tried everthing (nothing has worked) to get rid of you and we all dream of your hopefully soon demise. You are despised beyond words.

I listened to their entire 2 hour+ presentation and came away thoroughly impressed that their design capability is very, very credible, and they do have a way to catch up to Intel's process advantage. So, imo, it was not a disaster at all, instead, their recent stock price performance is just a normal correction somewhat amplified by the turmoil in the markets......for which we have to blame Bernanke.</Msg><Username>alpine_climber</Username><Timestamp>1369597896670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:51:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369598294927-45</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver appreciation thread</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369559524749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 05:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They sure have helped me.

Though the real issue here for the short sellers is how liquid is intel's float. My guess is that only 20% of the float is generally in play at any given time, about 1 billion shares. The rest (80%) being held by long and dividend seeking investors. Not to mention intels own buy back. So lately the average volume has been dropping dramatically. My guess is that most of the short position is at about $22, margin calls wont start come into play unless intel rises above $25.

It started climbing over a year ago but I cannot find more than 1 year history. I think the average price of shorts is a little higher than $22 but that would be just my impression. Intel contracts with a company to do their buy backs. Read about the Lehman Bros lawsuit against Intel to see an example of their instructions. Intel contract buys based on average volume and price over a period of time. Options are likely an easy exit. There are a million combinations. The excess short is about 150mil shares. The remaining shorts are probably part of the INVERSE ETF like SOXS, QLD, SDS, ... Value investors? The funny thing is that conservative funds in their search for yield are one of the major sources of shares to loan for shorting. It will be interesting to watch. I watched the shorts load up but I don't think there will be a squeeze.

I do have some thoughts about the culture of posting on Yahoo. 1.) Everyone has a right to their opinion and to post it up unless it is obscene or abusive. Or unless it constitutes bullying, harassment or stalking. Apparently Yahoo pretty much agrees with this. You are also not allowed to use the boards for commercial promotion. 2.) No one has a right to credibility. Credibility has to be earned. Many posters think that their opinion is credible simply because it is their opinion. It's almost never the case. 3.) Some posters believe it is their god-given right to be the board moderator. It's not. 4.) Some posters engage in nothing other than content-free posting. It is difficult to believe that these posters are anything other than paid shills of an Intel competitor, mentally incompetent, or psychologically incompetent. 5.) Credibility is earned by informative posts, stated in a lucid manner with supporting facts, logic and thoughtfulness. Credibility is enhanced by good written expression and an advanced sense of humor. 6.) The use of multiple IDs rarely does anything but destroy credibility. Why Yahoo allows it is a mystery to me. People with nothing to hide don't need multiple IDs. People with hidden agendas do need multiple IDs. 7.) Talking smack is an art. It needs to be informative and funny and well-written in order to be well-received. Those who think an angry, bile-fueled post is effective smack are totally and completely wrong. It just points out that they are too incompetent to effectively talk smack and that they shouldn't bother. Bad smack erodes credibility. 8.) Anger is not an argument. Just because a poster is angry it doesn't mean that he or she has an effective rebuttal to whatever is causing the anger. 9.) Calling people names is not an argument. It is unfortunately the only kind of post some people are capable of. 10.) It's not about the past - it's about the future.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369619494168</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 21:51:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369619980285-55</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver appreciation thread</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369559524749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 05:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Love your posts Wallis!
