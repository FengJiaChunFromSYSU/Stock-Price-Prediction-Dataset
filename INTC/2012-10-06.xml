That makes A6 1.4X fastener. A6 possibly has 1.5X more transistors. Since I donâ€™t know exactly, assume 1.3X. Another 1.3X speed. 32nm enables A6 to run at 1.6X clock speed. Another 1.6X bump Total speed bump =1.4*1.3*1.6 = 2.9 ------ Shrinks by themselves do not increase the speed of a processor. More transistors in the SoC do not increase the speed of the processor unless the transistors have been spent on the CPU. The A6 runs at 1Ghz while the A5 @ runs at 800 mhz. The A6 has around double the raw performance of the A5. This increase in performance is due to the new architecture, increased clock speed and a better memory interface. As for the rest of the ARM camp, the A15 can deliver this kind of performance (depending who/what you read, it will be faster) but the real question over the A15 is it's size (transistors) and power consumption. There is still a lot of leg room in the existing A9, with improved process tweaks (even at 40nm) meaning higher clocks for the same power envelopes, improvements to memory bandwidth etc</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1349507754423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 03:15:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349512196663-2</Id><Topic><Title>TIRED OF OBAMA?

Android races past Apple in smartphone market share By Julianne Pepitone @CNNMoneyTech August 9, 2012: 10:03 AM ET Android and iOS made up 85% of smartphone market share last quarter, according to an IDC report. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The mobile space has quickly become a two-horse race between Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) and Apple -- and one of those giants significantly widened its lead last quarter. Google's Android surged to a whopping 68% share of the global smartphone market last quarter. That's four times the 17% market share held by Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500), according to a Wednesday report from research firm IDC. IDC, which tracks smartphone market share by operating system, said that nearly 105 million Android phones were shipped in the second quarter -- more than double the number shipped at the same time last year. Apple also showed strong growth, with an almost 28% gain over the previous year to 26 million phones shipped. "Android continues to fire on all cylinders," IDC senior research analyst Ramon Llamas said in the report, citing good prices and new phone models from Android's hardware partners as growth catalysts. More specifically, IDC pegged Android's gain "directly" to Samsung, which represented 44% of all Android phones shipped during the quarter. That's more than the next seven Android vendors combined, IDC said. Samsung's Galaxy S III debuted late in the quarter to favorable reviews. Apple and Samsung are currently locked in a heated court battle over Apple's allegations that Samsung illegally copied its iPhone design. Apple's iOS momentum was slowed this quarter by rumors that the iPhone 5 will be released in September. The iPhone 4S has been on the market since last October, so IDC said sales have "cooled." Meanwhile, Android and iOS's combined 85% market share didn't leave much room for competitors. Shipments of BlackBerry phones from Research in Motion (RIMM) fell a staggering 41% over the year to 7.4 million. That represented less than 5% of the market -- the lowest level since 2009, IDC said. It will be tough for RIM to improve its position this year, as the company said in June that its BlackBerry 10 operating system is delayed again until 2013. The once-popular Symbian operating system from Nokia (NOK) "sunk to a new nadir last quarter," IDC said, with shipments falling more than 60% over the year. Symbian now represents only 4.4% of the global market. Microsoft's Windows and the open-source Linux rounded out the last 6% of the market.

Shortly after I returned home from the show I heard an interesting comparison: Intel detailed quite a bit about an architecture that wouldn't be shipping for another 9 months, while Apple wouldn't say a thing about an SoC that was shipping in a week. That's probably an extreme comparison given that Apple has no motivation to share details about A6 (yet), but even if you compare Intel's openness at IDF to the rest of the chip makers we cover - there's a striking contrast. We'll always want more from Intel at IDF, but I do hope that we won't see a retreat as the rest of the industry seems to be ok with non-disclosure as standard practice.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349539156082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 11:59:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349539460750-19</Id><Title>As a Platform, Haswell Looks Awesome</Title><Msg>As a platform, Haswell looks awesome. While the standard Haswell parts won't drive platform power down considerably, the new Haswell U/ULT parts will. Intel is promising a greater than 20x reduction in platform idle power and it's planning on delivering it by focusing its power reduction efforts beyond Intel manufactured components. Haswell Ultrabooks and tablets will have Intel's influence in many (most?) of the components placed on the motherboard. And honestly, this is something Intel (or one of its OEMs) should have done long ago. Driving down platform power is a problem that extends beyond the CPU or chipset, and it's one that requires a holistic solution. With Haswell, Intel appears committed to delivering that solution. It's not for purely altruistic reasons, but for the survival of the PC. I remember talking to Vivek about an iPad as a notebook replacement piece he was doing a while back. The biggest advantage the iPad offered over a notebook in his eyes? Battery life. Even for light workloads today's most power efficient ultraportable notebooks can't touch a good ARM based tablet. Haswell U/ULT's significant reduction in platform power is intended to fix that. I don't know that we'll get to 10+ hours of battery life on a single charge, but we should be much better off than we are today. Connected standby is coming to PCs and it's a truly necessary addition. Haswell's support of active idle states (S0ix) is a game changer for the way portable PCs work. The bigger concern is whether or not the OEMs and ISVs will do their best to really take advantage of what Haswell offers. I know one will, but will the rest? Intel's increasingly hands on approach to OEM relations seems to be its way of ensuring we'll see Haswell live up to its potential. Haswell, on paper, appears to do everything Intel needs to evolve the mobile PC platform. What's unclear is how far down the TDP stack Intel will be able to take the architecture. Intel seems to believe that TDPs below 8W are attainable, but it's too early to tell just how low Haswell can go. It's more than likely that Intel knows and just doesn't want to share at this point. I don't believe we'll see fanless Haswell designs, but Broadwell is another story entirely. There's no diagram for where we go from here. Intel originally claimed that Atom would service an expanded range of TDPs all the way up to 10W. With Core architectures dipping below 10W, I do wonder if that slide was a bit of misdirection. I wonder if, instead, the real goal is to drive Core well into Atom territory. If Intel wants to solve its ARM problem, that would appear to be a very good solution.

If you cannot detect the syntactic and semantic differences in the sentences, you are really not paying attention. Negotiating is "begging"? No wonder Romney is doing so well with followers who only hear what they want. I have complete confidence in him and his minions to return to his pattern. The Yahoo "default rating filter" is gone, not the 1-star (think about it). Thumbs up is 5-star. Thumbs down is 1-star. You just get to see all the 1-star (thumbs down) rated messages, including the commerical spam. The winners are the spammers that Yahoo wanted to "eliminate". There are some who do not want to be "real men". Like women. The "real men" you are describing are ... ugh ..... in the words of the board bully ....

This portends a lot of things for 2013 as LTE is solved and the first razr's buzz American shores...I would think. Second, there's direct purchase of server chips by Goog from INTC, cutting out middlemen such as HP and Dell...could it be there's a ginormous disconnect developing whereby the "PC is dead" chant misses the whole point? Could it be that HP and Dell are walking dead while INTC and Goog snuggle up cozy in bed and walk away with all the spoils, like Kathleen Turner in "body heat"??? Can anyone give more info than what we freely glean off Google on this? I think they are trying to fly below radar as long as possible..Are there hints that AAPL-ARM etal are soon to have their gooses cooked by the Google-INTC axis???? I know more than I can say, but suspect there are others out there who are free to comment....let's get it on the table.

Arm has always thought that Intel maybe faster but Arm would always have the efficiency advantage and that was more important. THESE REVIEWS SHOW A SINGLE CORE 32MM MEDIFIELD IS AS POWERFULL AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN A DUAL CORE 28 MM SNAPDRAGON. If this holds true, what will Arm have to offer when Intel moves to 22mm next year and 14mm the next.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1349567850983</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 19:57:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349568097571-59</Id><Title>Reminds Me of People on this Board</Title><Msg>Arkansas Republicans tried to distance themselves Saturday from a Republican state representative's assertion that slavery was a "blessing in disguise" and a Republican state House candidate who advocates deporting all Muslims.

The processors are not pushing higher processor speeds but going to multiple cores so that the operating system runs faster from threading of the instructions to the multiple processors. But see, an ARM tablet is mostly for just connecting to websites. And an application on an ARM tablet is often just a connection to a website. But here are my questions. Will the consumer connect to their financial account websites while using their ARM tablet on a WiFi network ?

It takes Fox News reenactments and Fox News modifications to video/audio tapes to decern the Obama lies. Romney? His lies are so obvious that people walk right by them. When Romney attributed a McCain statement, quoted by Obama TO Obama and publicly said he knew of the lie, I understood at that moment, there is nothing you can believe that comes from Romney lips. You can predict the position he will take on any issue by the audience he is addressing. You are just not tired of the Romney lies yet. They are new and different lies. You are not going to benefit from a Romney election (unless you are a multimillionare posting on a message board). Your friends are not going to benefit because you have no multimillionare friends. Your family is not going to benefit because they are not multimillionares either. If you are from the South, your state will see a reduction in Federal spending that will be far greater than you state federal contribution. Fewer dollars in the south to support both large and small businesses. More poverty to put pressure on charitable NGO's. Of course businuesses will floursih there. Without a minimum wage, they can pay what ever they want. Without unions and all those bothersome regulations, they won't have to bother with benefit packages, safety, .... unless they decide to bother. I defend, your right to vote for Romney (and I have really done so). Please do what you believe is right. Romney has changed positions so many times on so many issues, that I don't know what his position is on anything. He is a MUPPET who wants to be president and noone really knows who has there hand up his back.</Msg><Username>dumpwad</Username><Timestamp>1349571584544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 20:59:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349572947404-66</Id><Topic><Title>Reminds Me of People on this Board</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349568097571</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 20:01:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>John Edwards was a pathetic man who happened to be a liberal Democrat. If you piled up all the Demorats and Republicans exhibiting this behavior, the piles would be about equal. I thought that Republicans strongly supported the Constitution. They should distance themselves from this anti-Constitutional rhetoric if they support the Constitution more than the person saying these things. The House candidate Charlie Fuqua "deporting all Muslims" comment is a dagger at the heart of the 1st Amendment. The 1st Amendment does not say free speech is OK "as long as they agree with me". I am not sure what an unfaithful husband has to do with disparging the consititution. The Edwards act of adultry was denounced by everyone. The anti-Constitution quotes are just statements personal beliefs which should be criticized by those who belive and support the consitution.
