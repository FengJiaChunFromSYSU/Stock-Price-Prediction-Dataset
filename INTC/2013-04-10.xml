Intel talks next chip</Title><Msg>Will Windows 8.1 get a lift from quad-core tablets? It looks likely. Intel discussed the next-generation "Bay Trail" tablet processor today at its annual conference in Beijing. Expect to see a new crop of faster yet still power-efficient Windows 8 -- and likely Windows 8.1 -- tablets later this year. An "entirely new Atom microarchitecture...will [enable] the most powerful Atom processor to-date, doubling the computing performance of Intel's current-generation tablet offering," Tan Weng Kuan, vice president and general manager of the Mobile Communications Group, Intel China, said today at IDF Beijing. Bay Trail will allow designs "as thin as 8mm (0.3 inches) that have all-day battery life and weeks of standby," Tan said. Maybe most importantly, Bay Trail will pack four redesigned Atom processor cores that get closer to mainstream Intel processors in performance. Some of that extra horsepower comes courtesy of an out of order design (like current Core processors) and Intel HD 4000 graphics. Related stories Intel's next-gen 'Haswell' chip now shipping to PC makers Bay Trail -- and the Avoton server chip -- represent the first redesign of the Atom microarchitecture since it debuted in 2008. And like Ivy Bridge processors found in laptops today, Bay Trail will use Intel's 22-nanometer manufacturing process and 3D transistor tech. So, what can we expect on the tablet front? New product lines from the likes of Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. And enticing product updates like HP's Envy x2. That design, which has been generally well-received, would get a nice boost from a quad-core Bay Trail and HD 4000 graphics. Lenovo's Thinkpad Tablet 2 is a candidate for an update too. The next Atom is expected to appear in tablets for the 2013 holiday season, according to Tan.

Intel officials say the giant chip maker will play a significant role in the way future data center infrastructures are built, operated and managed. That role will still include processors—the chip giant has an aggressive launch schedule for chips for data center systems in 2013 that include new Atom and Xeon processors—but also will increasingly move into how the servers themselves are designed. During her keynote speech April 9 at the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing, Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Datacenter and Connected Systems Group, outlined the chip maker’s vision of systems that not only are powered by Intel processors, but also are designed and built using Intel technology, ranging from networking to storage. During a recent briefing with reporters to outline Intel vision, Lisa Graff, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Datacenter Marketing Group, said Intel is working on reference designs for “a rack-scale architecture” and already is working with some top-tier Chinese Web companies and telecommunications vendors in what is called Project Scorpio, aimed at building server racks that share components like power, cooling and networking. For the reference architectures that will start rolling out next year, Graff said Intel was engaging in similar collaboration. "We're working with end users, OEMs, and ISVs to drive common standards in a reference architecture," she said, adding what Intel will offer will be something organizations can build upon. “Our reference architecture isn’t a recipe. … Others can use what they want; they can pick and choose.” From eWeek</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365569996977</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 00:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365570112755-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Talks Server Design, Atom, Xeon Chips at IDF Beijing</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365569996977</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 00:59:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Graff noted that that the changing demands for bandwidth, processing power, energy efficiency and storage—brought on by such trends as cloud computing, big data, increased services and more mobile computing devices hitting the network—are driving the need for new architectures in the data center. Her comments echoed a key theme that was talked about April 8, when Hewlett-Packard unveiled the first of its ultra-dense, highly-efficient Project Moonshot servers: The demands in the data center are changing, and the infrastructure within the data centers will have to change along with it. Intel over the past several years has aggressively been building its capabilities in several areas beyond its traditional processor technologies, including networking, storage, security and software. The company has been bringing many of those capabilities onto the silicon, but also will use them in helping create a fabric for the data center. For example, in February, Intel released its own Hadoop distribution for big data environments. The Intel Hadoop offering has been used by several companies in China by carrier China Mobile and traffic management company Bocom. Intel officials want to bring the idea of balanced systems from the servers to the racks to create groupings of servers, storage and networking products that are more modular, efficient and dense. That’s already happening to some extent, with non-essential sheet metal taken out of the racks and components such as fans and power supplies taken from servers and put into the rack, where they are shared by all servers, Graff said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365570112755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 01:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365570283178-4</Id><Title>Project Scorpio</Title><Msg>Project Scorpio—which involves Chinese companies Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and China Telecom—is an illustration of what Intel is talking about, Graff said. Intel in 2013 also will roll out new processors for data center systems designed to bring greater performance, power efficiency, I/O capabilities and security features, according to Graff. The most aggressive roadmap is with the low-power Atom system-on-a-chip (SoC) platform, including the upcoming “Avoton” and “Rangeley” chips. Avoton will be the second-generation Atom—after “Centerton,” released in December 2012—for ultra low-power microservers, including HP’s Moonshot systems. The 22-nanometer chips are sampling now and will be released in the second half of 2013. The microserver segment is one of several arenas in the increasingly intense competition between Intel and ARM. HP will use chips from Intel as well as ARM partners—such as Calxeda and Marvell Technologies—in their Moonshot systems, with officials saying the use of multiple chip architectures is a key part of creating their “software-defined servers.” From eWeek</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365570283178</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 01:04:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365570780474-5</Id><Title>IDF Beijing: Big Data</Title><Msg>Big Data According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, the annual global datacenter traffic will reach 6.6 zettabytes by the end of 2016, and global IP traffic will reach 554 exabytes per month. Putting this number in perspective, experts believe mankind has created 5 exabytes of information since the dawn of civilization until 2003. Intel is at the intersection of the forces driving the explosion of data, such as the increase of mobile devices generating Web-scale data, the growth of high-performance computation and a growing range of sensors and embedded devices that collect data from automobiles, digital signs and more. To help organizations draw new insights from data, Intel recently announced its Intel Distribution for Apache Hadoop* software that delivers optimizations to performance and security, to help more organizations and people take advantage of the vast amounts of data being generated. Intel’s Hadoop efforts originated in China. Improving Safety, Reducing Congestion: Bocom, a leading supplier of traffic management solutions, is collaborating with Intel to transform its end-to-end solution from point video capture to a big data analytics solution. Using Intel Xeon, Bocom can extract data from video and send that information to an Intel-based Hadoop cluster for distributed storage and analytics. Individuals can use this information to streamline their traffic plans, while urban planners can prioritize capital investments and better allocate public safety resources. Real-Time Call Data: With China’s huge population, and the high rate of calls and SMS messages, China Mobile was challenged with offering accurate, timely billing and usage information to subscribers. Using Intel Distribution for Hadoop, China Mobile was able to ensure quality updates and optimal performance. The result is a system that delivers inquiry results 30 times faster and with a greater ability to scale capacity for future growth.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365570780474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 01:13:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365570908664-6</Id><Title>IDF Beijing: World’s Broadest Datacenter Portfolio</Title><Msg>Intel has a long history of delivering industry leading silicon technology optimized for improved performance, power, I/O, security and reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) features.

The more of these I see, the more humous they get. The actual headline reads "Huge bearish strategy is targeting Intel". After that headline, they then use the phrase "could be" several times in the article, indicating that they are guessing. There is simply not enough transparancy in options to know if a bet is BEARISH or BULLISH or NEUTRAL or VOLATILITY bets. 14,000 July 18 PUTs at 16 cents = $224,000 42,000 July 16 PUTs at 4 cents = $168,000 If the two trades were linked, the different would be $56,000. Is a $56,000 bet huge? ANSWER: No. It could be insurance through next Tuesday's earnings where the trade could be simple insurance. After the earnings report, you just sell the 14,000 puts back at a small loss and let the 42,000 $16 puts expire worthless at a profit. Huge BEARISH BET?

When these "option experts" state opinions as facts they do a great disservice. They have to make a number of unspoken assumptions that make a critical difference in their conclusion. One big assumption that they all make is "the trade will be held through expiration". That is rarely the case. The only options that reach expiration day are the ones that don't matter. That is the real reason why 95% of options "expire worthless". They are the "don't care" positions.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365603259298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:14:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365603297797-37</Id><Title>Nuff totally humiliated since Intel on the rise</Title><Msg>Suffering psychotic break.

Sure was nice to get over 100% profit on calls since buy signal and they may triple from suggested entry last week ie go to 22.7 if you let them, but sometimes its ok to take profits even before the real top near term.

On both the NYSE and the NASDAQ, fewer stocks made new 52-week highs early last week, when both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ reached new highs, than in mid-March. Although the market has stayed resilient and it isn't time to bet against it, the internal weakness, if it doesn't improve soon, will eventually lead to a correction larger than those we have had during the past few months.

Expect the same result as RT just a year or two from now when they finally reach the market. 3. Intel improvements across the ecosystem are coming in waves.

Haswell will be here in another 7 weeks (already shipping) and 14nm FinFET production will be here in 9 months. These two arrivals will herald the end of the ARM era. Wall Street seems to be waking up (at last) to where Intel is going and if not then these two buckets of ice water should do the job.

Among the first-tier brands, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Lenovo had the strongest growths in the month, while Asustek Computer and Toshiba had weak sales. Due to touch panel shortages for the 13-inch and above segments and Pegatron Technology's production issues at its plants in Suzhou, China, Asustek was the only first-tier vendor to have suffered an on-month shipment decline in March. Compared to their performances a year earlier, however, all the brand vendors and ODMs suffered big shipment drops in March. Global shipments also dropped 15% on year in the first quarter. The persistently weak notebook industry impacted the ODMs' 2012 financial results with most of them seeing flat revenues and significant drops in profits. Raising their profits is a major task for the ODMs in 2013, Digitimes Research believes. As for the notebook industry's promotion for products featuring 11.6-inch touch panels and Windows 8 and priced at US$299-399, Digitimes Research believes such a segment - which Digitimes Research refers to as netbook 2.0 - will face strong competitions from 10-inch tablets and entry-level touchscreen notebooks. digitimesDOTcom/news/a20130408PD208.html</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1365611425213</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:30:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365611501838-114</Id><Topic><Title>intel owners exhausted from the beating</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365009603169</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:20:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You look like a putz now.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365611501838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:31:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365611530377-115</Id><Topic><Title>intel owners exhausted from the beating</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365009603169</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:20:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wdblawgrow•Apr 3, 2013 1:44 PM 0users liked this postsusers disliked this posts0 Reply . good thing the markets weren't overbght, eh? lol _________________________ eh?????</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365611530377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:32:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365611662958-116</Id><Title>Lucy Nuff will now retire the aliases listed below and try, try again</Title><Msg>Coinmaker Singlion Aintzbeingreen aladieisright Vinnybagofdogdoodie</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365611662958</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:34:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365612002480-117</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy Nuff will now retire the aliases listed below and try, try again</Title><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365611662958</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:34:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jazzigirlhoebag28</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365612002480</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365612164129-118</Id><Title>INTC earnings release on April 16</Title><Msg>Enjoy the ride up ....</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365612164129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365612312723-119</Id><Topic><Title>INTC earnings release on April 16</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365612164129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:42:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looking at 19 soon.

CCUR's rival ERIC just paid MSFT just under $200mm to buy their Mediaroom multi-screen platform with a reach of 11mm pay-TV subscribers worldwide. CCUR's MediaHawk technology is rated much better than Mediaroom and CCUR already has a multi-screen reach of 6.3mm pay-TV subscribers! With ERIC paying just under $200mm for MSFT's Mediaroom and its reach of 11mm homes, CCUR's superior MediaHawk technology and its reach of 6.3mm homes is worth approximately $100mm! It is already extremely profitable with non-GAAP EPS last year of $0.35 and set to earn EPS of $0.50 this year! CCUR at $6.98 currently has a market cap of only $61mm and after subtracting its $24.6mm in cash and $15mm for CCUR's media data intelligence business purchase price, CCUR's real-time and video businesses are only receiving a total of $21.4mm in value or less than 1/3 their current annualized revenue of $66.4mm! CCUR's real-time business powers military simulator devices for 4 of the world's 5 largest defense contracts and has $27.6mm in annualized revenue, which means it's worth well over $21.4mm by itself leaving zero value for CCUR's video business. CCUR's video delivery solutions business, which includes CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen video technology, has $33.8mm in annualized revenue and $0.50m in annualized non-GAAP EPS. A valuation of $100mm based on ERIC paying just under $200mm to MSFT for their Mediaroom technology, would cause CCUR to rise by $11.47 or 164% to $18.45! Look for CCUR to first breakout above $10 this week! It has the most bullish looking chart in the whole market!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1365613703983</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:08:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365614295240-125</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice stuff!</Msg><Username>leroy_newman</Username><Timestamp>1365614295240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:18:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365614375299-126</Id><Topic><Title>SINGHLION2001, where are you?</Title><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1365611324946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:28:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that a foreign national fired from Intel needed a free plane ride back home.

The interesting new wrinkle in streaming TV is Aereo. This company apparently collects HDTV signals from local broadcasters over-the-air in different U.S. markets and streams it to PC's and portables. Remarkably Aereo pays nothing to broadcasters for the content and has already won two court cases allowing them to do it.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365620333827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 14:58:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365620520966-144</Id><Title>Whisper is 65 cent going to miss that big time</Title><Msg>Whisper is 65 cent going to miss that big time</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1365620520966</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365620652369-145</Id><Topic><Title>INTC web-based TV service</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1365615189007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:33:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very interesting, thanks.

The identified cause of the drop is Microsoft's mis-steps with Windows 8. IDC says many buyers couldn't afford the extra price of touch enabled PC's to make use of W8, and because Microsoft didn't give users a W7 desktop option it made using existing PC's that buyers could afford awkward to unbearable. Buyers just walked away. If the PC sales are down this much it's purely because of Microsoft's poor judgment, then complicated by their unwillingness to correct it. Intel is in a position to give Microsoft a second chance but Microsoft needs to get with the program, they need to fix Windows 8, give PC users the option of using the W7 desktop and cut, cut, cut prices on W8 for all tablets.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365632106912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365632363262-201</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver says PC sales dropping signals end of ARM era</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1365631257928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:00:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You calling everybody that expresses their disdain for your con game here the same person shows how sad a man you are.

MS really screw this consumer segment up badly. They never should ship W8 with Metro enabled view in not touch enabled systems. But from SW point of view W8 is really better system like W 7 /boot time, stability, battery time in mobile segment etc./ The Gartner report seems to be more realistic tough... But even with its 11 percent decline report also Gartner also count only: " Data includes desk-based PCs and mobile PCs, including mini-notebooks but not media tablets such as the iPad." No word about servers either. And we know Intel Data Center Group is not declining...So the numbers should be little better.. I still think the Intel sales should be ok - not great but within january guidance midpoint...and once we get rid of this quarter outlook, this will be time to start gradually build long position in Intel.. INTC is internally really firing on all cilinders ... Wall Street will be forced to realize that soon. This quarter should be the last before it becomes clear even to "Mr. "Goldamn it" ! Covello and Company again :-) ... very clear who "can walk the talk" .. : -) .

No one else can do all of this or even most of this. INTC could double in sales in three years. With a better multiple, it could be a $60 stock. I am not too worried about a quarters worth of PC sales.</Msg><Username>dewey_duhawk</Username><Timestamp>1365650424395</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 23:20:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365651592764-255</Id><Topic><Title>Customers buying Ultrabooks and less PCs.

Then your laptop is just used as the core computer, like your PC tower. Personally, I prefer the PC even though I also have laptops, but a laptop makes a good substitute for the PC tower, especially if you have a laptop dock, which makes connecting and disconnecting the laptop very easy.</Msg><Username>gzr2028</Username><Timestamp>1365651592764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 23:39:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365652468670-256</Id><Title>And the Band Played On</Title><Msg>Enough of the Wall Street stupidity and chanting of "the PC is dead." Wall Street continues to be such a group of simpletons that they can't grasp the idea that PCs have been replaced by processors. And the processor is anything but dead. Processors sales will continue to ramp up for the next decade as a minimum. And as the latest events and announcements in Beijing have attested, Intel is easily the best positioned company to lead the processor industry. Indeed, the ARM era draws to a close - marked by ARM's failure to penetrate either the low-end (RT) or the high-end (servers) of that PC market that Wall Street thinks of as unimportant. But it's all about mobility now and the last time I checked, mobile devices had a processor in them. And 2012 is the year that Intel is going to take over the mobility market. Someone please tell the cretins on Wall Street and at IDC that they need to stop being a brown shoe in the tuxedo world. Comments on PC's are so passe... pas•sé (pæˈseɪ) adj. 1. old-fashioned; out-of-date; outmoded. 2. past one's prime.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365652468670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 23:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365652651063-257</Id><Topic><Title>BIGTIME DAMAGE CONTROL Taking Place on this Board</Title><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1365648238465</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:43:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indeed, Haswell is such a huge improvement that people have been waiting on it. Leave it to the doom and gloom crowd at Wall Street and IDC to turn it into something negative.
