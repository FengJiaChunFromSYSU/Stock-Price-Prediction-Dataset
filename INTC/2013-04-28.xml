The companies said they moved the test chip design from RTL to "tape-out" in six months, usuing a design flow co-ordinated by TSMC. The companies did not state how long the design would take to be instantiated successfully in 20-nm silicon, which at TSMC is a planar process. Nor did the companies indicate whether the design is single-core, without peripherals, or whether it is a full working multi-core processor suitable for use in applications. ARM said it would now optimize its physical IP to the TSMC 20-nm process for power, performance and area and produce a specification for a Cortex-A15 processor optimization pack (POP). It did not say how soon this would be completed. "This first 20-nm ARM Cortex-A15 tape out paves the way for the next generation of SoC integration and performance," said Mike Inglis, general manager of ARM's processor division, in a statement. These SoCs will be suitable for smartphones, tablet computers, digital home systems, servers and wireless infrastructure, ARM said. Separately Cadence Design Systems Inc. (San Jose, Calif.) said that engineers that it employs also helped with the design and that it used a Cadence RTL-to-sign-off design flow that was the result of 18 months work between ARM and Cadence. ARM makes use of Cadence tools for design work and the two companies are working to optimize ARM processors and Cadence design flows so they work well together, Cadence said.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1367165985039</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 12:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367166847624-17</Id><Topic><Title>Should Intel Change Strategies?</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367072324845</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>[Nenni, there you go again - trying to deceive everyone by pretending that a tape-out is the same as volume production.

So, here's some questions for you:] NOT TRUE. I never said tape-out equals production. Clearly it does not. Tape-out to production takes about one year. And that is production START not fully ramped production. A new design in a new process is a very difficult thing and not to be trivialized. [What was the time lapse between the first 28nm tape-out and volume production? And by the way, when will any of the ARM foundries reach volume production on 28nm because they haven't yet.] NOT TRUE. TSMC 28nm has been in production for more than one year. In fact 28nm accounted for 24% of revenue in Q1 2013. Look at the TSMC financials. They break it out by process node. [If ARM foundries haven't yet reached volume production on 28nm, how silly is it to suggest that 20nm will be done more quickly or even just as quickly?] Again, NOT TRUE. [If ARM foundries have to have 20nm to do the half-step to 14nm and they don't have 20nm production yet and won't until 2014 or 2015, then how silly is it to suggest they will have the half-step to 14nm in any time frame?] 20nm is taping out now so look for production in one year. Q2 2013. 14nm is 20nm with FinFETs so it will not take as long as 20nm. I expect FinFET tape-outs in Q4 2013 so expect FinFET production to START in Q1 2015. [And a couple of statements: Having FinFET means selling products using it. Apple doesn't have FinFET. Apple won't have FinFET for years and years and years. So, stop with the silly tape-out delusions of being equivalent to volume production...] Apple just taped out at 20nm and is now working on FinFET. Apple iPhone6 (next year) will have 20nm.

Some features of the SoC process has been used to tweak Ivy to 7 SDP which went into production in January. You seem to blindly accept future predictions of TSMC but want to ignore what Intel is shipping today. Also you seem to be piddling over which Intel 22nm process we are talking about and yet you don't even have a clue as to the performance characteristics of the TSMC process. You do realize the TSMC 20nm process is planor not FinFet and that it costs more to make per transistor and has little performance advantage over their current process. .A much better question might be what is the breath of the TSMC 20 nm process. This is important because Intel is intermixing many of the different transistor variants on a single die. . Another good question might be when will TSMC have great analog capability at22 nm.</Msg><Username>redwood1205</Username><Timestamp>1367170668128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:37:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367170691618-29</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo K900 Benchmarks fly past quad core Snapdragon</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1358221736919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 22:48:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Merrifield will have integrated LTE</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1367170691618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367170706795-30</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Intel building so much capacity?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364955944554</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:25:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good info here</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1367170706795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:38:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367170958782-31</Id><Topic><Title>Jigsaw puzzle falls into place - Intel Bay Trail Tablets with built-in LTE</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366305192061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 13:13:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep agreed</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1367170958782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367171041717-32</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Daniel Nenni, ARM/TSMC taped out 20nm in 2011.......where is it?</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1367165985039</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 12:19:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Test chip tape-out is not a design tape-out.

It has utterly confused consumers since there are inherent differences between the full version of Windows 8 and Windows RT. For one, Windows RT devices are powered by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ) designs, which to the consumer means that legacy Windows applications are not compatible. However, devices powered by ARM offer the promise of smaller form factors and improved battery life over Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) -powered designs. Microsoft has done a poor job relaying these and other subtleties between Windows 8 and Windows RT to consumers. The Verge investigated the topic and found that Microsoft failed to properly educate its employees, which naturally damaged consumer perceptions about the product. As a result of this confusion, Samsung decided not to launch any Windows RT devices in the U.S. and stopped RT sales in Germany. Acer has delayed introducing any Windows RT devices in the U.S. until it had a better sense of how Microsoft Surface RT sales fared. When major OEM partners don't even want to embrace Windows RT, how can Microsoft really make it a success story? If only Microsoft would have just stuck with Intel's x86 architecture the whole time ...

Both Apple's and Google's tablet experience lack the level of productivity that that would be possible on a Windows 8 tablet powered by Intel's upcoming Bay Trail processor. With a few added peripherals, such a device could become an impromptu, yet highly capable, PC in a pinch. Speaking of Bay Trail, the future of the PC also hinges on Intel's ability to introduce technology that enables a compelling computing experience and form factor. Bay Trail-powered devices aren't expected to hit the shelves until the holiday season this year, but when they do, I expect the prospect of a $200 Windows 8 tablet to be within striking distance.

When something's been around longer than most teenagers, it's only natural for users to associate the Windows experience with the Start menu. Take that experience away, and it's easy to see why millions yearn for the past. Still, this outcry hasn't been enough for Microsoft to break down and give users exactly what they want. According to The Verge, Microsoft's upcoming Windows version 8.1 will be splitting the difference with users by giving them a Start button that routes back to the "Metro" interface. In other words, users still demanding a familiar Start menu experience will be sorely disappointed. From Steve Heller [I don't have a problem with Windows 8 except for the absence of the Start Menu.

However, the company is not immune to the secular decline in the PC industry and has already made a very aggressive entry into the smartphone industry. Lenovo is a close Intel partner and is about to launch a flagship smartphone (K900) using Intel's "Clovertrail" chips. Lenovo is also going to start a Yoga line of products using Ivy Bridge processors. I expect that Lenovo will be one of Haswell's biggest customers in the coming year. Microsoft - Microsoft like Intel has been pushing hard into the mobile devices industry and has launched the Surface tablets on its own. The newer Windows versions are becoming mobile friendly and Haswell ultrabooks will give Windows 8 a further boost. The North Cape prototype used a Windows 8 operating system. Apple - There are strong rumors that Apple will launch a new line of Mac products using Haswell chips. If Intel delivers on its promise of delivering a radically improved processor, then Apple might not have a choice as competing processors will be outclassed on performance/watt metrics. There are already credible rumors that Intel will start shipping Haswell processors to Apple in May for Apple products that will be launched during the fall. The Macbook Pro's biggest upgrade might be the usage of a Haswell processor. Other PC vendors - HP, Dell, Toshiba, Fujitsu and Acer should also benefit from a revival in the PC industry's fortunes. These companies have been unable to fight against tablets as both Intel and Microsoft did not have the hardware and software to compete effectively. As Intel levels the field with ARM in power efficiency, these companies will be able to fight back.

The world's largest semiconductor company possesses massive advantages both in technology and manufacturing. It has one of the biggest moats in the technology industry and does not deserve to trade at such a cheap valuation. The company's stock has already seen a slight uptick after its recent quarterly results. The introduction of "Haswell", "Baytrail" and "Merrifield" should see the stock go much higher in my opinion. The company not only remains a "monopoly" in the PC processor segment but will also become a huge player in the mobile semiconductor industry.

Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits. Intel's lead in fabrication and manufacturing is increasing in virtually every area.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367189069555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 18:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367193484875-80</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC schedule is for mid-2014 for 20nm.

They seem to be clinging onto the "PC is dyeing mantra". the great point being emphasises is that the PC as we know it, is and has been evolving, yes ARM based products arrived and have been successful. Though the rate of evolution of intel design, manufacturing far out paces, the rate at which ARM is evolving. Almost, a case of Darwin's theory, evolution leads to survival of the fittest. Unless the ARM camp (Apple included), evolves it's products to at least the same level of performance (per watt) as intel Haswell, they will be dead on arrival. Already WinRT products are DOA. Intel based Tablets (and possibly phones) are doubling in sales concurrent quarters. I would expect Haswell based devices to more than quadruple volume intel penetration in the Tablet space. This will not bode well for Apple with ARM based Tablets (iOS) as Apple is suffering and will need to concede that MacBooks will be forced to go touch enabled, running on x86 architecture. Even die hard apple geeks will admit they would prefer an all in one detachable MacBook, come Tablet, come PC, as opposed to three different devices running multiple operating systems will little application and software transferability. Add to that iWatch is probably intel powered. To me this now is the inflection point where we will be witnessing the correction of the ARM era. ARM will have a place in other devices though their biggest problems will be the decline in adoption of ARM technology in Smartphones and Tablets. Especially the most profitable high end devices. Intels push into phones and tablets started in low end devices competing directly with ARM. next step for intel will be the run into High end devices with Evolutionary superior performance and power saving consumption. This is the start of the "Evolution of the PC era".</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1367193963924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:06:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367195240949-82</Id><Topic><Title>Bravo Ashraf: INTC: The King is Back</Title><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1367180371747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 16:19:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Recap: Tipping point has arrived RT: Failure to launch ARM Servers: Still on the pad ARM Fabrication: Fades to black End of the ARM era Start of the Evolution of the PC era 2013: Year of the Intel Tablet 2014: Year of the Intel Smartphone</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367195240949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:27:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367195871936-83</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC schedule is for mid-2014 for 20nm.

The trend in the workplace also includes a wide range of innovative devices in the market and new cloud computing services being employed. And these trends are challenging IT departments across the region. Organizations must re-think the entire approach to end-user computing or risk becoming out-of-date. But according to the survey, before these trends can be addressed inside the organization, there are at least three requirements that should be met – security, manageability, and remote wipe capabilities. Intel’s vPro technology is aimed to address these needs. It is a set of security and manageability capabilities built into the 3rd generation Intel Core vPro processor family, the Intel Xeon processor E3-1200 v2 family, Intel chipsets, and network adapters that simplify and accelerate these four critical IT functions.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1367201053595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 22:04:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367201168505-92</Id><Topic><Title>Intel has Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) covered as well</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1367201053595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 22:04:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel vPro processor-based PCs or workstations provide the following features: Built-in features that help lower total cost of ownership - provides capabilities through Intel Active Management Technology (Intel AMT), Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT),and Intel Trusted Execution Technology (Intel TXT). Together, these technologies deliver hardware support for advanced management functions, virtualization, and platform security enabling solutions that help: reduce cost of service, provide greater software flexibility, and provide more security. Prevent attacks below the operating system – protects against difficult-to-detect, penetrating rootkits and malware that threaten users working in cloud or virtual environments by employing Intel Trusted Execution Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology. It also enables hardware-based virtualization for PCs or workstations using Intel Virtualization technology for centralized image management and administration, secure network storage, and out-of-band protection—all beyond the firewall. Strengthen authentication and protect passwords – Intel vPro technology features Intel Identity Protection Technology (Intel IPT),which provides several critical built-in defenses, including an embedded one-time password, built-in public key infrastructure (PKI), and protected transaction display. Protect confidential business, employee, and customer information - while Intel IPT helps to ensure that user identity is protected with a unique computer-generated token if the computer is lost or stolen, Intel Anti-Theft Technology allows IT to remotely lock down the computer, protecting both the user’s identity and corporate data.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1367201168505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 22:06:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367201233793-93</Id><Topic><Title>Intel has Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) covered as well</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1367201053595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 22:04:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Respond to security breaches with speed and agility - embedded in hardware, Intel vPro technology capabilities are accessed and administered separately from the hard drive, OS, and software applications—in a pre-boot environment.
