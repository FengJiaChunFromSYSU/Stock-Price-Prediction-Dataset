INTC is well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming NAND shortage for SSDs. MU deal will guarantee DRAM for INTCs endeavors. Server growth and XP end of life will more than compensate for PC contraction in Q2. Server growth and tablet growth will far outpace PC contraction in Q3, Q4, Q1, and Q2 2014. 14nm chips will start to gain market share in phones in 2H 2014. INTC will increase the dividend to $1.00/yr. at earnings. INTC will beat earnings and guide higher. INTC will be "the only chip maker" in 2015 and be at least 2 nodes ahead of TSMC, QCOM, and Samsung.

I still maintain that Apple has folks on the inside fighting for Intel and others fighting for TSMC, GF or Samsung. Tim Cooks is a logistics guy so you pretty much can assure that he's going to check out all avenues before committing to one vendor. Apple must have contacted these foundries and asked "How far can you go, what time frames and what do you need from us?" But you know how things turn from an inquiry to a signed contract in the tabloid press. I like Russ's story. One part he left out is if a good chunk of the market isn't buying SoC's from TSMC how can the rest of the market really afford to pay for 20, 14, 10nm trigate development? How can TSMC afford to catch up on it's own to Intel?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1374043864797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 02:51:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374044600219-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Earnings Call - My Expectations</Title><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1374040075419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 01:47:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking for positive news going forward about the pipeline, the roadmap, fabrication, volume 14nm FinFET production and the end of the ARM era that will provide a major boost in the P/E ratio...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374044600219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 03:03:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374044716163-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Earnings Call - My Expectations</Title><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1374040075419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 01:47:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fabs: You don't write-off producing fabs and Stacy Smith said last quarter: "And as I look forward across the year, the prediction right now is we’re going to run at a healthy rate of utilization."

On the other side of the fence: Geekbench at first shows the base clock for Atoms (ie, 1.3 for clovertrail) and then shows the turbo boost clock speed (1.8/2.0) so we could actually be seeing the scores for turbo boost (ie, Piednoel is wrong). Also, prototype devices can perform better as they don't have the various constraints that a real device has.

Saltwell Outperforming A15...With Less Power!!! By: Linus Torvalds July 11, 2013 10:57 am Room: Moderated Discussions bakaneko on July 11, 2013 12:02 am wrote: It doesn't matter for application developers, because native code is only recommended for isolated routines called from Java code. And the last thing any programmer would do is disable NEON. Any sane person will agree that AnTuTu is #$%$, and that using icc is odd. But that last statement of yours is laughably incorrect. No sane person uses NEON, because NEON isn't available in most ARM implementations. In fact, even if you only look at higher-end ARM ("They all have NEON, right?"), it turns out that NEON is an optional feature (idiotic ARM waffling, even for Cortex-A9), and isn't available in some reasonably common chips (ie Tegra 2 or the SPEAr chips). The thing is, ARM floating point and vector extensions remain a disaster. When they exist, they are often perfectly fine, but because you can't depend on them existing, many sane implementations simply cannot use them, or have to use them exclusively behind a library interface (which in turn tends to defeat all performance advantages except for very specific cases). Cue Wilco making excuses for bad architecture decisions in 3.. 2.. 1.. Last time I pointed out how screwed up this was, he went into denial mode and was spouting lies about how NEON is an architected standard in all modern cores. ARM remains the most fragmented architecture out there. It's not one architecture, it's a jumble of a handful of incompatible architectures that ARM has fooled people into thinking is one thing. And then the ARM people point fingers at how ugly x86 is because x86 is backwards compatible. F*cking clueless liars.

With MU using this tech, they have to know the limitations or they would be using it themselves. Yesterday, Micron (MU) announced that they are sampling a 16 nanometer NAND memory chip with the intention to enter full production in the 4th quarter of this year. This NAND chip is the highest density chip in the NAND memory industry. The 16nm node will enable Micron to manufacture 50% more chips per wafer, thus reducing the individual chip cost by one third. The interesting thing about this new chip is that it is built using HKMG (High K Metal Gate) technology. This EE Times piece on the new chip includes more detail than the above Micron press release that doesn't mention the very important HKMG. HKMG lithographic processing has been the near exclusive domain of Intel (INTC) since 2007. "K" is the dielectric constant of a material; higher dielectric constant allows integrated circuits to be built using thinner oxides without electrical leakage increasing. HKMG technology is what allows Intel to stay years ahead of the next best in class competition.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1374064733315</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 08:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374066339138-20</Id><Title>Bernanke speaks without rocking the market</Title><Msg>Got thru that hurdle.

In 2006, during the industry's last consolidation wave - the cable TV operators initially made the largest gains, but the focus quickly shifted to cable TV technology vendors. Seachange (SEAC) was the subject of a Brean Capital research note issued in December that read, "Because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." The industry consolidation scenario is now here! SEAC has been soaring in recent days, rising past its previous 52-week high of $12.10 and setting a new 52-week high yesterday of $12.50 where it has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.89. In 2006, many articles were published about both SEAC and its close rival CCUR being potential takeover targets. CCUR hasn't rallied to new highs yet like SEAC, but could do so in the days ahead! CCUR recently surpassed SEAC to capture the #1 largest video on demand (VOD) technology market share, and CCUR now leads in other key areas of MSO investment like start-over/look-back, Big Data Analytics, and CDN multi-screen solutions. CCUR is an undiscovered gem that in the event of a buyout could fetch a much larger premium than SEAC! , CCUR meets all of the same criteria that Brean mentions for SEAC being a takeover target. CCUR is currently trading with an extremely undervalued enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.71. CCUR could rapidly rise to SEAC's enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.89, which would value CCUR at $16.21. CCUR could quiclly rise to above SEAC's share price in the short-term. CCUR's 10-K filing next month will likely show record profits for CCUR and solid revenue growth! CCUR's fiscal 2013 non-GAAP EPS could potentially reach $0.50 and exceed SEAC's current non-GAAP EPS of $0.44. CCUR recently raised its dividend by 100% to an industry leading yield of 6.2%, which is an extremely bullish sign!</Msg><Username>wozof477</Username><Timestamp>1374072257930</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 10:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374072311915-40</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Just Took 6% Of The Tablet Market (Officially)</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1374069873502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 10:04:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for the solid information.

Agner Fog has done some work to characterize the instruction timings for various Intel and AMD CPU. He has a nice PDF table that you can browse through to get an idea of what he thinks is the cycles for each instruction. It is hard to get an accurate view of how many cycles because of the out of order operations possible. If the CPU are trapping to the x87, then the values will have to be pushed on to the x87 stack, executed and then popped back off. There might be some interaction between the x87 register file and the SSE registers on some of the CPU. agnerDOTorg/optimize/instruction_tablesDOTpdf Intel Optimization Guide User/Source Coding Rule 14.

Volume is light and has been light. We should pretty soon start to trade on fundamentals and not QE's. Most of the Economists from Citi, GS, MS and more reduced their GDP growth for the 2nd half to 1 % from 1.3 percent and most of them including UPS have said the domestic growth and consumer spending is in jeopardy. Refinancing is slowing as the interest rates are going up hence less money in the consumer pocket to spend and with the dollar rising the bond yields spiking the bonds look a better and safer place than equity. Max the mkt will hit 1700 on the S&amp;P and then pullback hard. I am waiting to see what outlook intel is gonna give. If it is cautious we are screwed, if its optimistic we should be okay, but I am cautious, I sold half my position at 24.25 to be on the safe side.

I wanted to provide some details about what's going on with the floating point workloads the Silvermont architect referenced. Two of the Geekbench 2 floating point workloads (Sharpen Image and Blur Image) have a fencepost error. This error causes the workloads to read uninitialized memory, which can contain denorms (depending on the platform). This causes a massive drop in performance, and isn't representative of real-world performance. We only found out about this issue a couple of months ago. Given that Geekbench 3 will be out in August, and fixing the issue in Geekbench 2 would break the ability to compare Geekbench 2 scores, we made the call not to fix the issue in Geekbench 2. If you've got any questions about this (or about anything Geekbench) please let me know and I'd be happy to answer them.

Analysts had expected the chip giant to report earnings excluding items of 39 cents a share on $12.9 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The company also said it expects revenue of $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million in the third quarter. Analysts currently expect $13.73 billion.

Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should” and their variations identify forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on projections, uncertain events or assumptions also identify forward-looking statements. Many factors could affect Intel’s actual results, and variances from Intel’s current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the following to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s expectations. Demand could be different from Intel's expectations due to factors including changes in business and economic conditions; customer acceptance of Intel’s and competitors’ products; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations; and changes in the level of inventory at customers. Uncertainty in global economic and financial conditions poses a risk that consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to negative financial events, which could negatively affect product demand and other related matters. Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and product demand that is highly variable and difficult to forecast. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the timing of Intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's competitors, including product offerings and introductions, marketing programs and pricing pressures and Intel’s response to such actions; and Intel’s ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into its products. The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs; start-up costs; excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or resources; product manufacturing quality/yields; and impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets. The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses on the sale, exchange, change in the fair value or impairments of debt and equity investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Intel's results could be affected by adverse economic, social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in countries where Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the level of revenue and profits. Intel’s results could be affected by the timing of closing of acquisitions and divestitures. Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust, disclosure and other issues, such as the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, impacting Intel’s ability to design its products, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect Intel’s results is included in Intel’s SEC filings, including the company’s most recent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1374092321440</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:18:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374092343656-192</Id><Topic><Title>INTC better lower the forecast some more they can't even beat the 39 cents.

We will see what they say in the CC.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1374095458193</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:10:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374095487376-283</Id><Title>Walking it down one penny at a time</Title><Msg>Tomorrow opens at low 23s and ends up the day in 22.85</Msg><Username>iheartdaddy</Username><Timestamp>1374095487376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:11:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374095585713-284</Id><Topic><Title>The Wallis Line ($24) is unbreachable!</Title><Username>walrusweener</Username><Timestamp>1374094349515</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someday &amp; soon I hope, you will reap the rewards of all the garbage you post Mr gutless shut in wonder.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374095585713</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374095650158-285</Id><Topic><Title>Where is my dividend increase, Mr. CEO?</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1374081980217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 13:26:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I have been saying, thee isn't any, we would have heard in May. 40% of $2 would be 80 cents.

Despite this, CFO Stacy Smith said, "We have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the second half of this year across all of the segments of our business. Haswell delivers historical increases in battery life across a diverse lineup of ultra- mobile form factors. In our phone business, we are on track to ship our next-generation applications processor code-named Merrifield by the end of the year." The company is also on track to start production on its 14-nanometer process technology in the back half of this year. Although still too early to predict Q4 trends, Smith said he expects "seasonal" results and maintained a cautious view on the fourth quarter selling season. Two tailwinds were seen for the back half of the year. First and foremost was the company's product cycle, and the second was an improving macro-economic climate.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1374098516713</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374098551964-348</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL DISASTER ROAD MAP JUST GETTING REVEALED: EARNINGS RE BAD AND WILL GET UGLY NEXT WAVE</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1374092021975</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol USA zombie $ucks wait till RIOTS break out in USA in 2014 TITANIC wreckage next</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1374098551964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:02:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374098588374-349</Id><Topic><Title>Is the Dividend payout 58 percent now?

It gives poor guidance, just like INTC. YHOO has been a serial disappointer. But what happens? In AH, it initially falls, then it goes up and up the whole of afterhours. Then it continues to go up more today. WHY? What is this company anyway, but a flopping social media company that has screwed up over and over again, for YEARS. Under the total incompetence of Jerry Yang, I lost money when he and his sidekick show up like two ragimuffins at the Seattle airport to meet with Ballmer, and then tell him they can't accept the huge amount of money MSFT was willing to pay them for the company. Result? Investors lost billions of dollars. NOW, let's move to INTC. This is a REAL company. It is the largest chip maker in this country, if not the world. It has top expertise in creating the best chips made. And now, it has ventured into the mobile market with its new chips that have architecture and capabiliity that no one else has. It has even bought a large chip foundry to manufacturer its own chips. No other chip company has this. They all must use outside sourcing, like TSM, to get their chips. TSM, the huge chip manufacturer cannot produce the 20, 18, 16 nm chips that INTC is capable of. So, simply because PC sales were, as expected, down, this stock trades nothing but down, down, down. All day long, the financial press and TV pumped out negativity about iNTC and earnings, when days before, they all were extolling its accomplishments and its threat to the best chipmakers that its new Haswell and other chips will bring. Now, I sit with a huge number of shares, a huge loss, and get told by the talking heads that it will bring the WHOLE TECH market down tomorrow. But they didn't say that about YHOO, did they? Further, unlike YHOO, this evening other tech reported also. IBM had a good report. XLNX had a good report. BUT, INTC will do this, but YHOO? NO, NO.

"QUESTION: I think a driving concern in the investment community is whether Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to cannibalize Haswell." It very well may be that Baytrail is a weapon of mass destruction: "RESPONSE: Our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don't believe it will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe what it really does is it allows us to get into these markets that we are not in in a big way today ... the sub-$400, sub-$300 in some cases, clamshells and touch-enabled convertibles and two-in-one devices. In tablets, $199 and below. Some you're going to see even lower, below $150 and much below that as we go through the holiday season." Wow. Baytrail tablets "below $150". This is war and Intel is going to get hit with some shrapnel from its own weapons.

Brian, although early the initial read we’re getting on Bay Trail with your partners is pretty positive, and I think that’s driving a concern in the investment community with whether or not Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to cannibalize Haswell, and so I guess I’d like to get your thoughts on how you can segment the market properly, to what extent do you think you’re a slave to market forces and to what extent do you think you can bring applications that are MIPS attentive into the ecosystem and secure the Core business even as you try to get more aggressive in Bay Trail and Atom? Stacy J. Smith If I can just add a couple of data points on that in terms of what we've seen over the last few years. First off is to reinforce what Brian said. There still is a big gap in terms of performance and features between the best in Bay Trail and the Core i3, i5 or i7 segment of our product line. And if you look at the last three years even in a time where the market's been relatively weak, the Core i5, i7 volumes have been very healthy and if anything we've seen a larger mix overall to Core over that time period. So there still is a healthy segmentation in the marketplace where Bay Trail will play – it will start to expand this into markets where we don't play today. And because of the cost structure we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we would be able to do if we were going after that segment today with Celeron or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful product from that perspective, John. Brian M. Krzanich At the end of the day, the market will go where the market goes and better to have a product like Bay Trail that we can play no matter where it goes rather than miss that market which if you look over the past was more than it is.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1374114200565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 22:23:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374114275253-467</Id><Title>From CC:</Title><Msg>In my humble opinion shorts are toast. Most important fact came when David Wong with Wells Fargo asked following question: David Wong - Wells Fargo Thanks very much. You mentioned moving Atom even faster to the leading edge. Can you give us some detail as to when we might see 14 nanometer atom products in the market and similarly you’ve talked about 14 nanometers going into production end of this year. So does that mean the first 14 nanometer Core products will launch in the first quarter of 2014? Brian M. Krzanich - CEO Okay. So, let me – you asked a couple of questions. We are not going to give changes to the roadmap or any kind of product schedules here, from what will happen as a result of the strategy. We will try and bring those updates to our Investor Meeting that happens in November. As far as our 14 nanometer Core launch in our – just our general product launch, I think what we’ve said so far is, first half of 2014 and we’re not going to – we’re not ready to give any specifics beyond that. David Wong - Wells Fargo Okay. Stacy J. Smith - EVP and CFO I gave you a pretty strong hint with the fact that it will be taking prequalification reserves, you can kind of sense that we’re well – those are going to be material. So we will be well into production on the fourth quarter. So, if that is the case Intel will be at least 2 IC chip manufacturing generations ahead of the competition in Q4!!! and that is all you have to know.

Brian, first of all how should we think about ASP trend in the PC segment; I think you outlined 3% sequential declines in Q2 and you got into another 50 point gross margin head from lower ASPs in Q3, why are you not seeing more of an uplift from the rollout of Haswell? Stacy J. Smith Yeah, this is Stacy; I’ll take that one, because it was in the CFO commentary that I put out. You should think of it as mix shift for us and share win at the low end of the market. I think if you look at our first half results you’ll see we came in pretty much in line with what we thought, but during a time where the [TAM] was somewhat weaker than we thought. I think the offset there, the plug is that we gained some share at the low end and so we have bit more mix at the lower end and then due to share win in that particular segment of the market. ------------------------------------- " You should think of it as mix shift for us and share win at the low end of the market" BAD NEWS FOR AMD BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW AMD IS A BOTTOM FEEDER</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1374116621124</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 23:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374116693496-473</Id><Topic><Title>From CC:</Title><Username>coolmark4you</Username><Timestamp>1374114275253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 22:24:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes sir!
