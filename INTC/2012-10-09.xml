"What Calxeda and any other server chip upstart (like Applied Micro or Tilera) really need to do is run some industry standard SPEC tests on their machines. SPEC CPU2006, jEnterprise 2010, and SPECpower_ssj2008 seem like good places to start. Then they need to do some real web serving and Hadoop benchmarks, which is where ARM and Tilera chips will get traction first in the server racket. And perhaps most importantly, the tests have to include the full system cost of the machine running the test and a cluster of machines (including switching costs) for supporting a horizontal workload because there is no question that Calxeda is going to have a big, big advantage here because of its integrated switching. This is why Intel has bought up Ethernet, InfiniBand, and supercomputer interconnects, after all."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1349755643576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:07:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349757066152-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Bernstein Says Sell, ASPs Set to Decline</Title><Username>romekay</Username><Timestamp>1349728805293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:40:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buying here would be a very bad idea because you will soon be able to get it 10 % lower and get an extra .25% divy in addition --Why would you want to lose 10% to make 4</Msg><Username>marrohead</Username><Timestamp>1349757066152</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349757146938-3</Id><Topic><Title>Xeon breaks Calxeda's ARM in Apache benchmark</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344863113000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 09:05:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its becoming clear ARM has not shot in the server/enterprise market.

It’s working. Consumer credit outstanding is at an all-time high of $2.73 trillion as the Federal government has dished out billions in student loans to 50,000 University of Phoenix MBA aspirants sitting in their basements quivering with anticipation of on-line graduation and future six figure job with Goldman Sachs. The Feds have also added the impetus to the “strong” auto sales through their 85% TARP ownership of Ally Financial by doling out 7 year 0% auto loans to subprime borrowers in urban enclaves around the country. The oligarchs aren’t worried about these loans being paid back, because they are reaping the profits today. The future losses will just be foisted onto the taxpayer, as always. Total credit market debt of $55 trillion now exceeds 350% of GDP. The National Debt of $16.2 trillion will exceed $20 trillion in 2015 no matter who wins the Presidency in November. The oligarchs adapt and control whoever occupies the White House. It is essential for our owners to keep debt growing at an exponential rate or the Ponzi scheme collapses. Narrow minded ideologues want a simple answer to a complex interaction of generational, cultural, economic, political, and criminal factors that have conspired to put the country into a predicament that, at this point, will inevitably lead to economic collapse. The truth is the American people have learned to love their servitude. They have willfully chosen ignorance over truth. They’ve chosen to believe what their keepers have instructed them. They’ve chosen to trust the storylines generated by the corporate media rather than think critically and question everything. They’ve chosen obesity and sickness over health. They’ve chosen debt financed faux wealth over savings based real wealth. They’ve chosen safety and security over liberty. They’ve chosen dependency over self-reliance. These choices were aided, abetted and promoted by the Alphas through their ability to manipulate and control the unthinking masses. Huxley understood the power of propaganda and brainwashing decades before it was perfected by our owners.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1349789312522</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:28:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349789396462-26</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL WILL BE SINGLE DIGIT STOCK IN 2013:THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM FOR INTEL NEXT $30 SoC or $250 CPU?</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348796337780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:38:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So bashers.....Fraud street also now almost screaming with a spin, what I am warning</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1349789396462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:29:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349789515468-27</Id><Topic><Title>Intel soon P/E of 8 vs peers at over 17 ???</Title><Username>buffet_graham</Username><Timestamp>1349775919231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 05:45:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How do you ever get to a P/E of 8? The latest analyst- Rasgon- made some good points on margins for the lower priced cores and lowers forward earnings estimates for 2013 to $2.00/sh. So, you think it will get to $16 shortly? His price target is $20, and hs is bearish- that's a 10 PE. I like taking worst case scenario for earnings.Then rely on them righting the ship with correct product mixes, R&amp;D to get into the tablet and ultrathin markets eventually. With a dividend of $.90 per share, $21/sh (forward P/E 10.5, yield 4.3%) looks like a very fair place to get back in long to me. If you think the overall market is topping and due to correct, what beter place to be than a solid company with visible, predictable revenue and a 4.3% yield, with most of the bad news already priced in?

The last time Intel was at $18, there were 6.5bil shares. Now there are 5.0bil. The number of shares have been reduced by 20%. $22 is the same as $18. EXCEPT, the last time that Intel was at $18, it had $45bil revenue and lower profits. $22 is below the equivalent $18. The dividend represents a 30% payout when Intel has said they are targetting 40%. There is a 33% margin between their payout and their target. The dividend represents an even smaller percentage of cash flow which means that the Intel board could even decide to payout more than 100% of profits in dividends without borrowing or issuing shares or .... Intel may be forced to cut the dividend but things would have to get VERY, VERY much worse before that was even thought about.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1349790974617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:56:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349791076309-38</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>Earnings season unofficially kicks off today with reports from AA.

Wall Street has now factored in the revenue miss eight times. Come earnings anything better than a 50 percent reduction in revenues will exceed Wall Street expectations. Intel continues with a ridiculous P/E ratio. All of this courtesy of the manipulation of the biggest firms on Wall Street and some of the smaller ones as well as they work in concert to defraud the small investor. But, no - I'm not worried because I know how it will all turn out. Like the US in WWII it's the big factory capability that will win the war. It will continue to be all about the fabrication. This isn't the new road, this is just a bump in the road as the fabrication factor kicks in. We've seen this before. The prevailing attitude on Wall Street that has been so screamingly wrong in the past is back and is just as wrong now as when a couple of years ago they beat Intel with impunity. This is the greatest processor market in the history of technology and it will continue to grow. Intel fabrication and manufacturing will determine how this story will end and it's not going to be pleasant for Chump Street. 2013 is going to be a great year for Intel. Next up - a welcome dose of reality as earnings will provide us real facts to offset the Wall Street frenzy...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349792521090</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:22:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349792590597-57</Id><Title>INTC Management needs to go!

INtel fabs are ahead... and that's all that matters... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Foundry sales at TSMC and UMC climbed strongly in the third quarter well ahead of their sales in the same period a year before. However, the picture was mixed with September sales showing slight signs of weakness. The two foundries are doing better than the overall semiconductor market, which is not expected to show growth in 2012 but sales slipped in September which may be a sign of a foundry slowdown to come. TSMC's CEO and chairman Morris Chang has previously predicted a slow down due to inventory correction in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. For now UMC and TSMC are following similar expansive trends but with TSMC leading both in terms of absolute size and by the size of the gains it makes both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. While September sales at both firms declined sequentially, the third quarter showed robust sequential and annual growth for both companies. TSMC announced unconsolidated net sales for September 2012 of NT$42.82 billion (about $1.46 billion), a decrease of 12.4 percent over August 2012 and an increase of 30.3 percent over September 2011. On a consolidated basis net sales for September 2012 were approximately NT$43.35 billion (about $1.48 billion), a decrease of 12.4 percent over August 2012 and an increase of 29.8 percent over September 2011. Meanwhile UMC has announced monthly sales revenue for September of NT$9.11 billion (about $311 million) up 11.5 percent over the same month in 2011 but down 7.0 percent from August 2012. On a quarterly basis TSMC 3Q12 consolidated revenues hit a record high of NT$141.38 billion (about $4.82 billion). This was 10.4 percent ahead of the 2Q12 revenues and 32.8 percent of 3Q11 revenues. TSMC's c0nsolidated revenues for January through September 2012 totaled NT$374.94 billion, an increase of 16.3 percent compared to the same period in 2011. UMC's third quarter unconsolidated sales were NT$28.52 billion (about $973 million) up 13.3 percent on the 2Q11 and up 3.3 percent sequentially. UMC's sales for the first nine months of 2012 are $79.91 billion still down on the equivalent period in 2011, by 1.9 percent.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1349792910975</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349792972777-62</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT: INTC may be forced to cut dividend</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1349790425829</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:47:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is a big, conservative company but the increase was in line with expectations of most.

It is going down as it is closer to reaching its promised land into Phones and tablets with the new Chips this next year. Do you happen to know what the top operating system in America is on phones? That's right it is Android. Do you know that Google--Motorola branch--will be selling phones in volume using the Intel CPU in early spring? YES it will. Motorola phones with Intel inside using the top used Operating system for phones will be a massive win for Intel and start the money flowing back into Intel. So the big institutions are selling Intel at a PE of 8 just as Intel is about to breakout. It is all automated computer selling and it goes down because it goes down nowadays. BUT---A deal with Apple would send it to 40 in one hours so there you are.

I am long Intel for the dividend and I sell call and put options to enter and exit a trading position in Intel. Intel has done a number of really good things that they get little credit for nor have they been able to monitize them. One that comes to mind is Centrino where they put wifi into your machine. IMO, (much more complex than I state ....) Craig Barrett made some questionable moves (with my clarity from the future) by incorporating HP PA RISC and steering Intel into the Itanium diriection where they thought that putting silicon support in the Itanium could offer sufficient performance. That was a costly diversion. Current management is doing fine but is having to unwind those problems. Intel reached a point with 32-bit, where the performance was really good enough to run the MSFT applications and faster CPU were not needed. Intel searched for the "kill app" that would benefit from the performance. They held the max power envelop constant and tried to add features. Thanks to Apple smartphones and tablets and ESPECIALLY touch input, Intel has found their new "way". Intel knows performance. Apple has given Intel their new mission. Low power and ultraportable devices.

However, one must look beyond the last few months and examine Mr. Otellini's records. In short, Mr. Otellini has been Intel's CEO for almost 8 years. He has not been successful in creating any new growth businesses for Intel. Within Intel, the move from PC to smartphone/tablets has been forseen for more than a decade and yet Intel could not capitalize on the transition. Intel continues to suggest that its silicon technologies leadership (tri-gate, 22nm, 14nm, etc.) will save the day. These messages have been parrotted by certain analysts especially those from UBS. In reality, Intel's problems are not technology or architecture based. Intel has a business model problem. The transition to smart devices and cloud computing moves the action from the PC client to the data center and the content and service providers. Yes, Intel will still benefit to some extent from the growth of data centers. But increasingly, Intel's role and value in the client (i.e., PC, smartphones, tablets, etc.) are eroding. This is where the majority of the volume and brand value reside. With this erosion, Intel's brand value is also impacted. Intel needs a major make-over. And Mr. Otellini is not the right leader to take Intel back to a growth path. The Board should act now!</Msg><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1349803959061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349804853239-154</Id><Topic><Title>Time for Leadership Change</Title><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1349803959061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paul O. has been a bust on so many levels as CEO - plain-and-simple.

Several years ago Otellini said he was giving up some CEO duties to focus on growth initiatives for INTC. He is a Board Member of Google. He met with Steve Jobs numerous times. Yet, Otellini totally missed the move to Mobile. He claimed in a later article that he wasn't smart enough to see it coming. Then he said Mobile was going to be "evolutionary." The guy is totally clueless and should be shown the door. The stock price today is lower than when Otellini took over as CEO--he has been well paid but it is obvious he has no idea how to grow the company. Barrett before him was no better. INTC has gone nowhere since Andy Grove left the company.</Msg><Username>shmemony</Username><Timestamp>1349804908130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:48:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349805111045-156</Id><Title>Looks like almost everything is down.</Title><Msg>I might sweat this if intel was the only thing getting hit.

The Washington Times is reporting that the California Democrat's husband, Paul F. Pelosi, owns Financial Leasing Services Inc., which has received $99,000 in rent, utilities and accounting fees from the speaker's "PAC to the Future" over the PAC's nine-year history. Last year, Pelosi supported a bill that would have banned members of Congress from putting spouses on their campaign staffs. The bill banned not only direct payments by congressional campaign committees and PACs to spouses for services including consulting and furndraising, but also "indirect compensation," such as payments to companies that employ spouses. The bill passed the House in a voice vote but died in a Senate committee. Last week, Pelosi's office defended the payments, saying they were legal because she is compensating her husband at fair market value for the work his firm has performed for the PAC. Ethical watchdogs called Pelosi's arrangement "problematic."</Msg><Username>wallispumper</Username><Timestamp>1349806467855</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349806517338-166</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Set Up To Reward Investors</Title><Username>loriguerra372</Username><Timestamp>1349788609235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:16:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm still with you!</Msg><Username>puckettn38</Username><Timestamp>1349806517338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349806573839-167</Id><Topic><Title>Time for Leadership Change</Title><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1349803959061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The Board should act now!"

Intel likes to compare "active" power vs. other chips or as part of the overall system power. However, in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, one of the key issue is standby power and leakage. That's the area Intel has a serious disadvantage. The fundamental issue is how Intel tunes its designs and silicon processes to achieve performance vs. power saving. As such, Intel's chips are higher perforamnce and competitive on "active" power. In reality, unless you are constantly encoding/transcodinfg video on your smartphone or tablet, you don't need this kind of high performance and the penalty of the higher active power. What you need is a very low standby power (low leakage) so that your battery can last a full day. Can Intel produce such a technology and design? Of course....but Intel has not made this a priority...yet! ARM, together with TSMC/Samsung, have. In summary, it is not a question of a 22nm SoC. Yes, a smaller geometry chip is (usually) lower power because it is a smaller chip. But much more important, it is how you design and target the technology.</Msg><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1349811433589</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349811465350-186</Id><Topic><Title>easy way to get rich</Title><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1349810908689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:28:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>up only a few cents and down at least more than half dollar, up one day and down more than a week, will repeat this pattern again and again! new lows will keep coming!

Internal Intel codenames derive from existing geographic places in North America. A rare exception is “Sandy Bridge,” the codename for Intel’s second-generation Core processor. In Intel’s so-called “tick-tock” model, “Ivy Bridge” is a “tick,” an advance in manufacturing process technology, to the ‘tock” that was the “Sandy Bridge” microarchitecture. To understand how “Ivy Bridge” got its name, it’s helpful to look back at how the company came up with “Sandy Bridge.” Harsat, who is based in Haifa, Israel, originally named the “Sandy Bridge” microarchitecture “Gesher,” the Hebrew word for “bridge.” The rationale, which he admits bypassed the geographical criteria for codenames, was that his team was responsible for defining a new generation of microarchitecture, or as Harsat saw it, “a bridge into the future.”</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1349813596077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:13:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349814062030-200</Id><Topic><Title>Closing price 21.90 or 21.87???</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1349813583125</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:13:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nevermind, google finally caught up to speed 20 minutes late...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1349814062030</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349814500376-201</Id><Topic><Title>$21.86!!!</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1349811107299</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:31:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a little gnat along with your other aliases: pumpwad and lucifer nuff.

LOL!!!! Tuesday, October 09, 2012 Big Bird Is Mad At Obama: Sesame Workshop Requests Obama's 'Big Bird' Ad Be Taken Down By Susan Duclos Barack Obama has gone from being incompetent to becoming ridiculous as the latest ad from his campaign, which is being roundly criticized by the Obama media outlets like MSNBC, Politico and others, which uses Big Bird, in reference to Romney's debate comments about PBS funding. Big Bird is not amused. Via Sesame Workshop: Sesame Workshop is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization and we do not endorse candidates or participate in political campaigns. We have approved no campaign ads, and as is our general practice, have requested that the ad be taken down. After being trounced in the first debate by Mitt Romney, which was on domestic policy, and was turned into a 90 minute list of Obama's failed policies with no rebuttal by Obama except nodding like he was in agreement with the list of failures Romney rattled off, the Obama campaign has unbelievably decided that talking about Big Bird and Elmo, beats the hell out of talking about plans to turn the economy around. The next debate adds in the topic of Foreign Policy, which is another area the Obama campaign doesn't want to discuss after their debacle of a response to the terror attack in Libya against our consulate, safe house and the murder of four American diplomats. The lack of security, decreasing security even after the U.S. mission asked for it to be increased, lying for days after the attack until details emerged and forced them to admit it was a terrorist attack. Ignoring the warnings... etc... So many mistakes with still more coming out as the investigation proceeds.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1349822070184</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 18:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349822168603-238</Id><Topic><Title>Leave Big Bird Alone!</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349354234026</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:37:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally's "Bigbird backlash" has indeed begun.

Both the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 indexes broke support near their September lows suggesting a potential intermediate trend change to the downside. The good news is that both the DJIA and the S&amp;P 500 held up relatively well and the volume was light. The overall uptrend stayed intact. The S&amp;P 500 has support in the 1430 area, its late September low, followed by the 1425 area, its 50-day moving average. As long as the earnings aren't too bad, expect dip buyers to step in when those support areas are first tested. Overall, expect more choppy moves with a downside bias as stocks aren't oversold yet. It's a market for traders to buy on dips and sell on rips. have a nice evening</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1349826163915</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349826218054-251</Id><Topic><Title>At $20 I am on this like white on rice.</Title><Username>barneylipps</Username><Timestamp>1349812714934</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:58:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brown rice is better for you.

ARM is way too slow to ever be used in enterprise except maybe for very small businesses who want a micro-server. Big business will be 100x better off with a powerful chip and 15 virtual servers in one box than 15 separate ARM servers. Also, Intel can make (and is making) a competitor to arm. Once MSFT ports their software to ARM it will more than likely also run on the INTC chip (as well as snapdragons and tegras) thus providing instant usability. INTC however will never lose their enterprise space to any of the above competitors. The only competitor in enterprise is AMD and they are drowning in debt.</Msg><Username>thejumpingsheep</Username><Timestamp>1349832308176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 21:25:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349833560908-265</Id><Title>Wall Street Continues to Beat Tech Like a Drum</Title><Msg>Wall Street continues to beat not just Intel but most of tech like a drum. They will use money and leverage to drive it down below any sensible valuation and then they will ride it back up. When the smoke clears a whole lot of average investors will be separated from their money and will exit the stock market forever. If something isn't done to protect the average investor from the big money #$%$, the integrity of the markets will be permanently damaged. There are already quite a few who think the game is rigged and with good reason. The only answer is to support reasonable regulation of Wall Street and reasonable disclosure of hedge fund trading activity. Write the SEC, your representatives in Washington and the media. Do it often. Pretty much all Intel longs just sat and did nothing while Wall Street was viciously assaulting the stock price.

As is Hewlett Packard, which is one of Intel's largets customers. What's your guess though about the stock in the next 12 months? We may see lower lows, or not. But how high do you think the stock could reach in the next 12 months. Needless to say, I did add a little more to my position today, because the downgrade by S.B. did not make much sense. I'm wondering if we will see 52 week high again in the next 12 months, given the fact that Intel just recently dropped a big one with a downward revision in guidance. And no certainly for Q4. Many say that Windows 8 will not help much, but I think that's not true. Microsoft I'm sure is looking to make the most out of Intel's processing power.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1349835285929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:14:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349835503751-272</Id><Title>Will Intel see 28 again in the next 3 years?</Title><Msg>Serious replies only, please.

From DavidA2 If anyone wants to estimate Medfield's die size, check out Doug Davis's presentation at Computex 2011. I counted 36 chips on one side and ~40 at the other side when I did the analysis. That equates to: 8.3mm x 7.5mm = 62.3mm2 That makes sense since Cedarview is 56mm2. Although its dual core, its less integrated than Medfield. I did estimate Cedarview to be similar in size to Medfield so it might too be under 60mm2.
