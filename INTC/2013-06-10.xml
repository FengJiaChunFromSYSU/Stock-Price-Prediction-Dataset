It was HTML5 based. It failed miserably after six months, and then the the president at the time said that they were getting out of the PC market and that the PC division was up for sale. Here's the short story, the PC stayed and he was replaced by Meg Witman. HP isn't a company that can afford to explore new architectures quite like the article suggested. If you want to know about the great misinformation ARM will be promoting in the future, I believe it will be in four parts. #1. HP, Apple. Lenovo, Dell , Asus, Acer (insert computer manufacturer here) is sick of Wintel. #2. Compatibility issues with Android/ iOS will cause consumers to reject Intel based devices. #3. (My favorite-The AMD myth carried over to ARM) ARM has this amazing new processor that is 16nm FinFET that is coming out next year. It will magically leapfrog ARM over Intel and put them two years ahead of Intel. It's a secret new 450mm fab that is opening soon. They are getting nearly 100% yield and will sell the new processors for $5 each. #4. ARM 64 is what Apple is waiting on to go entirely ARM in their product line. The BS never ends.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370844186953</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 02:03:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370847435710-3</Id><Topic><Title>Video of Lenovo K900 and Samsung S4 Octa running AnTuTu benchmark side by side</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370827922855</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 21:32:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looking at the video now, but right away I notice that Lenovo K900 looks like the coolest and sexiest phone out of the 4.

That would make this upswing the second longest on record, behind only the 10-year period that spanned the 1990s. The average since the end of World War II is just shy of five years, at 58 months. Reflecting the slow, steady pace of the recovery, payrolls rose 175,000 last month, in line with the average over the past year, Labor Department figures released on June 7 showed. S&amp;P Prediction “If the economy keeps expanding for the next three to five years, earnings will go up and the stock market will go up,” said Allen Sinai, chief executive officer of Decision Economics Inc. in New York. He said the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index may rise as high as 1,750 later this year and could hit 2,000 in 2015. The stocks benchmark was at 1,643.38 at 4 p.m. on June 7.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370859535835</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 06:18:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370861847799-7</Id><Topic><Title>Article just posted on yahoo "HP sick of Wintel"</Title><Username>mark.steffenhagen</Username><Timestamp>1370831805552</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 22:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was a case of over and under.

According to these dimmmwads, the Dow should be 6000 now because that was their prediction if the nation did the unthinkable and re-elected the illegal alien OB. Of course since fuxed up news told them that Romney would win, they were telling all their family and friends how it was everyone hated him and he would not even win 10 states. Ricky sucktelli on CNBC did his rant of hate toward the Pres and he is still working but he is not talking about the Pres anymore. Ricky sees the DOW up and he of course knows he has made some really dumb predictions. Oh yeah--and remember Romney and the GOP saying that OB had locked America's oil up and we needed to drill baby drill drill? Well funny thing is that we have the international Oil experts saying America will be oil independent in 7 years. And the GOP want to attack Ob for being weak on defense but then they have to stand their and defend him on his massive use of drones to kill terrorists as the left attacks him for doing so. Intel to 40 this year and the Dow to new record highs each month and your rightwing rants are growing more funny each day. Eat sheet and die you rightwing wooosssey boys and girls.

The numbers are striking. The month of peak was 12.6 million barrels a day in October 2006 and ... now it's under six, and by late 2012 totaled 6.8 million bpd," Morse said in an interview. Since 2006, U.S. oil field production of crude, plus natural gas liquids and bio-fuels has grown by three million barrels a day, about the same as the total output of Iran, Iraq, or Venezuela. In the same period, Canadian production has grown by 510,000 barrels a day. "The impact of this extraordinary production growth is becoming increasingly apparent and even if the growth rate subsides in the years ahead the mushrooming impacts of this growth will have dramatic impacts," the report said. "A half decade from now combined US and Canadian output will be in surplus of projected needs. Over the next five years, demand for natural gas in the US should catch up with supply, opening up unexpected opportunities in transportation and igniting a re-industrialization of the country." Lucky for Romney he ran on OB locking up american oil. Losers alway cry the loudest right. Rant? I tell you the truth and you cannot take it.

By Mark Knapp | More Articles June 10, 2013 new iMac There may be a lot of attention going to new software and new MacBooks, which have been anticipated at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, but another item might be worth noting, even if it doesn’t show up this week. While Monday marks the beginning of WWDC, and there will surely be lots to look forward to from Apple at the event, KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo believes there is another product right around the corner, and it might not be shown at WWDC. Kuo thinks Apple has another new iMac almost ready. Is Apple now a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity? Click here to get your 24-page Ultimate Cheat Sheet to Apple’s Stock now!

With the new iMac in the lineup, Apple could increase its sales of the computers by about 2.3 million units. Apple had iMac sales of 1.75 million units in the first calendar quarter, and Kuo estimates the second quarter — ending in June — will reach only 650,000 shipments of the computer. With the new iMac, Kuo thinks Apple predicts Apple will reach 4.7 million shipments for the full calendar year. This would be a 31 percent increase over last year. The big thing expected to come from the new iMacs is the inclusion of the latest chips from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Haswell processors could be a major source of attention for the next iMac because of their expected high performance and lower power-consumption.

Lipacis’s note follows a wave of positive and negative reports last week following presentations by Intel at the Computex computer trade show in Taipei, Taiwan, where the company discussed its “Haswell” processor family for PCs, but also announced its “Atom” family of chips has been selected by Samsung Electronics (005930KS) to power the next “Galaxy Tab” ten-inch tablet computer. Writes Lipacis, it seems as if there is something of a “resurrection” underway for the old Wintel empire of Intel and Microsoft (MSFT): We observe that Tablet cannibalization of Notebook PCs has occurred on the historical Notebook price curve, as Intel and Microsoft appeared content to stay in the high end of the personal computing market. We are incrementally more positive on Intel, Microsoft and PC OEMs as we believe that their increased focus on lower priced MPUs and OS has a chance to reverse the YoY decline in Wintel platforms this year. Without changing any estimates for Intel, Lipacis writes that he is encouraged about the prospects for upside for Intel in the second half of this year, given that Intel and Microsoft seem to have cast aside their position on the sidelines to “refocus on growth.” Lipacis cites some moves by Microsoft mentioned in media reports that may be helpful: In late February, Microsoft offered PC makers the deal of Windows 8 plus Office for $30 for touch-screen devices under 10.8 inches, according to one person fa</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370880245199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 12:04:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370880544589-79</Id><Topic><Title>Coinmaker</Title><Username>maxactionjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1370877714752</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:21:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody listens to coinmaker.

With next generation Xeon processors, dual workstation-class GPUs, Thunderbolt 2, PCIe-based flash storage, and ultra-fast ECC memory, the new 9.9-inch tall Mac Pro packs an amazing amount of power into an incredibly small package. "With the latest Xeon processors, dual FirePro GPUs, ECC memory, PCIe-based flash and Thunderbolt 2, all built around a revolutionary thermal core, the next generation Mac Pro is the most radical Mac yet," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. "All this performance and expandability is packed into a dramatic new design that's one-eighth the volume, and best of all, it will be assembled here in the USA." The next generation Mac Pro is architected around an ingenious unified thermal core that allows the desktop to efficiently share its entire thermal capacity across all the processors. The result is a pro desktop with breakthrough performance packed into a design that is one-eighth the volume of the current Mac Pro. Next generation Intel Xeon E5 processors with up to 12 core configurations deliver double the floating point performance. With two AMD FirePro workstation-class GPUs, the all-new Mac Pro is up to 2.5 times faster than the current Mac Pro and delivers up to an amazing 7 teraflops of compute power. The new Mac Pro also features PCIe-based flash storage that is up to 10 times faster than conventional desktop hard drives and includes the latest four-channel ECC DDR3 memory running at 1866 MHz to deliver up to 60GBps of memory bandwidth.* With all that pow</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370887652899</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 14:07:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370888792415-104</Id><Topic><Title>Apple WWDC 2013</Title><Username>dgalbers</Username><Timestamp>1370887264666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 14:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.

No new iGadgets. Not even a stinking iPhone 5s modest update. There was new hardware. Mac Book Air and a tease for the Mac Pro. All with Intel processors. I just sat and watched the presentation thinking of all the stuff they stole. iOS 7 should be named "Jelly Bean." Lots of catch up for Apple with Android, lots of reintroduction of software and services already commercially available. They are focusing heavily on user experience with touchy feely commercials that look more appropriate for Hallmark instead of Apple. Many of these so called user experiences I have on my Android phone. With aging hardware and catch up OS , software, and services from Apple the writing is on the wall for ARM. One of the world's most valuable companies who bet the farm on ARM is falling behind. The hardware by today's standards is competitive but not cutting edge. Instead of showing new ARM based hardware to the legions of drooling fans to wait in line for when introduced there is nothing. That most likely means no new istuff for the holiday season. Which very well could mean t hat this holiday season's iOS based device lineup can look much the same as last years. And that boys and girls is what an ARM fabrication crises looks like in the real world. Apple thought it was so innovative when it took to designing processors in house. A few short years later this where they are wasting everybody's time in things that could just as easily be handled in a press release. The only real "oh and ahs" came from the Haswell based Air announcement regarding battery life. The other nearly two hours of talk was a combination of "been there " and "done that." Meanwhile the newest hardware from Intel is out and Apple is taking orders. Spin this all you want ARM fans. This just looks horrible!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370894779478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 16:06:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370895678875-134</Id><Topic><Title>The magic eight ball says...</Title><Username>magic_stock_8ball</Username><Timestamp>1370891920012</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 15:18:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>amazing how an idiot with a magic eight ball can get it right better than most analysts.</Msg><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1370895678875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 16:21:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370897994198-135</Id><Title>Great Day for Intel!!!</Title><Msg>For Apple - not so much.

"Let me show it to you" "I want to share this with you, our closest friends." It sounded contrived. He tried to fake outrage "There are people using Android OS;s from 2010" he said in a whiny voice. There are still people using Windows 98, what's his point? Here's the thing that I can't help but think what possibly happened . Steve Jobs last conversation with Tim Cook. "Listen, Tim, I got this all laid out for you. Every year the A series processors will improve so don't worry about it. Just hold your press conference, show off the new iDevice like you just invented the cure for cancer, fill the first three rows with devoted employees and die hard fans. Find a celebrity to put up front and center of the first row. If none are available call Al Gore. Have an attitude that nobody else gets hip hardware like Apple. Give the tech bloggers 5 minutes to play with the product after the presentation. They will write glowing reviews about the product and make people so excited that they will wait in line for hours just to buy it. Then the media will show up and report live from the Apple Store and interview people waiting in line like they are actually doing something important. The hype machine will feed itself. In a few Apple will be so large and respected that foundries will be jumping all over themselves to give you the very best technology at the expense of the competition. The competition will be a generation behind in hardware because Apple will buy out the latest technology from the foundries. Just keep talking about how it's the user experience that's important as the stock climbs over $1500 a share."</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370906587330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 19:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370908949866-146</Id><Title>Intel will overtake ARM in the next few years because of battery life.</Title><Msg>ARM chips are power hogs compared to Intel chips.
