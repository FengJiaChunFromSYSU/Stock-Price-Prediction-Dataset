Topics such as datacenters, embedded platforms and Intel's next-generation Haswell platform will be the major segments Intel will be promoting. Several high-level executives from Intel including David Perlmutter, executive VP and General Manager of Intel Architecture Group, are expected to deliver speeches related to Intel's technology outlook at the show. Intel is also expected to explain more about its upcoming Haswell processors and will be promoting the CPUs' 10W power consumption design to further improve battery longevity and to allow thinner and lighter industrial designs for ultrabooks.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346937700033</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:21:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346938040525-19</Id><Title>Cramer dumping on INTC</Title><Msg>As I type.

Family First New Zealand is a political party which is anti-gay, anti-women's rights in fact anti-anything which is not mentioned in Deuteronomy. It claims that a “family friendly perspective with an emphasis on the Judeo-Christian values have benefited New Zealand for generations”. Ironically their logo is a koro which is an ancient Maori symbol for new beginnings, growth and harmony. Pagan symbols which represent new beginnings are not something you would usually expect from a conservative right group, which looks back to days when you could kill people and their goats for miffing your God. Family First New Zealand recently collected 50,000 signatures in desperate bid to stop the country allowing gay marriage. They handed out lots of slips with their domain name on so that people could read all about the terrible things that gays would do if they were legally allowed to be married. Unfortunately it seems that God, or the Devil, was against them. Someone in Family First New Zealand forgot to pay their domain name bill and the website listed on the slips was suddenly up for grabs. This was spotted by the pro-Marriage Equality movement which bought [withheld by Yahoo], they are automatically redirected to [withheld by Yahoo]. There instead of the usual calls to stone gay people in the public square for failing to act according to the will of a loving god, they can read a whole lot pro-marriage equality content. Cyber squattering is normally annoying, but it is nice when the forces of darkness finally get a kick in their intolerances.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346938290673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:31:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346938403991-21</Id><Topic><Title>Great Speech by Bill</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346912722832</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 02:25:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did he deifne what "is" is again ? did the stain on Monica's dress come up ? did he say how much he loved his wife ? did he take credit for what he and his buddy Greenspan did for the housing market ? they don't call him Slick for no reason.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1346938403991</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:33:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346938438105-22</Id><Topic><Title>Right-wing party loses to cyber squatter</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346938290673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:31:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure this upset the right-wing born-again Christians calling for a Taliban style of religious government in the US - otherwise known as the Republican Party...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346938438105</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346938466959-23</Id><Topic><Title>Sandra Flue the best ya got !??</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1346896922266</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:02:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"having to" ? come on an just admit it's all about gay rights for you. ww=csucker</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1346938466959</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346938625057-24</Id><Title>Oh, no - Wall Street's Biggest Firms Taking It in the Shorts</Title><Msg>Wall Street's heavy bets on doom and gloom not looking good today.

There is a paragraph on page 219 that creates the credit default swap and puts control under the commodites exchange (Senator Grassley requirement) rather than the SEC. "Mr. EWING (for himself, Mr. COMBEST, Mr. LEACH, Mr. LAFALCE, and Mr. BLILEY) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services, Commerce, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned" This bipartisan bill also generated the Enron loophole. If Senator Grassley had allowed credit derivatives to located under the SEC where they belonged, the damage would have likely been less. If you want to assign "blame" beyond those who lobbied for derivatives, then I would put high on my list: Lobbyist who pushed for credit derivatives Republican House (esp. Agriculture Committee Chairman) Republican Senate (esp. Agriculture Committee Chairman) Democratic President Clinton IF GWB had appointed strong regulators to Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC), the problem could have been reduced. The financial panic was a bipartisan effort where many players could have taken a stand and stopped it.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346944266660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:11:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346944605882-47</Id><Topic><Title>Picture of Motorola phone set to debut in London - SWEET looking phone</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1346937252795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:14:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Check the phone out on the knowyourmobile site.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1346944605882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346944893543-48</Id><Title>Election will be decided by tomorrow's job numbers</Title><Msg>All these speeches are meaningless.

Of the two major parties he was the best candidate last go around. This time he isn't. A middle class tax cut with far higher taxes on the wealthy doesn't sound like fair, it sounds like class warfare. Today they asked delegates at the DNC about corporate profits. Some of them said corporations should have profits, just lower prices. Do you agree with that? The pseudo-hippie message has gone on too long. Compared to Clinton Obama is a liberal extremist. Obama wants to run on a platform, but I will hold him to his record, and it sucks!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1346979420393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346979479148-108</Id><Topic><Title>His Finest Hour</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346962335420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 16:12:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I mean't to say "corporations should not have profits"</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1346979479148</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:57:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346981079028-109</Id><Topic><Title>Communism in Charlotte</Title><Username>ih8w8n</Username><Timestamp>1346952784643</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 13:33:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you of the Rep.

Andy Grove responded that if Intel wanted to be the largest company the next day, they could simply walk out to the curb and sell $100 bills for $99 each. Intel could remain the most profitable company and become the largest semiconductor company by revenue. The point is that Intel margin has increased due to shrinking Atom sales and they have the MCM costs incorporated in their plans. Intel will not flood the market, Intel WILL, however, set a strategic price watermark that will pressure exisitng vendors. MCM module costs are well understood and won't be a problem.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346981260273</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 21:27:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346982858166-111</Id><Topic><Title>How's Intel gonna stop Qualcom ?</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1346967722794</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:42:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the selling the ATM puts. The put options have the dividend premium adder and are easy to roll. The spread is never more than 2 cents and they seem to bring in about 20 to 30 cents per month.

During IDF in San Francisco, Intel will roll out new client and server products and initiatives to defend its turf in everything from ultrabooks to exascale supercomputers. It also will try to grab some territory in hot mobile markets like smartphones, tablets and the Internet of Things were it lacks a firm foothold today. Arch-rivals Advanced Micro Devices and ARM are setting up flanking actions all across the same terrain. Here’s a bit of what it looks like from our vantage point. Monday (Sept 10), AMD will host a press event to provide the first details about what it will do with the server technology it acquired with SeaMicro. We already know SeaMicro’s interconnect will form the basis of a follow on to HyperTransport AMD will name Freedom Fabric and try to make an industry standard for an ecosystem of x86 and ARM chips—a key plank for building big data center systems of all sorts As AMD prepares its advance, Intel is inviting press to a small group dinner Monday night with one of the heads of its server business. It has also put together a pre-briefing on its interconnect plans that will be announced Monday (Sept. 10). Intel’s acquisitions of Cray’s interconnect group and the Infiniband business of QLogic telegraphed Intel’s plans. Clearly, the company aims to bolster the proprietary Quick Path Interconnect on its processors to link clusters of CPUs for high performance computing and other uses in the cloud. The engineers at Hot Interconnects recently devoted a whole panel to speculating on Intel’s plans and their implications. At the panel a representative of the RapidIO trade group said it is pitching its technology as a standard for use on ARM server SoCs.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346984081969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 22:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346984704545-115</Id><Topic><Title>Intel forum is next front in x86 vs. ARM war</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346984081969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 22:14:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD? 3 dollar stock headed towards being delisted.
