The Chromebook is a "Race to the bottom" as one reviewer put it You simply give up way too much for it to be of any use to most people. If you're idea of a computer is a device to surf the web Chromebook is barely, and I do mean barely sufficient. Look at you bragging about six hours of battery life.

It seems that when everybody "knows" that a stock is ready to pop and poised for gains, somehow it either stays flat or declines.

Depending on retail channel reports in late August, it may start to go higher, but the real pop will be on earnings in October... That said, I hold a couple of in the money Jan 2014 and Jan 2015 calls for insurance in case I'm wrong, but... I don't think it breaks $25 pre June option expiration... In July I don't see it breaking $26... In late August, after option expiration with strong retail channel checks it may see a bump towards $27 And if earnings play out with positive guidance in October we can see $ 27+ JMHO, and I'd love to see my predictions labeled as too conservative...

I cannot predict that. For all I know Intel will have to sacrifice margins to establish a stronghold in mobile. That could postpone financial growth for an indefinite period. While I DO NOT subscribe to the Covello-Shah view of armageddon, you have to acknowledge where that is coming from: it represents the notion that Intel growth into mobile will be expensive and not necessarily all that lucrative. The smartphone chip market in tota is only about 10% of INTC total revenues, as I understand it. At what cost? The math makes me a little nervous about the new CEO and Presidemt...they seem obsessed with mobile, what may turn out to be a false premise. Ottelini's longer term "fundamentals" view made more sense to me. More like a respected company with standards rather than a "tabloid." I believe the only true growth in E and R can come from the internet of everything and success of PC's-Desktops in the ultrabook era and demand for servers, which is predicted to grow well over 10% in coming years, . This is why INTC wants to launch internet video...to stimulate the demand for server bandwidth. So...in guessing a high for the year we have to bet on hubris, or on the implications of Haswell family for the core business. There's eternal drag on INTC stock pps. So I'll go with $27 for the end of year...I'll have to buy back my January 2014 30's leaps.</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1370183086794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 10:24:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370183194044-20</Id><Topic><Title>Tell me your predictions for June:</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370180744834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 09:45:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the problem with being a numbers guy is that you miss structural changes in the technology. the problem with being a structural guy is that you miss the psychology that (unfortunately has proven useful) underpins the market.

The Octa is used in the GT-I9500 variant of the Galaxy S4 and is supposed to solve the problem of Cortex-A15 power consumption by using ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture. big.LITTLE allows the use of two core clusters, one for high-performance tasks and one for low-performance tasks. In the Octa, this is a quad-core Cortex-A15 cluster and a quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster, all built on 28nm. In big.LITTLE, there are supposed to be three modes for managing threads across all of the cores in both clusters. Evidence thus far suggests that the Octa really only supports one of these modes – the least efficient. Even worse, it appears that this limitation is due to crippled hardware in the SoC and not something that can be fixed in software" "According to Samsung, there is no hardware problem at all and the company chose cluster-migration because it “show[s] increased performance/efficiency.” But the statement does not match up with most people’s understanding of ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture. Moreover, ARM demonstrated core-migration working on a pre-release version of the Octa. And Samsung’s released kernel source code for the Octa includes the drivers for core-migration. But that code does not work in the final release version of the Octa and Samsung has been coy in giving a straight answer. Based on this, Linus Torvalds wrote:“quite frankly, the fact that the Exynos 5 currently only works in ‘either or’ configuration almost certainly means that there is something fundamentally wrong with the hardware design, to the point where no amount of ‘complex patches’ can fix it.” While this certainly makes it seem that Samsung has done something wrong in the Octa, the chip is still entirely based on designs from ARM. Torvalds goes on to point out, "</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370188588800</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 11:56:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370188784062-25</Id><Topic><Title>the Exynos 5 Octa, the chip may not be all it’s cracked up to be.</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370188588800</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 11:56:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>continued; "Torvalds goes on to point out, he has “very little reason to believe that ARM engineers got their cache handling right.

Moving the data around the system to remain coherent and wiggles some big transistors. Intel made a big change in the way they handle coherency in the 45nm Nehalem CPU which resulted in a big performance jump. Intel likely has a couple of patents on that design that will be generating some revenue if someone chooses to use. The other problem that will be interesting will be, if they operate in 4-big or in 4-little mode, what does the scheduler look like? When I push the start button does a little wake up or does a big wake up. If I start an app, does it chose the littles or does it chose the bigs? If I have 4 app running and 1 would like a big core and 3 would work fine with little cores, what does it chose. These are very hard problems to solve and ARM and those who design their own versions will have to do a lot of head scratching.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370193119595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 13:11:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370193160168-28</Id><Title>Long Intel is a smart play now.

James Cavello has a 14 price target on Intel still. So the Dow goes higher and could hit 20,000 before Obummer leaves office. Intel will have taken the majority of the smart phone chip market by then. Yet, Teabagger boy builds his end of the world bunker and buys gold. Before this year is done, Intel will have destroyed shorts. It was never gonna a be a real fight. Intel was always gonna win. It was just a matter of time you know. Intel 14 nm chips will make the other chip makers ROADKILL! Tell me shorty. When Intel has contracts with Samsung, Apple and a dozen others for phone chips, will you still be posting here or will you wonder to a new place where the stock sucks so that you can fit it into your set way of thinking. Yes--most men will not get a beautiful woman but I have one. Most men will not be born smart but I was. You think most people are mean but I think most people are nice. You think you need to defeat others to win but I know they can win and I can win at the same time. Life is not a football game you know. Go long Intel now and you will thank me this time next year. By the way--best place to live? Southern CA on the Beach. 4400 ft on Highway 50 CA in the Sierra Nevada forest. For pure party--Downtown Bangkok on Soi 8 Sukhumwit Top of the hill in Tokyo not far from Shibuya. Best girls? That is a matter of taste but Orange county Ca are best I think.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1370194915590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 13:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370195121992-31</Id><Title>Beware of this sick individual</Title><Msg>Here's a current list of his alias chump.weaver will_amd_yu backbay_bstn att4glte aintezbeingreen wdblawgrow wallisdreamweaver fourteennanometer itakebackmyapology dominateamerika singhlion2001 coinmaker77 jimbohomegameedyall aulus_vitellius_germanicus geraldmcginty</Msg><Username>iknow.whoyouare</Username><Timestamp>1370195121992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 13:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370195267220-32</Id><Topic><Title>Beware of this sick individual</Title><Username>iknow.whoyouare</Username><Timestamp>1370195121992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 13:45:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL your screename is HILARIOUS considering you clearly don't know who anybody is.

On the performance side, we are learning that ARM simply doesn't ramp very well as they try to counter Intel's superior performance. Samsung turning to Intel is good evidence of this. The big.little technology was nothing more than what ARM has to consider as a band-aid due to its lack of state-of-the-art fabrication. And we already know about the vast array of problems with ARM trying to move just a half-step to FinFET. The half-step is an effort by ARM to prevent Intel from just leaving them in the dust as they cycle down to 10, 7 and 5nm production. Intel is already actively working on 10nm production, due in 2015. If you throw in the problems ARM is having and will have with EUV and 450mm wafers, it's apparent that the technology and manufacturing hurdles are immense.

[Well, there is some pretty significant evidence that this might not be true if what you are talking about is reported earnings and revenue. The market is usually forward looking. It hasn't been the case with Intel - the market has been totally braindead but there are signs this is changing. We have already seen a break-down with ARM - twice recently and the latest is already over 5 bucks.This is almost totally from recognition of the increased competition from Intel. We have Altera and Samsung as clear indicators of the changing landscape. That ARM can drop by five bucks without Intel moving up by a large portion of that is a disconnect. ARM's loss is Intel's gain. More and more we are seeing signs of the tipping point and that it is being reached faster and faster. It's not about the delta - it's about the delta of the delta. We don't need quarterly results to continue this trend. Obviously ARM didn't need quarterly results for the bottom to start dropping out. We do need some huge press for it to happen. And that's what we are getting now. Really huge press relating to Haswell, Computex and the Samsung tablet deal. It could easily coalesce enough to result in a break out in the short-term.

The differentiations are mostly along target platforms and clock speeds, as these are all quad-core CPUs with HyperThreading. The price is around the $300 range, which is in line with typical upper-end CPUs. There will be a second announcement as relates to ultrabooks, the Core i3, Pentium and Celeron lines in a few days.

Migrating from A7 to A15 takes about 20,000 cycles to transfer state. I am going to have to dig a little further to see if they estimate the cycle cost of warming the new caches. It seems like so far that they are just putting the 20,000 cycles overhead on the state transfer. At 1GHz, you have a 20 microsecond state transfer time to the big CPU. You then have some time before the inbound cache is reasonably warmed up. The A15 is powered up. A15 caches are invalidated to clean them. A15 snooping is enabled A15 is provided with the register state of the outbound task A15 begins normal operation. A7 stays powered up to allow A15 data snoops to satisfy the data accesses from the A7 cache instead of memory.

Its brushed aluminum chassis is infused with a candy apple red and adorned with a stylish dragon tattoo on its wrist rest and lid. Depending on who you ask, it’s either striking and stylish or gaudy and extreme. One thing is certain: MSI has stuffed the GT70 with so much next-generation silicon and hardware that it’s screaming for your attention inside and out. The Specs: At its heart is the new fourth-generation (Haswell) Intel INTC +0.27% Core i7-4700MQ with a base clock of 2.40GHz, though it ramps up to 3.4GHz dynamically as needed. The next-gen hardware continues with NVIDIA’s GTX 780M, packed with 4GB of 256-bit GDDR5, a mobile graphics card which, as you’ll see below, makes the case for the GT70 becoming a desktop replacement. Also standard is 32GB of RAM and the GT70 Dragon Edition’s secret weapon: A 384GB boot drive comprised of three 128GB mSATA III SSDs in Super RAID 0. MSI claims insane read speeds of 1500MB/s. In the image below, the left chart depicts read/write speeds for a single OCZ Vertex 3 SSD present in my personal rig. On the right, actual results from my GT70 review sample. While it didn’t reach 1500MB/s, what it did achieve is nothing short of impressive: Suffice to say, installing frequently played games and creativity software on this drive results in ridiculously improved load times. Rounding out the specs is a 6x Blu-Ray read/write combo drive, a 1TB secondary hard drive, Killer Wireless-N gaming card with Bluetooth 4.0, and a beautiful full HD 17.3″ matte LCD screen. Said screen can be complimented by three external displays, as the rear of the laptop hides Mini-DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA outputs. All displays — including the GT70′s internal one — can be in use simultaneously. I love matte displays and this one is premium with great color depth...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229151966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370229313820-57</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons Article on Intel</Title><Username>donalhump</Username><Timestamp>1370219881492</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 20:38:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I put my order for 1000K shares today.</Msg><Username>engrjohn</Username><Timestamp>1370229313820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:15:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370229500096-58</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: MSI GT70 Dragon Edition Review: The First Haswell And GTX 780M Laptop Is A Hit</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229151966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More: I didn’t spend much time with synthetic benchmarks; the SSD test and the above PCMark 7 test were proof positive that the GT70 was a speed demon.

After 5 hours of running Heaven 4.0 on its most demanding settings, the internal GPU temperature maxed out at 91 degrees Celsius, but the heat dissipation didn’t reflect that temperature. MSI’s Cooler Booster 2 tech makes a genuine impact by connecting the CPU and GPU cooling systems via a thermal bridge. Once either component gets hotter, the system transfers the heat to the opposite side faster. In simpler terms, even lefties aren’t going to get their mouse hand fried by the exhaust, and the external keyboard temperature remained within levels that wouldn’t impact gaming. I honestly expected the system to melt with so much next-generation silicon inside, but the chassis didn’t even approach levels I’d call hot, even after stress-testing the system.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229500096</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:18:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370229525223-59</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: MSI GT70 Dragon Edition Review: The First Haswell And GTX 780M Laptop Is A Hit</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229151966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still more: The Bottom Line: If you do take the plunge on the GT70 Dragon Edition 2, consider buying from PowerNotebooks instead of directly through MSI. The guys at PowerNotebooks strip out all of MSI’s bloatware (Norton? No thanks!) and add a wealth of choices like preferred version of Windows OS, and the option of swapping out your optical drive for an additional SSD or HDD. The onslaught of Haswell and GTX 780M-equipped notebooks is only just beginning, and there will be no shortage of compelling hardware to evaluate. But MSI’s GT70 Dragon Edition 2 is first out of the gate, and while it comes with a steep pricetag, it more than justifies it in performance and features. If portable gaming is your gig and the bold design choices appeal to you, then you can’t go wrong here.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229525223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:18:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370229592795-60</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: MSI GT70 Dragon Edition Review: The First Haswell And GTX 780M Laptop Is A Hit</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229151966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The onslaught of Haswell and GTX 780M-equipped notebooks is only just beginning, and there will be no shortage of compelling hardware to evaluate."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370229592795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:19:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370229800285-61</Id><Title>In Advance of Computex</Title><Msg>PC manufacturers announced machines that are cooler, smaller and faster Sunday in advance of Computex. The new machines feature Intel's speedier fourth-generation Core processors, code-named Haswell, which Intel announced Saturday. Asus, Cyberpower, and MicroCenter announced all-in-ones, gaming laptops and desktops running Haswell, while major PC makers like Dell, Acer, and others expected to follow with more Haswell announcements in the coming days. Many new PCs will be on display at the Computex trade show in Taipei, which opens Tuesday. The announcements came on the heals of Intel announcing its first fourth-generation quad-core Core i7 and i5 chips based on Haswell. Intel is expected to announce more Haswell processors at Computex.

No Windows laptop before it had ever been quite so thin, beautiful and robust, and while the S7 could clearly match aesthetics with Apple's MacBook Air, it also had a distinctive design of its own. Looking to build on that success, Acer today introduced an upgraded Aspire S7-392 ultrabook, powered by Intel's latest Haswell chips, as well as a new Aspire S3 line that compromises a bit on style to deliver more power.

In order for a fourth-generation Core processor-powered notebook to be considered an Ultrabook, it must offer WiDi, voice control and sport a touch screen display. The system should also be able to wake from sleep in less than 3 seconds, offer more than 7 days of standby battery life, be able to idle for 9 hours on Windows 8, and provide more than 6 hours of HD video playback. Beyond that, an Ultrabook should also offer anti-virus and anti-malware protection, include Intel’s Anti-Theft and Identity Protection Technology and be less than 23mm thick. As part of its focus on 2-in-1 devices, the Ultrabook standard will also include more convertible designs.
