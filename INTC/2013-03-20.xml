In this article in addition to not making any sense he states: "I understand Ashraf's argument about short sellers circling ARM, based on valuation, and the short interest could be adding something to the stock's current price because, as was said over a century ago, "He who sells what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to pris'n." This is a much more fundamental call." The curious thing about this statement is that DL has recently written a letter to the US Copyright Office in which he tries to convince them to allow him to take ownership of "orphan works" although he doesn't own them and hasn't paid for them. In addition he lectures the Copyright Office like they are the village idiots and uses other professional phrasing like "because its owner is a zombie". The only thing missing was his signing it "tooo funnny" at the end. You can find the letter by doing a Google search on "Dana F Blankenhorn". It will be at the top. His cup of hypocrisy runneth over. But we knew that. In the meantime, Intel is up two bucks since November while ARM is down two bucks in the last 9 days. DL has been on the wrong side of both of them. It is fairly certain that if you take DL's advice you will be able to duplicate his losses...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363752646869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 00:10:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363752830330-3</Id><Title>Why INTC could fall 40% from here</Title><Msg>Mar 14, 2013 BRYANT ANDY DOfficer 1,064 Direct Disposition (Non Open Market) at $21.49 per share. 22,865 r 6, 2013 KILROY THOMAS MOfficer 54,486 Direct Automatic Sale at $21.99 per share. 1,198,147 Mar 3, 2013 JAMES RENEE JOOfficer 32,440 Direct Automatic Sale at $21.08 per share. 683,835 Feb 24, 2013 HOLT WILLIAM MOfficer 38,928 Direct Automatic Sale at $20.52 per share. 798,802 eb 21, 2013 OTELLINI PAUL SOfficer 148,817 Direct Disposition (Non Open Market) at $20.30 per share. 3,020,985 Feb 21, 2013 JAMES RENEE JOOfficer 50,546 Direct Disposition (Non Open Market) at $20.30 per share. 1,026,083 Feb 21, 2013 BRYANT ANDY DOfficer 65,228 Direct Disposition (Non Open Market) at $20.30 per share. 1,324,128 Feb 21, 2013 KILROY THOMAS MOfficer 50,546 Direct Disposition (Non Open Market) at $20.30 per share. 1,026,083 I can't even get em all on the list, there's so many.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Samsung VP of Mobile Lee Young Hee told Bloomberg that “we’ve been preparing the watch product for so long,” so a Samsung SmartWatch is definitely in the works. But Hee wouldn’t give any more details past the fact that Samsung is trying hard to bring the watch to the market. Sources told Reuters that the Samsung SmartWatch will “perform many of the tasks of a smartphone.” Last week, Samsung unveiled its newest flagship smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Earlier this month, Bloomberg was out with another report that unveiled more details about Apple’s souped-up watch and said that the product could arrive by the end of 2013. That article suggested the “iWatch,” which reportedly could make calls, check caller ID, show map coordinates and carry a built-in pedometer and health monitoring sensors. We haven’t heard much from Microsoft in terms of a SmartWatch, but the Redmond software giant actually tried to get involved in the space about a decade ago. Right around the time that Microsoft was trying to get us to use the first generation of Tablet PCs, the company was also pushing the concept of smart watches — wireless devices that displayed information such as news headlines, sports scores, gas prices and weather. The project was officially retired last year when Microsoft shut down the service that powered the devices via FM transmissions.

Bedard sketched out the history of the DRAM and flash manufacturing business, saying that the DRAM business had seen many players who had become consolidated to just three: Hynix, Micron and Samsung. "When I first started at Micron, there were about 40 to 50 DRAM companies in the space," said Bedard. "And we spent most of the '80s with the Japanese deciding they wanted to own the DRAM space which they went from 10 per cent market share to about 90 per cent, [and] took all of the US companies out except for two, us and Texas Instruments. "We spent most of the '90s with the Koreans deciding they wanted to go to gain market share in the DRAM space. So they went from virtually non-existent in the '80s to about 65 per cent of market share in the '90s, and we wiped out all the Japanese except for one [Elpida]. And we wiped out the last remaining US-based DRAM company [Texas Instruments], so there were two of us. We [the USA] still had one. "During that period of time, the Europeans consolidated down to one company as well: Qimonda. So we were left with Elpida Group, a Qimonda Group, Micron in the US and two Koreans. We got into this last decade [and] we saw the Taiwanese decide they wanted to be in the DRAM business. We had two fairly weak players financially - Elpida and Qimonda - and they were willing to trade out their technology that they have been developing to allow the Taiwanese to come into the space. "[The] Taiwanese over about a six-year period spent $20bn. Today, they’re virtually all gone or we control them. They still have $14bn, which is all getting written off. So all this 30 years has been some mechanism of consolidation to where today. We’re staring in the face of three remaining DRAM companies: us, Samsung and Hynix."

It is unlikely that all the information he is using is correct. Even Tom's Hardware suggests that "the Haswell-based machine just looks like it needs a little tuning" page 2. You might start at the SiSoftware Sandra website that contains some more information on both the benchmark and some of the new Haswell features. SiSoftware seems to be working on soom analysis of new Haswell features (FMA, AVX2 integer extenstions, TSX, ...) and will be providing some measurements. SiSoftware on TSX which points out that TSX will offer "significant improvement" in MP concurrency which is multiple cores working on the same data. It is pretty good reading. Final Thoughts / Conclusions We have seen in the preliminary testing that TSX does deliver what it was designed to do: • It is relatively straight-forward to replace classic software locks with TSX versions. Applications can implement it now using exiting compilers by using a little assembler. • TSX locks using HLE will run with no appreciable performance delta on legacy CPUs - not better but no worse. • TSX appears to provide significant improvement in concurrency - and thus performance - on TSX-capable CPUs which is very important as the number of threads and cores continues to increase in modern CPUs. • Once operating systems will be updated to use it, the performance of the OS as well as locking API should improve. New locking APIs will be provided to allow applications easy ways to use TSX.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1363774126127</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 06:08:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363774928809-20</Id><Topic><Title>'Lackluster Haswell Muddies Intel's Future'</Title><Username>aye_corumba</Username><Timestamp>1363767758982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 04:22:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No assembly needed .... just a new version of the gcc or Intel icc compiler. gcc v4.7 •Support for the new Intel processor codename Haswell with AVX2, FMA, BMI, BMI2, LZCNT is available through -march=core-avx2. gcc v4.8 Support for the Intel RTM and HLE intrinsics, built-in functions and code generation is available via -mrtm and -mhle options.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1363774928809</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 06:22:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363778343523-21</Id><Title>InVehicle Infotainment (IVI): Intel Atom power for new Mercedes S Class</Title><Msg>Mercedes has previewed the interior of its new S-Class luxury car. And it's dominated by a pair of foot-wide LCD panels. The new limo also gets Google-enhanced sat nav, a digital perfume system and much, much more. In-car LCD screens have been gradually growing larger and larger in recent years. Tesla sticks a huge 17-inch panel in the Model S's dash, for instance. But the big brands tend to be a bit more conservative about this kind of thing. So the new S-Class's pair of ultra-wide 8:3 aspect, 12.3-inch LCD displays is something a bit special. One does the duties of the driver's instruments while the other serves up the infotainment features, including navigation, entertainment, vehicle information, apps and more. No touchy Mercedes describes the screens as high definition but hasn't divulged the precise resolution. As with all previous Mercedes cars with the COMAND system, the screens are controlled with a rotary dial. There's no touch functionality. What there is, however, is an optional pair of COMAND monitors for the rear seats. While we're on the subject of COMAND, it gets a major overhaul for the new S in the shape of 30 million new lines of code. Which is just as well, COMAND was beginning to feel a bit clunky. What's more, increased processing power comes in the form of Intel's Atom processor, which should help drive those big screens smoothly. The navigation, meanwhile, is enhanced by Google Maps technology and Merc's excellent Drive Kit Plus app interface for iPhones makes another appearance. All very impressive. ..........

ARM is taking over first with tablets and phones and then PC's and servers. Most articles we read today about Intel are missing the words "AMD" unless it is historical in nature. Why? AMD really isn't a threat anymore. But every article we read about ARM mentions Intel. If Intel wasn't really a threat to ARM, wouldn't it not be mentioned? Windows 8 RT made a big splash in the market. Well, at least the sound of a big turd hitting the water in the bowl. Many haven't noticed that ARM first entry into the PC space wasn't the wild success that they had hoped for last year. That was phase one, phase 2 was servers. Meanwhile there is a hand written note on white paper on Paul Otelinni's desk. "Welcome! This isn't a hard job, just do the following. 1. Protect server sales at all costs 2. Maintain margins 3. Destroy competition whenever you get a clear shot. 4. If you want to make Koreans really nervous, put out a leak about A series processors for Apple! And for the record, if Intel does drop 40% from here, sell every asset you own, borrow every dime you can find and buy as much Intel stock as you possibly purchase. You're going to be very rich.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1363792978667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:22:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363793036226-56</Id><Topic><Title>Get latest Information in INTC</Title><Username>josephgray404</Username><Timestamp>1363381440673</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 17:04:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this report</Msg><Username>carlmoore584</Username><Timestamp>1363793036226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:23:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363793227583-57</Id><Title>Why is a Turd a better buy than Intel?</Title><Msg>This one is easy.

The combo order appears to be bid at a 60 cent debit. They are paying 60 for each $22 CALL/$21 PUT pair. They are expecting volatility shortly after the APR 16 earnings so the APR 20th option expiration covers the earnings announcment. They have 6,000 contracts so far (600,000 shares) and they are betting on Intel trading above $22.60 or below $20.40. The effect of the order is to trigger the PUT buys when INTC goes up (puts get cheaper) and trigger the CALL buys when INTC goes down. That should drive narrow trading price and pressure INTC toward the price where the option premium for the two is highest ... $21.50. Hmmm. That would be my guess would be a $21.50 closing price.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1363793695832</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363793772230-63</Id><Topic><Title>aladiesright, coinmaker, too funny, pcrandallfinance, lucy _nuff, etc</Title><Username>jj88810</Username><Timestamp>1363717339159</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 14:22:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't forget necromancer1215</Msg><Username>lazyeight</Username><Timestamp>1363793772230</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363793776606-64</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's set-top box will use motion control</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363792511141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:15:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meant to type "controller" instead of "control".

"We believe Apple could add roughly $5B-$6B/yr in revenue for Intel but is unlikely to be a foundry customer this year or next," said Richard, who follows Intel closely, in a research note today. Even the Intel bashers won't rule it out - Apple is still 100% depending on Samsung - even over the next couple years but Samsung is not considered by Apple for 20nm (at least to my knowledge). So while Samsung is being phased out Intel might be being phased in. The 2015 time line is very similar with ALTR. As far as I understand Apple is not using ARM for GPU. Paul O once mentioned that both Intel and Apple have in common laying out a "good" portion of the design "by hand". Maybe they can merge an x86design with Apple GPU.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363798997878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:03:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363799112741-86</Id><Topic><Title>Sell this stock</Title><Username>shoathai</Username><Timestamp>1363786884812</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not looking to help shorty.

Also, there's no doubt that "Haswell" APU (Accelerated Processing Unit, CPU+GPU+Northbridge) suffered through several delays as the company shifted its engineering focus on building mobile parts, where Intel has less than one percent of market share. Given the shift in engineering focus, we were not surprised not to see Haswell availability pushed to the summer of 2013, with the launch of Haswell-based parts between IDF China 2013 and the Computex Taipei 2013. Rumors that Haswell will have issues with USB 3.0 are just that - rumors, while the rumor that Intel is going with a non-upgradable BGA package is coming to "half-truth". Tom's Hardware Guide recently posted a detailed pre-review of Core i7-4770K, Intel's top of the line Haswell part. For explanation, you need to look at the table below: Going forward, Intel also decided not to allow full 40 Execution Units (40 EU) in an LGA socket. If you want premier graphics experience from Intel, you have to purchase an appropriate notebook. In our conversations with leading game developers, we received interesting information. We took one piece of Skype conversation which we can publish, under condition of anonymity: "Haswell is another Intel (product). They always promise, and never deliver. It is not about performance in a synthetic (benchmark) it is about (that) they don't support essential features we need and don't need to worry about compatibility on (our) code. Fusion, Radeon and GeForce have it all covered and if we have issues they resolve them or work (with us). Forget it they live in a mobile world right now."</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363804367640</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:32:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363804537440-94</Id><Topic><Title>Why is a Turd a better buy than Intel?</Title><Username>pcrandallfinance</Username><Timestamp>1363793227583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:27:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By all means, keep shorting it then if you're that confident in the downtrend lines will hold for you.

Now with a single leak and a whole lot of testing by our friends over at Tomshardware, we have gotten a pretty definite view of the next gen Haswell processor. This is a chip that Intel wants to place everywhere - a CPU tailored towards everything from energy-saving tablets to power-sucking servers. As such Haswell, which will be replacing Ivy Bridge as the latest i3/i5/i7 in traditional desktop/laptop markets, is Big Blue's most important release since Core 2 debuted seven years ago. The future is mobile and the present increasingly futuristic. Haswell will still debut in desktops and then laptops, this being as much to give Intel more time to tweak its A-list Core architecture for a successful foray into low-power tablet land, as it is to please enthusiasts. Either way, Tomshardware managed to get their paws on the top model of what will seems set to the last socketed i7 for at least a while . Their i7 4770K Engineering Sample gives us a huge insight into performance. While overclocking was off the cards, and there's the usual raft of 'this is an ES' and 'the BIOS is early' dislaimers, their results show an impressive chip. All in all then, Haswell is turning out to be even less surprising than Ivy Bridge; it is the very definition of evolutionary. The only twists are in Intel's slowly tightening grip around the throat of the x86 processor market, as top-end competition from AMD becomes a distant memory. With all that having been said, Haswell looks to be a fine chip and if you need the power it should be available with (or even in) a shiny new LGA-1150 socket motherboard early June. pcauthority</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363808038490</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 15:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363808185337-102</Id><Title>"Intel biggest Bargain" -Fort Pitt</Title><Msg>Go to the summery for Intel on Yahool, find the related video.

Judging by the company's fundamentals, however, there really is nothing justifying its absurdly high valuation multiples. ARM's latest earnings report is relatively unimpressive. It shows that revenue and earnings grew at a rate of 16% and 18% respectively in FY 2012. While those numbers may seem high, they still do not justify such a high valuation. What's worse is that they show a marked decline from 2011's revenue and EPS growth rate of 24% and 33%. What about the possibility of accelerating earnings growth in the future? While the relatively weak earnings report can be attributed in part to global economic uncertainty, judging by the current state of affairs in the semiconductor industry, I would still say that those prospects seem nary to none.

However, what many consumers, and apparently investors, fail to realize is that Windows RT and Windows 8 devices are two very different products. Contrary to popular belief they are not substitute goods. Windows RT devices are built to be cheap, lightweight and relatively portable. However, one major caveat is that Windows RT is not backwards compatible with the 4 million existing Windows programs that have been built for the x86 instruction set. It is clear that the lack of backwards compatibility with x86 programs has taken its toll on Windows RT sales. If that wasn't bad enough, Samsung, HP and Toshiba have canceled their plans to manufacture RT devices, and it looks like Acer may follow suit.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363812485240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:48:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363812530848-114</Id><Topic><Title>Is ARM Holdings Fairly Valued?</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363812456846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:47:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM Is No Longer the Sole Contender In the Mobile Space While ARM may face significant barriers to entry in Intel's segment of the market, Intel faces no such constraints. Most smartphones and tablets, which comprise the brunt of ARM's revenue, make use of virtual machines to run applications. This means that application developers do not need to program with a specific instruction set in mind, but simply need to make their programs compatible with the virtual machine. Google , which currently claims around 60% of the mobile OS Market, has partnered with Intel to make Android's Dalvik Virtual Machine compatible with the x86 instruction set. A number of phones running Intel Atom SoCs have already hit markets, and it seems that more will follow. ZTE, the 4th largest manufacturer of Android devices, announced a line of phones and tablets running on Atom SoCs, and, if the benchmarks of the Z2580 are indeed accurate, it is inevitable that other manufacturers will follow suit.

Xolo claims that its X1000 is the fastest Android phone as of now, eclipsing performances of even HTC One X, which has a quad core processor. Xolo even showed Linpack benchmark results that the performance of X1000 was far better than the Samsung Galaxy Grand. This claimed speed of Xolo X1000 comes from the Intel Atom processor, which has hyper threading technology and a clockspeed of 2 GHz. There is also a healthy 1 GB RAM in the X1000. The Galaxy Grand comes with a dual core 1.2 GHz processor, which is supported by 1 GB RAM. The combination is decent and the performance is thus decent as well. But at times, while playing graphics heavy games, the phone showed just a hint of slackness, which we had also pointed out in our review. Though we cannot say much about the Xolo X1000's performance at this time, but prime facia it looks like the Xolo handset has an upper hand vis-a-vis performance as compared to the Galaxy Grand.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363814172768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363814221825-126</Id><Title>East Leaves as National Champ</Title><Msg>But leaves the cupboard bare for the next guy.

While speaking at a media briefing in Delhi, Director of Product Management &amp; Pricing (Asia-Pacific) for Intel, Leighton Phillips said that both the fourth generation of Core processors and Atom processors from lntel, to be released in 2013, would improve power consumption and performance in devices. Intel also revealed that its partners intended to launch around ten smartphones this year powered by Intel processors. Phillips reiterated Intel’s focus on mobile computing by talking about how the new Atom Clover Trail+, Lexington and the upcoming 22nm Bay Trail processors would provide both power saving and performance in smartphones. He elaborated on the Atom Lexington processors saying that these processors were especially designed for low power consumption and would power devices in the “value smartphone market segment.” It was revealed that Intel was working with Acer, Lava and Safaricom to produce more smartphones for both premium and budget segments. Phillips also talked about Intel’s tablet strategy and how the quad-core Bay Trail processor that would power both Windows and Android tablets, would be the fastest Atom processor that Intel had ever produced. The first Bay Trail powered tablets are expected to hit markets by the last quarter of 2013 and will be made by companies such as Compal, ECS, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron. Phillips further stated that the first ultrabooks running Intel’s 4th generation of Core processors (code named- Haswell) would also be launched this year. He claimed that these new processors would enable ultrabooks to run the entire day on a single charge providing up to 9 hours of battery life. He added that Intel had also incorporated new processors to the existing 3rd generation Core processors (Ivy Bridge) that had a low power consumption of #$%$ thinkdigit</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363817598719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 18:13:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363818232016-133</Id><Title>Intel rising in embedded systems</Title><Msg>Intel is in and DSPs are history when it comes to single-board computers and embedded systems, according to vendors at the recent Embedded Tech Trends 2013 show here.
