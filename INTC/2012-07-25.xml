Maybe you are the problem...LOL ...itching to buy ASML... you probably loaded up on AMAT SAP achieved record software revenue in the second quarter, exceeding €1 billion. All regions posted double-digit software revenue gains. Demand for SAP's new innovation categories continued to accelerate: Cloud momentum continued with a 112% increase year-on-year in 12 month new and upsell subscription billings for SuccessFactors on a stand-alone basis. SAP's strong combination with SuccessFactors is allowing the company to accelerate its strategy to become the leading cloud provider. SAP recorded €85 million in SAP HANA revenue putting the company on track to meet full-year expectations of at least €320 million. Mobile revenue was €54 million and keeps SAP on track to meet full-year expectations of €220 million. SAP also saw significant traction in strategic industries, with financial services and retail both growing more than 60 percent in software revenue, and solid growth across the manufacturing sectors, which grew more than 20 percent in software revenue. "Our customer-focused innovation strategy is delivering exceptional business value for our customers and driving record results for SAP in an uncertain macro-economic environment," said SAP Co-CEOs Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe. "SAP stands apart in its ability to bring its customers innovations in cloud, mobile and in-memory computing on top of a proven, consistent and stable core. We will continue to provide game-changing solutions and remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals." "We reached the upper end of our second quarter software revenue guidance range and were at the mid-point of the software and software-related service revenue guidance range," said Werner Brandt, CFO of SAP. "With this momentum in the first half of 2012 and our focused commitment to operational excellence we are on track to deliver on our targets for the full-year 2012 – in line with our 2015 goals." http://finance.yahoo.com/news/sap-announ...</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1343195335000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:48:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343195539000-9</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM QC VS Medfield</Title><Username>awaytocar123</Username><Timestamp>1343173992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>on who's fab?</Msg><Username>six_packers</Username><Timestamp>1343195539000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:52:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343195829000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor Congress Will Support Stopping the Requirement to Use Ethanol in Gasoline</Title><Username>yourbestfriendshelly</Username><Timestamp>1343155788000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was that the Bush administration who encouraged the use of corn for gas?</Msg><Username>six_packers</Username><Timestamp>1343195829000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:57:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343195925000-11</Id><Topic><Title>70% of CNBC polled said Obama</Title><Username>liberalsrwacked</Username><Timestamp>1343151839000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 13:43:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So as my family.</Msg><Username>optermoron</Username><Timestamp>1343195925000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:58:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343196414000-12</Id><Title>$1300 Qual-tablet vs ultrabook</Title><Msg>Tell me which one give you the most value?</Msg><Username>pc_addicte</Username><Timestamp>1343196414000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 02:06:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343197603000-13</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM QC VS Medfield</Title><Username>awaytocar123</Username><Timestamp>1343173992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Point.

If it takes the latest quad-core ARM to match a single-core Medfield in SunSpider I wonder how it will do against a quad-core Silvermont when it tips up ;-). ------ My understanding is that Javascript (and thus SunSpider) is single threaded (even on a PC). I could be wrong and if you have any links to show that it's not I would be grateful. As for why the quad core is faster, in single threaded workloads the clock is bumped to 1.7ghz and we also have the 'optimizations' that where hinted at: "It's unclear how much of this performance increase over the dual-core S4 is due to the added cores vs. software optimizations to the MDP/T's browser."

That’s a slight change – within the margin of error – from last month’s poll, which showed Obama ahead by three points, 47 percent to 44 percent. Read the full poll here (.pdf) In a smaller sample of registered voters living in 12 battleground states (Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin), the incumbent president’s lead over Romney is eight points, 49 to 41, which is essentially unchanged from June. So is the good news you are posting? Romney is doing great. He is only losing in the battleground states by 8%.

He is none other than a retired Citigroup Chairman, a former NY Fed Director, and a "philanthropist." He is also the man who lobbied for overturning of Glass Steagall in the last years of the 20th century, whose repeal permitted the merger of Travelers of Citibank, in the process creating Citigroup, the largest of the TBTF banks eventually bailed out by taxpayers. In his memoir Weill brags that he and Republican Senator Phil Gramm joked that it should have been called the Weill-Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Informally, some dubbed it “the Citigroup Authorization Act.” As The Nation explains, "Weill was instrumental in getting then-President Bill Clinton to sign off on the Republican-sponsored legislation that upended the sensible restraints on finance capital that had worked splendidly since the Great Depression." Of course, by overturning Glass Steagall the last hindrance to ushering in the TBTF juggernaut and the Greenspan Put, followed by the global Bernanke put, was removed, in the process making the terminal collapse of the US financial system inevitable. Why is Weill relevant? Because in a statement that simply redefines hypocrisy, the same individual had the temerity to appear on selloutvision, and tell his fawning CNBC hosts that it is "time to break up the big banks." That's right: the person who benefited the most of all from the repeal of Glass Steagall is now calling for its return. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/defining-hypocricy-weill-who-led-repeal-glass-steagall-now-says-big-banks-should-be-broken</Msg><Username>crkadambuht</Username><Timestamp>1343229557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:19:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343229671000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Weill, Who Led Repeal Of Glass Steagall, Now Says Big Banks Should Be Broken Up</Title><Username>crkadambuht</Username><Timestamp>1343229557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:19:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gramm left the Senate to become a top executive at the Swiss-based UBS bank, which like Citigroup ran into deep trouble. Leach—former Republican Representative James Leach—was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 to head the National Endowment for the Humanities, where his banking skills could serve the needs of intellectuals. Robert Rubin, the Clinton administration treasury secretary who helped push through the Citigroup Authorization Act, was the most blatant double dealer of all: He accepted a $15-million-a-year offer from Weill to join Citigroup, where he eventually helped run the corporation into the ground. Citigroup went on to be a major purveyor of toxic mortgage–based securities that required $45 billion in direct government investment and a $300 billion guarantee of its bad assets in order to avoid bankruptcy. Weill himself bailed out shortly before the crash. His retirement from what was then the world’s largest financial conglomerate was chronicled in the New York Times under the headline “Laughing All the Way From the Bank.” The article told of “an enormous wooden plaque” in the bank’s headquarters that featured a likeness of Weill with the inscription “The Man Who Shattered Glass-Steagall.”</Msg><Username>crkadambuht</Username><Timestamp>1343229671000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343230032000-34</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy Must Be Loving It</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343192745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:05:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally gets to cheer today because INTC is green, 4.00 less than where he should have sold it.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1343230032000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343230183000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy Must Be Loving It</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343192745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:05:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally gets to cheer today because INTC is green, 4.00 less than where he should have sold it. ----------------- You told him he should have sold it "way up" at 19.78 last year.

A few months later he was retired mostly against his will. Today the OP label is still around, it's sold exclusively at WalMart. How did it go from high end fashion to mass merchant discount stores? One reason may be that the same Chinese knock offs my grandfather couldn't pawn off on me is now making their line. I like to think of it as a series of short sighted decisions. I know it's crazy to say but I haven't seen as much love and devotion to a label from that time until Apple came along. It's impossible to think that Apple could ever sink so low as to only be sold by Walmart. The buying public is fickle and what is hot today can easily be forgotten tomorrow.

HUNT: Well, should you restore Glass-Steagall then? SEN. OBAMA: Well, no. The argument is not to go back to the regulatory framework of the 1930's because, as I said, the financial markets have changed substantially. The question is, how do we build new regulatory systems that are flexible, that reflect new realities, that aren't going to put undue constraints on innovation in the financial markets, but nevertheless will encourage the transparency and accountability that we need and will maintain trust between investors and counterparties and the banks so that you don't see what's happening right now, which is a complete lock-up of the credit system. It's, as I think has been noted by a number of people, this is sort of a 21st century version of a bank run. And what happened when there were runs on banks in the - during the Depression era is that Congress moved in with FDIC and Glass-Stiegel and other laws to assure that confidence would be maintained and excessive risks could be curbed and that investors or depositors could have confidence.</Msg><Username>crkadambuht</Username><Timestamp>1343235431000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:57:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343235523000-56</Id><Topic><Title>Weill, Who Led Repeal Of Glass Steagall, Now Says Big Banks Should Be Broken Up</Title><Username>crkadambuht</Username><Timestamp>1343229557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:19:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Four of Obama's top six contributors included Goldman Sachs, J.P.

Mitt Romney’s father, George Romney, has been invoked on the campaign trail often. Newt Gingrich used his release of 12 years’ of tax records as an example to push his rival to release his own tax returns. On Thursday night, Romney mentioned the fact that his father was born in Mexico in response to Gingrich’s allegations that he is “anti-immigrant,” which raises the question: If George Romney was born in Mexico, how could he run for president? It is clear that naturalized citizens cannot qualify for the office of president, but there is no clarification in the U.S. Constitution pertaining to people born to U.S. citizens in a foreign country, and there is no definition of a “natural-born citizen.” Some experts have challenged the idea that foreign-born children of U.S. citizens are “natural-born” because citizenship is conferred upon them after birth. A Congressional Research Service report published in November comes closest to answering that question. “There have been legitimate legal issues raised concerning those born outside of the country to U.S. citizens,” the report states. “The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term ‘natural born’ citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship ‘by birth’ or ‘at birth,’ either by being born ’in’ the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship ‘at birth.’” Romney was born to American citizens living in a Mormon church colony in Chihuahua, Mexico. Even though he wasn’t born in a United States territory or state, George Romney was given citizenship at birth because he was born to American citizens, essentially granting him the status of a natural-born citizen. “When you’re born outside the United States to [U.S.] citizens, you have citizenship at birth,” explained Peter J. Spiro, a professor of law and an expert on the law of citizenship at Temple University. “You don’t have to do anything to claim your citizenship. You are a citizen from birth.” Romney was the first presidential candidate born outside the United States, and his decision to run against Nixon in the Republican primary of 1968 raised many questions. “This is not the kind of issue that was decided by the courts,” Spiro said. “No court has said definitively, but I think there’s some consensus understanding that a person such as George Romney would be eligible to be president.”</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343258864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343258898000-100</Id><Title>George Romney born in Mexico Part 2</Title><Msg>The issue came to the limelight again in 2008 with both parties’ candidates. Sen. John McCain was born on a U.S. naval air station in the Panama Canal Zone when his father was posted there, leading some to question whether he would be eligible for the presidency. It turned out to be a non-issue because a law passed in 1937, and applied retroactively, gave citizenship to anyone born in Panama whose mother or father was a U.S. citizen. President Obama was dogged for much longer by the birther movement about where he was born. The president released his birth certificate as proof that he was born in Hawaii. Citizenship for foreign-born children of U.S. nationals is not an issue that has gained widespread attention. George Romney didn’t make it far enough into the campaign for it to pose a problem, but that’s likely to change, Spiro says. “Going forward, there are likely to be other cases of other individuals who are born out the United States with citizenship, who achieve political prominence and who are in the ballpark for presidency,” he said. “This issue is not going to go away.” Several members of Congress — mostly Republicans — have attempted to cement this practice into a bill. Former Sen. Don Nickles introduced the Natural Born Citizen Act in 2004 to define the term, natural-born citizen, to include people who derived citizenship at birth from a U.S. citizen parent and to children under 18 who were adopted by U.S. citizens. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, went a step further, introducing the Equal Right to Govern Amendment in July 2003 to allow immigrants who had been naturalized for at least 20 years to run for president.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343258898000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343260478000-101</Id><Topic><Title>2 billion ARM chips shipped in Q2 2012</Title><Username>dnenni</Username><Timestamp>1343248664000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 16:37:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"there is the question of what ARM will do."

This processor takes ARM performance to the next level with a custom-designed CPU that is fully compliant with the 64-bit ARM instruction set. This CPU is designed to approach the instructions per cycle (IPC) of Intel’s current Xeon products. To do so, it will use a four-issue superscalar architecture with out-of-order execution. This approach goes beyond even ARM’s high-end Cortex-A15, a three-issue out-of-order architecture. The company expects its X-Gene CPU to operate at 2.4GHz in 40nm and 3.0GHz in 28nm. This clock rate is faster than that of Cortex-A15, which is rated at 2.5GHz in 28nm. The ARM design is synthesizable, however; Applied Micro has an advantage in being able to “harden” its physical design, optimizing it for greater speed. Instead of aiming for pure performance, X-Gene is optimized for performance per watt. A complete 40nm eight-core 2.0GHz X-Gene processor with system logic is rated at just 25W TDP. Each CPU has its own instruction and data caches; each pair of CPUs shares a level-two cache of unspecified size. These pairs of cores are connected to each other and to a level three cache through a nonblocking cache-coherent crossbar with more than 1,000Gbps (1.0Tbps) of peak bandwidth. This approach should be adequate for up to eight cores. Unlike Intel’s Xeon processors, X-Gene is a complete SoC with memory controllers, integrated accelerators, networking, and other system I/O, as Figure 3 shows. The processor connects directly to SATA drives and provides 10G Ethernet (10GbE) and Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports. It supports multiple DRAM channels with ECC protection. To reduce system power, the integrated memory controllers support 1.35V low-power DDR3L DRAM as well as standard DDR3 DRAM. Applied Micro has already demonstrated a working model of its ARMv8 CPU running in an FPGA-based simulator. The first X-Gene processor is due to sample in 40nm by the end of this year. If everything stays on track, 40nm X-Gene processors should enter production in 2H13, followed by 28nm versions in 2014.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1343271477000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:57:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
