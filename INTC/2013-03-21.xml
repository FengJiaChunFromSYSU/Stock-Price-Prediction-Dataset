Q1 will be the low and we will have steady improvement the rest of 2013. We know Haswell will be here soon perhaps in less than a month to get the party started. We know that Intel will have ten new smartphones in 2013 and more tablet offerings than can be counted. The Surface Pro is a strong indication that Intel is going to be building tablet market share. We know that Intel will be shipping the 22nm Silvermont Atom SoC this year and the 14nm Airmont Atom SoC in 2014. Intel is shrinking Atom chips every year. We know that the ARM world fears Intel's move to 22nm SOC's but it's the move to Airmont that literally strikes terror into their hearts. We know that the ARM era has come to an end. At the same time that Intel's node cycle time has dropped to a year, ARM's fabrication is entering suspended animation at 28nm. Volume production of 20nm might happen in two years but the absence of FinFET technology means 20nm planar has limited improvements at an excessive cost. And ARM's half-step move to half FinFET technology at 14/16nm is so far in the future that we have no earthly idea when it might realistically arrive. The ARM fanbois would have us believe that a tapeout is almost the same thing as volume production. But anyone who paid attention to TSMC's 28nm manufacturing process with its many delays and problems in ramp knows that the ARM world tapeouts are no cause for celebration. We know that the Altera deal completely changed the competitive landscape by clearly demonstrating that companies really want and will get in line and pay for Intel's advanced fabrication and technology. We know now that many more discussions are taking place and that Intel will be able to pick and choose the ones that it wants. We know that Apple is in huge trouble and needs Intel more than Intel needs them. Samsung is beating Apple like a drum. Apple better make a move and they better do it quick.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363839347180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 00:15:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363840067241-2</Id><Topic><Title>What We know Now</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363839347180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 00:15:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now many people are dumber that wallis!

We know that ARM investors are exhausted and that ARM technicals continue to look terrible. The stock has dropped 8 out of the last ten days with huge drops on some days. The CEO left after posting up some huge sales before the stock went into free-fall. ARM needs constant and exciting product releases and press to maintain its monstrous P/E ratio and instead its getting lower ASPs, margins and profits out of its ARM shops at the same time that they are experiencing growing competition. The number of viable ARM foundries has dropped to two, one of them competes with its customers and the other is losing highly profitable deals to Intel. We know that Samsung and Apple have more lawsuits and ill will than ever. We know that the ARM/Intel war is not going to be decided by the big Wall Street firms or the raging ARM fanbois. It is going to be and has been decided by Intel's bold fabrication and technology investments and their completely revamped mobility strategy. We know the game is over.

Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars,Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. 10.) With the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) When an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. 12.) ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. Cost of 50-100M USD per year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363845141388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 01:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363845269187-17</Id><Topic><Title>The ARM people are a little bit slow</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363831904659</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:11:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see Volta discovered stacked DRAM ... congratulations but they did not really give a time line did they ?

The event might be misinterpreted by the market as a negative for INTC but actually, I view this as positive since Oracles loss is probably Intel's gain.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1363865480882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 07:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363866584409-32</Id><Topic><Title>Sixteen Reasons Why ARM's Fabrication Is Toast</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363845141388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 01:52:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember the PowerPC?

You are also forgetting that it's about the SoC not just the CPU, Apples SoC's are *different* from everyone else as they have huge GPU's and custom IP blocks. They will not use a generic Intel design. As a side, Apples current CPU is good and more than likely able to keep pace with Bay Trail on a thread-by-thread basis (even with no changes to the current design).</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363867120106</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 07:58:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363869778245-36</Id><Title>Citi &amp; JP Morgan</Title><Msg>Yesterday it was Citi weighing in with they didn't think INTC would make their numbers for 2013.

In the very near future there will be x86 smartphones that will run Android or Tizen and when connected to a docking station can also run full Windows 8 (or Ubuntu Touch/Debian/*nix) giving the user unprecedented portability of their desktop and applications. While connected to the docking station the smartphone will get external power so the phone can run Windows 8 at ultrabook-like speed and it won't reduce the battery life of the phone. Lenovo, Asus, Moto, and nearly every other smartphone vendor will make these type of devices because it gives great value to the user. The smartphone owner might even save money on software licensing. Samsung can get an edge over Apple by using x86 and Tizen to build smartphones with Intel's multi-OS Windows design. Today Apple can't offer the same type of integration with MAC OS and IOS because Apple's smartphones and tablets use ARM. Eventually Apple could offer a MAC OS/IOS combination if Apple switches to x86 for smartphones and tablets but most likely they'll trail Samsung and others in this innovation. None of this is a stretch of technology, especially considering the labs are already working on smart watches and wearable computers. The Multi-OS smartphone is merely an incremental step on that path.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1363872783711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 09:33:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363872933230-40</Id><Title>ORCL crash INTC crash ha ha ..</Title><Msg>sell sell</Msg><Username>nite_trader2000</Username><Timestamp>1363872933230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 09:35:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363872938969-41</Id><Title>CAN'T HOLD $21</Title><Msg>HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!

TSMC was the only foundry previously in mass production with 28nm products. As competitors of TSMC offer lower prices to lure customers, the foundry's dominance in the 28nm market will be affected with second-quarter revenues likely to be a disappointment, the sources noted. Market watchers, however, still believe that TSMC's sales for the second quarter of 2013 will enjoy at least single-digit sequential growth. In addition, TSMC has received requests from its customers to slow their technology migration plans to the 20nm process, the sources said. In fact, many of TSMC's clients have expressed concern about the limited room the foundry's 20nm node can reduce in their chip power consumption and costs, the sources indicated. In other words, the transition to 20nm process technology from 28nm is not as cost-effective as that from 40nm to 28nm. Nonetheless, TSMC is mulling having two 20nm process offerings, the sources pointed out. In order to attract more customers to its 20nm technology, TSMC plans to develop a version that features FinFET 3D transistors, the sources said.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363875221018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:13:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363875267009-54</Id><Topic><Title>"Out of 19 apps tested by AV Test Labs, McAfee fared the worst ..."</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1363827941795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 21:05:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't find any information about this topic.

The stock options granted are similar to those granted by the companies competing for the employees. The options are part of the compensation.

But asking how fast future Windows 8 PCs will be is probably the wrong question. The Haswell chip that Tom's Hardware got a hold of and tested showed only modest central processing unit, or CPU, performance improvements over the latest hardware. This would seem to indicate the future of Windows PCs -- which in this case means newfangled devices like Microsoft Surface and HP's Envy x2 -- isn't about the desktop anymore. "The mobile space is where Intel's efforts should become more apparent," said Tom's. And that's probably the biggest takeaway from the leaked benchmarks. Intel's next chip, which will undoubtedly land in most of the world's new PCs, has been designed first and foremost for better power efficiency. Just ask Intel CEO Paul Otellini. "Haswell [is] the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel history," he said in January, as he waxed eloquent about all of the new mobile designs Haswell will engender. That's not to say Intel will skimp completely on boosting performance. But that is expected to occur mostly in the graphics processing unit or GPU. "Processors with Intel's [upcoming] HD Graphics 4600 engine should offer notably better 3D performance than today's HD Graphics 4000," Tom's said. The GT3 version of the graphics chip is expected to pack 40 execution units or specialized processors, compared to 16 today. And that should boost performance on smaller mobile devices that rely exclusively on Intel's graphics hardware and don't have room for higher-performance "discrete" GPUs from Nvidia and AMD.

The Acer Liquid C1 smartphone, the first Intel Atom-powered smartphone in the country and is being pushed into new mobile phone platform specifically geared towards the mid-range market segment. Its 8-megapixel main camera and 4.3-inch touchscreen with 540 x 960 display resolution process image via PowerVR SGX540 400MHz graphics engine. It has 1GB DDR2 memory and seems like a decent mid-range device. The quad-band capable Acer Liquid C1 is one of the first smartphones to be launched on the Intel Lexington platform featuring the Atom Z2420 1.2GHz processor with Hyper Threading technology. The Lexington processor is designed “to run hundreds of apps, upload and download photos and videos and deliver experience for casual gaming,” Banaag said. At the moment it runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system can be upgraded to Jelly Bean. It wireless connectivity is built with 3G HSDPA that can connect up to 21Mbps speed. The C1 is now available in the Philippines for US $306.58. It will be interesting to see if the Acer Intel duo has any plans to release it elsewhere if there is any demand in the cash strapped country. After all there are some pretty poor people in the EU who might be interested.

The stock is now $4.75 or 11 percent off of its 52-week high. After refusing literally for years to recognize that ARM could not support its lofty P/E ratio, investors would have to admit that the market has lost confidence and that few catalysts exist to take the stock higher while many exist that would pressure the stock down. The departure of Warren East hasn't helped, especially after having unloaded a lot of shares near the 52-week high and before it began the strong move off the highs. Fierce competition has now arisen from Intel just at the time where ARM's top-end fabrication appears to be stuck at 28nm, where it will likely stay for several years while it tries to develop 20nm that is not FinFET and a half-step to 14/16nm FinFET fabrication. Intel with superior 22nm products already in volume production will move another level up to 14nm production at the end of this year. Significant evidence exists that this is the tipping point and will mark the end of the ARM era of mobility domination and monopoly. With Haswell due out soon and Intel's fabrication gathering speed and support, ARM has few resources with the strength to reverse the trend...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363898003186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 16:33:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363898158668-191</Id><Topic><Title>FYI... my ARMH sold today</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363879224798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 11:20:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are looking ... it's a good time to go long NVDA...

When they do it has never occured to them that they will be selling at a loss if they don't raise prices dramitically. This is where INTC makes a boat load of cash because they have allready depreciated their 22nm lines and will be depreciating their 14nm lines. They also fail to mension that TSM has a net margin of 30% where INTC has a margin of 20%. Follow that forward when TSM starts making 20nm and you can see INTC making much higher margins in their 22nm as these lines are allready depreciated. My take is they are still accumulating INTC, closing their short positions on INTC, and sell off their position and shorting TSM. Could be wrong but I doubt it - seen this play too many times before.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1363902102095</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:41:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363903273459-197</Id><Title>Rich peiople need to do their share!

But now it appears the ARM based project is virtually dead and there is no front in which ARM has mounted a credible assault on Intel's traditional markets. Intel however, has made huge strides to position itself to gain foothold in ARM's core markets, particularly smartphones and tablets, the results of which will unfold throughout this year and beyond.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1363919347002</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 22:29:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363920686502-212</Id><Title>Oracle sells record number of x86 servers last quarter</Title><Msg>Oracle to Reveal SPARC T5 Microprocessors, Systems Next Week Oracle Blames Weak Server Shipments for Introduction of New-Generation of Chips 03/20/2013 11:45 PM by Anton Shilov "Due to release of the new generations of servers, which were delayed last year from their original schedule, customers of the company held off purchase of new systems in Q3 of fiscal 2013 (ended February 28, 2013).

Still, the company claims that it sold 800 of its high-end engineered systems, such as Exadata, Exalogic, Big Data Appliance and Oracle Database Appliance, during the quarter, a record number. “With more than 800 [engineered systems] sold in Q3, that is the best unit quarter ever. We have now sold more than 5000 engineered systems to date. In the first full quarter for Exadata X3, we sold over 400 systems.

Having used the Tegra-powered Surface RT and Samsung’s Ativ Tab fairly extensively, the Smart PC feels like a breath of fresh air. All of Microsoft’s "metro" apps load and run far faster than Windows RT tablets, and running these programs side-by-side never results in slow down. The biggest surprise with the Smart PC is how well it handles legacy Windows apps. I consider myself a power user, and in the past Atoms have been incapable of running the apps I need on a daily basis, but Samsung’s tablet was able to keep pace with my workflow. I comfortably processed and edited photos in Photoshop while writing this report in Word, and also managed to browse the web with MetroTwit snapped to one side pulling in my Twitter feed. Playing back YouTube or Netflix in HD also posed no issue. Sure, things move a lot quicker on an ultrabook or MacBook Air, but this is a thin, fanless tablet. While Atom performance isn't quite at the point where you could cast your ultrabook aside, the gains in battery life goes a long way to making up for it. The Smart PC didn’t quite match up to Intel’s ten-hour promise, but battery life is more than acceptable.

Sure, more powerful — and less power-hungry — ARM processors are coming, but Windows RT tablets are going to be at a disadvantage against Windows 8 machines for a long time thanks to the app situation. It doesn’t look like Adobe or Google are in much of a rush to port over their most important apps to RT. Apparently Microsoft’s partners share my opinion — Samsung recently canceled its plans for RT devices in the US and halted sales in Europe, and just days ago Nvidia’s CEO called the OS "disappointing." Microsoft itself has also struggled — it's only sold 1.1 million Surface RT tablets in five months, despite expanding its retail reach to Best Buy and Staples for the all-important holiday season. Just as ARM and its manufacturing partners are constantly working on the next iteration of their processors, Intel too is making plans — it’s already announced Clover Trail's successor, Bay Trail. It’ll be based on 22nm technology, rather than Clover Trail's 32nm, which essentially shrinks down the chip, making it use less power. This nm drop will allow Intel to increase Atom’s processing power and graphics performance without negatively affecting battery life. Bay Trail will come to tablets as a quad-core chip, and Intel tells us it'll have double the performance of Clover Trail with no negative impact on battery life. Rumors suggest that the next generation of chips will scrap the Atom's PowerVR GPU in favor of the same graphics solution found in Intel's Core processors. A more powerful graphics chip, along with increased all-around performance, should make for a potent combination. The first Bay Trail tablets are expected by the end of the year, and they could leave Windows RT dead in the water — especially if an Atom-based Surface is among them.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363922757347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:25:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363922761381-216</Id><Title>Intel inside successor to Nexus 7?</Title><Msg>The Nexus 7 Two could be the first product to have the quad-core Bay Trail inside.

ARM has offered up what it thinks of as "just good enough" whereas Intel has put years and years of development into providing truly performance-based products that are power efficient at the same time. The results are clear with the RT being deemed a not ready for prime time device. We will see the same thing across the fabrication space become clear as Intel has invested years and billions in bringing FinFET to market. ARM is attempting to patch its fabrication deficiencies with concepts like big.little to close Intel's very significant technology and manufacturing lead. It's simply not going to be enough. With Haswell, Airmont, Clover Trail and Bay Trail Intel finally has the tools to bring the ARM era to a close and not to just take away market share but to assume the leadership position in all of mobility. The recent decline in the ARM stock price confirms that some investors already understand that the tipping point has been reached...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363923544510</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 23:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
