Gustafson that talks about the Ivy Bridge support for the F16, half float data-type. The F16 data type would be useful in many different application areas, including graphics. It is an interesting presentation about how and when to select smaller PRECISION when performance floating point. Examples of where he suggests would benefit from lower precision would be box3d applications, financial modeling, .... His point is that using precision that is too high slows performance, burns extra power and does not make your answer any more correct. Ivy Bridge adds F16, half float support and future Intel CPU will have support too. I think that F16 data will boost graphic performance and reduce power consumption independent of process node.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350549128234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 04:32:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350551768651-28</Id><Title>Q3 "customers thinned out Win 7 inventory"</Title><Msg>That's Ottelini comment on cc and it says a lot.

By Therese Poletti, MarketWatch SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — While investors will be watching Microsoft Corp.’s earnings report closely on Thursday afternoon, a better indicator of the software giant’s prospects may come in the launch of its own tablet next week — a launch that may be a lot messier than many expect. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer shows off the Surface tablet at a June 18 event in Los Angeles. In fact, the debut of the Surface has the potential to turn into a disaster for , which badly needs to build some positive buzz about Windows 8 in an environment where the PC in general seems passé. Tablets are all the rage, so the company needs its flagship software to have a strong stake in this new market. The problem with the first Microsoft Surface tablet is that it doesn’t come with a full version of Windows 8. Windows RT, which will go in the Surface, is designed for a different chip, not “Intel Inside,” and will not be able to run all existing Windows applications. The first Surface tablet goes on sale Friday, Oct. 26, the same day that Microsoft is launching the Windows 8 operating system. Windows RT is designed to run with the types of ARM-based processors used on other tablets and smartphones. Read more about the planned launch of Microsoft's Surface tablet. Apps need to be specially written for Windows RT, which means the first Surface tablet will not be able to completely tap into the same, vast universe of Windows developers that Microsoft commands. Entry-level Surface sells out “Consumers will expect something that it doesn’t really deliver,” Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, said in an interview. On Wednesday, some Microsoft blogs reported the entry-level Surface with Windows RT, priced at $499, sold out. A Microsoft spokeswoman said the $499 version that had been available for pre-order is now on back order. She declined to comment on product sales or on any other questions about the launch, or Microsoft’s expectations. Read about the $499 version of the Surface sold out. The Windows RT tablet represents the first major break in the company’s long partnership with chip behemoth Intel Corp. The device will use a processor from Nvidia Corp. that is based on designs licensed from ARM Holdings/ Based on the specs from Microsoft’s website, it looks like the applications for the Windows RT operating system will be stripped-down versions of the software that most consumers and business users are accustomed to. The main software with the Surface and Window RT is called “Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 RT Preview” that includes a version of the Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote programs. The next version of the tablet, called Surface with Windows 8 Pro, will have an Intel chip and will run Windows 7 applications, just as most standard PCs. This means consumers and business users may be in for a surprise, if they are picking up a device they expect to have full Windows functionality. Click to Play Microsoft prices Surface tabletMicrosoft is announcing prices for its first-ever homegrown computing device due out this month, setting a starting price that follows the lead of Apple's iPad. “My view is that Windows RT is not really going to be satisfying to consumers,” said Rotman Epps. Read more in Rotman Epps's blog post. The iPad, one can argue, is also limited. But because it has a large universe of specially designed apps, users can often move beyond certain limitations, such as the inability to use Adobe Inc.’s Flash. Solid launch needed The Pro version of the Surface, due about 90 days after the Windows RT Surface, may get a better reception than this device. But the Intel version doesn’t even use its lower-power-consuming chips that Intel itself would have recommended, according to Rotman Epps. “All they [Intel] said is that Microsoft didn’t consult with them about that choice,” she said. Microsoft is using an Intel Core i5 processor, which is found in many laptops and PCs but is not designed for light devices like tablets and Ultrabooks. This may hurt the battery life of the Pro version. The other issue facing Microsoft is its distribution. The company — in part because it does not want to compete too directly with its hardware partners — is going to sell the Surface in its own retail stores and online. Today, Microsoft operates about 27 retail stores, and plans for about 40 more, based on its website. “Early reports have indicated that Microsoft intends to ship three to five million tablets in the December quarter,” said Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow, in a note Tuesday. “Given Barclays is currently forecasting total tablet shipments of 40.6 million in Q4, this would imply a market share of 10%, which we believe is rather aggressive, given the price point and the limited supply-chain activity around Windows 8 tablets thus far.” Microsoft needs to pull off a solid launch for Windows 8, which would be marred if large numbers of customers reject the Surface or return the tablet. Many investors may be thinking of that old adage that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” The burden will be on Microsoft to prove otherwise.</Msg><Username>getsome_nads</Username><Timestamp>1350562393819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 08:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350562464953-34</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>Although a three-day gain turned many pessimists from last week into bulls, the major indexes failed to break above their resistance yesterday.

Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today. That matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and compares with a previously reported 7.6 percent expansion in the second quarter. GDP rose 2.2 percent from the prior period, a four-quarter high. Any rebound in growth may ease pressure on the Communist Party as officials begin a once-a-decade leadership transition next month. The government has paused for three months from easing monetary policy in the world’s second-biggest economy even as data showed trade, manufacturing and inflation cooled during the quarter. “China’s economy is performing better than expected, and the bottoming will be clear in the fourth quarter,” said Zhu Haibin, Hong Kong-based chief China economist for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. The possibility of another interest-rate cut this year is getting “quite small,” though the central bank may cut lenders’ reserve requirements, Zhu said. China’s economic growth has started to stabilize, Premier Wen Jiabao said in remarks published yesterday by the official Xinhua News agency. The government is confident of achieving annual targets and the economy will continue to show “positive changes,” Wen said, according to Xinhua. The State Council said today that it will maintain proactive fiscal and prudent monetary policies this year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350566377878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350566583300-42</Id><Topic><Title>Q3 "customers thinned out Win 7 inventory"</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1350551768651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 05:16:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL, LOL, they are, but not until after Oct 26...LOL.....

The PC is not dead, it is just a computing device that is undergoing reconstructive surgery.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350571615165</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:46:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350572241134-65</Id><Topic><Title>Marsavian, Alexander....</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1350566104409</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:15:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And who are those clients exactly?

The chipmaker blamed sluggish third-quarter earnings, reported Oct. 16, on a PC market that shrank for the first time in 11 years, as well as broader economic slowdown. But there is a larger story behind Intel’s piece of the global slowdown in the growth of the semiconductor market. It’s a titanic shift in how we use technology, which could reduce one of the dominant firms in microprocessor manufacturing to a bit player chasing shrinking returns on products in which it’s forever playing catch-up. Here’s why: 1. PCs are becoming less relevant. For everything from browsing the web to acting as a cash register, a tablet is sufficient and in some cases superior at performing the jobs that we used to rely on PCs to do, and tablets are cannibalizing PC sales. By 2016, there will be 750 million tablets in use worldwide. Of those, 375 million tablets will be sold that year alone, and businesses will buy a third of them, predicts J.P. Gownder, an analyst at technology research firm Forrester. In the education sector, sales of iPads are already outpacing PCs. A new survey by Forrester found that “13% of tablet owners said they bought their tablet instead of a laptop; 18% say they’ll wait longer to buy their next laptop and 14% say they won’t buy a new laptop ever.” 2. Intel has almost none of the tablet or mobile chip market. Intel is the No. 1 chip maker in the world, with 16.5% of the global market for semiconductors. It’s undisputed king of the high-performance chips in the powerful servers that make the web possible. But in mobile devices, battery life places strict limits on how much power a processor can draw. And Intel only has 0.2% of the market for these kinds of chips. Its competitors are many: NVIDIA dominates, but Samsung and Apple now design their own chips, and even Amazon may soon be creating custom microprocessors for its tablets and (rumored) forthcoming phone. 3. The move to mobile will slash Intel’s profit margins. Intel’s high-performance PC chips account for a quarter of the $1,000 price tag of the ultra-slim laptops that Intel’s partners have been trying–and failing–to sell. The chips that are the brains of most cell phones and tablets go for as little as $10 to $25, says Vijay Rakesh, a senior research analyst in charge of microprocessors at brokerage firm Sterne Agee. The Atom processors that Intel is now making for tablets running the forthcoming Microsoft Windows 8 operating system are priced accordingly, at $42-$47, but its margins on these chips are a fraction of those it makes on PC processors. ”With Atom, they have to make it work, and I think they are making it work, but the question is, will it dilute the margin structure that Intel has?” says Rakesh. 4. Not even Intel’s server business is entirely safe. As we’ve said, Intel excels at making high-end chips, which inhabit powerful computers, which live in vast and ever-growing server farms, which constitute the “cloud” where the web resides and where more and more of our computing is done every day. But the electricity needed by both the processors and the systems to keep them cool is now a dominant cost in all of those server farms. That has convinced the plumbers of the internet to figure out how to use processors not so different from the ones inside an iPhone to power the web itself. Which means that for some applications of the cloud, Intel is now fighting nearly the same battle that it has been losing in mobile devices. 5. Intel is about to lose its unique advantage. One way that Intel has long been able to keep its margins low and its technology sharp is that, unlike other microprocessor designers, it also owns the “fabs” where its chips are made. But a new fab costs some $7 billion to build, and the push to the next level of chip technology will necessitate another fab. So unless Intel can grow its market fast, it won’t have enough volume to justify building one, and will lose the edge it has enjoyed. Even if it manages that, it will be moving into a much more competitive, and less profitable, marketplace. 6. Don’t count on Windows 8 to change anything. Intel’s tablet chips will be designed for the new version of Windows, but not that many people may want to make the switch. “There’s no need for people to go to Windows 8,” says Rakesh of Sterne Agee. “There has to be a value proposition there, and Windows 8 has a new interface with its own learning curve, and most people feel the performance of Windows 7 is very good.” 7. For tech firms, flat revenue is often a harbinger of doom. ”Quarterly financial data is often a lagging indicator of strategic success,” notes Horace Dediu, a mobile industry analyst who spent eight years at Nokia. He cites the example of RIM, maker of the now much-derided Blackberry smartphone. The company’s revenues more or less tracked the growth in the mobile-phone market from 2008 through 2010, a full three years after the iPhone arrived. But as other smartphones became cheaper and the apps for them got better, people started deserting the BlackBerry in droves. In 2011, the company’s earnings fell off a cliff, and the company was suddenly worth less than its value if it were liquidated. It seems unlikely that Intel will ever suffer precisely the same fate as RIM, since the company continues to lead in the specialized world of microprocessors for servers. As the internet grows, so too does the market for servers, and it’s not as if PCs will disappear overnight. “It’s still a market of more than 300 million PC desktops and servers sold annually today,” says Rakesh. But, as we’ve discussed, servers too could start to use cheaper, low-power chips of the kind that Intel’s competitors make just as well. Here’s Dediu, again, on RIM and the entire mobile industry: It might sound like a spectacular story; an anomaly, a once-in-a-lifetime reversal of fortunes. However, the moral of this story is that this is not an exceptional phenomenon. Disruption happens. It happens quickly and perhaps most quickly in this industry, and looking at trailing indicators like revenues and profits is of no help. I’ve only witnessed sharp expansions and sharp declines. I’ve never witnessed steady state, quiescent markets in technology. The history of platforms is always virtuous cycles followed by vicious declines. Whatever amplifies success seems to also amplify failure. Intel’s success was long amplified by its mammoth chip fabs and its lead in high-performance processors. They are exactly the things that could amplify its failure.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1350577385774</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350577687139-92</Id><Topic><Title>INTC - Word on the Street</Title><Username>p.stanton47</Username><Timestamp>1350563225826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 08:27:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm new to the stock market and need all the information I can get!</Msg><Username>williemeadows695</Username><Timestamp>1350577687139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350577689918-93</Id><Topic><Title>I can't get an answer on who Intel will be selling 14nm to outside of Samsung or Apple</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1350572394212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:59:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heh, how did you know I have my eye on a 14nm Broadwell (or 22nm Haswell).

The dual-core with hyperthreading will positively destroy the quad-core ARM competition in the same power range. This is a processor that will have Itanium/Power 7 server performance/clock levels yet be a twentieth of the power. 14nm Airmont will also beat the same ARMs on performance/core and performance/watt. There will compelling Intel skus from every form factor from the cheap single-core phone to large way multi-core servers. It's not a question of who the customers will be but who they won't be. The customers will decide the winners not big OEMs like Samsung and Apple who are the current favorites with bashers here.

'PCs are becoming less relevant. ' Maybe but that does not mean the PC business is going to collapse overnight. Looks like it has stagnated for now but that could just be the not so big jump from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge and the wait for Windows 8 this year. It's hard to imagine Windows 8 not leading a big increase in computer growth as it will combine traditional desktop Windows with the new touch Metro interface. It's the biggest change to Windows since multi-tasking came in with Windows 95. 'By 2016, there will be 750 million tablets in use worldwide. Of those, 375 million tablets will be sold that year alone, and businesses will buy a third of them, predicts J.P. Gownder, an analyst at technology research firm Forrester. In the education sector, sales of iPads are already outpacing PCs.' Clover Trail and it descendants will be perfectly placed to grab a huge chunk of this business, it has better cpu performance than any iPad but at similar power levels and complete and full legacy Windows compatibility. Clover Trail will be more important to Intel than Medfield in 2013, revenue/profit wise, as it is a unique product in its space and should sell very well. Intel phone chips won't start getting unavoidably compelling until the 22nm Silvermont generation although 32nm Medfield and Clovertrail+ are still pretty good and can hang with any ARM chip. 2. 'Intel has almost none of the tablet or mobile chip market' That's about to change in a big way 'Its competitors are many' So what, it's the quality that counts and that is a mixed bunch. Intel faced far tougher competition from AMD when they first brought out Athlon and Athlon 64 respectively. Intel had to resort to price wars and multi-cores to keep selling. Architecturally ARM is just an overgrown kid in comparison. 3. Margins on Atoms are not much less as their die size is smaller. It also doesn't matter if gross margins drop slightly if you eventually double/triple your volume ;-). 4. Scaremongering nonsense. Xeons are in no danger of losing their performance/watt crown from the toy 32-bit ARMs not with derivatives of Ivy Bridge/Haswell in the pipeline . Maybe the 64-bit ARM ones may provide stiffer competition but I will believe serious ARM server sales when I actually see them. As to supposedly losing the mobile battle there never was a battle as Intel did just not turn up until now lol. 5. LOL, the FUD is in full flow now. So suddenly Intel can't afford to build any FABs but it can afford to give away ~$10bn in dividends and buybacks each year lol ! You really can't take this guy seriously as he is not dealing with facts only fear. 6. Yeah right, so everybody will turn their nose up at the new touch screen functionality just because he said so lol ! 7. Intel made new revenue/profit numbers last year with Sandy Bridge so it's not surprising there is a pause with the Ivy Bridge tock and the pause before Windows 8, well maybe just a little surprising to the dumbazz who wrote that article ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350581349284</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:29:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350581657965-106</Id><Title>Samsung Chromebook</Title><Msg>A rather interesting new ARM A15 netbook. $249 from Samsung.

The next step in mobile evolution is to allow full blown Windows to run as a guest "virtual machine" or "container" inside the smartphone and deliver a full desktop experience when one is home, office and elsewhere. With probably 256GB of flash storage and WiGiG one will be able to connect to external high resolution displays, storage, speakers and other peripherals. Your desktop can go everywhere you go. The critical requirement for this step in the evolution of mobility and good Windows performance however is native x86. Its difficult to imagine the blow this event would have on the ARM camp, and Apple too unless they switch to x86 to make a hybrid MAC OS smartphone equivalent. Naysayers would be wise to recall the transformations that have already played out: mainframes - minicomputers - desktops - laptops- tablets - smartphones - wearable computers. Mobile has far more steps to play out.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1350583949077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350584146780-112</Id><Title>GOOG halted</Title><Msg>ER leaked before close ..........

There is zero chance of 14nm Broadwell losing any sales to any ARM competition in Intel's traditional markets and AMD will have a very hard time too. The stock may not now recover until next year but Intel's strong future product pipleine as it gets executed will ensure an eventual reversal of the stock price decline. Once PC sales and Atom sales (i.e. tablets/phones) both start increasing again (sometime in 2013) that will be the trigger for this stock to still be seen as part of the computer future and not just its past and present.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- At the same moment that Google (GOOG) accidentally posted its quarterly earnings release, Google also unveiled its technology broadside against Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL): The $249 Chromebook laptop. This is a very significant threat to Microsoft, Apple and -- as I will describe in more detail below -- Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD). Google's Chromebook, made by Samsung, looks almost identical to an Apple MacBook Air 11.6 inch. However, while the Apple laptop starts at $999, the Google/Samsung laptop is 75% less expensive. It may also be the first volume-manufactured laptop to not have a fan, because it runs so cool. It is therefore as quiet and cool as any smartphone or tablet. No noisy fan which draws power and blows hot air out of the laptop. Enabling this industry-first fan-less laptop, is a Samsung chip that is among the first to be based on ARM's A15 architecture. This is basically the kind of chip that is just now starting to hit the highest-end smartphones in the market. Google is able to run an entire laptop (and soon also other desktop PCs) based on this cell phone chip because its software is so much "lighter" (or "more efficient" if you will) than any laptops running Apple or Microsoft operating systems. This makes for Google, with Samsung's help, to sell a laptop for significantly less than the competition. In addition, because the $249 Google laptop also runs cool, it will not feel like a hot potato in your lap, regardless of whether you are wearing shorts, jeans or whatever. Think of it as an Apple MacBook Air, but as cool in your lap as the iPad. In other words, this is the holy grail of computing, folks. The Google/Samsung $249 laptop manages to squeeze at least 6.5 hours of battery life, while weighing only 2.5 lbs. It's only 0.8 inches thick. These specs mean that it is not only visually similar to the 11.6 MacBook Air, but that it also performs like a champ. However, for every MacBook Air you buy, you can get four Google laptops. The Google laptop will be available to buy either from Google directly online, or from Best Buy (BBY) and Amazon (AMZN) -- among other places -- Steve Jobs'-style "shipping on Monday," Oct. 22.</Msg><Username>zags97</Username><Timestamp>1350588193455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:23:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350588245670-122</Id><Title>Perfect Notebook for gamers without SSD (smart) - Intel Inside</Title><Msg>iBuyPower Valkyrie Gaming Notebook Review: Budget Price, Amazing Performance</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350588245670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:24:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350588550455-123</Id><Topic><Title>Today Windows Tablets - Tomorrow Hybrid Windows Smartphones</Title><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1350583949077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:12:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel has done a poor job explaining to analysts (who overall lack vision) how their efforts in SoC design &amp; manufacturing positions the company in an enviable, if not unique position going forward.

If you SELL the puts, you are are willing to buy the shares at $22.50 if Intel finshes below $22.50 OR you get nothing other than the premium if Intel finishes above $22.50 (noone would sell you shares at $22.50 if Intel was above that). You could also be betting that INTC will go up short term to sell the puts (close them out) at a profit. Because of the ex-dividend drop in price in early Nov, the amount of the dividend is priced into the put option.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350591434943</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:17:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350591516183-137</Id><Topic><Title>INTC market makers doing fine job</Title><Username>whowants2be</Username><Timestamp>1350590702180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeh ,right, like bringing down Intel 7$ ??? lol can you spell manipulation backwards?</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1350591516183</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350591705049-138</Id><Title>Microsoft miss big and they trading close to 52 week high</Title><Msg>I'll take Microsoft MM any day</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1350591705049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350591709854-139</Id><Topic><Title>INTC market makers doing fine job</Title><Username>whowants2be</Username><Timestamp>1350590702180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: INTC market makers doing fine job By mystk7 . 2 minutes 19 seconds ago .

Without them, it would not have been possible!!!! Mitch McConnell Eric Cantor John Boehner A Romney win would make Norquist the shadow president A transcript can be found online of a “60 Minutes” interview with Grover Norquist that first aired on Nov. 20, 2011, and was rebroadcast on Aug. 26, 2012. Steve Kroft interviews Norquist, a lobbyist and conservative activist who Kroft says “over the years has gotten virtually every Republican congressman and senator to sign an oath called ‘The Pledge,’ ” adding, “Norquist controls 279 votes, including the speaker of the House and the Senate minority leader.” Kroft says those who have made the pledge “will never, under any circumstances, vote to raise taxes on anyone.” In the interview, Kroft says to Norquist: “A lot of people think you are the most powerful man in Washington.” The report goes on to state that Gov. Mitt Romney and Rep. Paul Ryan have signed it! That means that a vote for the Romney ticket is actually a vote for Norquist — a man who has never run for office or had a single vote cast for him. If Romney wins, Americans will be living under a virtual dictatorship. If that thought doesn’t frighten you, I feel sorry for the rest of us.

If you look the other way into the PUT options, you can see the 22.5 dividend is nearly 100% priced into the put. $24 NOV is $2.56. $24 - $2.56 = $21.44. What is the premium on the $24 put? $21.67 - $21.44 = 23 cents (which equals the dividend) The option market maker has protected himself from those trying to sell covered calls which he will exercise early and steal the dividend. He has protected himself against those who think they can buy the put and wait for the drop.

Intc longs should be esctatic, it outperfomed the QQQ, by dropping less.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1350597904875</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350599494064-155</Id><Title>needs to test $20</Title><Msg>then rise</Msg><Username>counter_insurgency_buff</Username><Timestamp>1350599494064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:31:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350602182185-156</Id><Title>Is Intel chips in any tablets??</Title><Msg>Any??</Msg><Username>mhebert324</Username><Timestamp>1350602182185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 19:16:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350602414556-157</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel chips in any tablets??</Title><Username>mhebert324</Username><Timestamp>1350602182185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 19:16:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was just at Best Buy and noticed about 30 people in the tablets section and only one person in the laptop section.

You can make the person who sold you the put accept the shares from you at the strike price of $22.50. If you pay $1.57 to sell INTC for $22.50, you end up with $20.93 in your pocket. The $20.93 is less than $21.67 and 74 cents would be a loss. If there was a profit, you would be able to buy the Intel shares and have money left over. The put option increases in value as the share price drops. The call option increases in value as the share price increases. A JAN 2013 $30 strike: the call has a value of 1 cent the put has a value of $8.50 A JAN 2013 $10 strike: the call has a value of $10.75 the put has a value of zero cents bid. Take a look at the Yahoo NOV options and select the STRADDLE VIEW display at the bottom of the page. Options remind me of those tests where they ask you if the picture is the right hand or left hand.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350613221825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350614207918-168</Id><Title>INTC is doing fine</Title><Msg>record earnings and people are panicking...... my blog entry describe my thesis: google "bovine bear value investing"</Msg><Username>hacksomeoneelse</Username><Timestamp>1350614207918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:36:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350614654845-169</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is doing fine</Title><Username>hacksomeoneelse</Username><Timestamp>1350614207918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You nailed it. Why issue debt when you can buy back cheap shares. _____ The recent headline news is depressing Intel share price because 2012 is clearly a bad year for computer sales. And a bad year simply means an earnings drop of less than 10%. But I don't think of a short term problem as a big deal. I've read some analysts project a long-term 6-8% growth. That's fine by me. Intel is a net-net company. This means their financial assets exceed all their debt. Intel has equity of $10 a share. This is the value of all their fixed assets and intangibles. Intel can easily issue bonds at interest rates below 3% but buyback Intel shares that yield 10%. Intel has bought back significant stock and continues to do so. I hope it does so before the stock gets much higher than $20.</Msg><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1350614654845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:44:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350618394540-170</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is doing fine</Title><Username>hacksomeoneelse</Username><Timestamp>1350614207918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree, Agree, Agree; I'm doing the same thing . . . mortgage is 3% and I can buy Intel shares paying 4%.
