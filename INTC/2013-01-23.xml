[Intel will be in production on 14nm FinFET this year with sales starting in 2014. TSMC will be at 28nm just about forever...] "After mid-2014, TSMC will have 20nm in volume." [Ha. Yeah, like they have volume on 28nm now. Let us not forget the innate inferiority of TSMCs 20nm, It's planar and not FinFET which means reduced performance and economics. Let us not forget the inferiority of TSMC's ramp which is no where close to that of Intel and is getting worse with each new node. Let us not forget the inferiority of ARM's economics which declines with each new node while Intel's improves. 20nm planar is so inferior that ARM foundries are considering skipping it entirely to attempt an almost impossible two node jump directly to FinFET...] "So TSMC is ahead till the end of the year and then again after the middle of next year. Seems like they're about even. Where's the 2 to 4 years coming from?" [Lies, lies and yet more lies. How do I know that you are lying? Because you are posting. The two are indistinguishable.

None of the foundry '14nm' SoC processes will be true ones. They will all be on a 20nm dimensional base because none of them had figured out how to do full 14nm economically yet. Having said that, volume production of Intel's true 14nm SoC i.e Airmont will start in Q4 2014 which will be before volume production of any of the 14/16-20nm foundry hybrid processes. None of the foundries have started 20nm production yet so clearly you are wishing on a star with your mid 2014 production claim of 14-20nm hybrid as Samsung have not even produced 28nm yet let alone 20nm !!

Feb 7th shareholders of record are those who bought on Feb 4th. FEB 5th is the first day that Intel trades without (EX-) dividend. SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 23, 2013 – Intel Corporation's board of directors has declared a 22.5 cents-per-share (90 cents-per-share on an annual basis) quarterly dividend on the company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record on Feb. 7, 2013. "With the payout of this quarterly dividend, Intel's dividend and stock buyback program will have returned approximately $119 billion to stockholders since the program's inception," said Intel president and CEO Paul Otellini. "This is a testament to our commitment to return cash to our stockholders as we continue to generate strong cash flow driven by the combination of new products and design wins from the lowest power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358952047177</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:40:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358952115860-37</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend confirmed, 22.5 cents payable March 1st</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358950673118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:17:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was really anticipating that they'd raise it to 25 cents, but maybe they'll do that later this year...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1358952115860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:41:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358952632281-38</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend confirmed, 22.5 cents payable March 1st</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358950673118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:17:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Q1 is traditionally the Intel weak quarter. Q3 and Q4 have been their strongest based on holiday season and end of year buys by companies. Q2 appears to be getting stronger and the executives seem to attribute it to Chinese New Year. The weak Q1 was not the time since the Intel payout was at 38% and their target is 40%. If Intel had raised the dividend, the market would have punished them. If Intel smokes Q2, they might raise it. More likely raising the dividend will follow or accompany a strong result. Possibly May but more likely in in Q3 or Q4.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358952632281</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:50:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358952808073-39</Id><Topic><Title>What am I not understanding...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1358896015169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:06:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the comment and I also like Intel but I gotta take issue with one comment.

They have contracted a 3rd party to do it for them. There are strict rules about how they can buy back. They can only buy at the BID price or at the last transaction price. They are limited to 25% of the average daily volume from the last 5 days. Anyone who is trying to pressure the price down, knows the rules and can play the complementary game. "Must be Paul wants the stock price low so he can get all his departure options with a low strike price." Your statement does not make any sense. It is almost as funny as backbay's routine whining about Paul. He appears more and more to be a "fake long" crying about the Intel share price performance, Paul O., the BOD, .... .

Buying puts or selling calls drives the price down. Someone is selling Mar $22 calls. This will cap the upside. Someone is selling a bunch of Jul $18 puts. That will limit the upside until they are covered. I have seen some strangle and straddle activity. These tend to define a narrow trading range until they are cleared out.

The agreement, which contravened anti-competition laws, would have enabled the companies to hold down wages and to restrict opportunities for their staff. It also shows how Apple, in particular, sought to use the threat of litigation over intellectual property to bring other companies to heel. The revelation follows a statement made by former Palm CEO Edward Colligan that Apple CEO Steve Jobs made a veiled threat to sue the company for patent infringement if Palm would not agree to stop hiring Apple staff. In an email to Colligan, Jobs wrote, "I'm sure you realise the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies... just for the record, when Siemens sold their handset business to BenQ they didn't sell them their essential patents, but rather just gave them a licence. The patents they did sell to BenQ [which Palm subsequently purchased] are not that great... My advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here [over patent litigation]." Apple's actions against Palm's hiring practices go back to August 2007, according to Colligan's statement. He claims that Jobs proposed a no-hire agreement between the two companies after Palm started hiring staff to develop its new operating system and mobile devices. Jobs also sent direct emails to Schmidt asking him to stop Google "relentlessly recruiting" Apple staff. The emails, though, also implicate the former Google CEO Schmidt in the agreement. In one email, he writes, "I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later". Intel CEO Paul Otellini is also implicated. Indeed, an internal email sent by Otellini, states, "We have nothing signed. We have a handshake 'no recruit' [agreement] between Eric [Schmidt] and myself. I would not like this broadly known". In addition to Apple and Adobe, Intuit and Pixar have also been implicated. In 2012, the Justice Department and California state antitrust regulators sued eBay over an alleged no-poaching deal with Intuit. eBay has filed for the case to be thrown out, arguing that antitrust law "does not exist to micromanage the interaction between the officers and directors of a public company". It also faces a civil action that could see it pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to employees who claim that they were adversely affected by the tacit agreements made between the top managers of Silicon Valley technology companies.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1358968084222</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:08:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358968122873-80</Id><Title>I was trying to wait until CNBC PETE the con man said sell INTC So I could buy some, But I must be sick I purchase some INTC today</Title><Msg>I was trying to wait until CNBC PETE the con man said sell INTC So I could buy some, But I must be sick I purchase some INTC today</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358968122873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:08:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358968419996-81</Id><Topic><Title>Narrow range trading</Title><Username>jsf34062</Username><Timestamp>1358958380034</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 11:26:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is not an exact science and the actions in the options market are difficult to pin down but I base the statement on a couple of assumptions. 1. the option market maker (OMM) wants to make a market but maintain a relatively neutral book. 2. any activity over a couple thousand contracts will involve the OMM participating. 3. I make the assumption that option trades will be held to expiration. 4. the goal may be for the option to expire worthless but the OMM must consider both the worthless and assigned cases. Buying a put or selling a call is an action that directs the shares away from you if the options are exercised/assigned. The motive may not be to dispose of the shares but the "action" resulting from them are to lose the shares. If someone traded a pile of contracts, the OMM would have to participate. Getting shares from the call would be nice but from any losses from getting shares from the puts would not. The OMM hedges to lock in profits. He does that by shorting shares, or from complementary option positions. =============== Buying a call or selling a put is an action that directs the shares TO you if the options are exercised/assigned. Your motive may not be to acquire the shares but the "action" resulting would be to acquire shares. The direction of the shares are to you so any of the options that the OMM holds will encourage him to buy shares. ============== The BETA tends to shrink because the option premium is highest around the strike prices. As the stock price moves higher, the OMM will short the stock as he begins to hit the BUY prices on the PUT bids and the SELL prices on CALLS offered for sale. That dampens the movement up. As the stock price moves down, the OMM will buy shares as the BUY prices on the CALL bids and the SELL prices on the PUT options are hit. The option trading tends to dampen the range of activity.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358968419996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:13:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358968616202-82</Id><Title>The Great Rotation: A Flight to Equities in 2013</Title><Msg>[Not just bad news for bears but horrendously bad news for bears...] One of the big investment shifts of our day may be at hand — regardless of how global markets actually perform this year. What's already known as the "The Great Rotation" — a tilting of pension and insurance funds' strategic, long-term asset preference back toward equity from extreme positioning in bonds — has been one of themes of the new year so far. The gist of the argument is that investor holdings of now expensive, ultra-low yielding government debt — following a virtually unbroken 20-year bull market in bonds — are ripe for rebalancing. The attraction of relative and absolute valuations in equity will coax the outflow to stocks. It's this juncture that has some of the most persistent global equity bears of the past two decades, such as Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards, rethinking the big picture. Edwards now reckons that over 10 years long-term institutional funds are in danger of missing "the cheapest equity prices in a generation." From such a committed bear, that's really saying something. And there are no shortage of shorter-term players hoping to catch the slipstream whenever it comes. Some feel there's no time like the present. With the whiff of global economic recovery in the air as major central banks floor cash rates, buy bonds and neutralize systemic stability fears, mutual fund and retail investment flows are already on the move in 2013.

Suppose I submitted an order to BUY TO OPEN 1,000 of these Put contracts at the ASK price. When that order is completed, I submit another 1,000 Put contract buy at the current ASK price. Suppose I repeat that process 100 times. You are saying that my action will have no effect on the share price? Who WROTE the 100,000 put contracts that I just opened? SInce there are only 6,000 contracts open now, the OMM is the one that WROTE them for me. The OMM was the seller. There is a good chance that the OMM will get the shares in April. He will hedge. How does he hedge having to write put contracts? He shorts the shares. My pushing 1,000 put contracts on him causes him to short shares to prepare for the 1,000 x 100 = 100,000 shares. When he shorts 100,000 shares, that might affect the share price. If I BUY TO OPEN 1,000 PUT contracts and he shorts 100,000 shares, it will affect the share price. If I repeat this action 100 times, be confident that the OMM shorting 10,000,000 shares will affect the share price.

If I sold a put, the direction of the shares would be toward me and the OMM would buy shares to hedge. My example was for me BUY TO OPEN APR $25 puts for $4.15. When I buy them, the OMM would assume that he would likely get shares from me. What does he do with the shares that I "put" to him if he has alread bought shares ? He will end up with twice the number of shares. I think you know the point which was that the OMM can be influenced to trade shares. If you have enough juice behind your order, you can encourage the OMM to either BUY or SELL shares. It is much more complex when considering all the months, strike price and open interest.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358976629188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:30:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358976631507-129</Id><Title>Inturd Seems to Be Stuck in the Pipe Between the Toilet and the Septic Tank</Title><Msg>Doesn't go down and can't go up.

You can sell calls (covered or naked) to pressure down. I have seen call spreads where they appear to buy the deep with low premium and sell the shallow with a higher premium. All this narrow trading range may also be the preamble of a dividend arbitrage effort. If so, look for HUGE option volume (especially the deep calls) on the coupld days before ex-dividend.

But this is the reality of where ipads are more likely to go. Right now they are just a new item that most people want to give a try. Especially kids. "So and so kids have one, so I want one too." But this paragraph from a recent article says what's really going on with these ipads. "First, let me state the obvious. Intel (INTC) has had a rough patch and it appears little improvement will occur in the near future (i.e., Q1/2 2013). The bet with INTC, however, is that as smaller, more energy efficient chips come on line, they will make headway into the tablet space and, eventually mobile. My understanding is that they are 12-18 months ahead of the competition in terms of these new chips. They already have a presence in both tablets and mobiles but it is marginal at best. Speaking of tablets, Intel's near-term bet is on the so-called hybrid-tablet, which they term ultra-book and is basically a tablet with a keyboard. Personally, I think they are going to be successful there. Tablets are "fun" but, outside the very low price point (e-readers), I just don't find them very functional. Neither does anyone I've spoken to, nor my kids either. In fact, I joked in a comment recently that if I could find my kids' iPads, I'd find all my missing socks. I'm not kidding - they just don't use them. Also, maybe I am just old in the way, but I have serious doubts about the death of the desktop PC, particularly in emerging economies." The future of tablets is more like to be an extension of an ultrabook or even a desktop complimentary device. They may bundle these stuff together with desktops or hybrid laptops. Something like having a jetski attached to a boat. The boat handles most of the tasks and the load, but the jetski is there for the extra fun. To say that tablets can replace a PC is more like saying a jetski will replace the need of the whole boat or yacht.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358990788519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:26:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358990941879-163</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH will drop over 10% tomorrow</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1358986207923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 19:10:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That should bode well for my April $42 puts.

(For more of her Apple take read “Terrific Or Terrible, Earnings Won’t Settle Apple Debate.”) That position looked even better Wednesday, when Apple’s revenue was lighter than expected and it’s forecast failed to inspire, leading to a nearly 10% drop in after-hours trading. (See “Apple’s Holiday Sales, Forecast Miss Estimates.") There are tech stocks Forrest does like though, and in our conversation she highlighted two in particular. “Believe it or not we really like Intel,” she said of a stock that slumped more than 21% in the last year. “Everybody has thrown them out, hates them as ‘the PC company,’” Forrest says. Fort Pitt doesn’t think PCs are going anywhere just yet and with that strong base, any ground Intel picks up in the mobile space should prove significant. ARM Holdings has been the darling among chipmakers thanks to its presence in highly-regarded mobile devices, but Forrest thinks Intel can move in on its territory as employers start demanding more robust capabilities for devices used by an increasingly mobile workforce. She believes the engineering challenge facing Intel – skinnying down chips to cut their power needs – is less significant than that facing ARM – making energy-light chips more productive. Another big tech name Forrest praises is IBM, which was the best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average Wednesday thank to Tuesday afternoon’s blockbuster earnings report. She calls Big Blue, like Intel, “an excellent operator,” and thinks they are shrewdly pursuing new opportunities without losing sight of the benefits of a huge installed base. “Everybody talks about the new stuff, but you need the older, higher-margin stuff to make it work.”</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1358992380670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:53:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358996585625-166</Id><Title>AMD has faded, and ARM has taken its place at the low end of the chip</Title><Msg>space.
