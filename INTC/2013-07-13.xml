The Intel compiler probably optimizes for CISC, by combining multiple RISC instructions into their CISC equivalent.

When you do benchmarking you make sure you are comparing like for like (given the limitations on the enviroment). Same version of the OS, same version of the compiler, same compiler settings etc. The default setting for Antutu was Os for all ISA's (optimize for small size), this was changed for Intel's binary. The skipping parts of the benchmark is the effect of the 'skipped' instructions. It's basically doing something like: if (CPU is Atom) { ignore this part of the benchmark; } else { do this part of the benchmark } Albeit it on a smaller scale. Do a google for anandtech forums AnTuTu and Intel and you can see the details.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1373732125321</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:15:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373732486230-20</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Beats Intel With Revised AnTuTu Benchmark</Title><Username>intel.justice</Username><Timestamp>1373677979324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:12:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are compilers and there are compilers. An optimized x86 compiler will use mSMI's (specialized machine instructions) and that is a specialty of Intel chips. My guess is that this is evolving with the new Intel penetration into mobile, while ARM has been around a long time and compilers are already optimized for them. IMO, the comps where ARM beats Intel are all optimized compiled for ARM, and unoptimized x86. If so, the shoe is on the other foot, and Intel will beat ARM in all tests. Surely you won't force Intel chips to wear lead boots in these comps?

Intel did not publish anything and has no reason so respond. The results were a leak and any response will highlight their existence and give them legs. Intel did not tout any results and has no reason to reply, other than to say someone violated their confidential agreements in Asia. Someone in China ran some version of the AnTuTu benchmarks and results were automatically, anonymously submitted. Intel (nor many other tech companies) have been able to keep their Asian partners/vendors from leaking Intel confidential information (roadmaps). AnTuTu (likely) routinely compiled their benchmarks with the Intel compiler for the first time (probably with the same compiler switches they were using before with gcc) and did nothing other than that. The gcc compiler AnTuTu was using knew something about the Atom Saltwell core BUT not about new changes for Silvermont. AnTuTu likely wanted to use the compiler that at least "knew" about new Atom instruction set, out-of-order scheduling, silicon resources, .... to get a representative result. Intel probably wanted to make that available to them for their work. Bay Trail is the first Atom to support SSE4 instructions for example. Benchmarks are hard and making them correctly is near impossible.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373733500518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:38:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373733682525-22</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Beats Intel With Revised AnTuTu Benchmark</Title><Username>intel.justice</Username><Timestamp>1373677979324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:12:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suggest you do study it, because if the claims are true...

Yeah, compiling the android kernel and apps with ICC will make things faster, but the same would happen if you built the the whole thing with ARM's compiler (it's also better than GCC) - and like ICC you have to pay for it. FYI, when you build for x86_64 (on GCC at least), it automatically includes support for SSE2 (or is it 3? I can't remember) and other flags as a minimum CPU standard for x86_64. Looking at the assembly in the article, it looks like it's 32bit (ie, x86) - do a Google for: anandtech forum AnTuTu and Intel and the first hit should be it.

If you look at the blurb for BayTrail the overall performance claimed for it is an amalgamation of about 15 apps/benchmarks so nothing will change for it.

When they introduce a Bay Trail product, they will provide performance metrics. When they introduced Silvermont, they gave some general power and performance ranges. To narrow that Silvermont prediction range, you need a specific implementation. You obviously don't care about how much trashing would go on if Intel provided some information. There would be someone (not unlike you) who would say that it was not enough and Intel did it wrong. A response by a reputable company to an anonymously submitted benchmark result would give the "trashing" more weight than it truly deserves.

Last month the company announced that it would be adding Intel's new Haswell processors to an updated version of the device, and this week Dell has started selling the refreshed 2013 XPS 12. As anyone following Intel's launch of the fourth-generation Core CPUs knows, the Haswell chips offer improved performance while strengthening battery life. Dell is claiming that the new processors will boost the XPS 12's speed by 1.6 times and battery life by 2.5 hours. In addition to the Haswell upgrade, Dell has given the XPS 12 support for Near Field Communications, letting you transfer files by tapping an NFC-supporting device to the Ultrabook. The expected battery life jump will help overcome one of the XPS 12's weaknesses, based on Sandra Vogel's review from earlier this year, which otherwise praises the system's swiveling screen and overall design.

According to Intel’s Director of Strategic Initiatives for South Asia Rajiv Bhalla, the fourth generation Core chips now only requires six watts to function, at its most basic levels, which rises to as much as 95 watts for chips typically utilised in data centres. He also noted that this means that a devices battery life could be extended by as much as 50 per cent, in addition to doubling graphics performance, and allowing for a 15 per cent overall CPU gain. He also noted that the new chips added capabilities such as a seven-day standby time for mobile devices, and a less than three-second wake-up from sleep mode. Also emerging in a statement issued by Intel; “All new Ultrabooks using this technology will be touch-enabled and have Intel Wireless Display capability built in to bring natural touch and motion interactivity and speed mode for low-latency gaming on the big screen”. Additionally, the statement also revealed Intel to be working on the premise that, by 2016, all TV, video-on-demand and Internet video, combined, could represent as much as 86 per cent of global consumer traffic.

Instead of sticking closer to the “list price” that they used to offer on brand new models, they pick up right where they left off with market prices. This means that even though we’re looking at a refreshed model with the new Intel Haswell processors, pricing is as competitive as we saw on the 2012 Ivy Bridge models. This holds true for today’s deal, which offers a solid performance upgrade over 2012 models at a price point that rivals anything we’ve seen in the past year. This IdeaPad Y410p stuffs the quad-core Core i7-4700MQ and 2GB Nvidia GeForce GT 750M graphics card into a 14-inch chassis that is still rather petite at 5.5 lbs and 0.59-1.29 inches thick. Also standard on all models is 8GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and backlit keyboard. Lenovo IdeaPad Y410p - closeup The connectivity list is strong with one USB 3.0 port, two USB 2.0 (one of which will charge a mobile device), 6-in-1 card reader, and both HDMI and VGA outputs. Intel’s 2230 802.11n WiFi card and Bluetooth 4.0 are also standard on every model, leaving only three real options to choose between different models: an HD+ 1600×900 screen, 24GB mSATA SSD, and Blu-ray drive. With this sale, you can snag the well-equipped base model with Core i7, 8GB, 1TB HDD, and HD screen for $769 after coupon. For a little more coin, you can step up to a version with the HD+ screen and 24GB mSATA SSD at $849. These prices are incredibly competitive in the Haswell laptop space and will hopefully help make a few gamers very happy.

The former is representative of a real world scenario where x86 compiler optimizes the executable to skip 'unnecessary' instructions. However, for the pure hardware test, competiting processors need to execute the same (or equivalent) set of instructions, even if that means executing unnecessary instructions. This is what was done in the revised benchmark. I am just talking about the possibility, don't know what is the real case. But if the above thought is true, CT+ and successors will have additional advantage in running the real world applications - through compiler optimization. In real world situations, CT+/BT will run as fast as the first AnTuTu benchmark. Another question is why does AnTuTu benchmark need C/C++ compiler, whether ICC or GCC? Is it based on C/C++ code? Does it bypass Java based Android OS on Android platforms and directly deal with the processor?

People should get their heads out of these meaningless benchmarks, and put them somewhere where there's more light and it smells better..</Msg><Username>thebluereddork</Username><Timestamp>1373758144564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 19:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373758264938-55</Id><Topic><Title>AnTuTu Benchmarks - More Questions</Title><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1373757513925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 19:18:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's like telling the Chicago Blackhawks to play by special olympics rules to be fair to ARMH.</Msg><Username>thebluereddork</Username><Timestamp>1373758264938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 19:31:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373763909184-56</Id><Topic><Title>5 years from now is this a 10 dollar stock?</Title><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373753196901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 18:06:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brand new Troll alias probably a nuff,,same IDIOTIC style, much better odds.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1373763909184</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:05:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373764384366-57</Id><Topic><Title>5 years from now is this a 10 dollar stock?</Title><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373753196901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 18:06:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No chance of it collapsing based on Server chips alone.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1373764384366</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373774267393-58</Id><Topic><Title>One trade + $4,500 On the day..</Title><Username>rogerwalker513</Username><Timestamp>1371785363137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 23:29:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WTGH</Msg><Username>peteperril</Username><Timestamp>1373774267393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 23:57:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
