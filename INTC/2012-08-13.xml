The Intel team that promoted Centrino thought they were geniuses because they rode the growth of Wi-Fi. What really happened is that Intel launched the Centrino product line into an already growing demand for wireless connectivity which was at a tipping point already. As a result several Intel folks rode the Wi-Fi train up the Intel ladder. Not long after the Wi-Fi success Intel wanted a piece of the cellular business and the same folks that took credit for Centrino's success thought they would redefine the cellular industry with a clone of Wi-Fi they called WiMAX aimed at carrier services. Instead of building a better SoC than ARM Intel wasted more years and about $10 billion trying to establish WiMAX as the dominant 4G wireless protocol. Carriers wanted no part of it and designed LTE which won the 4G protcol war. WiMAX was an Intel authored disaster that delayed Intel pursing the right strategy which was to build a better SoC than ARM. Intel had to clean house and bring in a new team. The WiMAX group was disbanded. A lot of people were terminated, some reassigned to offices away from the HQ. And yes, Meego was another disaster, at least it didn't cost as much. Qualcomm hired damaged goods.</Msg><Username>Merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1344864378000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 09:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344864716000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Curiously, TSMC</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344624943000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:55:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These were those killer numbers for TSMC that D.A.N. was boasting about?

And now, I want to than the Tea Party for giving us Ryan on the Romney ticket. He has a strong, clear, message, that Americans disagree with. He will enthuse the far right of the GOP (just as Palin did), but he will scare aware moderates and independents into the Democratic tent (as Palin did), with the result being that Obama wins in 2012, just as he did in 2008.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1344888583000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 16:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344888716000-46</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wally, want me to post you saying......</Title><Username>wallispumper</Username><Timestamp>1344795024000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 14:10:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wallis Kweerver married?

NOTE.... he said "It will act as a protection to future Administrations against the necessity of going deeply into debt to furnish relief to the needy. The law will flatten out the peaks and valleys of deflation and of inflation". If only he knew what this monstrosity has become. Franklin Roosevelt's Statement on Signing the Social Security Act August 14 , 1935 Today a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled. The civilization of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age. The man with a job has wondered how long the job would last. This social security measure gives at least some protection to thirty millions of our citizens who will reap direct benefits through unemployment compensation, through old-age pensions and through increased services for the protection of children and the prevention of ill health. We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete. It is a structure intended to lessen the force of possible future depressions. It will act as a protection to future Administrations against the necessity of going deeply into debt to furnish relief to the needy. The law will flatten out the peaks and valleys of deflation and of inflation. It is, in short, a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness. I congratulate all of you ladies and gentlemen, all of you in the Congress, in the executive departments and all of you who come from private life, and I thank you for your splendid efforts in behalf of this sound, needed and patriotic legislation. If the Senate and the House of Representatives in this long and arduous session had done nothing more than pass this Bill, the session would be regarded as historic for all time. http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odssast.html</Msg><Username>herbal_dude</Username><Timestamp>1344904875000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 20:41:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344905049000-59</Id><Title>amdmonkey72 has @#$% for brains.</Title><Msg>he likes the current mess we are with DumbO in office.
