No, ultimately the best processor wins as the customers choose the winners not the vendors, that's how free capitalism works. Also what happened to all this support during WindowsRT ? First sign of any real work or money being required to port apps and everybody ran to the hills. Some support lol ! 'NVidia would crash &amp; burn if they put out new architectures as slowly as INtel...' LOL, Intel misses cpu launches by months occasionally while Nvidia misses by years both in gpu and cpu, its roadmaps radically change every year as reality regularly hits your dear leader like clockwork. Only reason you get away with it is because AMD is just as bad as you lol ! Project Denver/Maxwell was appearing on Nvidia slides a couple years back as a 2012 product, even in 2011 Huang was saying it was a 5 year project that was 3.5 years done.

NOTE: ULT = Ultra Low TDP; ULX = Ultra Low eXtreme TDP. Only certain BGA versions will receive GT3 (Intel HD 5X00) integrated graphics. All other models will get GT2 (Intel HD 4X00) integrated graphics. Due to low power requirements of tablet and UltraBook platforms, Haswell-ULT and Haswell-ULX will only be available in dual-core.

Although the DJIA and the S&amp;P 500 both were able to post new all high time highs this week, the rest of the major averages were unable to follow suit. With several of the key indexes sitting near support levels it appears that investors are taking a show me attitude from here. Upside surprises in earnings, and we could see further gains. A few early misses on the earnings front and investors could use it as a reason to lock in gains. The negative divergence showing up in many of the technical indicators seems to indicate further downside is still very likely. However, as proven many times during this rally, don't count the bulls out yet. Until we see the S&amp;P 500 close below the 1538-1540 area the uptrend remains intact.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1365240787362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 05:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365246410610-18</Id><Topic><Title>Two things I've noticed...</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1365215366008</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 22:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess that is why they are doing 80 billion this year in revenues and next year they are estimated to do over 85.

It needs FinFETs just so it can fit in say a phone at over 1 GHz. ARM have developed their architecture way beyond the realms of their fabrication to contain the power increase which means they are now vulnerable to higher clocked Atoms from below and low power Cores from above, classic Pincer attack. It was hubris, they believed their own hype, they thought they could go after x86 performance while still keeping their traditional low power. They failed which now makes them vulnerable on their home turf. Only their low power low die size cores like A7 and A53 have a real future, x86 will crush the A15/A57 cores.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1365268203383</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365268420268-43</Id><Title>Intel server revenue gonna allow Intel to maintain and increase Dividend next 5 years</Title><Msg>PS, the biggest winner when smartphones grow is INTEL, as servers and server chips are required to support smartphones and Intel does and will continue to Dominate. 2016 for ARM 64?

CCUR holds a 30% video-on-demand (VOD) market share and is seeing its profits explode from the new rapidly growing multi-screen video delivery boom. Last quarter, CCUR's EPS was double the quarter before and quadruple the quarter prior to that one, and that's not including the signing of Virgin Media (VMED), CCUR's largest new multi-screen client in history. VMED is the largest cable TV operator in the UK and CCUR is beginning to power VMED's Virgin TV Anywhere, which delivers TV and on demand content to VMED's 3.8mm subscribers. CCUR already powers the Xvie multi-screen service of Jupiter, the largest cable TV operator in Japan. CCUR's VOD clients include 4 of the 6 largest cable TV companies in the U.S. and that's not including CCUR recently announcing a huge deal to double the VOD title capacity of an unnamed Top 5 North American pay-TV company. CCUR is currently trading for only $7.24 with an extremely low enterprise value of only $42mm, for an enterprise value/revenue ratio of just 0.67. CCUR has large gross margins of 58.81% and has been profitable four consecutive quarters.. CCUR's competitor HLIT has gross margins of only 44.59% and is losing money, yet is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.83. CCUR's competitor SEAC has gross margins of only 50.18% and is losing money, yet is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.81. For CCUR to match SEAC's multiple, CCUR needs to reach a share price of $15. For CCUR just to trade with an extremely low enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1, CCUR needs to reach a share price of $9.50.</Msg><Username>jowslir632</Username><Timestamp>1365297106739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 21:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365299519959-66</Id><Title>How Will ARM Sell Any Tablets?</Title><Msg>When Notebooks with 15-inch displays and running Windows 8 with Intel Ivy Bridge processors have been spotted in the wild selling for as cheap as $299, according to the bargain hunter site DealNews. That price, which includes 6GB of RAM and a 750GB hard drive, is $100 less than the best deals available during last year's Black Friday weekend. And these bargains will soon be available in tablet form factors. Why would anyone buy the limited performance of an ARM tablet when they can get full-blown computing for LESS? The ARM era draws to a close as Microsoft and Intel reunite to offer a highly superior and often less costly tablet experience. Not to mention Intel's superior Android products. Intel offers dual boot for the best of both worlds. ARM simply has nothing to compare...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365299519959</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 21:51:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365300233355-67</Id><Title>Intel's Lead is going to become bigger in the next 3 years</Title><Msg>Intel has bought a substantial equity stake in the largest semiconductor equipment maker ASML. Note ASML is only one out of the 3 companies that can make advanced lithography machines for the semiconductor fabs. It has a sizable technology lead over competitors like Nikon and Canon in making this very expensive equipment. Intel has invested money in ASML to accelerate technology advancement and further its lead over competitors. Intel is also spending $2 billion to build the first 450 mm fab in the world. These new fabs will use 450 mm wafers instead of 300 mm wafers. The 450 mm wafers will dramatically decrease the overall cost, as the new wafers will produce almost 2x more chips for the same cost.

Intel Fab Utilization is low currently but will fill it up fast One of the criticisms that Intel is facing is that its fabs are running at low utilization. The reason is that the PCs are declining at a faster pace than expected and Intel wants to keep a low inventory level. However, Intel is rapidly catching up with competitors in the mobile processors space. By the end of this year, Intel will introduce a new generation of mobile processor chips, which will compete with the best out there. It should also manage to integrate a communications chip in its mobile SOC products. This will give it a much greater market share of the rapidly growing smartphone and tablet chip market. This should fill up a large share of the fab capacity. Some commentators are also speculating that Intel might use its advanced fabs to produce leading edge NAND memory chips. Intel recently sold its interest in the IMFT JV to Micron Technology (MU). The company continues to have a close relationship with Micron and that possibility remains in play.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365300322099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:05:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365300422617-69</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Lead is going to become bigger in the next 3 years</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365300233355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:03:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conclusion... Summary I think that Intel has one of the strongest competitive barriers in the technology industry due to its lead in both semiconductor technology and manufacturing. The company is spending its huge cash flow on building for the future, unlike some companies, which simply hoard cash. While Wall Street likes short-term profit and low capex, I think Intel is being smart by spending its idle cash in increasing its lead in the semi industry. Intel has one of the lowest cash levels amongst mega cap technology companies as it spends nearly all of its cash flow in either capex or dividends/buybacks. Intel remains one of my favorite technology picks due its low valuation and strong competitive barriers.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365300422617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:07:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365300733213-70</Id><Title>INTEL’S NEW “HASWELL” CHIPS NOW READY FOR PC MAKERS IN TIME FOR IDF</Title><Msg>Major PC makers have now at their disposal Intel’s next generation ‘Haswell’ chips; this after reports surfaced confirming the delivery of the said chips yesterday. The chipmaker’s new, fourth-generation core chip is also expected to be its most power-efficient mainstream processor to date. In this regard, industry observers are expecting to hear a statement from Intel at the scheduled IDF conference in Beijing set for next week. According to Intel, the IDF 2013 will be a gateway to information and connections necessary to advance the latest initiatives as well as plan effectively for the future. Intel goes on further that IDF offers an opportunity to meet up with the company and technology experts, giving the opportunity to be informed firsthand of the latest details in technology, as well as the opportunity to connect with industry decision makers who will be mapping out what great products to create next.
