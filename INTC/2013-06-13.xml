And you don't have to be smarter than a fifth grader to figure it out. The thing about processor wars is that they don't happen very fast. The erroneous conclusion that Wall Street and so many others have made is that because it happens slow it isn't happening. Well, not only is it happening but it has almost finished happening. And still there are hordes of people who don't get it. What happened is so simple that it can be described in a single word. Certainly there are other factors, but let's start with simplicity: FinFET. The processor war has been over since Intel developed FinFET. Since then we've really just been waiting for it to play out. In the spectrum of it playing out we are fast moving through the middle and approaching the end game. Given that Intel has already successfully deployed FinFET at 22nm, one would think that even those with serious vision problems would be able to see where this is going. But apparently there are those who are deaf, dumb and blind. For those people we will have Intel's 14nm FinFET in about six months and by a year from now we will have Intel crushing ARM into little pieces. This should be enough for anyone with over three functioning brain cells to conclude that the processor war is over and Intel has won. Like I said - it was easily visible years ago. Several other factors have contributed significantly to winning the processor war. These are: 1.) The every other year upgrades to microarchitecture (ticks) to go with the every other year die shrinks (tocks). 2.) Intel's totally revamped mobility strategy which has been in place for years now and is getting traction at a faster and faster rate. 3.) Intel's extreme focus on energy efficiency which is superbly clear in the release of Haswell. 4.) Intel's recent reorganization and renewed focus on mobility. These things have all helped to end the war more quickly.

Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. FinFET 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits.

The every other year upgrades to microarchitecture (tocks) to go with the every other year die shrinks (ticks). Think of an old analogue clock and they move first on the tick and then reinforce the movement with a tock. That is probably the best way to visualize and remember it. I also think your 4 points are equally as important as FinFET, remember Clovertrail(+) is going to be a success and it is only HKMG. Of course FinFET reinforces your points so thinking more of it as a TURBO on an already fine engine would be more accurate IMO. Finally I would also add a fifth point 5) x86 proving again that the CISC approach to computing while initially more expensive than RISC in design and die area allows greater flexibility and ability to hit better performance and performance/watt targets.

The goal originally came from an interest in getting as much code as possible into small programs. The act of "decoding" these instructions would be similar to "decompression" of the compressed instruction stream. The instruction decompression engine is the decoder which cracks the instructions for instruction. Now, today, the smaller CISC code footprint enables more of the program to reside in caches and reduces the number of memory accesses. Accessing memory, today, is a high energy activity that requires the CPU to drive large IO buffers to retrieve the program from memory.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371122767341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 07:26:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371125883673-18</Id><Topic><Title>It's Been Clear</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371099638718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 01:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CISC is all what you say and a lot more. Basically instruction throughput is a power bottleneck in modern processors so you can't go too wide for your class of cpu otherwise you end up like say A15, a processor whose heat limits its clock-speed. Therefore it is important to make each instruction as powerful as possible so the processor can do more with it when it is decoded. Which is why you see new complex x86 instructions added each upgrade cycle and macrofusing taking place. It's therefore not too difficult to predict that an x86 processor will outperform an ARM processor per clock.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371125883673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 08:18:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371126102346-19</Id><Topic><Title>Market Chatter - IBM LayOffs</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1371064961563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 15:22:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>littlestupid,, see how the workers paradise has worked out in North Korea, Cuba, E.

It's the last paragraph that got my attention.</Title><Msg>TL;DR Samsung will announce Android and Windows products on June 20th. Got room for another S4 on your wishlist? We've already seen four iterations of the Galaxy S4, including the mini, a model running stock Android set to be released this month, and the ruggedized Galaxy S4 Active. However, it seems Samsung has yet another Galaxy S4 up its sleeve. This past weekend, photos surfaced of a Galaxy S4 with a large zoom lens attached to the back of the device. Word on the street was that this phone was the Galaxy S4 Zoom. Today, Sony confirmed the device's existence and revealed a little more about the S4 Zoom. Think of it as a cross between the S4 and Samsung's Android-powered Galaxy Camera. The S4 Zoom looks to be thinner than the Galaxy Camera and sports a 16MP camera with 10x optical zoom and a 1.9MP front-facing camera. As with the Galaxy S4 mini and S4 Active, the device doesn't actually have the same specs as the original S4, just the same S4 branding. The S4 Zoom packs a 4.3-inch qHD display and a dual-core 1.5 GHz CPU coupled with 1.5 GB RAM. There's also 8 GB of onboard storage. The Galaxy S4 Zoom is due out in the UK this summer, and will arrive in the United States in the third quarter of this year. Samsung didn't offer any info on pricing but it's definitely not a budget smartphone. If you're keen, best to prepare your wallet for the average price of a smartphone these days. Either that, or be prepared to sign a contract. When rumors of the device initially cropped up last week and this past weekend, we assumed Samsung was saving the announcement for its June 20 event in London, but it looks like Sammy has something else up its sleeve for that event. The company has it billed as an Ativ and Galaxy event so we'll be seeing both Android and Windows devices next week.

Why is there no demand? Fewer good paying jobs, maybe. Low to no wages for the #$%$ jobs that are available, maybe? Henry Ford understood that simple concept. There'd be more profit if folks could afford stuff, but they can't. The way this all plays out is America turns into a third world country with tons of poor and few very rich people.

This should be low-enough to go into relatively small and light tablets as it’s close to the power draw of ARM chipsets. The chip features a dual-core processor that comes in two versions – 6.5W SDP and 4.5W SDP, both having the same TDP, 11.5W. In case you’ve missed the new terminology, TDP is the maximum power draw (CPU and GPU at full throttle), while SDP is a target for “regular” usage. The processor is clocked at 1.3GHz and can reach 1.4GHz max, while the GPU goes between 200MHz and 850MHz (the GPU model is unknown at the moment). Keep in mind this is a proper Core part, not an Atom, so even at a relatively low clock speed it should offer great performance. To put it in perspective, the new Apple MacBook Air has a dual-core Core i5 at 1.3GHz with max turbo frequency of 2.6GHz. Of course, this new chip isn’t exactly official yet – it was found buried in a data sheet about low-power Intel CPUs – but we’ll keep our fingers crossed it makes it to a tablet soon.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1371131968772</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371132575977-29</Id><Title>WHERE'S ALL THE BASHING POSTERS FROM YESTERDAY?

In terms of Intel’s recently invented SDP (Standard design power) the same CPU maxes out at 6W. To refresh your memory this is just slightly above the magic 5W TDP that is the maximum for fanless designs. Intel is well aware of that and this is why it has Y-series processor with SDP of 4.5W that will obviously fit tablets and other fanless devices. The nominal clock is set to 1.3GHz to 1.4GHz and the graphics core is set to 200MHz to 800MHz. All that is possible with a 11.5W TDP. The same processor can work at 800MHz in TDP down mode, with a 9.5W TDP that translates to a standard design power of 6W, or even a 4.5W SDP. At 800MHz you cannot expect great performance, but this CPU won’t need much power either. Intel’s own document claims that package power in Package C7 state maxes out at 0.85W in C8 state needs 0.1W and in C9 idle state needs only 0.04W which promises great battery life. Just to put things in perspective, U-series processors with 15W TDP and GT3 graphics need 0.95W in C7 state, 0.12W in C8 state and 0.052W for the C9 state. We can expect to see Haswell based detachable notebooks very soon coming from almost anyone before the end of the summer or before the back to school shopping spree. Haswell won’t bring that much of a performance gain, it will make things 10 to 15 percent faster in CPU intenstive tasks, but it will sure make the notebook or detachable system run much longer and ensure much better battery life.

LOL</Title><Msg>Samsung Could Be in Serious Trouble By Alexander Cho - June 13, 2013| Tickers: AAPL, GOOG, SSNLF| 27 Comments I am a large pessimist on Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) devices, and to be honest no investor should ever want to expose themselves to the risk of owning this company. Recently Reuters reported, Analysts say sales momentum for the high-end version of the S4, which became its fastest selling smartphone since its launch in late April, has slowed. "Sales of high-end handsets are lagging behind expectations while low- to mid-end handsets are selling briskly worldwide," said Kim Young-chan, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp. Disastrous consequences The problem Samsung faced initially was trying to create an operating system that would garner mainstream appeal. At some point, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) came along and helped out the ailing company and the remaining handset manufacturers by providing a unified platform that could directly compete with the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Initially it went according to plan, with Samsung focusing on designing certain elements of the phone while outsourcing the semiconductor aspects of the phone to other companies. Soon the company came up with some of its own designs, before opting to go with Intel Silvermont platform for tablets. This more or less proves that Samsung packages devices, slaps on its brand, and forces the products through distribution. The company doesn’t do a whole lot to add to the value of the products by inserting in new technologies that could be game changing.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1371133256874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 10:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371133633920-38</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung S4?

Samsung, the world's largest memory module supplier, has reduced production of standard DRAM to make room for producing more mobile DRAM and NAND Flash modules to be fitted in the new large-screen Galaxy Note 3 smartphone, the report said. Robust sales of Samsung's champion flagship model, the Galaxy S4, more than 10 million units of which have been sold since its launch in late April, was another reason behind Samsung's cutting into standard DRAM production, the report said.

The piece highlights just some of the hurdles Intel or anyone else will have using the cable company's infrastructure to build a viable business delivering OTT live TV in direct competition to the cable companies. Even if it is proven that Comcast is leaning on other content creators not to cut content distribution deals with Intel, which is arguably anti-competitive, the remedy for that bad behavior doesn't alter all the other market and regulatory advantages cable companies enjoy over Intel. Set aside for the moment that the FCC, FTC, DOJ, Congress and the courts have for years supported the rights of cable companies to bundle content, to place caps on the amount of monthly data delivered to customers, and to give special advantage to the cable companies own streamed IP services over competitor's offerings. Intel's ambitions for OTT live streaming simply isn't good business strategy. B its own admission Intel said it is willing to pay far more than the market value and far more than cable companies pay for the same content. Just on the economics of this one parameter alone Intel is at a competitive disadvantage to cable operators to deliver the same type of service Intel wants to deliver. And any cable operator could do it, streaming technology is very mature and well understood. Maybe Intel has a D.C.-based lobbying firm that has convinced them they can bust open the entire cable industry on their behalf, but this is the classic lobbying industry sales pitch.

ATMI looks to be designed into both TSMC's 28nm process chemistry and likely others (GF), and should grow revenues/wafer once 28nm ramps. NVLS also cited 28nm yield issues as a reason for recent foundry order pullbacks, but once they are resolved orders should flow again.

I'm only pasting a portion of the article. Later on the author states that the executive heading up Intel Media has left the company. Sneha Shah (Seeking Alpha): I am positive about Intel (INTC) stock as I think the company has one of the strongest competitive barriers in the fast changing technology industry. The company has got a huge manufacturing lead in semiconductor manufacturing, which has given it a virtual monopoly over the PC and server processor market. The company has also invested heavily in the last two years to make an entry into the mobile processor industry, which is starting to bear fruit. The stock remains undervalued compared to the broad market indices and gives a nice dividend yield as investors remain skeptical about the company's mobile prospects. The company recently announced a new venture - Intel Media. This division will sell set top boxes for TVs and compete with a wide variety of companies like Apple (AAPL), Comcast (CMST), Netflix (NFLX) etc. While I remain highly positive about Intel's foray into the mobile devices market, I think Intel's TV entry will prove to be a dud. The company's strategy seems to have little differentiation, in a highly competitive market with very strong players. Intel has little expertise in acquiring and distributing content and I do not think it can leverage its manufacturing strength in this area. Recent data indicate that the company is being forced to pay much higher rates for content. I think Intel will fail in this business and should focus on its core business of making chips. Despite my misgivings about Intel Media, I remain highly positive about Intel's stock for many other reasons and think that it offers one of the best ways to invest in the technology space.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1371150453204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:07:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371150559698-106</Id><Topic><Title>About Intel's Employee Stock Options - Coinmaker be enlightened!</Title><Username>butexcuseme</Username><Timestamp>1371149867865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:57:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have been enlightened, but not by you , all you have do is check the insiders SELLS and how far the stock drops over and over again.

If you look at the TV, the "brain" of it really resides in the set-top box. Just like Intel is in the "brain" of the computer/tablet/smartphone, Intel needs to be in the "brain" of the set-top box. Furthermore, it also appears to me that the set-top box and the gamebox (xbox, playstation etc) are merging. Intel has been investing heavily into voice and gesture controls. I believe it is for incorporation into the set-top/gamebox devices of the future. The battle for living room dominance has not yet begun, but I am glad to see Intel is spearheading the efforts to change the current status quo.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371150762890</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371150856092-109</Id><Topic><Title>Are you ready to go lower, here come the insider sell orders</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371148827490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:40:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1, 2 ,3 all the insiders sell</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371150856092</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:14:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371151137666-110</Id><Title>Good job you just might get to $25 , before the insiders sell again</Title><Msg>Good job you just might get to $25 , before the insiders sell again</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371151137666</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:18:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371151197179-111</Id><Topic><Title>Are you ready to go lower, here come the insider sell orders</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371148827490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:40:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>24.92 Nice day guys.....coinloser is having a bad day.....so sad.</Msg><Username>albchem</Username><Timestamp>1371151197179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:19:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371151249458-112</Id><Title>Wallisweaver craves attention very badly</Title><Msg>Ignore him.

The first and most highly publicized is the Intel branded Web TV project lead by Eric Huggers that aims to deliver live OTT TV services to consumer's homes and compete directly against the cable operators' HDTV video services. This project is an Intel branded service from start to finish. In my opinion, this is the media project that was hugely flawed, poorly conceived and had near zero chance of succeeding against the vast array of assets and advantages cable companies can bring to bear on any wannabe competitor. Second there is the classic Intel business model that leverages it's world-class chip design and manufacturing capability to get design wins in devices such as cable modems and settop boxes cable operators and other telecom companies sell to their customers. This model is a very good fit for Intel's strengths and resources and this should be a great long term opportunity for them. Moreover design wins in the TV/entertainment and consumer electronic space probably displaces ARM which is even better for Intel. It may be that Intel's Web TV streaming project will be allowed to just fade away without ever launching and they'll say getting their chips inside cable settop boxes and cable modems was what they really meant all along. So be it. As they Intel saying goes, "Hurry up and do the wrong thing fast, so you can start doing the right thing".</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371153068801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371153294839-127</Id><Topic><Title>Are you ready to go lower, here come the insider sell orders</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371148827490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:40:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know it sounds strange but as enjoyable as it is to see Intc go up , you make it much more enjoyable because the picture of you banging your head wondering why your brain thinks the way it does makes me smile</Msg><Username>maxactionjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371153294839</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:54:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371153314594-128</Id><Topic><Title>Are you ready to go lower, here come the insider sell orders</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371148827490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:40:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC shareholders approved 60,000,000 share limit in their 2006 plan.
