Nvidia has shown that there is a viable market for these devices and Phi is far more usable as you can just recompile existing x86 code on it as well as mixing it up with Xeons on expensive servers.

That Otellini's successor will do any better making inroads into mobile at this late stage in the game is highly unlikely. General sentiment on the street seems to be Intel needs to cut down on capex to more realistic levels based on actual demand for its chips and not wild cloud-soaring projections. At 0.2% of the mobile chip market, it has a long way to go and no tracks to follow. You can make yourself feel happy that its the leader in fabrication technology. With its closed stance and the absence of paying customers this lead is leading it nowhere at least not right now.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1353498006708</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 06:40:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353498531073-21</Id><Topic><Title>will INTC write down MacFee like HP?</Title><Username>xz1</Username><Timestamp>1353457568384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 19:26:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"will INTC write down MacFee like HP?" INTC will not write down any goodwill. You only "write down" goodwill or overvalued assets. Intel is very conservative when integrating acquisition. That was what I was primarily responding to. Is Macfee [sic] the worst deal Intel ever made? Maybe, but I doubt it. Intel has always had a difficult time in the retail business. If you think that the free online virus protection programs offer the same functionality, then corporate business does not share your view. That is why they spend the dollars for protection. If you trust the free programs to protect you, then use them. The Intel balance sheet just supported the build out of 22nm and 14nm fabs. I am shocked you were not paying attention to that part of the Intel business. The fabs are the real expensive part of the business. You can doubt the Gartner Group and IDC 10% PC worldwide growth forecast. When they see data that supports a change to their 10% forecast, they will adjust it.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353498531073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 06:48:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353501225399-22</Id><Topic><Title>investment 101</Title><Username>kn592</Username><Timestamp>1353453740279</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 18:22:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i keep hearing the pc is dead...

As any observe will tell you, the stock has been hammered in the recent months--it has fallen 29.5% from the 52-week high. But Standpoint Research, in their recent research report, expressed that they are bullish on the stock, and so am I. The PEG ratio is now well below 1x at 0.83x, and EPS growth is forecasted for a 10.6% rate over the next 5 years. Needless to say, multiples this low cannot be sustained in the long-term. Furthermore, Intel has made inroads in key growth markets. The company's next-generation Bay Trail tablet CPU will use 22nm manufacturing to run an Intel HD 4000 GPU. This will showcase the company's abilities and help to gain market acceptance. Until then, the downside is relatively limited from a 4.4% dividend yield and an excellent balance sheet.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1353509567466</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 09:52:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353509710346-44</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH and Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1294333376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-01-06 12:02:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I tell you where we go from here Intc: around $15 by Feb. 2013 ARMH: around $29 by Feb 2013</Msg><Username>kn592</Username><Timestamp>1353509710346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 09:55:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353509720073-45</Id><Topic><Title>From Motley Fool</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1353509567466</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 09:52:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The divvy is now 4.6%, even more compelling.

You have HPQ up after their dismal performance and incomprehensible, irresponsible leadership with debt piling up as INTC continues to make mega dollars yet continues making new 52 week lows. Wall street is digging their own grave as they eventually will have to fight it out with each other because the retail person is making a conscious decision to remove their funds from this market as wall street abuses their authority with overt manipulation while the SEC turns a blind eye. Maybe the SEC are not blind. They are looking at the partner they are having a sexual encounter rather than doing their job.

I have owned many tech stocks since I started investing in 1997. From 1997 to 2000 you couldn't lose because the tech bubble was in full bloom. Now it seems all the big tech companies are paying dividends and are "blue chip" stocks. So I try to figure out what are the best tech companies to own. I currently I own Intel and Broadcom. Hard to not buy more Intel and this price. I have bought shares of Intel at $18-$23. So I am a bit underwater right now; but hoping Intel will break free of this negativity surrounding it.</Msg><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1353527108065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:45:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353527387239-182</Id><Title>I'm going all in.. 800 put options at $18</Title><Msg>I can't lose.</Msg><Username>thunderstar25</Username><Timestamp>1353527387239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:49:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353527787600-183</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer said SELL SELL SELL for INTC</Title><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1353514716331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:18:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cramer nothing but a Delancy St. sock peddler.....</Msg><Username>johnnycuckhold</Username><Timestamp>1353527787600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:56:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353527904260-184</Id><Title>As far as Cramer goes...</Title><Msg>just forget him.</Msg><Username>bimmy.beoris</Username><Timestamp>1353527904260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:58:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353528287002-185</Id><Topic><Title>I'm going all in.. 800 put options at $18</Title><Username>thunderstar25</Username><Timestamp>1353527387239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:49:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>expiration date?</Msg><Username>whodat_ok</Username><Timestamp>1353528287002</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:04:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353528354243-186</Id><Topic><Title>As far as Cramer goes...</Title><Username>bimmy.beoris</Username><Timestamp>1353527904260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:58:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree he shoots from the hip and has been wrong on many occasions.

Smart guy but he does not know about Intel.</Title><Msg>A fellow Lib who backed OB so I give him points on that one but on Intel, he just makes momentum moves. Selling at 22 was a good play but still selling now is stupid. The idea--am I right--is to buy low and sell high. Intel is low now and so is a buy. Also--there is a VERY good chance that Intel will get a superstar to replace Paul O. David Tupman ? David Tupman presided over launches such as early generations of the iPod, as well as the first iPhone's launch five years ago. Tupman has more than 70 patents in his name. The move has puzzled observers, as it's not clear where Tupman has gone - and he left as Apple's results hit a high, driven largely by the success of its iPhone division. Tupman's official title was Vice-President of Hardware Engineering, iPhone and iPod division. The engineer had risen through the ranks at mobile computing company Psion, before joining Apple a decade ago. Tupman reported to Tony Fadell, who led the team that designed the iPod at Apple. Fadell is often described as the 'father' of the iPod. Or could it be--Two former Apple guys? Tony Fadell too? Fadell being the CEO with Tupman running the phones and tablet division?</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1353529104284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:18:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353529164035-194</Id><Title>Intc $12.41 very soon wait..wait...</Title><Msg>Good Luck</Msg><Username>dansmily2000</Username><Timestamp>1353529164035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:19:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353529346553-195</Id><Title>TSP money coming into INTC on FRIDAY I think you shorts are in BIG BIG trouble</Title><Msg>TSP money coming into INTC on FRIDAY I think you shorts are in BIG BIG trouble</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1353529346553</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:22:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353529403965-196</Id><Title>Get ready to say OH NO up we go</Title><Msg>Get ready to say OH NO up we go</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1353529403965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:23:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353529426801-197</Id><Title>sounds like AAPL has pulled an INTC</Title><Msg>the only smartphone leader who has not gotten into NFC...the wave of the future...smartphone becomes a credit card...and guess who makes the NFC chips???

All seems to be going well. The company was initially formed by bringing together the manufacturing capabilities of a somewhat distressed processor manufacturing company Advanced Micro Devices, that was looking to go fabless, and the oil riches of the Gulf state of Abu Dhabi. Back in 2008, Abu Dhabi had a plan. The billions of dollars Abu Dhabi has provided – an investment in adapting the emirate to a post oil-economy world – that has allowed Globalfoundries (Milpitas, Calif.) to make such rapid progress. But it now seems that the time of easy money – and we are talking of well in excess of $10 billion – could be coming to an end. With talk of a future IPO of shares, Globalfoundries is entering a new phase of its existence and a reading of the runes suggests a significant change of heart in Abu Dhabi government circles. The announcement of a goal for Globalfoundries to be profitable by 2015 and a potential IPO suggests Globalfoundries' parent - the sovereign wealth investment vehicle Advanced Technology Investment Co. – wants to stop handing out cash and indeed is looking to reduce and, possibly, to eventually eliminate its stake in the chip maker. At the same time, there was no explicit mention at the time we reported on the expected IPO that of a now-moot plan to build a wafer fab in Abu Dhabi. That was expected to cost another $6 billion to $8 billion. The apparent abandonment of the Abu Dhabi fab plan suggests that the numbers aren't adding up for the wealthy emirate. Without a Middle Eastern manufacturing and technology infrastructure as an end-goal, it is hard to see how Abu Dhabi would justify continued involvement in Globalfoundries. Mike Noonen, Globalfoundries' executive vice president of worldwide marketing and sales, emphasized that profitability is the first step, and that step would allow Globalfoundries to take "control of our own destiny." That could be another way of saying that, after 2015, Globalfoundries may have to fund future wafer fabs from profits, which will be no easy matter. Already, United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), the previous No. 2 foundry, with annual revenues similar to Globalfoundries', is considering whether it can afford to keep up with the semiconductor race to smaller geometries. If a company is strategic to a nation's or a region's interest, steps can be taken to reduce the cost of capital for that company, making spending decisions much easier. But without a manufacturing foothold in Abu Dhabi, Globalfoundries looks set to be a global company that will have no one place to call home. That could be a significant disadvantage against formidable rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung or Intel.

Always baffled me. I wonder what Intel will do, if they'll keep the drivers closed or if they'll open them like all the other drivers they publish. When they talk GPU performance I suppose. I can see intel's interest given their Larrabee was a failure but they still continue the "many cores" road where this fits in perfectly. I'd like to see something coming out of it. From a SW perspective it's a pity that this will hardly be utilized and what we'll see at most is some sort of OpenGL driver/wrapper but no direct access to the chip. Could be a complete new way to write SIMD code. The ARM core will probably be dropped. Intel still has their own ARM licenses (no?). They have build an ARM core already if they wanted.

Quoting from that: … MediaTek 28 nanometer quad-core A7 smartphone chip MTK6588 launch time is expected to advance to the fourth quarter of this year from the first quarter of next year! Because the price is very competitive, only 18 to 20 dollars, not only quadcore smartphone prices in mainland China will immediately fell to less than 150 dollars following that, the company will also have the opportunity to break into [the market of ] first-tier [i.e. global brand] manufacturers such as Samsung. … Mediatek’s biggest “backer” [in terms of stock market performance] is expected to be the launch of MT6588 (quad-core A7 [with] TD-SCDMA/WCDMA) and MT6599 (8 core of the ARM [with] LTE/TD-SCDMA/WCDMA) smartphone chips in 4th quarter [of this year] and in the next year, respectively. … we will see in the near future more dual-core 1.7Ghz Krait-based MSM8960A [on one hand], and MSM8974 [on the other], which is same but with quad-core, rather than next to the launch of 8225Q. … … the fastest possible production of MediaTek quad-core mobile processor chip MTK6588 will start in October this year a small amount, quantity should not be a lot, may be available only to large client proofing purposes. Rumored MediaTek MTK6588 manufacturing cost is even less than dual-core MTK6577. … MT6588 has a 4-core CPU [Cortex-A7 (!), see on the second slide below] clocked at 1GHz [1.XGHz rather, see the included slides below], supports dual-channel at maximum 1066Mbps, has an integrated multimode modem for WCDMA [+ it is delivering HSPA+ WCDMA performance (!) vs just HSPA with MT6577/75, see the first slide below] and TD (!), that is it can support both Unicom [latest upgrade to HSPA+ service, see the news in the original post materials much below] and China Mobile 3G network, supports an up to 13 MP camera and 1080P video playback. It finally has a GPU upgrade with SGX544, doubles the resolution to 1280×800 HD level, and has 32KB L1 cache and 1MB L2 secondary cache. Along the MT6588 there is a 28nm dual-core version, MT6583 on the MediaTek 2012 product roadmap. From the chipset parameters it is evident that MT6583 is a scaled down version of MT6588. It has 2 cores less, the camera support is 8MP, the video decoder is of 720P level, and the resolution is down to 854×480. It is understood that MT6588 and MT6583 will be in production in the first quarter of 2013, early next year the fastest.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353546685999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:11:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353546935879-251</Id><Topic><Title>MEDIATEK: nEW sMART PHONE SoC will crash smart phone prices inn 2013 and mor eproblem for Intel to compete</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353546685999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:11:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither Samsung nor Texas Instruments, he was thinking of leaving the mobile market .

ARM is the first GPU Intellectual Property (IP) supplier to submit conformance for Full Profile OpenCL, bringing desktop GPU computing features to the mobile, embedded and smart-TV markets. This will help bring visual computing to life by providing developers with a consistent and effective platform on which to build their designs, and tangible benefits to the end user in terms of improved performance and battery life of their devices. GPU computing is a trend where the computational performance of the GPU, historically used for graphics, is harnessed to augment the main processor (or CPU) for certain applications where the GPU architecture will be more effective. The result is improved performance and energy-efficiency and a more efficient use of the system as a whole, making computational photography, computer vision, advanced imaging, point-of-interest extraction and augmented reality possible because of the extended processing capacity. The Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is an important open standard programming framework for portable, parallel computation that enables the CPU and GPU in a system to work faster and more efficiently together. Why: The Mali-T600 Series of GPUs have been designed from the outset for GPU computing, including full support for work-groups and synchronization barriers. Building on a scalable multicore, multi-pipeline architecture design, the Mali-T600 Series GPU includes a number of advanced features. In particular, native scalar and vector operations for OpenCL's integer and floating point data types (including 64-bit); support for static and dynamic compilation; hardware accelerated image and sampler data types; fast atomic operations and compliance to IEEE754-2008 precision requirements.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353547111971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:18:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353547431325-253</Id><Topic><Title>MEDIATEK: nEW sMART PHONE SoC will crash smart phone prices inn 2013 and mor eproblem for Intel to compete</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353546685999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:11:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NVIDIA GTX 690 has about 3000 cores, lol, but cores mean nothing, Tegra 3 has 12 GPU cores and Mali 678 has 8 but the latter is be way more powerful! In the sense that we are talking about 8 (discrete) GPU cores here, Tegra 3 has only one core. That one core has 12 shader pipelines but saying that Tegra 3 has 12 GPU cores is purely a NVIDIA marketing strategy LOL Its strange and sort of funny to me the way that ARM sort of burst onto the scene and has, in a few short years, come to define the mobile computing space. It's also ironic and amusing to see a companies like Microsoft and Intel scratch their collective heads and wonder what, exactly, happened during the time between their utter dominance of the market and their current scrambling to keep up... This just goes to show you how dynamic the mobile market is and how it will drive future developments in the computing.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353547431325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:23:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353547987345-254</Id><Topic><Title>MEDIATEK: nEW sMART PHONE SoC will crash smart phone prices inn 2013 and mor eproblem for Intel to compete</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353546685999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:11:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exynos 5250 has 72 GFLOPS of floating point performance. This is with T604. This is not running at 300Mhz, but at 533MHz. And this probably is the first GPU with openCL 1.1 full profile MAli T604 will have 68 gflops, and I assume Mali T624 will have twice as much, so around 140 Gflops, and around 280 for Mali 628. But the "GPU compute" series is better at the whole "gflops" metric, and Mali T658 will have 272, and I assume Mali 678 will have over 500 gflops, since these generations usually double the performance over the previous one. Also number of "cores" means nothing. Different GPU companies design them in different ways. For example AMD has a lot more "cores" than Nvidia in their PC GPU's. It's the same story in the mobile market. --------------- Benchmarks: Apple iPad 4′s A6X beats all comers in GPU performance “As always, our good friends over at Kishonti managed to have the first GPU performance results for the new 4th generation iPad,” Anand Lal Shimpi reports for AnandTech. “Although the new iPad retains its 2048 x 1536 ‘Retina’ display, Apple claims a 2x improvement in GPU performance through the A6X SoC. The previous generation chip, the A5X, had two ARM Cortex A9 cores running at 1GHz paired with four PowerVR SGX 543 cores running at 250MHz. The entire SoC integrated 4 x 32-bit LPDDR2 memory controllers, giving the A5X the widest memory interface on a shipping mobile SoC in the market at the time of launch.” “A quick look at the GLBenchmark results for the new iPad 4 tells us all we need to know. The A6X moves to a newer GPU core: the PowerVR SGX 554,” Lal Shimpi reports. “Normalize to the same resolution and we see that the new PowerVR graphics setup is 57% faster than even ARM’s Mali-T604 in the Nexus 10. Once again we’re seeing just about 2x the performance of the previous generation iPad.” Lal Shimpi reports, “Ultimately it looks like the A6X is the SoC that the iPad needed to really deliver good gaming performance at its native resolution. I would not be surprised to see more game developers default to 2048 x 1536 on the new iPad rather than picking a lower resolution and enabling anti-aliasing. The bar has been set for this generation…”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353547987345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:33:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353548189729-255</Id><Topic><Title>GloFo and the end of easy money</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353534491994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:48:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The announcement of a goal for Globalfoundries to be profitable by 2015 and a potential IPO suggests Globalfoundries' parent - the sovereign wealth investment vehicle Advanced Technology Investment Co. – wants to stop handing out cash and indeed is looking to reduce and, possibly, to eventually eliminate its stake in the chip maker. 2015? I would not call this stellar would you ? Anyway I was always wondering about GF financial performance - high exposure to AMD.... no easy switching from one foundry to another....nowadays both parties are "locked in" for almost good and Welcome to the brave new world of 20nm - double/triple patterning is extremely complex and expensive process - not just litho - it requires etch as well as deposition equipment: quote from ASML referring to TSMC fab for Apple: they might suggest that there could be a fab work or about 40,000, 45,000 wafer starts to put in, which in the mid 2013 and mid 2014, and 45,000 wafer start fab at 20 nanometer is about €1 billion (US 1.3 billion) in little (litho) investment. Again versus the 600 or so for the 28-nanometer investment, it’s quite substantial. I recall Intel (and actually AMD) using "older" (depreciated) equipment for NOR flash - maybe they can work this in similar way for SoC. TSMC 's overall margins are taking 5% hit due to Apple (according to blurb I posted) - keep in mind the leading edge is only 10 to 20% of overall business ....</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353548189729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353548778708-256</Id><Title>I was right again INTC made a new year low today</Title><Msg>You can listen to me I am never wrong</Msg><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1353548778708</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:46:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353550019224-257</Id><Topic><Title>I was right again INTC made a new year low today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1353548778708</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 20:46:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will Intel close up or down on Friday?

Apple simply chose ARMH to develop a product. The market decided the smartphone was better than a PC. Intel simply needs to adjust to the market decision, and produce more smartphone, tablet, and wireless chips and continue making faster and better chips for tablets and automobiles. Expect to see tablets integrated into refrigerators, washing machines, and more automotive applications. The new Microsoft Surface uses an Intel chipset. Watch for Christmas numbers. I like the fullsize keyboard. Can you get that on an Iphone? Did you post your question on an Iphone? Apple doesn't own the market. Samsung, and Google still sell lots of devices, and the PC isn't totally dead. The market will adjust, and Intels foundry operations and supply channels will prove more and more useful as they adjust to step up competition.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1353557309369</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 23:08:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
