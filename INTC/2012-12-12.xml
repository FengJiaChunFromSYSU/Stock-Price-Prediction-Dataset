Please welcome Diane Bryant. Diane Bryant - Vice President General Manager, Datacenter and Connected Systems Group Okay. So, good morning, thank you very much for joining us for what is a very exciting launch for us, the launch of Atom SoC, the S1200. So, with this launch, we are adding to an already extremely extensive portfolio of products for the data center. The Atom S1200 is the world's first SoC that is enterprise-class developed and delivered for enterprise applications. It's a single chip solution. Did I went too fast, so back up one. I am sorry. Did I hit the button too many times? So, truly an SoC, this developed for ultra low power, high density enterprise class computing. As you will hear today, we have lots of industry support for our new product line. We'll hear from our great customer HP and our end users' Facebook and our industry partner Microsoft. We have over 20 designs already and it's obviously targeted the microserver space, but we are seeing wonderful pick up in other portions of the data center, including storage and comms. And, with adding the Atom SoC product line to our data center portfolio, we are just reinforcing our commitment that whatever the workload is, it will run best on Intel architecture. We will deliver the optimized, application optimized computing solution. It's our commitment across servers, storage and network. So, it's all about scale as more consumer services come on line, as businesses become more and more dependent upon IT for delivering both top line and bottom line growth as governments around the world continue to invest in IT build out in support of their countries' economic growth, it becomes all about scale and when you talk about scale, it drives an incredible focus on total cost of ownership. How do we manage this massive environment at a lower and lower total cost of delivery. If you think about the cloud service providers today are deploying tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of servers every year. If you look at the top 500 supercomputer list that was just published back in November, the number one Intel-based supercomputer had over 9,000 compute nodes in a single computer. It's just massive scale and enhances the focus on total cost of ownership. Now, how you measure total cost of ownership depends a lot on which segment you reside in. So, if you are enterprise IT, total cost of ownership starts by driving up the utilization of your existing assets. That's why we've all spent the last eight years virtualizing our servers, aggregating those enterprise applications onto a single footprint through virtualization, driving up utilization and reducing total cost of ownership. It's also about for enterprise IT total cost of ownership is about reliability keeping the business running and doing so at the lowest possible cost of support and maintenance of that wide variety of applications. If you are in the technical computing space, total cost of ownership is all about how many FLOPS you can get per dollar, so FLOPS, per dollar from an acquisition TCO is the key and then from an operational perspective it's about FLOPS per watt. And if you are living in the cloud service provider, you may measure total cost of ownership by performance per TCO, where its performance per capital spend, so performance per $1 at the acquisition cost and its performance per watt from an operational cost. There is also a very clear total cost of ownership focus around consistency. Consistency in the data center drives down the cost of support and maintenance. Variation in the data center drives up the cost and so there is a clear focus on reducing the amount of variation, driving a level of consistency across the data center.</Msg><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1355291874139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 00:57:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355299940042-5</Id><Topic><Title>First Intel will take over the tablet market.

With Intel keeping up the pressure with new Silvermont cores and 22nm later in 2013. ======================= Check out: ITPRO(dot)CO(dot)UK - Smartphone processor head-to-head The surprise package was Intel's Atom - placing a solid second. The 2GHz clock speed makes it the fastest on test in terms of raw clock speed. However, even with this clock speed advantage removed, Intel's first real system-on-chip design was able to hold its own against the best competitors have to offer in everything but pure-synthetic benchmarking. Meanwhile, Nvidia's Tegra and Qualcomm's Snapdragon disappointed during testing - alternating between third and fourth spot for most of the benchmarks. We can cut the Nvidia some slack as it has the oldest part on test. Still, if it weren't for the quad-core layout and high graphics clock speed of the Tegra 3, the chip would be a mediocre part. Nvidia appears to be aware of the deficiencies of its design, however, and likely allowed the general-purpose performance to suffer in order to be able to run the graphics portion at 520MHz for improved 3D rendering speeds. But the biggest disappointment was the Snapdragon S4 Pro as it was the newest part. Although perfectly adequate, the chip finds itself outclassed by Samsung's Exynos and even Intel's single-core Atom in most tasks. The S4 Pro is certainly not the wonder-processor Qualcomm has made it out to be - although, if we're right about the issue being related to unoptimised software or drivers, a simple software update for the Nexus 4 could help wring more power out of the processor.

Apple has been using Samsung to manufacture the processors to run the iPhone and iPad but the two companies are waging war in competing products and the courtrooms. There has been a lot of speculation that Apple plans to move some of its production from Samsung to TSMC and possibly Intel. TSMC has also said that having a plant dedicated to a single customer could make sense. It would be a solid business decision for Apple to make this move but it is not without risks. Given the huge quantities of components needed to make the hundreds of millions of units it sells and the intricacies of these devices Apple does expose itself to product disruptions. An article from Larry Rulison at the Albany Times Union says that Deloitte is searching for a major semiconductor facility for an unnamed company and believes it is TSMC who would use it build components for Apple (known as Project Azalea). After looking at Austin it appears that New York may be the leading candidate and estimates that the plant could cost up to $10 billion. Apple has the resources to make this type of investment and it has been investing a tremendous amount of its capital in its suppliers. At the end of September the company had over $121 billion in cash and investments and an additional $15 billion in machinery and equipment (largely at its manufacturing partners) and over $21 billion in off balance sheet third party manufacturing and component commitments.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1355329499477</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:24:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355329901051-43</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to build its own FAB and Intel will perish</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1355329499477</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:24:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That could cause just the right amount of problems for Apple for Intel-rolla to make a huge dent in Mobile.

While a number of low-cost device makers such as Datawind and HCL Infosystems have already launched tablets for this segment, Intel wants to bring in devices that are more robust and with relevant content. “We are on the verge of launching our first Android-based tablet and we are planning to do it for education specifically,” Gregory M. Bryant, Vice-President and General Manager, Asia Pacific, Intel told Business Line. “Intel is very capable of producing a cost-effective tablet for education. I would not pre-announce the details, but we are very close to it. I don’t think the price is the only consideration, you also have to worry about quality of the device. We do not want the device to break when a kid drops it at the first time. There are engineers in India who are capable of developing contents and software at affordable cost and we are working with them,” he added.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355331145790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:52:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355331200144-46</Id><Title>INTC will be $12 as I said</Title><Msg>bearish candlestick</Msg><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1355331200144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:53:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355332139274-47</Id><Title>So much for having a nice UP day...</Title><Msg>At least it's not down as much as it went up yesterday... but still would have been nice if it would have kept rolling higher like it was first thing this morning..</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1355332139274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 12:08:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355332297970-48</Id><Topic><Title>So much for having a nice UP day...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1355332139274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 12:08:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The stock market is playing the FED.

Pathetic. Read James Cavello crying to his investors.</Title><Msg>Goldman Sach‘s James Covello late yesterday reiterated a Sell rating on shares of Intel (INTC) in a note to clients that wades into the discussion over whether the chip giant might get some of Apple‘s (AAPL) contract manufacturing business away from Samsung Electronics (005930KS), a prospect, he writes, that should concern investors if it were to come to pass. Writing that he has been fielding “a significant amount of investor interest regarding Intel becoming Apple’s foundry given Intel’s current excess capacity and Intel’s manufacturing ability,” Covello goes on to opine that getting Apple’s business would be bad for Intel’s gross margin, at an estimated 25% to 30%, or what he deems a “drag of about 400 basis points” to Intel’s gross margin, on a blended basis with the rest of Intel’s business. That’s assuming total revenue of perhaps $8.9 billion come 2016, if it were to happen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey James old boy. You have a price target on Intel of 16 and the stock is going up. I bet a lot of your investors are angry at you. So now, like a republican pollster for Romney, you say good news for your opponent is really bad news for Intel. So even an idiot like you say that Intel would gain 9 billion dollars a year in revenue--3 billion net profit--from an apple deal. You say--the margins would go down for Intel but that is nonsense,. Also--you are grossly under-estimating the deal. Intel will be making the chips for the Apple TV--the Macs--the Ipads, and the chips for the Iphones. Also--as a fab for Apple--Intel and Apple will be the worst nightmare for competitors. Intel makes the best chips in the world for Apple which has the best software and retail products in the world. I am sure that James will have a sell on Intel when it hits 40 and I am also sure that nobody on the planet will give a shhheit what he says then.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1355354242164</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 18:17:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355356605083-111</Id><Title>This Apple deal is "A GAME CHANGER".

VR Zone managed to get a hold of some processor models in numbers, shedding more light on the new chips. Haswell will come in two and four core versions and TDPs ranging from 35W to 84W. The flagship is the Core i7 4770K and it was quite easy to guess that Haswell ends up with Core i 4000 name, since it is internally known as the fourth generation Core architecture. The Core i7 4470K works at 3.5GHz and can turbo to 3.9GHz. It has 8MB of cache, four cores and eight threads. It officially supports maximum of DDR3 1600 and the K suffix suggests its an unlocked CPU. It comes with Intel HD 4600 graphics that run at 1250MHz and it is unclear whether there is a turbo clock for this new and well improved graphics core. The processor supports dual-channel memory controller and has an 84W TDP rating. The current king of Intel's quad-core market, the Ivy Bridge based Core i7 3770K has a TDP of 77W, which is 7W lower than the new Haswell core. Bear in mind that Core i7 3770K has the same clock speeds as the Core i7 4770K Haswell, but as we heard before Haswell should come with much more powerful graphics compared to the previous 22nm generation. The rest of the standard power lineup includes the Core i7 4770, with a 100MHz slowe clock and locked multiplier. It also carries the Core i5 4670K, a 3.4GHz to 3.8GHz clocked quad-core with four cores and four threads, 1200MHz clocked graphics and the same HD 4600 graphics core and 84W TDP. Core i5 4670 is clocked the same as Core i5 4670K but it’s a locked version, while Core i5 4570 works at 3.2 to 3.6GHz and 1150MHz graphics. Core i5 4430 is the slowest of Haswell standard power cores and has a 3.0 to 3.2GHz clock, with 1100MHz graphics. Intel also plans three S versions of the Haswell including Core i7 4770S with four cores and eight thread, Core i7 4670S, Core i5 4570S as well as 4430S, all quad cores with four treads, but their TDP will be under 65W. Intel doesn’t stop there, as it has four additional 35W to 45W desktop cores that will find its use in all-in-ones and small form factor PCs. The Core i7 5770T is 2.5 to 3.7GHz quad core with 4600 graphics at 1200MHz and still under 45W, which is rather impressive. Core i7 4765T works between 2.0 and 3.0GHz and has 35W TDP despite its 4600 graphics with 1200 MHz clock. Core i5 4670T 2.3 to 3.3GHz quad core with four threads and four cores again at 45W and a single dual core called Core i5 4570Tclocked at 2.9GHz to 3.6 with 1150MHz graphics and all at 35W TDP. The lineup looks impressive...

The firm cut their price target from $21 to $20. Goldman said the 22% month over month increase in the stock is unjustified. Goldman sees a number of issues including: processor shipments slowing over the course of the year. Street 2012 EPS reductions as record 2011 capex impacts ASPs and COGS; and increased competition from ARM based processors in tablets and eventually in mainstream PCs. Well, let's see what happened. For one, in the following 12 months, Intel rose to over $29 a share. Processor shipments grew to record numbers over the course of the year for 2011. ASPs did not get impacted at all, since Intel held processor prices strong due to superior performance and demand over its closest competitor AMD. As for ARM based processors, Intel has already made inroads into the tablet market and is even making some serious advancements into getting in smartphones which are mostly dominated by ARM for years. And there is hardly any sign of ARM based processors in mainstream PCs.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355367840928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:04:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355369555110-123</Id><Topic><Title>Does Intel seriously have about 6 times more outstanding shares than....</Title><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355365967229</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 21:32:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Welcome to Fraud Street Casino in USA USA Hijacked by Home Grown financial AL QAEDA led by Bankster Terrorists Thomas Jefferson/Andre Jackson/Eisenhower Warned us all: Andrew Jackson quotes: Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the bread stuffs of the country.
