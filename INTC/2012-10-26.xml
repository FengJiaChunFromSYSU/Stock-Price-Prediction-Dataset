"Great American Turkey Shoot",</Title><Msg>The Torpedo Alley, or Torpedo Junction, off North Carolina, is one of the graveyards of the Atlantic Ocean, named for the high number of attacks on Allied shipping by German U-boats in World War II. Almost 400 ships were sunk, mostly during the Second Happy Time in 1942, and over 5,000 people were killed, many of whom were civilians and merchant marines. The period of attacks began in January 1942, and together were known as the "Great American Turkey Shoot", by U-boat sailors. Torpedo Alley is located in the waters between the mainland and the Outer Banks, primarily around Cape Hatteras.[5][6]</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1351224497437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:08:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351227429093-2</Id><Title>hey GOP teabaggers and other nimrods--Romney has lost.</Title><Msg>You idiots think he will win Ohio?

One can use the PC to do work ( ie; generate multimedia content, conduct sophisticated analysis ) and overall perform tasks that can generate income, improve job status, etc. Of course one can also use the desktop, laptop, ultrabook for entertainment and leisure. For most however a tablet isn't powerful or versatile enough to satisfy the work requirement. It's OK for some entertainment and Internet social interaction but its limited functionality means the tablet is more like an entertainment expense, similar to buying a DVD player because one still has to have the real thing to support their professional endeavor. In a tight economy if one only has $600 to spend on technology it makes a lot more sense to invest in the tool that can fully support one's profession and income generation and do leisure activities than a paying the same price for an underpowered device that will put on the shelf after the novelty of the interface wears off. The touch interface is compelling to many but eventually consumers will understand the difference between investing in themselves versus buying an entertainment appliance.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1351260534531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351260704576-34</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts are trying HARD to keep it down...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351259285460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:48:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shouldn't it be edging closer to 21.94 area then.. seems to be something at 21.86 blocking it from surpassing that...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351260704576</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:11:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351260837154-35</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts are trying HARD to keep it down...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351259285460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:48:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also based on what you are saying, the belief is that it will be trading above $22 or well above by November 17th...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351260837154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351262488256-36</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts are trying HARD to keep it down...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351259285460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:48:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is part of the fun and mystery of options. Suppose someone entered an option trade with an ASK price of $6.80 for 10,000,000 NOV $15 call options (very, very extreme example). When Intel reached a price of $15.00 + $6.80 = $21.80, these would have zero premium. What would this 10,000,000 call option block do to the trading price of Intel? If Intel moved higher than $21.80, someone would ARBITRAGE some of these options and skim a small profit. They don't even need to keep the shares, They simply BUY the options and ..... immediately short the stock. They reap a small GUARANTEED profit. They do not even care about the dividend. If there was a 10,000,000 contract block for sale, they would cap the top trading price in the shares. So, when someone steadily selling call options at the money, the effiect is similar to but not exactly like the extreme example above. They are are dampening the upward movement of share price by feeding their call options. They could be selling covered calls, thinking that it was extra money.

The key to success is the state-of-the-art technology. While TSMC has a little bit of 28nm production, Intel has a huge amount of 22nm manufacturing capability. With 14nm gearing up quickly.

"TSMC is offering up a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year, warning of slowing sales. TSMC warns that end users -- like automakers and computermakers -- are reducing purchase orders to its clients -- which include Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN), and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA). Those chip designers are responding by cutting production with third-party fabs like TSMC. The net result is a slowdown in the entire food chain. The last year has been very kind to TSMC's clients, but the next half-year is unlikely to be. The apparent driver of the bearish chip turn is a slow global economy, which in turn has dented expectations for consumer demand for Q4 2012 and Q1 2013. Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) and LSI Corp. (LSI) two of TSMC's fab peers, joined it in offering up pessimistic outlooks."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351265074111</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:24:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351265207607-42</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Buy under $20 soon or later....</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1351264874051</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:21:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The day job not so easy now, huh shill boy?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351265207607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351265359672-43</Id><Title>ARM is just another Transmeta</Title><Msg>Intel thinks that ARM is just like one of the many chip makers who have tried to take it on and failed. Paul Otellini, chief executive officer of Intel, in an interview with AllThingsD web-site said that it would see off ARM. He compared ARM partners to companies like Transmeta, which designed ULP x86-compatible chips, but eventually went bankrupt and or Via, which offered low-power low-cost chips, but also failed to gain market share. Otellini reckons that Intel's CPUs are the best and are getting better quicker than everything else and should see off the ARM threat. He said he had been around long enough to remember Transmeta and VIA. “People come and go, and we have never had an exclusive, if you will. And, overall, the best chip has won,” stressed Mr. Otellini. He said he was not worried that Windows 9 would run on ARM chips. He said that Intel-based Windows 8 machines will run all the software and Web sites written for past versions of Windows.

But now they are warming to the idea. Driverless and remote controlled cars have been with us in one form or another since 1936. The Mercedes S Class has been able to autonomously avoid collisions, restrict speed relevant to traffic in front and behind and automatically brake at junctions since 2005. The 2013 model will have a fully autonomous mode for sub-25mph speeds, enabling it to drive itself through cities, around car parks and in heavy and slow-moving traffic. Volkswagen has been producing a completely autonomous Golf since 2006. Called the VW Golf GTi 53+1.

When the latest iPad came out, there was talking that Apple was going to sell trillians and even Nick Farrell would have to buy one because they were so damn superior. Now Apple has fessed up that tablet sales, while respectable, are nothing like the hype that the Tame Apple Press and some analysts have been peddling. In its latest sales figures, Apple said iPad sales fell well short of Wall Street's targets. iPad sales of 14 million in Q3 were well below lowered forecasts for the tablet as the economy remained weak. IDC claimed that tablet sales would be 107.4 million units, up from 69.6 million in 2011 and just 19.4 million in 2010. It said that Apple would make about 65 per cent of those sales, which would end up being 70 million iPads, depending on which cocaine fuelled analyst you spoke too. At 14 million units last quarter, Apple is clearly falling short. Analysts see the tablet market growing to 176 million in calendar 2015, as it marches toward eclipsing PC sales. But we could be seeing the first signs of tablet fatigue and these figures might be on the optimistic side. What is more funny is that this figures are supposed to be signalling the death of the PC. True PC sales have dropped but that is more likely to be the global economy rather than any Jobs' Dream. What might be particularly scary is that Microsoft appears to have fallen for it and decided to copy Apple in the one area which is really hype over reality. The Tame Apple Press has done its best to explain the figures as saying that buyers had delayed buying a tablet because they were waiting for the iPad Mini to come out. Yet Apple fanboys have already bought bigger tablets, why on earth would they buy something that is smaller and less useful than what they have already got. Why would a non-Apple fanboy buy something that is even less useful than anything being made by Google and Samsung. It is starting to look like the reality distortion field around the tablet is beginning to crack.

What's left? The answer is the $10-$15 billion smartphone and tablet application processor market. Much of the Intel resources that have been leveraged to control everything above these "pocket mobile" devices is now available to target smartphone chips. The Intel Medfield SoC has found some non-US smartphone designs. To get a little peek at what faces Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM), read this very slowly. The author has found a prototype of a Clovertrail powered tablet to benchmark against the Microsoft Surface and the ASUS VivoTab, both of which are powered by Nvidia Tegra 3 application processors. The Clovertrail tablet makes the other two look like toys. The Clovertrail is basically a tweaked dual core Medfield. The Clovertrail is still made on the 32nm process. We can only speculate about performance of the out-of-order next generation Atom core built on 22nm and 14nm, that will ramp during 2013. According to Intel, a 4G LTE function is coming by the end of 2012 and will ramp quickly in 2013. It is unclear whether it will be a stand-alone device or be embedded in a quad core Atom based SoC, or both. In any case, it will be a bad dream for Qualcomm. There will be a "forehead slap" of global proportions when this Intel story comes into focus for analysts and institutional investors. Better to buy Intel now with the knowledge that it is unavoidable that Intel dominates smartphone chips, just as it dominates all higher levels of computing devices.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1351276110796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351276597156-70</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Buy under $20 soon or later....</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1351264874051</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:21:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>intel has never been this low before and you are saying short it????? what a maroon!!! you won't have a big loss but you will book a loss.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351276597156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:36:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351276599409-71</Id><Topic><Title>Would love to get called out at 22 today.</Title><Username>yo45009</Username><Timestamp>1351267156115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Struggling to break 21.94... keeps edging it...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351276599409</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351276866908-72</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Blew Its Mobile Business - Or Did It?</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1351276110796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Intel Blew Its Mobile Business - Or Did It?"

Bohr comments on TSV (cost) Ken Liu of Taiwan Economic News reports that TSMC is aggressively hiring for their 2.5/3D packaging and test unit and will have a team of over 400 specialists ready for this business area [link]. Reports are that they have hired experts away from ASE, Siliconware and Powertech to fill these vacancies. In the past IFTLE has insinuated that TSMC was working with a half dozen primary customers in the 2.5D area. Liu now names them as Xilinx, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, TI, Marvell and Altera Corp. Reports in Taiwan are that TSMC lost the chance for making Apple A3 processors to Samsung because of its lack of the capability to package and test the chips. TSMC management reportedly now feels confident of securing Apple's foundry contracts for next-generation processors. The A6 ??

Once you basically understand that 32nm Atom is the architectural equivalent of ARM A8 (in-order 2 way issue) and it generally destroys it and that it also has hyperthreading as an inherent multithreading advantage you realize that ARM has a fundamental architectural handicap against Atom which forces it to throw out-of-order, 3-way issue and multi-cores at the problem to get parity.

With the release of Microsoft’s Windows 8, the competition between Intel and ARM promises to escalate, particularly in the booming tablet market. However, if Intel CEO Paul Otellini is overly concerned about ARM, he isn’t showing it. In an interview with the AllThingsD news site, Otellini compared ARM with past competitors that eventually failed to gain much traction, in particular chip makers Transmeta and Via Technologies. “I happen to be around long enough to remember those guys,” he told AllThingsD. “People come and go, and we’ve never had an exclusive, if you will. And, overall, the best chip has won.” Intel has long competed with smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices in processors for desktops, notebooks and servers. Transmeta a decade ago challenged Intel and AMD with a line of ultra-low power x86-compatible Crusoe chips aimed at notebooks, and was credited by some analysts for getting its larger rivals to turn their attention to power issues in their processors. However, Transmeta eventually went bankrupt after switching its focus from the hardware to its LongRun and LongRun 2 power management software. Via makes power-efficient x86 chips, but has never gained much traction in the market. However, the competition with ARM—whose low-power chip designs are licensed by a wide variety of vendors, including Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm and Nvidia—is of a different nature, particularly in that ARM does not use the x86 architecture. In addition, the primary battleground is not necessarily Intel’s stronghold of PCs or servers. Instead, it’s a market—mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets—that is dominated by ARM-designed chips, and one that Intel is anxious to get into. This is particularly important to Intel, which like other tech vendors is getting hit by the slowing sales of PCs. Analysts with IDC and Gartner said PC sales in the third quarter fell 8 to 9 percent from the same period last year, due in large part to a struggling global economy and growing consumer preference for tablets and smartphones. Intel executives believe that the combination of the company’s lower power chips—such as the newly released Atom Z2760 Clover Trail systems on a chip (SoCs)—and Windows 8, which is optimized for tablets, could help the chip maker penetrate the tablet market. “It’s a watershed event,” Otellini said of the Oct. 26 release of Windows 8, according to AllThingsD. “The fact it spans from traditional PCs and tablets and then in all the hybrid devices in between is really very powerful. It allows the hardware side to really exercise creativity in a way that we haven’t been able to do for quite some time.” Microsoft also is releasing a version of Windows 8 called Windows RT, which will run on ARM-based processors. However, Otellini noted that there are a number of advantages Windows 8 on x86-based tablets will have over devices running Windows RT. In particular, Intel-based tablets will be able to run all the applications and software from previous Windows versions. “That will not be as true on the RT [machines],” he said. “I’m not sure that iTunes runs. I’m not sure that Quicken runs.” Otellini also argued that while tablets will continue to be popular, they won’t necessarily displace PCs. He noted that many of the newer tablets coming out can also be fitted with keyboards as illustrating that users still want that PC-like experience. Otellini and other Intel executives have said that what Windows 8 will allow—with its touch capabilities—is OEMs to create a host of new system designs, including hybrids and convertibles, which can be used as both a tablet and a PC.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351301261558</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351301774079-111</Id><Topic><Title>iPad sales disappoint</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351266436916</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:47:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But for those already weary with the tablet market, the redesign of Surface and Windows 8 may hit the sweet spot.

Tepid earnings reports combined with poor outlooks on top line revenue are disconcerting. However, the latest economic data wasn't too bad. Technically, stocks are oversold. In addition, although both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ made a new intraday low for the week today, there were fewer new lows on both the NYSE and the NASDAQ than there were on Tuesday. Although the market will have to deal with the fiscal cliff problem in the next couple of months, earnings are likely to continue to be the near term driver. Most of the disappointments are likely priced in. This would allow stocks to rebound from their oversold condition. With that said, until the major indexes can break out of their downtrend, the trend stands. For the S&amp;P 500, watch for resistance near 1425, followed by 1435, with support near 1400. have a nice weekend</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1351304534228</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:22:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351305157375-114</Id><Title>After hours volume?</Title><Msg>Anybody have any idea what was going on at the close?
