You might also be stating that some options cost between $15-$23/share. The problem with your thinking of this is that the insiders pay most of the price of the share and so it only will cost a few dollars per share meaning that most of the money can go back into repurchasing more shares along with the price needing to go up to use some of these options. So both of your arguments seem to faulty at best. The 3 reasons being the few amount of thousands of shares, the price needs to go up so that the insiders can use the higher priced options, and the amount the options cost when talking about the hundreds of Millions of shares the company repurchases.</Msg><Username>insect.icide</Username><Timestamp>1354711157910</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 07:39:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354711752892-3</Id><Topic><Title>What we now know</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354677549634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Medfield was introduced in Jan 2012 at CES and was avaliable in Q2/2012. It will take more than 2 or 3 months of the first half to determine the ramp and success of Medfield. There is near zero information on response to Win8. I would not bother buying Win8 unless I had a touch device. I expect that many buyers make the same decision. The cross over to Win8 will be driven more by touch input devices than conversion to Win7 which was the first real 64-bit offering from MS. Another prognosis for Intel? 1. Using extra fab capacity to contract products is always on the table. Intel has a couple years to make and unmake that decision. The foundry decision and how much is independent of IA. They have capacity right now to do both. What is interesting about the Rosepoint die map is the large size of the WiFi section. The WiFi section is larger than two cores. Think about how adding the WiFi to the SoC will stress the most expensive foundry capacity. 2. There is no problem with Intel and its ability to innovate. The problem that Intel had was its success with netbooks. Yes. Netbooks. They filled the fabs and masked the evolution of the iPod MPG - iPod Touch - iPhone. Intel innovation will be to integrate the phone to a single chip and then to have the process and capacity to ship product when Samsung will be the only other game in town.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354711752892</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 07:49:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354712423229-4</Id><Topic><Title>What we now know</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354677549634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How do you touch enable a desktop PC?

By Jamie Yap | December 5, 2012 -- 10:58 GMT (02:58 PST) Intel Labs and Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a nonprofit R&amp;D (research and development) organization, have jointly developed an experimental memory array which they say will give better performance while using less energy. The superfast memory array architecture is designed for use in future mobile devices such as ultrabooks, tablets, and smartphones, as well as large data centers running cloud computing technology, a Central News Agency (CNA) report said Tuesday. Developing memory with the new architecture will give longer battery life, improved graphics with higher resolution, and faster integration of mobile data, said Intel CTO Justin Rattner at a news conference in Taipei. Intel Labs is the U.S. chipmaker's (R&amp;D) arm. Tests on terminal devices using the new architecture will begin next year, and will include handheld gadgets and supercomputers, Rattner added. "Taiwan has long been at the forefront of technology innovation and we look forward to continued research collaboration that sustains Taiwan's status as a major center of innovation for the global IT industry," he said. Wu Cheng-wen, vice president and general director of ITRI's Information and Communications Research Laboratories, pointed to the collaboration as an effort to help Taiwanese foundries address future challenges in the market. It will also have a significant impact on the development of future memory products and high-end application processors, Wu added. According to the CNA report, the Intel-ITRI partnership began in 2011 and involves the creation of experimental memory arrays, prototyping, and development of model simulation software.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354714947184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 08:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354716728471-11</Id><Title>8:10a Intel Cut to Underperform From Mkt Perform by Raymond James INTC</Title><Msg>8:10a Intel Cut to Underperform From Mkt Perform by Raymond James INTC</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1354716728471</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:12:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354716810811-12</Id><Topic><Title>What we now know</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354677549634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Replacement by laptops is what I expect to happen.

In short, the authors think Apple might very well do it, for three reasons: the vertical integration of Mac OS and chipset could aid user experience, the technology is now in place for ARM-based chips that can support a desktop experience, and it would mean saving more than $100 off the cost to Apple of Intel’s “Core” series of chips. Speaking of Intel, Raymond James’s Hans Mosesmann this morning cuts his rating on the shares to Underperform from Market Perform, warnings that the company faces a “potential gross margin nightmare.” To Mosesmann, there is risk that Intel’s 62% to 65% gross margin range of the last three years was an exception as it took share from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) “and benefitted from the last real Windows upgrade cycle.” Going forward, with ARM increasingly competitive, Intel might see 50% gross margin, he argues.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354720086706</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:08:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354720341187-29</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons: Would Apple dump x86?</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354720086706</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:08:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seem completely contrary to other recent news...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1354720341187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:12:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354720553633-30</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons: Would Apple dump x86?</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354720086706</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:08:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Seem completely contrary to other recent news..."

Now, the Cupertino bears (see "Here is Why Apple Could Fall Below $425") will also argue that long-term worries about Apple include: (1) Tim Cook's inability to be exactly like Steve Jobs, (2) departure from tried-and-true strategy with the iPad Mini, (3) strategic partners -- such as China Mobile -- unwillingness to settle for Apple-sided deals of yesteryear, and (4) a general lack of innovative products on the horizon.

Mosesmann writes that the recent announcement Intel CEO Paul Otellini will step down next May was “spit-my-coffee-on-my-PC alarming” and a “big deal.” Why? Because Mosesmann thinks Intel needs to change its culture of simply building bigger fabs. At issue is what Mosesmann sees as the potential for a “gross margin disaster” as rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) gains ground and Intel’s gains against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fade amidst a sluggish PC market: We believe the 62%-65% gross margins seen over the last three years were the exception to the rule. Over that time, Intel gained share vs. AMD in both PCs &amp; servers and benefited from the last real Windows enterprise upgrade cycle. With these benefits abating, Intel has a number of new challenges in the form commoditization of x86 (by ARM), price competition in both PC and data center markets (also ARM) and an increasing capex burden (with little to no growth). We believe mid 50% (and potentially low 50% over time) gross margins are an increasing reality as opposed to a downside scenario, and investors should brace for lower estimates. With ARM-apps processor pricing at 15-20% of x86 vs. Intel on recently launched Surface platforms, we believe a gross margin baseline below 55% should not be surprising. The data center assault from ARM will be next, and that could prove even more damaging as this is the only area where Intel has posted op. profit growth in 2012. The idea Intel could simply build chips for Apple (AAPL) or Qualcomm (QCOM) seems to Mosemann not an answer: “Does it make sense for Intel to build $10 billion shiny new fabs for foundry work? We think not for 45-50% gross margins, and ask IBM how the foundry investment turned out.” And so, Mosesmann thinks Intel needs new blood, but it might not necessarily get it with Otellini’s departure: The sudden announcement of CEO Paul Otellini’s departure is spit-my-coffee-on-my-PC alarming. We have discussed this dynamic recently and suffice to say that in-house CEO candidates bleed more blue than Mr. Otellini himself. In our view, building bigger fabs and accelerating process nodes at a faster cadence than Moore’s Law won’t work. Hence, the prospects of an outsider getting the CEO slot at Intel is a huge undertaking as it may take years just to change the company’s corporate culture that tends to be hubristic</Msg><Username>ezk00</Username><Timestamp>1354727927373</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:18:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354728040709-56</Id><Title>Another worthless analyst</Title><Msg>who couldn't find his @ S S with a flashlight.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1354728040709</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:20:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354728233125-57</Id><Topic><Title>6 Billion dollars says you idiots should be long.

Intel has stated margins would drop about year ago at an earnings conference call with analyst, and they also said they are willing to accept a drop in margins to capture marketshare. This is what Intel is doing now and the Arm chip makers are very nervous. What is more important is revenue and profit growth. With Intel's technology and Fabs the clear winner will be Intel.</Msg><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1354736567875</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:42:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354736592673-80</Id><Topic><Title>LOL @ Raymond James</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1354731686142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:21:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indeed, Raymond James what a joke.

I'm paying attention to this. Thesis Points on INTC: •They are making inroads into mobile. Google (GOOG) is now working with them. •The Surface fears do not reflect the eventual TAM of the Surface Pro and Yoga -- ie., the preferred form factor of Win8 Tabtops. •The move to 22nm and smaller puts the INTC manufacturing advantage in even better position going forward. •A great balance sheet just got better with a very smart debt deal to fuel increased buybacks. •The current Surface RT negativity means little in the key enterprise market for Win8 on a multi-year cycle. •A world of Touchscreen enabled mobile computers and desktops will produce immense productivity advancements in the enterprise. •Don't think so... then why is the iPad so effective for enterprise users? •Greatest threat for Win8 is my long held view on Apple (AAPL)'s potential to come out with a Touchscreen platform across their computing line. Frankly, I'm surprised AAPL didn't beat the Microsoft (MSFT) to this punch. Thus all the above, I'm standing by my $32-35 view on INTC valuation.</Msg><Username>lucy_alert</Username><Timestamp>1354740771654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:52:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354740789340-113</Id><Title>If Intel doesn't warn in a week, they will beat expectations.</Title><Msg>The time to warn for Intel is the next few days.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1354740789340</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:53:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354740964791-114</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy working feverisly for 4.25 an hour trying to bring Intel down</Title><Username>lucy_alert</Username><Timestamp>1354740771654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:52:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WHAT A PUMPER!</Msg><Username>grecothegiant666666</Username><Timestamp>1354740964791</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:56:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354741041079-115</Id><Topic><Title>This Is Gonna Be Fun</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1336573582000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-05-09 10:26:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yipppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeee! hi-ho weaverino!</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1354741041079</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:57:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354741076374-116</Id><Topic><Title>I feel INTC will have a bad earnings report.</Title><Username>insect.icide</Username><Timestamp>1354739977089</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:39:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they are, I'd look for an early warning later this month, otherwise I'm going to guess they'll meet or beat the street...

Seems to me Wall Street is on crack, even if Intel comes in at .57 they will have beaten estimates by .11. Intel beat estimates in Q3 by .10 so I'd say .57 is right on target, and just enough upside surprise to rally to $22 IMHO.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1354741515868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:05:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354741535084-121</Id><Title>Market up INTC down again and can't hold its gains, INTC not acking will looks like its going to take another leg down</Title><Msg>Market up INTC down again and can't hold its gains, INTC not acking will looks like its going to take another leg down</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1354741535084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:05:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354741741339-122</Id><Title>Intel will wildly succeed or become a foundry, which makes it a 30+ stock</Title><Msg>Intel is locking itself into success with its Manufacturing expertise.

The U.K. chip designer ARM (ARMH) dominates the smartphone and tablet markets, but now is making progress penetrating the personal computer and server markets, areas long controlled by Intel (INTC). Microsoft (MSFT) launched the first version of its Windows PC operating system to run on ARM-based chips Oct. 26. The new OS, called Windows RT, is a break from the decades-old Windows-Intel, or Wintel, alliance. Windows RT runs Microsoft's convertible tablet-notebook called Surface. Other hardware companies are making Windows RT machines as well. The technology of ARM, which wants to dominate PCs, is found in smartphones and tablets. A shopper looks at Apple's iPad Mini in Chicago. AP The technology of ARM, which wants to dominate PCs, is found in smartphones and tablets. A shopper looks at Apple's iPad Mini in Chicago. AP View Enlarged Image Also, recent news reports have Apple (AAPL) considering a switch from Intel processors to its own chips based on ARM technology for future Mac computers. ARM-based chips already power Apple's iPhones and iPads. On the server front, computer makers are designing new servers around ARM's new 64-bit chip architecture. Near High ARM shares have been on a roll since Oct. 23 when the company reported better-than-expected Q3 results and said Q4 sales would be in line with Wall Street's forecasts. ARM's U.S. shares are trading near a 12-year high. "In-line guidance for the fourth quarter is a victory in itself because most chip companies in the fourth quarter are expecting revenue declines of about 5%," said Gary Mobley, an analyst with the Benchmark Company. "Certainly, ARM is the brightest star in the chip solar system." While ARM's success in the mobile device sector is driving its current sales, the firm has aspirations to move up the computing food chain with higher performance processors for PCs and servers. The growth of ARM's licensing business indicates that some of those initiatives are taking off, Mobley says. ARM has two revenue streams: licensing and royalties. Chip and computer companies license its intellectual property when they're developing new products. And once those products ship, they pay a royalty per unit sale. "Over the past 12 months, the royalty revenue growth has been pretty darn good relative to the broader chip group," Mobley said "But it's been the licensing activity that has really driven the strength for ARM Holdings." ARM has the "de facto licensable, third-party, general-purpose processor" intellectual property, he says. Plus, it's licensing technology at a much higher value per transaction than it once did because it's upselling customers other technologies, such as performance optimization packs and graphics processor designs.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354744376910</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:52:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354744480037-138</Id><Topic><Title>INTC vs TSM</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1354739294422</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:28:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's just 1 criteria.

Earlier this week it emerged that Intel is working on a series of power efficient Ivy Bridge chips, with TDP’s well south of 17W. Now the first specs are out and we are looking at five dual-core parts, including a single Core i3, two Core i5 parts, a Core i7 chip and even a single Pentium. Although there was talk of 10W and 13W parts, it turns out only the Pentium 2129Y fits the 10W envelope. It’s a 1.1GHz dual-core, sans Hyperthreading and Turbo. It has 2MB of cache and an 850MHz GPU. The Core i3-3229Y also lacks Turbo, but it’s clocked at 1.4 and has four threads. It’s got a nominal TDP of 13W, HD 4000 graphics and 3MB of L3 cache. Moving on Core i5 parts, Intel will offer the Core i5 3339Y and 3439Y, both stock clocked at 1.5GHz, with 3MB of cache and 13W TDP. However, the 3339Y will go up to 2GHz on Turbo, while the 3439Y can hit 2.3GHz. Pretty impressive for a 13W part, but the Core i7 3689Y takes it one step further. It’s clocked at 1.5GHz, but on Turbo it can run at 2.6GHz. It has 4MB of cache, and like the other parts, it also features HD 4000 graphics clocked at up to 850MHz. However, here’s a twist. All five chips support cTDP Down mode, that lets manufacturers limit the TDP to just 10 watts. Furthermore, they can all be made to fit an even lower thermal envelope – just #$%$ Of course, bringing 13W parts down to just 7W will degrade performance, but at least it’s possible. The new frugal Ivy parts should appear in Q1 2013.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1354753729197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 19:28:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354756015824-149</Id><Title>INTC down on a Dow up day!!</Title><Msg>Its to bad Intel lost all its former glory.

I would have laughed up my sleeve but it's already full of chortles and guffaws. Intel according to the charts is a SCREAMING BUY, and just for fun you can quote me, I'll be back on this board in exactly 180 days, and we will see if Intel has made a sizeable upswing including crossing the 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages which are the 3 metrics that I pay attention to the most. Reasoning: regardless of the markets (I'm basically a long-term i.e. 1 year-to-infinity holder) when a stock still has fundamentals, and the economy is relatively in good condition (which is not the case now, oh boy) a company's management still has to answer to shareholders and the Board of Directors, and still has to earn enough money to pay a dividend. IF, and that's a big IF, Intel cuts their dividend (which any company can decide to do at any time) then that may or may not portend a lower stock price, because occasionally the street looks at a dividend cut as Good Management Style and means the company is taking measures to stay in business. I just purchased a new computer and it, just like the other 4 computers I've owned in my lifetime, still says "Intel Inside" and Core15, in fact I think it has 2 CPUs inside. Whatever. I wish I had written down the name of the analyst who is pejoratively referring to Intel as "old school". I'm long at an average price of $21.48 and am happy to have Intel in my portfolio primarily because of the 90 cent dividend and the current 4.6% yield, not to mention a P/E of 8.66. If you can find another tech stock with those metrics and is as a stable as Intel, good luck with it. I feel comfortable holding it and have no intention of selling any time soon.</Msg><Username>timbo44b</Username><Timestamp>1354757816699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:36:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354758557483-151</Id><Topic><Title>10W to 13W, with a twist</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1354753729197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 19:28:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as INTC spends vast amounts of money to reinvent newer chips, the smart money makes money keeping things simple like making good old fashioned potato chips the good old fashioned way. only fools like Waldo (an old fool who should know better) buy semiconductor chip stocks as long term investments instead of trading plays.

Since January 2010 until the end of 2011, its stock had fallen by more than 24%. As I have discussed in an earlier article, the turnaround was essential for Cisco to survive and rebuild a long term growth path, and this is now becoming more and more apparent. In its previous quarter-- the last of its financial year -- Cisco posted better than expected results that saw revenues and profits rising by 5% and 55%, respectively, year over year. The improvement came on the back of not only its aggressive cost cutting strategy but its ability to attract new orders from Asian and U.S. firms. As a result, Cisco is also increasing its dividends from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. On the other hand Cisco’s peers, such as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC), have posted falling quarterly income by 0.42%, 14.30%, and 43%, respectively. In such an environment, Cisco’s results lifted the gloom from Wall Street.</Msg><Username>pq.8989</Username><Timestamp>1354761230644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 21:33:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354761884591-158</Id><Topic><Title>10W to 13W, with a twist</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1354753729197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 19:28:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32-bit Geekbench for a 1.8ghz Ivy Bridge does pretty good against the iPad.

That allows us to consider and take business on a value pricing model versus cost-plus pricing model, which is what the foundry industry in general uses. I don’t’ think that makes sense for us. We want to get paid for the value of, for the performance of the transistors." To me, it sounds like 1) Intel will be doing foundry for a large customer and move is already in progress. I think it is a large customer because why would it hurt this customer so much if previous suppliers knows? and he also said "THIS has been a lower-profile kind of deal"..indicating THIS one large customer 2) He stresses that Intel wants to take on foundry business only if it adds 'value'. To me this sounds like (if he is refering to the same customer) Intel will be manufacturing ARM chips for this customer. Why? Because Cisco does not use ARM (some one correct me if I am wrong here), so how would manufacturing for Cisco bring 'value' ? Manufacturing Apple's ARM chips now temporarily and later, when Bay Trail or later product is ready, having intel inside iPad, brings value. To me it sounds like it can possibly be Apple that he is refering to. But overall still very vague to intepret with certainty. Also interesting is when he said "as our semiconductor lead gets wider over the rest of the industry"....Intel's process lead is getting wider....</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354766693874</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354769241594-164</Id><Title>Cisco and high frequency trading</Title><Msg>Cisco Flexes Custom Silicon Muscle for High-Frequency Trading Crowd Posted by Art Wittmann September 19, 2012 Cisco’s Nexus 3000 line has been aimed at high-performance applications, but most of the attention in that market has gone to startup competitor Arista, which has had its 7100SX family on the market for almost a year and a half now. The story may change with today's release of the Nexus 3548. Latency is the key variable for high-frequency trading; all use cut-through switching to keep latency as low as possible. Arista’s switches and the Mellanox SX1036 had set the low-latency benchmark, at around 400 nanoseconds over 10-Gbps links. Cisco’s Nexus 3000 switches clocked in closer to 1,000 nanoseconds. The Nexus 3548 employs what Cisco calls Algo Boost (algorithm boost) to push latency down to 250 nanoseconds and below 200 ns in Warp mode. Warp mode restricts the size of the forwarding table, allowing the switch to make faster forwarding decisions. Feed replication (sending the same data out multiple ports) can incur latencies as low as 50 nsec.

Cisco also provides precision time synchronization, which can be required by regulation in trading applications. In other words, the switch is fast, and that speed isn't dependent on turning off management functionality, according to Cisco. The Nexus 3548 also supports a bigger packet buffer than its predecessor, at 18 MB of shared buffer space. The fixed-configuration, 48-port switch is just the first in the product line; Cisco will add to it, as it did with the Nexus 3000 series, and we’re told that Algo Boost will probably show up in other switch designs. With this product rollout, Cisco is reminding the market that it can to things with its custom silicon capabilities that might take others a while to catch up--but catch up they will, as the vendors leapfrog each other for this fairly lucrative market. The one thing the Cisco 3548 isn’t is cheap. The Arista 7148SX lists for $26,395, while Cisco’s switch starts at $41,000 for the Layer 2 version and runs up to $66,000 for the fully loaded Layer 3 version.

Cisco also provides precision time synchronization, which can be required by regulation in trading applications. In other words, the switch is fast, and that speed isn't dependent on turning off management functionality, according to Cisco. The Nexus 3548 also supports a bigger packet buffer than its predecessor, at 18 MB of shared buffer space. The fixed-configuration, 48-port switch is just the first in the product line; Cisco will add to it, as it did with the Nexus 3000 series, and we’re told that Algo Boost will probably show up in other switch designs. With this product rollout, Cisco is reminding the market that it can to things with its custom silicon capabilities that might take others a while to catch up--but catch up they will, as the vendors leapfrog each other for this fairly lucrative market. The one thing the Cisco 3548 isn’t is cheap. The Arista 7148SX lists for $26,395, while Cisco’s switch starts at $41,000 for the Layer 2 version and runs up to $66,000 for the fully loaded Layer 3 version. Applications go well beyond financial trading, including high-performance computing and private cloud pods.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354769260972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:47:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
