But it is worth asking about what 1000 Apple processor employees do all day long if such mild modifications happen on the SoC from generation to generation? Significant yes, 1000 engineers significant? No. The switch from RISC to Intel took about five years behind the scenes and this was when Apple wasn't anywhere as successful as it is today. It wouldn't surprise me if they are working on modified versions of x86 that are proprietary for Apple. Perhaps a sleek, new SoC that is cutting edge. The thing about Apple is that they tend to announce something and a few months later it ships. If something does go down on Monday you're talking about something that ships by the end of summer in time for back to school and the holiday season. The time seems right for something to go down on Monday. But, just the same Apple can afford to sell absolutely nothing for the next ten years and still keep all current employees on payroll until retirement. So, though the timing looks right, who knows what they will do?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370666558463</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 00:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370666641912-5</Id><Topic><Title>The Galaxy Tab 3 Won’t Be The Last Samsung With Intel Chips</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370526390481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:46:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still laughing about this one.

"We estimate that a system that uses a Silvermont processor will generate 1/5 to 1/2 the revenue for Intel than a Haswell processor. We think that this is the consequence of CPUs being good enough and devices no longer driven by CPU performance." Let's look at the second sentence first. If that was true, then Intel's netbooks along with the celerons and pentium would have done much much better than what they currently see. Also, AMD would not be in the pits as it is now since this guy thinks what's under the hood doesn't matter. Intel has been seing a healthy rich mix of processor sales and has been keeping their processor prices the same for every single version of their more than 200 offerrings. As for the first sentence. Silvermont will generate 1/5 to 1/2 the revenue for Intel than the Haswell. This calls for a huge margin of error. He calls for a total unit shipment of around 325 million for PCs. Not mentioning anything about how many tablet sales and what convertibles may do for Intel. But let's use a very very conservative base of 350 million processor sales for Intel for tablets and PCs. His total revenue estimates are somewhere around $52 Billion for this year or next year and from Intel's figures, the PC segment revenue is around $36 Billion of this $52 Billion. Intel's total ASP figure is around $105 per CPU. Lots of math has to be done to figure out how many units of Silvermont he thinks will sell as opposed to Haswell and more variables have to be given by him such as if any of the older processor models are taken into account for the total units, but nevertheless, he is giving himself a huge margin of error. And maybe a figure that mathematically does not make sense when you look at his $52 Billion total revenue estimates, percentage of Silvermont over Haswell revenue huge range estimate, and the total number of PC processor unit estimates combined.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370696984839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 09:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370697261171-15</Id><Topic><Title>What to make of Piper Jaffray's downgrade?</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370696984839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 09:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As for the stock price, he has been very wrong before with his $21 target recently which is way off of the recent Intel high of $26.

Apple must counter this threat.</Title><Msg>Apple started as the Model T. "You can have any color you want, as long as it's black." Except it was screen size. Samsung is giving the people what they want, choices. Screens are 7", 8", 10". All the computer makers are following Samsung's lead. Samsung is not interested in creating an exclusive universe where you can feel good about how cool you are. They want to sell screens. Apple needs a booster shot. Every person has at least two screens (computer, tablet, and/or phone). The market is huge and growing. People will want these screens to talk to each other, without any hassles. Talk to people in the Apple universe about how cool it is to have their TV, computer, iPhone, and iPad all talking the same language. This is what people will want. However, because Apple's universe is so restricted, they have never had more than 15% market share with computers. They changed the definition of a phone, true. They brought the tablet to life, true. But their shooting star is burning out. That leaves Android and Windows. Windows PC base is established. Which is more realistic? Android phone and tablets inspire Android PCs? Or Windows PC dominance inspires Windows phones and tablets? Which way are consumers going to back-fill? Screens. It's all about the screens and who will run these 1.8 billion screens by 2014. Cannibalization? Please. INTC would have to cannibalize 35% or more of its CPUs across servers, PCs, tablets, and smartphones just to make a paltry $55 billion in sales.

The specs are something that I pay attention to as well. If they were going to throw the Intel version into the middle of the pack price point I doubt it would move. This tablet is clearly a low end tablet. The low resolution of the screen, and 1gb of RAM point to that. I know that sounds like a bad thing. Yet, when you look at the rest of the line of Android tablets with more impressive specs (more resolution, more RAM) the one thing that you'll find is that they don't sell very well. When the price gets to the level of an iPad people buy the iPad. Price sensitivity on tablets and smartphones has gone up. In the phone market it has led to cut-throat pricing for cell phone plans. In tablets it has led to low demand except the holiday seasons and new iPad introductions. The novelty of the tablet has warn off. Another $500 + trip to the mall to buy one isn't in the plans, especially if it's going to monopolized by a child 90% of the time. What this looks like is a $299 10" tablet. They may have a suggested retail of $399 but the price will drop. This looks to me that it will the a tablet that is promoted heavily during the holiday season for $250 on sale. You may find people camping out for it at Walmart for Black Friday at $199 with a limit of 60 units per store. This also looks like the units that they will give you for free if you sign up for a 24 month contract for $20 a month 2GB high speed internet dongle from Verizon or one of the other large carriers. This opens the door for $40 a month 5GB sales for the large carriers or mega overage charges. The thing that may be interesting to watch is if the product comes out in Tizen before the end of the year. Samsung could sell it at ridiculously low prices and make money off of it's proprietary store. It's the Gillette strategy, give away the razors, sell the blades. The profits are in the downloads. Just ask Apple.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370700658750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:10:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370702710683-19</Id><Topic><Title>What to make of Piper Jaffray's downgrade?</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370696984839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 09:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The guy has a history of publishing the most absurd comments. If present CPUs &amp; SoCs were "good enough" why is the entire ARM camp struggling so hard to improve the performance of its cores? What's the reason for bolting A7 and A15 together? Why would TSMC commit north of $10 billon in CAPEX to try to keep up with Intel and why it is saying it will have FinFET too? If they just listened to Gus, none of this effort and expense would be necessary. The key point that ARM pumpers conveniently omit while spewing the "the PC is dead" and the "good enough" mantras is that speed is just one of many parameters Intel is advancing with their new chips. It's also about power efficiency, thermals, graphics capability, security, integral wireless capability such as WiDi, and cost to manufacture. The point that Gus completely ignores is that if vendors can get chips from Intel with at least equal or better performance than whatever "good enough" threshold he has in mind yet delivers more features, better graphics, better battery life, and runs full Windows, Android, Tizen and every flavor of Linux - why wouldn't they vendor use the chip that gives the customer more value? On the other hand, if one believes that technology marches on and that more rich user experiences and human interaction will evolve demanding even more power and capability the answer is already clear - performance and innovation matter and the most capable product will win.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1370702710683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370703727202-20</Id><Topic><Title>this pig had a breakout then a day later a breakdown. go figure</Title><Username>phil42_ny</Username><Timestamp>1370641662045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 17:47:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>22-Feb-12 05:04 pm Two out of every three people receiving stock dividend payments are rich, many totally, incredibly rich and should be paying more taxes instead of us soaking the middle class.

This is going to give some good media to the Cupertino based company. A report says that “These CPUs are seemingly tailor-made for Mac between their lower power consumption and faster integrated graphics. Some expect Apple to take advantage of this by repeating its strategy from last year’s WWDC, where it replaced almost every MacBook”. The MacBook Pro and Mac Pro will become much more better and improved with new processor from Intel. Experts say that Apple will also be showcasing new MacBook Pro 2013 version during the Apple developers conference. MacBook Pro with Retina Display was billed as the best Mac ever, and the pundits nodded their heads in agreement. The MacBook Pro has been the laptop of choice for ‘serious’ professionals. The kind that does a lot of photo and video editing, the kind that do a lot of design work and like their laptops to be a fast and efficient beast. Every generation the Pro line brings in improvements, if in nothing else in weight and thickness but usually in much more than that.

According to Richard, although Intel shares have been on the march upward of late, driven by enthusiasm for the company’s “Silvermont” CPU architecture for mobile devices, formally unveiled three weeks ago, and for its “Haswell” family of desktop, server and laptop chips, which were formally unveiled this week at the Computex trade show, nevertheless “underlying fundamentals remain unchanged and the company’s core PC business is in a state of decline.” Richard cut his estimates for the PC market this year to a decline of 6% versus 2012′s unit shipments, worse than his prior expectation for a 2.9% decline, to a total of 325.3 million units this year. Growth in 2014 may resume with a 1.6% rise. Richard maintains a forecast for $51.88 billion in revenue this year for Intel, below the Street consensus of $53.5 billion, arguing that slightly better near-term trends are merely “channel fill,” and are “taking revenue out of 2H for a net decline of $400M in CY13.” While Haswell improves on such metrics as battery life, writes Richard, it won’t help PC unit sales, he thinks, as “we expect to continue to see tablets taking share from notebooks with the dekstop market remaining stagnant.” Intel’s recent stock “honeymoon,” as he calls, won’t last. Richard thinks the recent appointment of CEO Brian Krzanich is “a non-event” for the company, as company strategy appears set to remain status quo. And while Silvermont is “a significant improvement,” nevertheless he thinks Intel is behind in the broad commoditization of application processors, driven by ARM Holdings (ARMH) and licensees such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM)</Msg><Username>kaptain_lou_s</Username><Timestamp>1370716115204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 14:28:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370717440389-39</Id><Topic><Title>Intel</Title><Username>tecate78726</Username><Timestamp>968700362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2000-09-11 15:26:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is 2013, when is this future ?</Msg><Username>vperl</Username><Timestamp>1370717440389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 14:50:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370717982960-40</Id><Title>Shorts End the Week with the Mother of All Fudd Fades</Title><Msg>The short exit strategy put together by four of the big Wall Street firms went up in smoke this week just like all the other short exit strategies of the last six months.

I can see extending OS X across the ecosystem but not iOS. Of course, I would be happy to hear arguments to the contrary. There is the touchscreen issue to be dealt with in order to do this. What Apple is waiting on I have no idea. The touchscreen issue is currently killing them and will continue to do so until it is available. It's a huge detriment to Apple in competing with Windows 8 and 8.1 on tablets. It keeps them from offering OS X on tablets. Given their shrinking growth, this is more than a little problematic. The upside for Intel I think is that OS X is going to run much better on Intel processors across the Apple ecosystem. Choosing to go with ARM would be a serious mistake. I can't believe that Apple is not totally aware of ARM's very substantial fabrication and manufacturing issues going forward. I'm very interested to see how this plays out because i rarely see Apple do anything these days that I think is prudent. Naturally my opinion by itself is meaningless but given the decline in the stock price there are many who share all or some of this opinion. I can't get excited about iRadio. It's not a game changer. I can get a bit worked up over the iWatch. I think it has good potential and I think the reason that many peope aren't enthusiastic is that they think it's going to be just a watch with a few extra features. The potential is much, much greater than this. I'm pretty sure we will see an iWatch, I just don't think it will be this week. I'd love to be surprised. And I'd really love to see Apple come out with something great and totally unanticipated. Based on Tim Cook's existing performance I'd rate this as about the same as getting a winning lottery ticket. Come on, Tim - prove me wrong!!! I just don't know how many more heavy sigh disappointments consumers can take without a lot of the cool factor rubbing off of Apple. Intel is a bright spot for them.

Samsung announced that its new 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 3 would be powered by an Intel chip – an unusual move considering past designs have run Samsung’s own ARM-based designs – while Intel took the wraps off the new Haswell, Bay Trail and Merrifield processors. The latter is aimed at enabling super-powerful smartphones, but the new Core (codenamed “Haswell”) and Atom (“Bay Trail”) chips will likely power newer -- and possibly cheaper-- hybrid slates. Intel said at Computex that it is working on 30 tablets and said that Bay Trail Atom hybrid tablets could sell for as cheap as $399 this upcoming holiday season. But these models could soon be headed for even lower price points. Recently departed CEO Paul Otellini suggested recently that convertible $200 tablets would be possible in future, and another exec followed suit at Computex. “We believe we can push it well below the $199 price point,” Hermann Eul, VP and general manager of Intel’s Mobile and Communications Group told IDG News.

I don't know what stops some kind of touch upgrade. I like the thought of not even having to use my finger to point and just using my eye movements for much of that control. Smartphone/tablet/....my random thoughts. Apple pundits suggest a need to expand from the high price segment (phones and tablets) to protect their upper end products and form a barrier. I expect they are trying to respond with a design and a reliable supply chain. Apple has seen the TSMC/Samsung Semi/Intel roadmaps, knows the Intel schedules and knows the Intel history of hitting those targets. I think that the biggest problem that Apple faces is sufficient, reliable, advanced process fab capacity. Depending on where they go for fab and what process they get, that will heavily influence how they go forward. The matrix of possible iPad/iPhone upgrade possibilities is pretty complex.
