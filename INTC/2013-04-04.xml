Intel's decision to support full profile OpenCL in its HD Graphics 4000 core marked the first time the firm acknowledged the power of GPGPUs. Now it seems that Intel is perfectly happy to help developers make use of the GPU for computing purposes in addition to its CPU cores. Given the prevalence of Intel's GPUs in the market, the firm's support of OpenCL is vital to widespread adoption. The problem for Intel is that should developers make good use of its GPU and its full computing capabilities, the firm's investment in CPU engineering could be undermined.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1365048369801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 00:06:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365048542116-6</Id><Title>anyone think this will go to 29?</Title><Msg>Anytime soon</Msg><Username>investor2210</Username><Timestamp>1365048542116</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 00:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365048573538-7</Id><Topic><Title>test</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1365047797783</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 23:56:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It seems to be selective - my post does not include any link - very strange.

In the recent years, to better regulate voltages of different blocks within central processing units, multi-phase CPU power supply circuitries were implemented. Such circuitries are rather costly and take up a lot of space on mainboards. But most importantly, granularity and performance of such VRMs is not as high as Intel wants. In a bid to make its chips even more power efficient than they are today, Intel has developed a special programmable chip with 20 power cells, reports PC Watch web-site. Each power cells is a mini VR with analogue circuits rated for up to 25A electric current and supporting up to 16 phases. Potentially, one 20-cell chip enables 320 power phases per CPU, which allows extreme granularity of power supply. Intel will install the integrated voltage regulator (IVR) chip, which will be made using 22nm process technology onto the same substrate with Haswell microprocessors.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1365055252963</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 02:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365055380359-22</Id><Title>The Big Bet at Intel Corp.

Now, an analyst says he's learned that the set will go on sale late this year, for $1,500 to $2,500. In a research note Wednesday, Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets says the "iTV" will be 60 inches on the diagonal, but could also come in 50- and 55-inch versions. Apple will also release a small "iRing" that fits on the viewer's finger, allowing the user to control the screen by pointing, White says. In addition, the set will come with tablet-like "mini iTVs" with 9.7-inch screens, the same as the full-size iPad, White said. The "iTV" will be able to send video to the smaller screens wirelessly around the house. The concept is similar to the way in which cable and satellite TV companies are starting to let their set-top boxes send video to iPads and other tablets. White says his report is based on gleanings from visits with unnamed Chinese and Taiwanese companies that supply Apple with components. Apple doesn't comment on future products before its launch events, but late company co-founder Steve Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson that he wanted to remake the TV and had figured out a way to do it. Last year, there were numerous analyst reports that said Apple would launch a TV set in 2012. Apple does sell an "Apple TV," but it's a small box that connects to a TV to display movies and shows from iTunes. Apple shares rose $2.20 to close at $431.99 Wednesday, as the tech-dominated Nasdaq index fell 1.1 percent. Apple's stock is still close to the 52-week low of $419, which it hit a month ago.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365056006973</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 02:13:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365056838986-25</Id><Topic><Title>The Big Bet at Intel Corp.

None of you should love or hate intel. You should all be glad it exists and we are at a point like this now with people divided and the stock going nowhere for years while its valuation is getting cheaper and cheaper and the potential bargain larger and larger. Stop the fighting and recognize what the situation is; The way i see it intel is in one of 3 possible cases; 1) Its a company that is facing a transition that will eventually destroy it and collapse its business model and render it a fossil company unable to adapt to a changing world. Then it will go to teens and below 10 and single digits eventually. 2) Its a stock that will experience a further lengthy period of nothing significant going up and down and never making a real move of over 50% from some core avg of the past 10 years call it 20. So 10-30 forever until we die or stop studying/trading/investing in it. 3) Its a company that like ibm or apple took a significant period of nothing happening almost decade plus (same for them look it up) (appl 1988 to 2000 12+ years did nothing) (ibm 1970-1997 28y did nothing) until they finally got it together to enter a new phase accepting for good what needed to be done and forcefully changing the market itself rather than being a victim of it (eg compete with apple etc). Basically the moment intel becomes a player that designs its market and not serve the market of others it will regain a potential for growth and valuation expansion that will easily give it a factor to 5-10 eventually from here. Now its hard to know what of the 3 is the case. You will all take sides here and i personally take 3 but i will never assign 0 chance to the the other 2 alternatives. Yes they can all 3 prove reasonable outcomes that ignoring completely their possibility will be detrimental. So what is to be done then? cont.-</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1365064257918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 04:30:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365065159753-29</Id><Topic><Title>Why most of you have this game all wrong with intel.</Title><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1365064257918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 04:30:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>continued- Whatever you want to choose of 1,2,3 its fine with me. Choose it and study the changes that take place to adapt and even reconsider your choice in the future or find yourself firmly believing it further. Accept that no matter what is to happen, it wont happen overnight and possibly several years will still be required to decide it. So recognize that you must choose to trade intel smartly instead of taking sides and hating all others that take different ones. The ideal thing to do is to create a portfolio that is 50% cash and 25% long intel or 25% short intel and the other 25% is to be used to trade derivatives or shares using technical analysis and fundamental analysis and broad market timing and all kinds of information that can help you be a 60-40% or better predictor (very doable). Remain objective. Intel is giving both buy and sell signals all the time. To remain permanently long or short without adjusting exposure to price changes is idiotic. Choose a core position that reflects your choice of 1,2,3 case and use the rest as cash and as trading capital going long calls or puts (or shares ) depending on the kind of signal you have. Then close the trades often at profits or sometimes at loss and adjust the portfolio to be again 50-25-25. So if you have profits over time you will notice that your cash and your position will increase . If you are short you will be able to short more for the core. If you are long you will be buying more shares over time. Eventually this way even if wrong on the core decision and another case proves true you will not destroy your portfolio. You will increase it even if wrong. Of course if you are right you will increase it much more. So stop fighting each other and instead exchange information with friendship in mind. Then use that information to trade better. Trade and build longer core positions and see how it works out. All will win that do this and they will be happy even if intel proved them wrong.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1365065159753</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 04:45:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365065824523-30</Id><Topic><Title>Why most of you have this game all wrong with intel.</Title><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1365064257918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 04:30:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think you cant time the market 60-40 on the trading signals i suggested then simply ladies and gentlemen you do not have what it takes to have any bloody attitude about the stock or the market and you need to shut up. Get it now why fighting is idiotic and childish??? If you know what the heck you are doing or talking you must recognize that you are capable to spot a bargain or an overbought situation both near term and mid term but also recognize that all 3 of the cases i listed can potentially happen long term and therefore taking only a static long term position and supporting it with endless posts is a very risky gamble and naive choice. Therefore what i proposed is doable if you have what it takes. You create a core based on long term fundamental faith which you continue to re-evaluate and you supply it with more power over time through trading. If you cant trade then you are not good enough to begin with to have a core position and attack others for having opposite ones. Only someone ignorant thinks they are entitled to attack others on their fundamental stock direction choices to the degree experienced here. Instead learn to interact with each other friendly and debate and collect information to get better at trading and safer in your core choice.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1365065824523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 04:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365067569353-31</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>normanmarra</Username><Timestamp>1365067569353</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 05:26:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365068769674-32</Id><Title>SA Article by Asraff Easa, April4th, 2013</Title><Msg>Generally yet another good article of which in part touches on the marketing strengths of INTC.

Crazy as it may sound, surely the possibility of choosing someone from ARMH can't be ruled out. Confused? Take a close look at the DELL's case where a former executive has actively taken a key position with counterbidding sides. I continue to maintain a hedged position in INTC.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1365068769674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 05:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365071637416-33</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great job!</Msg><Username>severanced</Username><Timestamp>1365071637416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 06:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365074705221-34</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great job!</Msg><Username>lorenphelps535</Username><Timestamp>1365074705221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 07:25:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365074706102-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Buy under $20 next!!!</Title><Username>spcrash</Username><Timestamp>1365069114250</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 05:51:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf of the ragsheet SA is a relentless pumper..A dolt who desperately needs to "get a life"..Exactly what I am waiting for...

According to the last cc, we might start to see that in second half, but who knows? Despite the overhyped pumpers, top and bottom line growth is a simple objective criterion, and INTC hasn't been doing it lately. Once they do, despite the sickening naysayers, this thing will soar.

Intel has been revealing high level details of its upcoming Haswell processors for a long time, such as its statement at IDF 2012 that a Haswell 10W TDP part will be pitched at laptops. The firm not only shown off running Haswell silicon at the recent Game Developer Conference but also announced that its HD Graphics 15.31 driver released this week is designed specifically for Haswell processors. There's no doubt that Intel's Haswell chip will be the big semiconductor product launch of 2013, but it is rare to see Intel give away so many details of its upcoming processor line, given that AMD is doing relatively little to push the firm's third generation Ivy Bridge Core processors to the limit. However Intel's prelaunch announcements show a company that wants to stress the efficiency of its processors above everything else. ... Andrew Feldman, best known for leading Seamicro and who is currently corporate VP and GM of AMD's Server Business Unit, told The INQUIRER that the cost of developing ARM based processors is so low that chip vendors' biggest customers will be able to subsidise chip development cost and buy the products on a cost-plus basis. Feldman's future might sound extreme, and it is in the present day semiconductor industry, but ARM based processors are considerably quicker and easier to develop and do not require leading edge process nodes to have the energy efficiency that Intel gains with its advanced manufacturing capabilities. theinquirerDOTnet/inquirer/feature/2258763/customer-designed-arm-chips-will-give-intel-headaches</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1365079082141</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 08:38:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365080543228-43</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well everything in the article is negative on Intel, so not really much to think about.

It's believed that Intel's average price per chip breaks down to about $107 -- far above the $21.39 that Qualcomm commands. Granted, Intel's trailing-12-month gross profit margin is over three times richer than what Qualcomm earns on its chip business. More than likely, Intel's gross profit margin will likely be cannibalized at the expense of growth in mobile computing, unless Intel can somehow maintain its historically rich profitability.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365085307309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 10:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365085320109-56</Id><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Msg>Another tough day for ARM longs as the stock is once again threatening to drop below $40.

Phone expected to reach 2 billion units in 2017. Everybody knows Intel's story by now. Intel has a compelling array of CPUs and SoC's for tablets and smartphones and Intel's plan for innovation is unmatched. Nothing will challenge Haswell tablets for high-end performance and Clovertrail+ already competes with the best ARM products shipping today. In the next several quarters Intel also releases Baytrail and fills the requirement for LTE. Intel's product lineup is looking good for smartphones and the price/performance gains of 14nm Intel products arrive next year. Intel is well positioned to capture a sizeable share of that predicted growth. Microsoft on the other hand is on the verge of getting left out of this future because Intel can ride Android and Tizen into the future. While Microsoft has announced new pricing schemes for smaller tablets they need bold, game-changing improvements, and they need it fast.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365088660688</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365088830276-72</Id><Title>intel/apple deal</Title><Msg>The decision could have been made 18months ago. "A" parts could have been designed to run on gate last, made and qualified. How would we know any different? The problem has been a secure source of the right kind of memory. There is a lot of capacity underutilized at Intel, it is reasonable that that capacity gets filled soon. Apple/TSMC is a bad joke. If Intel priced Apple chips at the Samsung price ($17.50 according to iSuppli [I think more like $25]) they would generate about $16,000 revenue per $5000 cost 22nm wafer. Moving to 14nm the cost would go to about $3.50 while the resale price would stay at $17.50...why would it go down? So now you have 80% gross margins. By that time Intel will be making new architecture x86 based SoCs that run circles around the A chips. What will Apple do then? Oh, Intel will do the apple business alright, but not until memory sourcing is firmly under control. You can bet that Intel has already seen the new Atom cores in an SoC in engineering volume. I would bet that it just dances around anything any foundry can do now or in the future. So, how long do you think Apple would have Intel fab and inferior product for them while Intel is supplying x86 SoCs to the rest of the world? In the unlikely event that the Apple "A" chips outperform the new Atom based stuff, Intel BETTER get in bed with Apple...or get ready to sell those excess fabs for 50 cents on the dollar. Intel will do the Apple business either way.</Msg><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365088830276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:20:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365088983647-73</Id><Title>Invest Smartly</Title><Msg>In this day and age you need any advantage you can get.

Jen-Hsen, who worked for AMD in a former incarnation, is on record as saying that if he worked for Intel it would only be as the head of the corporation. Noted for his incredible work ethic, Jen-Hsen built Nvidia up more or less from scratch. But its unclear how far the approaches went – Intel’s head hunters are more or less scrabbling around trying to find the successor for Otellini. Pat Gelsinger, chief technology officer at EMC, has signalled that he’s not interested in the job. Internal candidates include Dadi Perlmutter. The future CEO of Intel, whoever she or he is, faces a daunting task. Faced with the fact of convergence and people moving in droves to use smartphones and tablets without any X86 device inside, Intel, basically, needs to be completely re-engineered.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365102017102</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 15:00:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365102017353-122</Id><Title>Hate all the GD Intel bagholders</Title><Msg>Am under the impression that my comments somehow have a way of affecting the market price.

Swift is much lower. The last one was clocked around 1.3GHz whereas Atom is around 2GHz. The new out-of-order Atom may have better performance, but what it gains from process (22nm) it will lose in increased active gate count so it'll probably have about the same power draw as the current one. To compete, Intel needs to reduce power draw. They don't seem to get that. Or maybe they've run out of ideas.

He will publish hs "reiteration" with a negative statement just before all Intel events. He will then reiterate right after the event saying "nothing new". He then reiterates several weeks after the event and lowers his target. He did not reiterate and lower his target after the Q1 earnings and I was surprised to not hear from him. It is nice to know that he is still alive. Expect him again the day after earnings and then again around May 1st. He will have even more negative things to say. If you look at his history of ratings, he has maintained his SELL rating even as he raised his target to $25 last summer when Inte went to $29. (StreetInsider) I have often wondered what it would take to get a NEUTRAL from him. The problem he has is that a NEUTRAL rating would be an UPGRADE.

Intel saw a year-over-year revenue decline of 3.1 percent, as slow PC sales dragged down the dominant PC semiconductor supplier. Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) surged 31.8 percent year-over-year to the No. 3 spot in 2012 from No. 6 in 2011 on the back of its success supplying mobile phone semiconductors. Samsung came in second with a 3.1 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Texas Instruments held onto fourth place in the semiconductor market, while Toshiba dropped to fifth place from the third spot in 2011. "The normal drivers of semiconductor industry growth--the computing, wireless, consumer electronics and automotive electronics sectors--all suffered serious disruption in 2012. Even the industrial/medical, wired communications and military/aerospace sectors ordinarily less affected by changes in consumer sentiment suffered severe declines in semiconductor consumption. Excess inventory levels also remained a growth inhibitor," said Steve Ohr, research director at Gartner. Recognizing its vulnerable position as a PC semiconductor supplier, Intel has been desperately trying to make in-roads into the mobile semiconductor market. Qualcomm and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) grabbed the early lead in that mobile chip market, and Intel has been playing catch-up ever since. Intel has succeeded in getting its chips into high-end Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) Surface tablets and has been pushing a marketing program using the "Intel Inside" branding on mobile phones containing its chips. So far, Intel has succeeded in getting its chips into seven smartphones available in 20 countries, according to a report by The Motley Fool. Intel has already launched its Lexington chipset for lower-end smartphones, which are able to support cameras, 1080p video viewing, HSPA+, dual SIM cards and wireless video streaming through Intel's WiDi technology. Its Merrifield chipset, aimed at the higher-end smartphone market and due out later this year, will provide greater power efficiency and performance on a small 22-nanometer design, the report noted. In China, Intel signed a partnership with ZTE to provide its Atom Z2580 processor for ZTE's high-end smartphones, according to a report by the South China Morning Post. "We are expanding into the mobile device field because this is a big market," Vincent Lee, Intel manager for southern China, told the newspaper. Intel is also teaming with Lenovo to provide mobile phones powered by Intel chips in China. Intel recognizes that it must score in the mobile semiconductor market or fall by the wayside as PC sales continue to decline. Whether it will succeed remains to be seen.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365113141566</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 18:05:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365113395977-153</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am from Chicago.

Per Yahoo Finance - Profile section: Paul Jacobs exercised about 400-500k shares over the past year ($23 million, I am using a rough range of about $45 to $60 for the share price for the $23 million value). He currently holds 27,839 shares, indicating that he has sold or otherwise disposed off of roughly 375,000 to 475,000 shares over the past year. Irwin Jacobs holds just 16,874 shares.

Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GSM, GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA, WLAN, Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) and other technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and might not be as successful in generating licensing income as our CDMA licensing program. Many wireless operators are investigating or have selected LTE (or to a lesser extent WiMAX) as their next-generation 4G technologies for deployment in existing or future wireless spectrum bands as complementary to their existing CDMA-based networks. While multimode 3G/4G products are generally covered by existing 3G licensing agreements, products that implement 4G and do not implement 3G are generally not covered by existing 3G licensing agreements. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the LTE and WiMAX industry standards and have granted royalty-bearing licenses to more than 30 companies (including LG, Nokia and Samsung) to make and sell products implementing 4G standards but not implementing 3G standards, the royalty rates for single mode 4G products are generally lower than our royalty rates for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products, and therefore, we might not achieve the same licensing revenues on such LTE or WiMAX products as on 3G-based or multimode 3G/4G-based products. In addition, new connectivity services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in gaming and the connected home. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature may impact our ability to obtain royalties that are equivalent to those that we receive for 3G products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, the royalties we receive may be lower</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365127966836</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 22:12:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365128059365-173</Id><Topic><Title>intel/apple deal</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365088830276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:20:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It could be possible they will sign with both tsmc and Intel.

In an early benchmark test an Intel based Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 gave the Samsung Galaxy S4 a good kicking. The IdeaPhone has a dual-core Intel Atom Clover Trail+ processor. Unfortunately the benchmark did not indicate if the S4 used Samsung's Exynos 5 Octa chipset or a variant bearing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 quad-core CPU. GSM Arena, which carried out the test, said that the Lenovo K900 reveals that the smartphone is a touch ahead of Samsung Galaxy S4 and the K900 is one of the fastest smartphone in the current market. The Galaxy S4 was the fastest Android phone yet, so Intel knocking it off the top spot would be significant. Intel as it is using a dual-core CPU design to combat ARM's quad-core designs. The dual-core Intel Atom CPU inside the IdeaPhone K900 is clocked at 2 GHz.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365132684685</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:31:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365133689096-193</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is a buy</Title><Username>thadsilverfox</Username><Timestamp>1365121710322</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as the dividend grows every year from here and until I retire the stock price is meaningless to me.
