Many people stay locked into Apple because they have too much money invested in music, movies, TV shows and apps. Apple is the benevolent dictator. They don't think in terms of having the best hardware because they want to be the best. They truly believe they are the best and whatever hardware the select customers will learn to appreciate. I would love to see Apple switch to Intel. It would take brass ones to do this. Tim Cook doesn't have them. He has to be concerned what the board of directors think. Steve Jobs didn't care what they thought. He was a true wild card. Apple will come to Intel at some point. I just don't see it in the near future. There will be four major platforms in the future, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. In order to take share from each other they will have to be more aggressive. The ones most likely to upset the Apple cart is Google and Amazon. Microsoft is too slow of a learner. I believe Intel will ultimately be the game changer in the market. They will have the best hardware by the time the iPhone6 comes along. Apple has already seen a slow down in phone sales. Right now it makes perfect sense for Apple to be in the processor design business. It gives them a leg up. But as of now it also gives them heartburn and headaches by dealing with Samsung. Sooner or later they'll get wise.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1343969508000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 00:51:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343969715000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to make Apple chips?</Title><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1343831431000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:30:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Apple will come to Intel at some point.

Neither can anyone be unaware of the logic behind such accusations. Yet still, Scott Rasmussen’s apparently tireless work for the RNC continues to do its damage through the media who fail to understand how insidious manipulated polls can be. Here’s a couple examples of Rasmussen polling’s evident blindness to reality. ● In the final weeks of the 2010 governor’s race in California, Rasmussen’s results suggested, using more polling “data” than anyone else, that the race was a toss-up. Right up to until Election Day, Rasmussen flooded the media with the view that Meg Whitman was going to pull off one of the greatest upsets in US voting history. So what actually happened when voters went to the polls? Whitman lost to Jerry Brown by 13 points. This is despite the $140,000,000 of her own money she used to lather the airwaves with advertising. This was not a “close race” or “tossup”—it was a slaughter. ● Rasmussen also had an apparently out-of-thin-air rosy view of Sharron Angle’s Senate candidacy the same year in Nevada. If he had set out to stir the chattering classes to accept the possibility of Harry Reid’s defeat, he sure got that to happen. Press organs from coast to coast were all eager to participate in the “scoop” of Harry Reid, the Majority Leader of the US Senate, losing his seat. Yet once again, Rasmussen’s polling proved to be entirely off the rails. Reid beat Angle 51% to 44%. Not even close. So how is it that Rasmussen, with his dismal track record, continues to make such a stir in the media?</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1344003494000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:18:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344003503000-20</Id><Title>Shorts on Fire</Title><Msg>I love the smell of napalm in the morning...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344003503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344003588000-21</Id><Topic><Title>WAHHH WAHHH WAHHH</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1344002923000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:08:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah suire he will.

Sep 27 or even aug 26 (riskier but cheaper and better delta) are a good idea. A very speculative crazy idea is aug 25s that will triple if we drop even to 25.5! But it expires likely to 0. In any case be smart and take profits here or buy puts or both.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1344007617000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 11:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344007845000-35</Id><Topic><Title>New Highs?&gt;</Title><Username>ashleydove4533</Username><Timestamp>1344002461000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Post of the day!

That would make a good movie and an investigation might expose how Wall Street firms operate in reality. Would be funny if one day hackers managed to produce a 10+% market crash in a matter of hours by making coordinated isolated pseudo trades that then trigger other programs they have also infiltrated in other firms to act in (manipulated not proper changed by virus) response creating massive panic until people figure out what is happening. This is a major system risk in my opinion that they need to eliminate. That in itself can send the economy in a dive over nothing. Makes for great modern day terrorism too.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1344010019000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 12:06:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344011116000-39</Id><Title>Ultrabook takes AMD over 30 before November.</Title><Msg>Rushfatbaugh crying because he hates good news.

Investigators executing the searches, which took place November 25 at offices used by Limbaugh's South Florida physicians, accused the radio personality of "doctor shopping," or improperly seeking out practitioners to supply him with an inordinate abundance of painkillers OxyContin, Lorcet, Norco, Hydrocodone, and Kadian, the anti-anxiety drug Xanax, the cholesterol-lowering drug Niacin, and Clonodine, which treats high blood pressure. Under Florida law, doctor shopping is punishable by up to five years in prison. The affidavits, one of which you'll find here, indicate that authorities began investigating the talk-show host last December after meeting with Wilma Cline, Limbaugh's former maid, and her husband, who told them that they sold Limbaugh "large quantities" of pharmaceutical drugs "over the course of many years."
