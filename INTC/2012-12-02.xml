Then there was the "break-down" a month and a half back when AAPL said no more INTC chips in their products. Then O "stepped down." Now we are seeing "negotiations". These events are correlated. It's not hard to figure it out. O's politics were not acceptable to AAPL and they had to back-peddle from INTC. There's probably not a single AAPL employee with a measurable IQ who supported Romney (in fact, that is a generally true statement of most people, but most at AAPL have high IQ's). AAPL was offended by O's statements...at very least, for not keeping it to oneself. The INTC board saw a great oppty slipping away. So, out goes O, and we're back in serious "negotiations." In the meantime there is a strong correlation between the politics and intellect displayed on this board. You need only unignore att4glte occasionally to see how drool and republicanism are the same thing. Let the republicans scream and rant all they want. They lost, and of course, they are very bad sports. They are very bad losers...well, hey they are simply losers, period.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1354447645682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 06:27:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354450694954-6</Id><Topic><Title>My insight:</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1354447645682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 06:27:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is not the republicans who lost, but the American people.

Nobody thought INTC should trade below 20 ever again, at least nobody with a brain. I do not post about every trade, but I too was buying all the way down, since the drop defied logic and reason. Who's the bigger idiot, you are the one who thinks ARMH is going to stay up forever with it's 70x P/E ratio. By comparison, INTC would have to trade above 150 to have such a sky high valuation, and has been growing earnings at about the same rate as your beloved ARM.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1354451822077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 07:37:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354452369654-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's systemic problems</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354374845764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 10:14:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a systemic problem that you cant just root out which short term fixes. It needs a longer term approach to resurrecting the company which includes paying better for the better engineers, something Intel hasn't culturally been wont to doing. They've traditionally taken the stand that their corporate image is so good that they'll automatically attract the best engineers. Unfortunately, that has changed over time. Their lack of R&amp;D ROI is a symptom of this underlying problem. Also, their lack of being able to deliver on commitment. They make the right speeches, get their ducks lined up the right way, but the forward momentum is just not there.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354452369654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 07:46:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354453148328-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's systemic problems</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354374845764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 10:14:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you sound like a disgruntled ex-employee.</Msg><Username>gordon939</Username><Timestamp>1354453148328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 07:59:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354453835595-10</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo Laptop - "think pad"</Title><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1354245823705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 22:23:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great job Mom.

He didn't sound too down (he's been something of a sad sack the last couple of earnings conferences) so I think the quarter is progressing about as they thought. At about 49 minutes in he's asked about doing foundry work for Apple. (This is a couple days before the latest rumor broke.) He's a little vague, as to be expected, but I took his answer to be essentially "no." He said something about being hopeful of getting Apple's business, but X86 chips "are job one," implying that they'd like the business by convincing Apple to convert because of Intel's superior technology.

With products like the samsung ativ smart pc 500t and Acer iconia w510, hard to differentiate. If windows tablets can run full windows, there is a major competitive advantage over iPads which only run iOS. If Apple wants to respond with a tablet running full MacOS, should it run on ARM or INTEL? I posted earlier that a lot of Mac users install Windows on their Macbook using bootcamp or some emulator program (parallels) so if Apple wants to keep that trend going they need to have to convert to tablets running Intel. By switching, there is also the advantage that they do not have to convert their MacOS to run on ARM. As well, all there won't be any compatibility issues for all current SW running on MacOS ala Windows RT. Finally, the Intel's chip is just heads and shoulders above ARM in terms of performance (power effiency matching soon with Broadwell). BTW, check out the patent Apple has at the below link.

Sascha Segan By Sascha Segan September 15, 2012 11:30am EST iPhone 4 vs. iPhone 4S vs. iPhone 5 Apple couldn't engineer itself out of the global LTE mess, but maybe Intel can. The new iPhone 5 features 4G LTE, which is going to dramatically improve Internet speeds for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone owners. (Sprint subscribers are left waiting for LTE to arrive where they live.) But globally, the iPhone LTE picture is a disaster. There are two different iPhone models. The AT&amp;T iPhone will work on LTE on T-Mobile USA and in Canada, but not in the rest of the world. The Verizon/Sprint iPhone will work in some European and Asian countries. No iPhone will work on the existing LTE networks in Austria, Brazil, Columbia, Denmark, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland, as iMore points out. The phones will still roam where they can't get LTE; they'll be on 3G, which isn't fatal, but it's a night-and-day difference in terms of speeds. The incompatibility is because there are way too many frequency bands being used for mobile phone networks right now. Apple's a popularizer and refiner of technologies; they're not introducing any radical new RF breakthroughs here, so they're stuck in the same LTE band whirlwind that everyone else is. Between Apple's two models, it's already supporting seven different LTE bands, known as band 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 17 and 25. But European operators have three more bands they use: 7, 20 and 38. They may also use band 8 in the future. Some Asian operators appear to be on Band 40. Here at home, Sprint also plans to use band 26, and some smaller US carriers have band 12. It's a mess. It means phone makers have to put together lots of different models for different countries, and those units will have trouble roaming well in other countries if they travel. It also means small carriers on obscure LTE bands, like 12, have trouble getting phones that work well with their networks because there are no huge carriers placing large orders for them. Can Intel Fix Apple's Problems? Fortunately, across the street from the iPhone event, I saw a potential solution. Intel's Developer Forum was going on just across the street from Apple this week. Up on the second floor, the company was showing off the four relatively lackluster Intel phones so far, as well as a modem technology that could really change things. Intel's XMM6260 modem, which has been in the market for a while, uses a single power amplifier for multiple bands, and it can be extended in software to support as many bands as necessary. It doesn't support LTE or CDMA, which is part of why we haven't seen it in many U.S. products. But the point here, an Intel engineer told me, is that the company will be able to put an unlimited number of bands on a single LTE modem, possibly as soon as late next year. Intel's modems will be able to mate with processors from Samsung, Nvidia, TI, and others. Apple used its modems up until 2010, when it switched over to Qualcomm in part to get Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Modems are only half of the solution, though. Dermot O'Shea, co-founder of antenna firm Taoglas, said antenna design gets difficult when you're covering such a wide range of frequencies. Active antennas for smartphones, which have just started to hit the market this year, can adapt to different bands without being huge, although they add to the cost and complexity of smartphones. We're likely to see more of them next year. Between active antennas and multi-frequency power amplifiers, it looks like phone makers are starting to get their hands around the riot of LTE frequencies; they're just not there yet. Maybe we'll see them in the iPhone 7.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1354474282313</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 13:51:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354474287909-51</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith presentation</Title><Username>dundarra</Username><Timestamp>1354457102852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 09:05:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You could be right.

What I am not sure about is what should be a strategy for supporting all existing ARM based applications. Obviously, not supporting existing apps is not an option - no one will upgrade to a new iPad if it's incompatible with all existing Apps. Then what? and before anyone gives an example of Android port which supports most existing applications, 80% of Android apps run under Java VM and could care less about underlying instruction set. With iOs applications are compiled to a native arm instruction set and Intel would have to emulate ARM to support them. Question is how much performance/power hit would this take?

A MacPad is possible using Haswell in 2013 but that would require a touch-based Mac operating system. Then the 2013 Mac touch OS could go on the 2014 Bay Trail iPad. Also, does Apple support both a Mac touch OS and a Mac regular OS and do something more than Microsoft ? And then, the iPhone keeps the iOS and so that's three operating systems. Then since that's three different operating systems, the iPad actually keeps the ARM processor but a MacPad with a Haswell processor is added.

" The author then replied: "Yep, I'm well aware that iOS and OS X have basically the same kernel. Are you saying that iOS developers, when they test their apps, are building x86 executables? If so, that's pretty cool." Remember ios apps are in a closed enviroment. They all have to be verified by Apple and are all on Apple's app store. It would be easy to convert all apps to run on x86.

While competition from Samsung and Qualcomm are pushing out with limited supplies of 32/28nm chips, Intel has already announced that it will be shrinking its ultra-low-power Atom chips to 22nm in 2013 and 14nm in 2014. Say what you like about ARM chips being inherently more efficient, but the shift to 22nm and 14nm will mean that Intel’s ULV chips simply cannot be beaten. ARM can innovate until its blue in the face, but at the end of the day it will be impossible to compete with Intel’s far superior manufacturing process — and heck, on top of all that, it’s not like Intel doesn’t know how to make a good CPU. In short, ARM &amp; Co. are in a very unenviable position. Intel now has a beachhead and its terrifying, industry-clobbering, 60%-gross-margin wehrmacht will surely follow. You might only see a few Medfield-powered scouts in 2012, but by the time the 22nm Silvermont tanks roll around in 2013 and x86 is better than ARM across the board, expect to see dozens of Santa Clara design wins. Unless TSMC, IBM, GloFo, or Samsung uncover some kind of ancient scroll that details the magic of 14nm, come 2014 and the Airmont core, I wouldn’t be surprised if Intel completely dominates the Android smartphone market. Following the Motorola partnership, I would also be very surprised if Microsoft and Apple aren’t working on x86 versions of their mobile operating systems, too.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354480375773</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 15:32:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354480400829-64</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo Laptop - "think pad"</Title><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1354245823705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 22:23:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.

This is possible because ARM is a RISC based architecture, which by definition has a reduced instruction set. X86 is complex instruction set, so it is able to do much more in a single clock cycle by comparison. The reverse is true if trying to emulate x86 on ARM, the CPU may need to use multiple clock cycles to perform the same instructions. There is no reason why binary translation shouldn't work for iOS, and if things progress as expected for Atom at 14nm and beyond, the iOS applications will likely end up running MUCH better on x86 even though compiled for ARM.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1354484502401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:41:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354484692452-73</Id><Title>Stacy Smith for CEO?</Title><Msg>If not Pat Gelsinger or Andy Bryant (but he is a little old) then I like Stacy Smith.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354484692452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:44:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354484843312-74</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith for CEO?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354484692452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:44:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dadi Perlmutter would be my first choice.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1354484843312</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:47:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354484887712-75</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith for CEO?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354484692452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:44:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's been my preference from day 1.

Also, an article by Andrew Bary. How to Play the Economic Recovery By ANDREW BARY Ross Margolies says the recovery in auto sales and the housing rebound bode well for the U.S. Why he likes Celanese, Hormel, Intel and JPMorgan. "Margolies spoke with Barron's recently at his Manhattan offices, weighing in on the shale energy revolution and why he is bullish on the U.S. economy and stock market. His current favorites include Hormel Foods; Celanese; Seagate Technology; JPMorgan Chase; AerCap Holdings, an aircraft-leasing firm; and out-of-favor Intel . What do you see in Intel that the market doesn't? The stock is around $19.50 now, and it trades for 10 to 11 times next year's earnings. The consensus for 2013 is around $2 a share, but we are assuming projections come down to between $1.75 and $1.85 because the PC market is very tough. It has a dividend yield of more than 4%. We know that Intel [INTC] is cutting back production, and that process takes about six months, and is detrimental to margins while it's happening. How bad is the situation? The core PC-chip business is weak. Intel has low penetration in the mobile market, and, to top it off, CEO Paul Otellini announced that he is going to retire in six months. So why are we buying it instead of selling it? The answer is that Intel has transformed its business dramatically over the past five years from a manufacturing standpoint and taken out a lot of costs. Technology companies historically have not been disciplined manufacturers. Intel also has a technology lead over other semiconductor makers. What's the key there? Intel has developed a new three-dimensional chip design called Tri-Gate that allows Intel to develop chips with either more processing power or better battery life. The reason Intel missed the mobile market is that it was always focused on speed, not battery life. As the world went mobile, battery life became more important. Intel has addressed that now. In addition, Intel is the dominant company in making chips for servers, which are very profitable. So you think Intel will crack the mobile market? Intel should pick up share in the mobile markets where it has none. People are concerned about Intel losing share in PCs, despite the fact that its main competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, is pulling back. Intel should pick up meaningful market share in phones and tablets over time, and if that happens, it should offset what occurs in PCs. Do you think the dividend is safe? It's very safe. If anything, Intel is going to keep on raising it, although probably not in the next few months. Intel spends an enormous amount each year on capital expenditures. It could easily cut back on a few billion dollars worth of capex, and generate a lot of extra free cash. Intel controls its own fate. As long as Intel keeps its technology lead, it's going to be hard for anyone to keep up.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354484903086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:48:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354484916837-77</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith for CEO?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354484692452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:44:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mark Bohr would be my 2nd...</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1354484916837</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:48:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354484929394-78</Id><Title>Google "Conservatism is Calling" and watch the video for Obama's debt LIES</Title><Msg>do it!!!!</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1354484929394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:48:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354484956336-79</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Barrons (Dec. 3 issue) says BUY INTC!

Not only are they becoming vital parts of our everyday lives in the English-speaking western world, but also in developing nations around the globe. It’s clear that dumbphones are on the way out, and our current smartphones will look like dunces in the next decade. Intel has been working hard on an impressive 48-core mobile processor for a few years now, and it’s looking like it could be ready for prime time in a mere five-to-ten years — and inside of our mobile devices, not just servers. Computerworld has a fantastic story with direct quotes from Intel upper management and the actual research scientists working on making small and power efficient parallel computing a reality. Justin Rattner, Intel’s CTO, says “It’s just not practical to just take sound and pictures and send it up to the cloud and expect that some server is going to perform those tasks. So a lot of that will be pushed out to the client devices.” That really stands out as an ambitious goal that is worthy of consideration. Siri Immediately, services like Siri and mobile speech-to-text come to mind. Right now, every command you give to Siri involves a lot of interaction with Apple’s servers. Your voice command is sent via the network, processed by Apple’s servers, and returned to your device as text. Then, the servers grind and grind in hopes of understanding what you meant. If all of the planets are aligned properly, your command is executed a few seconds later. Sometimes, for whatever reason, Siri just spins and spins until it times out. If your iPhone had a true large-scale parallel processor, instead of few measly cores between the CPU and GPU, all of this could be done locally on your device. It wouldn’t even matter if you had cell service or not. Most impressively, these chips being developed are very power efficient. Back in 2009, Intel claimed that the processor uses about the same amount of power as two lightbulbs. In 2010, it was made public that the cores were clocked between 1.66GHz and 1.83Ghz, and are roughly on par with Atom-class chips. The individual cores themselves don’t have to be super computers, but the technology that allows them to work together in concert is what has massive potential. Sadly, Intel hasn’t given us a name or a specific architecture, but it would be fairly safe to assume that we’re talking about a mobile variant of the Xeon Phi/Knights Corner MIC. Encoding massive videos, always-on augmented reality, and large-scale multitasking are just some of the benefits we’ll see from technology like this 48-core parallel processor. Not only will our phones be able to power our traditional computing needs, but also tasks we’re not even dreaming about yet. In combination with an increased number of sensors and receivers in your device and the world around you, your phone could be controlling your HVAC, automatic shifting in your car, and creating a realistic 3D replica of your current environment all while you’re looking at cat pictures or composing an email. A decade is a long way away, and this is all still very much in development.

Since 2010, Intel's revenue has grown by $10 Billion. So even with the so called weakness in PC growth in percentage terms, Intel's actual dollar growth has grown more than Qualcomm. Yet analysts justify the higher market cap for Qualcomm by saying that future growth expectations are higher for QCOM. Let's see how that plays out while Intel is breaking into Qualcomm's market share of smartphones and tablets.

Intel plans to shift production to 450 mm silicon wafers — the size of a small coffee table. That's about 40% more chips per wafer at a fraction of additional production costs. With the massive silicon wafers, and the move to smaller geometries below 22 nm, which squeezes more chips into the same area, Intel's new fabs will be able to make mind blowing numbers of chips. But before Intel spends $7 billion plus on 450 mm fabs it has to ensure that it will have mind blowing demand for its chips. It needs high demand because it has operate its fabs at near full volume and 95% plus yield rate. If Intel were making hundreds of millions of low cost Atom chips, replacing all those ARM chips, it would have the volumes it needs to keep its fabs running smoothly. That means it has the means to manufacture all of its highly profitable server and desktop microprocessors, at the lowest possible production costs. There's another very important element in this story: a high volume chip like Atom is essential in helping to quickly ramp up production of all of its chips. High volume products qualify chip production machinery and fine-tune hundreds of complex chip processes. They are essential to Intel being able to maintain high levels of usable chips per wafer. This is why ARM markets are important to Intel and why it must defeat it with Atom, or something similar -- it needs the numbers. Not because it needs the microscopic revenues that feed ARM. Intel needs those markets for the sheer volume of chips that device makers such as Apple and others buy, so that its hugely expensive future 450 mm fabs will be viable producing its high profit chips.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1354491939151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:45:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354492073005-89</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL WILL BE SINGLE DIGIT STOCK IN 2013:THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM FOR INTEL NEXT $30 SoC or $250 CPU?</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348796337780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:38:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>15 billion arms licensed to date 98% of cellphones since 2005 have had arms in them. all ipods, ipads, nintendo ds and gba, most routers and other hardware. once, people did buy 8051 series, now they use arm instead. intel now only have pc and pc server markets. pcs are starting to dwindle due to the rise of tablets, servers will also fall as power becomes more expensive.

Now, a full suite of Ubuntu benchmarks show the chip as a credible threat to Intel and AMD’s low-power x86 processors in the tablet and netbook space. Nvidia’s Tegra 3 was similarly abused, though Tegra 4′s imminent ramp should help diffuse the situation. Phoronix tested the Exynos 5250 against Nvidia’s quad-core Tegra 3, three Intel Atom’s (the N270, Z530, and dual-core D525), and a Core i3-330M with a 35W TDP. The Exynos 5250 smokes Tegra 3 and the two single-core Atom processors, racking up wins by margins of up to 50%. The dual-core, Hyper-Threaded D525 is better competition for the Cortex-A15, but the ARM chip still won more tests than it lost to that particular Intel CPU. The Core i3-330M, on the other hand, crushed the Cortex-A15 in every single metric. While the article points out that the i3′s TDP is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the Exynos 5250′s, it failed to acknowledge that Intel has made substantial strides in this department. The i3-330M was launched in early 2010 as a 2.13GHz chip with 3MB of L3, no Turbo Mode, and no AVX support. The best current, non-embedded match would be the Core i7-3667U (2GHz base, 3.2GHz Turbo, 4MB L3, 17W TDP) or the embedded i7-3517UE (1.7GHz base, 2.8GHz Turbo, 4MB L3, 17W TDP). The point here isn’t to diminish the Cortex-A15′s accomplishments, but to put its performance in the proper context. The TDP and performance-per-watt gap between Intel’s Core products and the current low-power Atom, Brazos, and ARM families have shrunk dramatically in just two years. They’ll shrink further in 2013, when Intel launches 10W Haswell hardware. The Cortex-A15 is unlikely to challenge Intel’s absolute performance lead, but it could form a potent bulwark against Clover Trail. The D525 is a decent stand-in for the Z2760′s performance, if not its thermals. I suspect that AMD’s Brazos would have put up a better showing — it’s typically 15-25% faster than Atom — but Brazos is a bit long in the tooth compared to either chip. As for Tegra 3, these benchmarks stress just how badly Nvidia’s product line needs a refresh. Of the three companies we’ve mentioned, AMD is easily the most vulnerable to a strong Cortex-A15. Intel has low-power SKUs, high average selling prices (ASPs), and substantial momentum to draw on. Nvidia’s Tegra 4 is already in the pipe. AMD’s Brazos is aging and its replacement is still half a year or more away. If Kabini slips later in 2013, it could end up squeezed between the Cortex-A15 at the low end, and Intel’s 22nm Valleyview Atom (the first out-of-order Atom architecture) at the top. The next 12 months will determine whether Windows RT will seize a significant percentage of the x86 notebook market or if these devices remain on the periphery. Based on these performance figures, I suspect Cortex-A15 designs will be the first real competitors for x86 tablet and netbook form factors. Tegra 3 may have served as a launch vehicle for the Surface RT, but the dual-core Exynos is dramatically faster than Nvidia’s quad-core design. Windows RT and Android tablet manufacturers aren’t going to ignore that.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1354493577747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 19:12:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354493686696-96</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcom/Samsung/Apple/Nvidia and Chinese Co's will never abandon ARMH and INtel has to wrestle against these Gorillas</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1354492467822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:54:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung is integrating the new ARM Mali 604 graphics into the Exynos 5 to provide the high-resolution support for these activities, which also add support for DirectX 11, indicating that this chip could be used for Windows 8 computers.

Samsung Electronics Comp., Ltd.

The new 64 GB NAND Flash storage chips, which are built on the eMMC 4.5 standard, which Samsung basically wrote itself, offer random writes of 2,000 IOPS (input-output operations per second), random reads of 5,000 IOPS, sequential reads at 260 MB/s, and sequential write speeds of 50 MB/s. Those stats are about 30 percent up from the first-generation eMMC 4.5 devices (mature 20 nm product), which Samsung delivered five months ago. More good news for Samsung is that it was able to repurpose its 20 nm lines to produce the 10 nm-class chips.

It’s a pricey bauble at $899 plus an extra hundred for the Touch Cover. But everyone is excited. This is the model most of the Surface sympathizers are waiting for. It has the full Windows 8 experience, a capable Intel chipset, and an ecosystem two decades in the making. But here’s the problem: come January the Surface Pro could have serious competition from Asus, Samsung, Lenovo and maybe even HP. In short, what happens when the big guys finally catch up to Microsoft? As of this writing, pickings for a Windows 8 tablet are pretty slim. To the rabid Microsoft fan, the Surface Pro looks like the second coming. It’s the tablet that will save them from the horrid iPad. But fear not, friend.

Any reading above 50 indicates that factory conditions are improving in the manufacturing sector. Another measure of manufacturing activity released Monday, HSBC's initial purchasing manager's index, also indicated improvement in the sector. At 50.5, the index is at its highest level in 13 months.
