[Have you hear of FinFET (3D Tri-Gate transistors)? If not maybe you should read up and stop offering opinions until you do a little basic research. Intel spent 10 years developing FinFET and refining the manufacturing processes. Intel has it. ARM doesn't. Of course, ARM is probably working on it. But they are no where close to having the technology much less the manufacturing prowess to build processors at 14nm. ARM is also struggling with other parts of the process and may need to move to EUV at the same time. This is likely to cause additional significant delays. The consensus in the industry seems to about a three year lead for Intel in process technology. But ARM's capabilities in this area are so ill-defined that there is no clear path to 14nm for them at this time. Heck, we don't even know when ARM 20nm will see volume production. Here's a quote for you from Extreme Tech: "In short, with its 22nm Ivy Bridge parts, it now looks like Intel might have extended its technology lead to almost three years. It will be 2014 at the earliest before TSMC debuts its 20nm process, and I would be surprised if it’s not 2015 before we see real, mass-market production. It’s too early to say, but Intel’s roadmap says it will be at 10nm by 2015 — two full process nodes ahead of TSMC, GloFo, and Samsung."] "ARM doesn't have market share now, but its only a matter of time. Fading fabrication? Why is it fading?" [See answer above...] "Manufacturing probably won't play a role in this." [Hahahahahahahaha. You wish...] "Trends suggest Intel's process lead will shrink." [No they don't. Intel's process lead was three years and growing the last time anyone checked. The ARM world is having more and more problems ramping each new chip cycle as the die size shrinks. Witness TSMC's world of problems with 28nm. In stark contrast, Intel ramped 22nm smoothly, quickly and efficiently. This is all well-documented.

Send the letter... Letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission Dear Sir or Madam: It is with growing concern that I have watched trends within the stock markets move towards perpetuation of an environment in which the larger firms and corporations are enabled to use money, leverage, technology (as in high-speed trading, and access to media in order to disenfranchise or even defraud those without the same level of resources. This manipulation appears to manifest itself in two primary ways. One is what appears to be the use of a cooperative strategy by Wall Street’s largest firms to use a combination of analyst’s reports, reports to the media, timed upgrades/downgrades, and buy/sell strategies by their own trading desks in order to channel the direction of the stock price and to then unethically and perhaps illegally profit from this combination of methodologies. The other is a similar strategy by hedge funds. Hedge funds under current regulations provide little or no visibility of their trading patterns, strategies or activities, essentially allowing them free rein to manipulate stock prices in ways not compatible with the normal trends produced by supply and demand. Both of these situations work to the detriment of the average investor. They tend to drive the smaller or average investor completely out of the stock markets with the conclusion that the “market is rigged”. In fact this certainly appears to be the case in an unfortunate number of circumstances. Let us consider the case of Intel. Intel has been locked in a trading range for years. Even when they recorded five years of 27 percent annual growth, the P/E ratio was continuously and significantly below that of the average S&amp;P 500 company while they performance was hugely better. Every time Intel threatened to move to a higher level, Wall Street’s largest firms would apparently band together with a barrage of downgrades and negative media comments. The result was a continuous valuation under what any reasonable analysis would support as being fair. Whether these firms traded against Intel in addition needs to be determined. I therefore ask for consideration of the following: 1.) An investigation of the manner in which Wall Street’s largest firms internally trade, correlated against analyst recommendations, upgrade/downgrade releases, and reports to the media. 2.) An investigation of the manner of trading across Wall Street’s largest firms to determine if there is any pattern of cooperation or collusion in regards to particular stocks. 3.) The development of new regulations resulting in greater transparency of hedge fund trading in order to determine if they are using money and leverage to manipulate the market and stock prices in a manner inconsistent with stock market fairness and stability. 4.) An investigation of large Wall Street firm and hedge fund trading of Intel Corporation to determine if they are engaged in activities which unfairly or illegally deny Intel a fair valuation. 5.) An investigation into naked shorting of Intel. Thank you for your time and efforts in helping to establish a market environment free of fraud, manipulation and methodologies which disenfranchise smaller investors.

Rumors have been very interesting. What we know now: 1.) Intel has recognized that mobility is the major growth area and has total re-organized priorities to address this. They have changed the timetables for all mobile strategies and moved them to the top. 2.) Intel will pass ARM in power efficiency in 2013. 3.) The companies that went with Intel early on in smartphones and mobility will look like geniuses by the end of 2013. This early adoption is going to put them in the catbird seat for superior performance and power consumption efficiency that ARM will not be able to match. 4.) ARMs fabrication is substantially inferior. Two to three years til 20nm volume production. And then after that - nothing. They are looking at at least 4 years to develop 14nm. This will give Intel three years of having their way with the market with their 14nm production. 5.) In four years Intel will be doing volume production on 10nm and getting 7nm ready. No company that has to be on or even near the cutting edge of technology will be able to rely on ARMs fading fabrication. 6.) The ARM roadmap after 20nm is a looming void. They will likely have to do EUV and maybe even 450mm at the same time. It took TSCM a year to get 28nm yields just up to an acceptable level. Intel ramped 22nm smoothly and rapidly and will do the same with 14nm. They are already producing product. Expect all these things to prevent TSMC from reaching volume production on 14nm for years. It's so far out in the future with so many massively complex issues for them to solve that it's impossible to predict when it might happen. When it does, Intel will be at least 2 product cycles ahead. Intel is going to own mobility and that's because of its advanced fabrication and manufacturing. 7.) Otellini has commented on Intel coming in to a "golden age". He’s talking about Intel’s significant technology edge. He knows ARM can't keep up with Intel's fabrication cycles and that will determine how mobility will play out. 8.) It's not about talking smack as ARM CEO Warren East is fond of doing. He can talk all he wants. It won't do a thing to diminish Intel's rapidly growing advantage in fabrication. Intel's efforts have gone exactly where they needed to go. Years of preparation are coming to fruition. 9.) Intel will have huge 22nm capacity and then huge 14nm capacity. Why would anyone want 28nm ARM processors, given a choice? As it becomes more and more obvious that Intel will stay on the cutting edge as ARMs fabrication fades, there will be much more of an incentive to switch. We are in the midst of that change where it is becoming obvious. 14nm will be available in a year. That means discussions and planning are taking place right now for those who want to be on the cutting edge and then on a direct path to 14, then to 10, then to 7 and then to 5nm. 10.) It's possible that Intel will soon be the only major IDM (integrated device manufacturer) left in the world. As processors become more complex this is more and more important. The ARM fabless model is essentially broken because it doesn't have the tight integration of design and manufacturing that is required to have a successful experience with today's state-of-the-art processors and fabrication. 12.) Let us not forget the economics. Each new processor cycle brings improved economics. This is why Intel keeps telling us it is necessary for them to continue the every eight quarter pace. Those that can't keep up (the entire ARM world) will have lesser economics, worse margins and problems with cash flow. 13.) Anyone who understands the fabrication space knows the miss was totally overblown. There shouldn't have been any reduction in stock price because the big Wall Street firms and hedge funds have Intel trapped in a trading range that has kept the P/E fifty percent below where it should be. That has to end. A fair valuation even with the revenue reduction should be in the 35 to 40 range.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347889115068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:38:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347889410291-16</Id><Title>Tame Apple Press starts to spin the iPhone 5</Title><Msg>[The same sentiment could be applied to the tame Wall Street press who wholeheartedly participate in the relentless attacks on Intel...] Don't trust anything you read The Tame Apple Press appears to be pulling out all stops to encourage readers to waste their money on the lack-lustre iPhone5. Reuters this morning was dominated by stories which claimed the iPhone5 was going to be a sell out and was peppered with comments that there was going to be a frenzy. The fact that the iPhone 5 has comparatively poor reviews and most of its functionality does not work in Europe has not stopped the spinning. The other technique is product placement. This morning if you read Business Insider, you would have seen a headline which claimed that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer just sent an email to all of Yahoo's full time and part time employees in the US promsing them an iPhone. Mayer is a super hottie and widely expected to sort out Yahoo so having her give all her staff an iPhone should assure all fanboys that the iPhone 5 is on everyone's hot list. The only problem was that the story did not say that. In fact Mayer letting her staff have any smartphone they like including Samsung,Nokia, or HTC smartphone. In fact the real story here is that the only phone that Mayer is not buying for her staff is anything from RIM. Yahoo is also going to discontinue IT support for Blackberry phones. Through the program, Yahoo employees will have a choice of phones: iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC One X, HTC EVO 4G LTE, or Nokia Lumia 920. The point is that until the iPhone 5 is on the streets you should only trust Fudzilla as other magazines are taking upon themselves the task of sacrificing their credibility to hawk iPhone 5s. Unlike Business Insider, we will fire any hack who perverts a news story to make the new iPhone 5 look like it is important.

The author is selecting an extreme interpretation of a Perlmutter interview statement. It appears that most (all?) of these articles can be traced back to statements from Dadi Perlmutter during an interview at IDF. He said Linux cannot handle Clovertrail optimizations PROPERLY. "Linux doesn't yet know how to cope with all of Clover Trail's power state changes at the kernel level, which would put any penguin-powered PC at a disadvantage." Intel is "OS agnostic". Intel wants all the OS to run on their systems. Intel DOES however want to show Clovertrail in its best light so they want to support OS with that capability more heavily. I think that Dadi was saying that there was going to be some features in Clovertrail that Linux would handle inefficiently YET. This seems to be a case where a statement: "LINUX does not have the code to manage the power features of the new chip." Morphed into "spin" versions of the statement where the reporters extrapolated in the direction they thought gave them the best story. Intel is "terrified of everyone". ANDY GROVE: "Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive." FROM DADI PERLMUTTER INTERVIEW AT IDF: "Intel reportedly claimed at IDF that Clover Trail-based Atom processors "cannot" handle Linux properly. As outlined in The Inquirer's account of events, the issue is more a matter of optimization than an outright block: Linux doesn't yet know how to cope with all of Clover Trail's power state changes at the kernel level, which would put any penguin-powered PC at a disadvantage. Intel would really, really prefer that you run Windows 8, as the new Atom and Microsoft's OS are tuned to work hand-in-hand.

AMAT also warned early. Obviously Intel's earnings are not growing at the fantastic pace we were seeing just 6 to 12 months ago, clearly the growth rate is dramatically slowing. This quarter's earnings could definitely be a huge miss even with the lowered guidance and the warning. Obliviously Intel doesn't have the ability to forecast their own earnings accurately. That's not good, it means conditions are changing rapidly to the negative. Semis generally lead the way, obviously that's not happening now, and it's not going to turn around in a few months.

We'll likely see Clover Trail in many of the first Windows 8 tablets, slotted in between the Windows RT devices at the low end and the low-power Ivy Bridge devices at the high end—Lenovo's ThinkPad Tablet 2 is said to use Clover Trail, as are several of the other laptop-like Windows 8 tablets introduced at this year's IFA. According by Intel, Clover Trail should enable these tablets to deliver ten hours of battery life and a month or so of standby time in an 8.5mm thick package that weighs about a pound and a half—comparable, in other words, to current 10" ARM-based tablets.

Unlike the traditional S3 and S4 (sleep and hibernate, respectively) states, a system in this S0ix state is still connected to the Internet, and Windows applications that use background task and push notification APIs can still retrieve data. System resume time is also said to be instantaneous, wasting less power than in the transition between sleep states.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347898455923</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:14:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347898520859-43</Id><Topic><Title>Clover Trail Atoms will give Windows 8 tablets ARM-like battery life</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347898264756</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:11:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another power-saving feature, and one that is standard in basically all mobile devices these days, is hardware accelerated video and audio playback designed to offload these common tasks from the CPU to more power-efficient parts of the SoC. Clover Trail's GPU can decode 1080p MPEG4, H.264, and MPEG2 streams, and its audio offloading engine can be used to play HTML5 audio or audio from applications using the Windows Media Foundation or Windows Audio Session APIs—however, the audio engine is only available to applications from the Windows Store, and not to standard desktop applications. ...... While Clover Trail's power usage technology will be interesting (and will give us some indication of how accurate Intel's lofty power usage numbers for Haswell chips are), the processor itself is going to sport performance that's not much faster than the Atoms that we've been seeing in netbooks for the last few years. Next year's Bay Trail platform—which will introduce quad-core chips, Intel's own in-house GPUs, and a major architectural upgrade to the Atom line—should prove to be a more interesting performer.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1347898520859</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347899200231-44</Id><Title>I am taking INTC down today</Title><Msg>sell now or lose more money</Msg><Username>johnboy2680</Username><Timestamp>1347899200231</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347899472956-45</Id><Topic><Title>Great Info!

It's pretty good that Apple is so proprietary in that extent in that it shields others from very direct merchant chip competition as Android and Windows will always have their followers and thus use non Apple chips.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347907266489</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347907500878-57</Id><Title>Keep Your Eyes On $23.02</Title><Msg>and, as always, keep your eyes on your fries.</Msg><Username>wilder_blitch</Username><Timestamp>1347907500878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347908070156-58</Id><Topic><Title>Keep Your Eyes On $23.02</Title><Username>wilder_blitch</Username><Timestamp>1347907500878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:45:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Splain to 'em about the twenny three oh too Ildur!</Msg><Username>myle_der_blitch</Username><Timestamp>1347908070156</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347908156929-59</Id><Topic><Title>Smartphone Announcement Tomorrow</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347889115068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:38:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A6 is not twice as fast as Medfield at least not in normal integer based applications.

The incentive for Apple is margin. Not that they don't love Intel, but when you can get a CPU/GPU for $20 vs $200, it is very valuable to make your own. Intel doesn't just need to stay ahead, but they need to stay way ahead to keep the margins. That is the risk. Remember, that this is likely on 32nm LP, so they could conceivably run it much higher with increased cores.

Could it happen to ARM? ARM has been riding high on the smartphone boom for the last three years -- and I suspect that growth will continue for a little longer. But think back to the 1990s and the rapid growth of the PC market. Intel shares rose in value by about 20 times during the 1990s -- yet today they trade at much the same level they did in late 1999. My suspicion is that something similar will happen with ARM. At some point, its technology will mature and something else will take its place, leaving ARM to become a more typical large-cap share, delivering profits, dividends and moderate growth. The problem is that this transition could be painful for ARM's shareholders, as it is likely to involve a substantial re-rating of its share price to more normal levels -- perhaps less than 20 times earnings. Intel today trades at a P/E of just 9.9.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1347916526956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:15:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347916614062-74</Id><Topic><Title>Funny Wallstreet: Downgrade @ 52 week low. for Intel ...but Upgrade @$700 for AAPL???</Title><Username>buffet_graham</Username><Timestamp>1347913680930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:28:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are just as stupid-- This is along way from its 52 week low-- Now - when it does reach sub 20 it will certainly be a buy- but we have another 15-17% decline to get there- that is a long way from being at a 52 week low now!</Msg><Username>marrohead</Username><Timestamp>1347916614062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347916792976-75</Id><Topic><Title>Smartphone Announcement Tomorrow</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347889115068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:38:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A6 is not twice as fast as Medfield at least not in normal integer based applications.

The 2GHz number is still turbo boost so performance will be dependent on how long Medfield can maintain that state. As a side, the A6 performance numbers could be fake and they are around what you would expect the A15 to be able to do, so it might not be a custom core.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1347916792976</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:19:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347916793670-76</Id><Title>Read this, collect the Dividend and wait/accumulate</Title><Msg>Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android mobile platform will continue to beat Apple's iOS in terms of market share for as long as they can offer a wider variety of feature rich devices for low prices that keep getting lower. Perhaps that's why Google's developers recently partnered with Intel's impressive software team to hammer out compatibility issues. The results were the successful porting of the Android operating system to the x86 instruction set while still maintaining compatibility with existing applications. Test results show that the Intel processors will be able to slip into an Andriod phone or tablet anywhere an ARM chip could go. Bringing Intel into the fold to compete with ARM should drive the prices of Android devices even lower. This is good news for Google and great news for Intel shareholders. The next step for Intel's mobile penetration plan is to dispel the myth that their Atom processors are less efficient and slower than existing technology. In a test conducted by Anandtech, Intel's single core “Medfield” pro at 1.6 GHz beat the dual core ARM Cortex A9 by a wide margin performing tasks that require a single core. When tested completing processes requiring multiple cores the Intel chip still came out ahead of ARM. On top of performing tasks as faster or better than the industry standard ARM processors, the Intel chips do so using roughly the same amount of power. Single core Intel Medfield chips are still measuring up to competing dual cores while maintaining energy efficiency. Further testing with the quad-core Snapdragon S4 processors by Qualcomm showed that they perform only slightly better than the single core processor from Intel. Intel has a higher performance Medfield chip slated for early next year that sports dual cores and LTE capability. Intel's new chips should outperform both ARM and Qualcomm processors. More importantly the Intel chips will be able to not only outperform ARM and Qualcomm chips, but do it using just as little power from those tiny smartphone batteries. Also, Intel has a distinct advantage over ARM with respect to getting their new products to market. The ARM Cortex A9 design was completed three years before you could buy a phone that was using it. Intel has ARM clearly beaten in this arena. Intel's instruction set programming and core architecture development can be done internally. This is not the case with ARM Holdings. Also Intel doesn't have to collaborate with an outside manufacturer once their chip designs are finalized, they've got the most advanced processor factories on the planet. ARM, on the other hand, relies on outside manufacturing from sources like Taiwan Semiconductor and United Microelectronics to produce their chips.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1347916793670</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:19:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347917528111-77</Id><Topic><Title>Great Info!

Bringing Intel into the fold to compete with ARM should drive the prices of Android devices even lower. This is good news for Google and great news for Intel shareholders. The next step for Intel's mobile penetration plan is to dispel the myth that their Atom processors are less efficient and slower than existing technology. In a test conducted by Anandtech, Intel's single core “Medfield” pro at 1.6 GHz beat the dual core ARM Cortex A9 by a wide margin performing tasks that require a single core. When tested completing processes requiring multiple cores the Intel chip still came out ahead of ARM. On top of performing tasks as faster or better than the industry standard ARM processors, the Intel chips do so using roughly the same amount of power. Single core Intel Medfield chips are still measuring up to competing dual cores while maintaining energy efficiency. Further testing with the quad-core Snapdragon S4 processors by Qualcomm showed that they perform only slightly better than the single core processor from Intel. Intel has a higher performance Medfield chip slated for early next year that sports dual cores and LTE capability. Intel's new chips should outperform both ARM and Qualcomm processors. More importantly the Intel chips will be able to not only outperform ARM and Qualcomm chips, but do it using just as little power from those tiny smartphone batteries. Also, Intel has a distinct advantage over ARM with respect to getting their new products to market. The ARM Cortex A9 design was completed three years before you could buy a phone that was using it. Intel has ARM clearly beaten in this arena. Intel's instruction set programming and core architecture development can be done internally. This is not the case with ARM Holdings. Also Intel doesn't have to collaborate with an outside manufacturer once their chip designs are finalized, they've got the most advanced processor factories on the planet. ARM, on the other hand, relies on outside manufacturing from sources like Taiwan Semiconductor and United Microelectronics to produce their chips.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1347931734854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:28:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347931900189-91</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to bring Android to Clover Trail Chips for Tablets</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1347931734854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:28:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bringing Intel into the fold to compete with ARM should drive the prices of Android devices even lower.

They are buying all the Apple kool-aid they can consume while bashing Intel at every opportunity. The guys at Fudzilla have had some interesting ways to put it. Here's one: ""The cocaine nose jobs of Wall Street have been spluttering into their espressos after Texas Instruments announced that it is set to beat their low end estimates"." Here's another: "Don't trust anything you read. The Tame Apple Press appears to be pulling out all stops to encourage readers to waste their money on the lack-lustre iPhone5. Reuters this morning was dominated by stories which claimed the iPhone5 was going to be a sell out and was peppered with comments that there was going to be a frenzy. The fact that the iPhone 5 has comparatively poor reviews and most of its functionality does not work in Europe has not stopped the spinning. " In the meantime, Wall Street has concluded if Apple is magnificent then ARM must be great. And if ARMs fabrication wasn't in total decline they might be right. But ARMs fabrication is a train wreck which will become more and more obvious as we move into 2013. What we know now: 1.) The iPhone 5 is a "just good enough" iteration. Just enough to get them down the road but leaving them totally exposed in regards to future developments. 2.) Apple has no good fabrication choices. Samsung and the lawsuits and no state-of-the-art. Or TSMC and limited capacity and no state-of-the-art. 3.) If Intel offers its state-of-the-art technology to Apple competitors then Apple will sail into a huge competitive headwind. 4.) Wall Street is clueless about the underlying dynamics within mobility. It's all about the fabrication and Wall Street doesn't understand the first thing about fabrication. 5.) Intel has built for the future. ARM is relying on the past. Not hard to see how this is going to play out. 6.) 14nm is the tipping point. The point at which there is no compelling reason to ever use an ARM processor again. Intel 14nm will have vastly superior processing power along with greater power efficiency. 7.) The turn is happening now and will pick up speed throughout 2013. 8.) Motorola smartphone announcement tomorrow. The UK variant of the Motorola RAZR M phone will be powered by an Intel chip instead of a Snapdragon S4. Just the beginning of the ARM replacements with Intel...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347933839889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 22:03:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347935728515-93</Id><Title>14 nm FAB 42 plant coming online in Chandler Arizona in 2013 changes everything</Title><Msg>Read all about it.

Microsoft/Intel's Wintel moat which makes it difficult for other chip manufacturers to break into the lucrative PC market and Intel's process moat which makes it difficult for fab-less chip designers such as Qualcomm and Nvidia to compete with Intel on chips. The first has been broken. The second is eroding. The reason Intel is so ahead on process is partly because they have had continuous demand for their chips due to the PC industry (that they envisioned and created). The independent foundries have not had such huge demand and therefore invested in research slowly. This has changed, so Intel's process moat will probably get forded in the next 5 years. It's a pity Intel's so far behind on architecture. If it weren't for that, they could have been clear leaders with Medfield. x86 got them here and it will lead them to their destiny.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1347939442592</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:37:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347940781714-100</Id><Title>Motorola Mobility to announce first Intel-based device 5am ET</Title><Msg>10AM UK London time will be before the US market opens tomorrow.
