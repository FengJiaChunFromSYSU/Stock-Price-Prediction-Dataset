No one should interfere with a Congressman's right to get knee-walking, commode-hugging drunk, get naked, and desecrate religious sites on trips paid for by the American taxpayer. I'm just sorry that my Congressman wasn't there to express his individual liberty and to perhaps throw out a few remarks indicating that he thinks of women in a class slightly below the family dog....</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345522228000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 00:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345522318000-2</Id><Topic><Title>You Can't Make This Stuff Up!</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345470656000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 09:50:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is why people spit on Republiscum.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345522318000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 00:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345522550000-3</Id><Title>Coming Up</Title><Msg>Back to School and IDF.

Really? Republicans Urge Akin to Quit Senate Race Senate Republicans are urging Rep. Todd Akin to drop his U.S. Senate bid in Missouri after the candidate told a local news show that women "rarely" become pregnant through "legitimate rape." The National Senatorial Campaign Committee has pledged to pull the $5 million it had planned to spend in Missouri if Akin stays in the race, a Republican with knowledge of the committee’s activity confirmed to RealClearPolitics. Crossroads GPS, a super PAC that has been running ads against Akin’s Democratic opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill, plans to withhold additional ads if Akin does not drop out, spokesman Nate Hodson said. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/08/20/akins_rape_remark_echoes_beyond_missouri_race.html</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345522882000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 00:21:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345523310000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama caught lying again today!</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1345514873000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 22:07:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The rape comment will be forgotten in two weeks." *** Here's a Democrat that agrees with you: "I'm sticking with my prediction: it all blows over and Akin doesn't even lose much support.

Pure and simple it is nothing but market manipulation that transfers wealth from INTC's shareholders to the Wall Street robbers. One week these programs run INTC shares up and they sell call options, the next week it is down. In sum, despite earnings doubling over the past five years, INTC's share price is basically unchanged. Not just INTC's shares are being manipulated, but many other mature tech stocks: AMAT, NVLS, KLAC, STX, WDC, etc. Since 2010, STX earnings are up 120%, yet despite the recent rise share STX' price is up just 25% Isn't it about time to put an end to this scam? Paul Otellini in a recent Business Week interview stated that certain Analysts may be pursuing an agenda that derives trading profits for their firms rather than reporting the facts: Business Week: "You guys have been churning out record revenue pretty regularly. But people aren’t paying as much attention to your strengths, like high-end chips that go into data centers. Critics are more fixated on, “Gosh, Intel missed this whole smartphone surge.” Is that fair?" Otellini: "We’ve had a very good last few years. Part of it is that the analyst community has their own agenda. They may be long on something and short on something else.

The tech industry is at an inflection point where form factor and usage is changing dramatically. Intel execs can spend their time yelling at analysts or they can spend the time repositioning Intel to be strong in the face of change.

I would be intrested in an explanation of how the manipulation occurs and how it affects share price if you ever see a specific example. My problem is that most if not all of the manipulation has been explained by vague theory presented as fact. I have shared my dividend arbitraging theory and pointed out what I suspect. IMO, Intel has become a victim of its own success and inability to diversify outside the computer industry. Once they own 90% of the market, they ARE the market and cannot grow revenue or profits faster than that market. It is tough risking the cash cow for new markets.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1345559845000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:37:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345559902000-45</Id><Topic><Title>ARM's 64-bit architecture is "clean and elegant"</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345554477000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 09:07:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"INtel will be competing with a common CPU ISA, that the entire world's R&amp;D will be supporting..." So, you are saying the entire world's R&amp;D will supporting ARM64? It's more like R&amp;D from around the world will be supporting it. There is a niche market that this core would fit into. There are open source web hosts for example who may be interested in ARM64. This isn't pandora's box however for ARM. Intel has had a long history of having server processors show up in the market from competition and then having to respond to them. AMD has pulled fast ones now and then. ARM64 has been broadcast years in advance. They are competing on parameters that Intel is already addressing such as low power consumption. My question is what node will ARM64 be at, realistically? 28nm? Or the mythical 20nm? I am thinking by the end of 2013/2014 ARM64 20nm may not be readily available. What you will have in the streets is ARM64 28nm vs. Intel at 14nm. R&amp;D means nothing if you can't get product on the streets. Tic Toc will soften the blow of ARM64. I expect many great news articles about ARM64, and the stock price to surge with the news of the 'x86 killer server processor' as it will be explained to naive ARMH investors. But, as for a swift acceptance of ARM64, what will drive it?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345559902000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:38:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345560008000-46</Id><Topic><Title>Otellini Calls Out Wall Street ANAlysts</Title><Username>alienation_666</Username><Timestamp>1345556618000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 09:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If Intel delivers earnings, the stock rises.

Meanwhile, the foundry's new 12-inch fab - Fab 15 - will have a capacity of more than 100,000 12-inch equivalent wafers in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to the report." Read it carefully, it means that one one wafer they got a yield of 80%. If they could consistently do this they would put it in writing. What's their real yield rate? 40%. If they had a yield rate above 50% they would switch immediately to selling by the wafer? Why? As yields improve costs would go down, and a consistent price would drive the market. What I am reading from this article is that the pay per wafer business plan isn't working and they are having guys like D.A.N out their BSing suppliers with bogus numbers. As the numbers on the bottom of the article state the sales figures aren't that great, 5 and 7 percent versus the expected 20%. This pay per wafer idea was the best thing ever for Intel. They easily lost 6 months due to production issues and now pure stupidity. The iPhone 5 threat of TSMC/QCOM is now gone. The iPhone 5 will most likely be a Samsung 32nm. And with the full scale production cycle of the holiday season now out of reach, they are ramping up production for the slowest time of the year for consumer gadet sales. Oh well, at least they will be ready for ARM64 by the end of next year.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345561338000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:02:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345562168000-52</Id><Topic><Title>i spit on the market.</Title><Username>xz1</Username><Timestamp>1345560118000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That makes two of us.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345562168000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:16:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345562311000-53</Id><Topic><Title>I spit on AMD...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345554032000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 09:00:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True, I have plenty of other things to spit on.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345562311000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:18:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345562549000-54</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 28nm process yields break 80%</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345555937000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 09:32:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"at least they will be ready for ARM64 by the end of next year." this year...

Applied Micro, Cavium Networks, Qualcomm, Samsung and Nvidia will be designing their own CPU's to the ARMv8 ISA. Each of these CPU's will have a different power/performance/price ratios. ----- My question is what node will ARM64 be at, realistically? 28nm? Or the mythical 20nm?

What you will have in the streets is ARM64 28nm vs. Intel at 14nm. ----- ARMH's own CPU's meeting the ARMv8 ISA are targeting the 20nm node. Others, such as Applied Micro are looking at 40nm then moving to 28nm. ----- R&amp;D means nothing if you can't get product on the streets. Tic Toc will soften the blow of ARM64. I expect many great news articles about ARM64, and the stock price to surge with the news of the 'x86 killer server processor' as it will be explained to naive ARMH investors. But, as for a swift acceptance of ARM64, what will drive it? ----- There will be no ARM ISA based 'x86 killer server processor'.

I also get that the ARM CPU is inside the SoC's such as the Tegra3 and A5X. What I am picking up from the various engineering types on the board is an unsophisticated view of how the markets work. When I ask "what will push this technology" this is what I mean. The sales numbers for server processors don't drive themselves. Intel has territory sales managers calling on various geographical locations. Most often they have EE degrees and are paid well. They get to know the players in their territory. When a company has 100 or more servers they keep in contact with them. The large accounts like Google for example have their best reps working for them in key account positions. They may even have dedicated staff on site at Google's various server farms. The problem you'll have with an ARM64 processor is that Intel is very well entrenched in the market. They have an uphill battle like they won't believe. This is a market Intel knows well and has feet on the street willing to fight for every last sale. I can understand the fringe sales for the smaller and more obscure players. But if you are expecting an overnight explosion like smartphone sales, won't happen. Like Intel has said before it's 10 to 15% of the market, max. An organic growth rate is more likely, but it will take years.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345587206000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 18:13:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345587258000-95</Id><Topic><Title>The Hammer is Down After Hours</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1345582097000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 16:48:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will hold.

Barclays expects that TSMC’s pushout of its Fab 14 phase 2 caused Applied Materials to lower its revenue forecast for front-end semiconductor tools. Despite well-known shortages at 28nm for Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD, and other chip suppliers, TSMC is likely hesitant to add capacity until it improves its 28nm high-k metal gate (HKMG) yields. Barclays interprets this situation as leaving lithography and process control orders intact, while more capacity driven players would see a delay. Other factors in the Q3 lull include a retrofit at Samsung’s Austin fab and a modest pushout at Fab 16.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1345597535000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 21:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345598649000-112</Id><Title>Sell INTC, Buy Apple?</Title><Msg>Both stocks trade at a P/E around 12 but Apple would appear to have more upside potential from current levels considering it's growth prospects.

But people aren’t paying as much attention to your strengths, like high-end chips that go into data centers. Critics are more fixated on, “Gosh, Intel missed this whole smartphone surge.” Is that fair?" Otellini: "We’ve had a very good last few years. Part of it is that the analyst community has their own agenda. They may be long on something and short on something else. We tend not to worry about that."&gt; On a Q&amp;A sesion on a recent presentation (I think an analyst meeting), Ottelini kept getting the same question over and over as though these dorks didn't really understand the business. Finally, Ottelini said, "I'm not going to talk to you guys anymore." I've been looking all over for that bit, but I can't find it. Since then I haven't seen any Intel generated commentary or exciting announcements. The IDF is coming up in about three weeks. If there is something important for developers to know, Intel should be starting to talk soon. You can't just pop a bunch of new stuff on your developers the first day of the meeting. The above interview kind of confirms that Ottelini is doing a slow burn over the apparent ignorance of the analyst community. Sooner or later there will be a huge piece of news that will catch 150 million short shares in somthing of a "hurry" to buy. Payback is a tough deal. Just to repeat...the IDF is Sep 11-13. Ottelini has always given the opening keynote speech. Not this year. The Apple iPhone 5 intro is Sep 12. Will Ottelini be there instead of the IDF?</Msg><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1345604078000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:54:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345604435000-121</Id><Title>Take yo Baybee by the hand</Title><Msg>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Hm34p5m8c</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1345604435000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:00:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345604604000-122</Id><Title>Obama is the Windows Vista of Presidents</Title><Msg>Lots of hype, but doesn't live up to promises.</Msg><Username>b52boomer</Username><Timestamp>1345604604000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:03:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345604785000-123</Id><Topic><Title>Take yo Baybee by the hand</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1345604435000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:00:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Take yo baybee by the hand, and make her do a high hand stand.
