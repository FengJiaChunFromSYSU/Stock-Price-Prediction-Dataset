If you are long in ARMH then you should think soon about taking profit if its direction clearly starts reversing and re-buying at a much lower level like under 15-20 when it gets there. INTC has been above its 50 SMA (20.86) for all of 2013, see stockcharts for the dividend adjusted chart because I think you are looking at a non dividend adjusted chart average.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361269031270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 05:17:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361280231462-5</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver said ARM was a sell at 22.......and now says it's a sell at 44</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361234536862</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 19:42:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LMAO!

The new chip will give Nvidia a processor to compete against Qualcomm’s integrated chips. Nvidia has launched an integrated smartphone chip designed for mainstream smartphones in a bid to take on Qualcomm’s processor dominance in mobile handsets. The Tegra 4i is part of what will now be a family of Tegra 4 smartphone chips, with the 4 aimed at high-end phones and tablets and the 4i aimed at phones in the $100 to $200 range. The Tegra 4i could support delivery of 1080p video playback on a 5-inch screen, according to the reference design Nvidia showed off with the launch (see above). The Nvidia spokesman expects features like the HD playback to become mainstream by the time these chips hit the market at the end of 2013.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361286784059</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:13:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361286805103-30</Id><Topic><Title>Take a look at this report before you loose your $</Title><Username>nicklee657</Username><Timestamp>1361216174211</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 14:36:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report.</Msg><Username>nickreed179</Username><Timestamp>1361286805103</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:13:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361286917181-31</Id><Title>AONEQ strong buy</Title><Msg>AONEQ strong buy</Msg><Username>benhorp</Username><Timestamp>1361286917181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:15:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361287213665-32</Id><Title>Statler and Waldorf, Sam, Fozzie and all</Title><Msg>I signed in this morning and the board reminded me of some of the wild Muppet shows with slightly less humor.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361287213665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:20:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361288327723-33</Id><Title>ARM Fanboi Hissy Fit Continues into Second Day as Bubble Fears Mount</Title><Msg>Poll of the Day Will the ARM Bubble pop just before or just after Haswell is released? 1.)

The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed to 48.2 from 31.5 in January. That’s the highest since April 2010. Economists forecast a gain to 35, according to the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.

Apple is trying to push itself into the same market which Intel is headed so the hope was that if enough dirt stuck to the product it would beat the competition even before it started. One of the advantages of Apple having so many chums in the press is that stories like this get written and repeated on the web without anyone bothering to check. At the centre of the Big Brother claims is the idea that it has a forward pointing camera that does not have a shutter, which the tame apple press wants you to see as an always on spy device. However cameras without shutters are old hat now. Samsung showed off their latest TVs that came with a camera, Microsoft’s Kinect devices never had them, neither did about 200M notebooks with a camera with no shutter. Intel will use the camera to automatically login the user and customise the experience based on their distinct needs and habits. The video communications are local only and doesn’t “phone home” and it can serve as an intelligent parent filter because the telly can see who is watching it. Ironically Intel’s camera is opt-in and also provides a physical shutter that the viewer can close if they choose. This is much more than most of the camera orientated devices out there.

When Redmond released the Surface running on the version of Windows 8 n the US and Canada on February 9 it soon went out of stock. Most of us thought this was Redmond’s cunning plan to make it look like the device's popularity, others believe that the inventory was low due as manufacturers did not expect to sell too many units. But there are signs that there really was a heavy demand for the product which was not filled. According to a report in technology website CNET, the 128GB Microsoft Surface Pro was hoarded by early buyers and being flogged on eBay in a bid to make a quick buck. One seller is offering it for $1,300, even though it is officially priced at $999. The report says that there are other retailers who are selling it at a hefty price of $1,399 and $1,499. On February 15, Microsoft announced that it will be taking pre-orders for Surface Pro. However, the units will not be shipped for at least another two to three weeks, and even this inventory will be limited. The thriving black market seems to indicate that Redmond is actually killing off demand for something that could be popular.

In Q4 2012, in the Legacy 1 tier, the most affordable Pentium was the G645 a 65W, 2.9GHz clocked dual core Sandy Bridge. In Q1 2013 this one got replaced by Pentium G2020, an Ivy Bridge 55W TDP dual core and already in Q3 2013 it will get replaced by a Haswell Pentium. The Legacy 1 market is ruled by the G2020, Legacy 2 is taken care of by the G2120 and Legacy 3 has the G2130, which will be replaced with Haswell version of Pentium processors. At this time we don’t have the clocks of these processors but we do know that L1 market starts from $64, L2 market for boxed Pentiums is at $75 for tray and $82, while L3 market wants $86 for tray and $93 for boxed parts. This is the transition guide for Haswell in 2013 and many will notice that the transition is much faster than before.

RE: chart adjustments... adjusting for regular dividends is like splitting hairs... I look at trends and the fact is INTC stock price is close to dropping below the 50 day SMA and is barely holding above a 23.6% retracement level from the Aug high to Nov low. Also, on my (non-adjusted) chart, the 10 day SMA is close to crossing that 50 SMA.

I don't care.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1361318184757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:56:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361318663081-103</Id><Topic><Title>Where's Moe, Lary and Curly (Wallisweaver, Ashraf and Marsavian)</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1360953194752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:33:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well because other posters have asked my opinion about when ARMH would peak but as you are asking about INTC's chart ... well the 50 MA is gently pushing the stock up but you have dropping moving averages like the 125, 150, 200 etc above the stock that will provide downward pressure. Long term relatively static moving averages like the 300, 400, 500 and 600 are also above the stock providing resistance so it will require a change in perception or fundamentals to really move this stock and overcome the bad chart which it should do within a year because it was bad perception of fundamentals which overcame a good chart position at 29 to get down to the 21 today. Fundamentals will overcome technicals in this stock every time as change in sentiment provides the volume to move it.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361318663081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 19:04:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361320380547-104</Id><Topic><Title>Where's Moe, Lary and Curly (Wallisweaver, Ashraf and Marsavian)</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1360953194752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:33:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>p.s. the stock also crossed above the 100 MA in February and the 50 will cross above it too soon so these dropping averages need not be terminal to upward movement but they are providing temporary friction to be overcome.

In most posts you say you are looking for an entry point. But today you finally said that entry point could be bullish or bearish. Up to that point you've held to the party line that you are looking to be long. But at the same time you have nothing but criticism for Intel in every post. There is an obvious reason for tracking the stock and bashing it at the same time. But it's usually doesn't mean you like the stock. So, I say again. You keep talking out of both sides of your mouth. The only thing you do consistently is say ugly stuff about Intel. I therefore have decided that you are a basher and treat you as such. Like all the other bashers you seem to know nothing about Intel or technology... But I get tired of all the dancing around that you do.

LG to Showcase Innovative Convertible Tablet at MWC [02/19/2013 10:35 AM] by Anton Shilov LG Electronics will be showcasing its own interpretation of a tablet-notebook hybrid device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, later this month. The convertible device features fully-fledged dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with reduced power consumption, high-definition display, 4G/LTE connectivity as well as integrated keyboard. This is the first hybrid PC with built-in 4G/LTE connectivity. The slim and light LG Tab-Book is based on Windows 8 operating system and features a precise 5-point multi-touch 11.6” screen with 1366*768 resolution and a superb slide-out keyboard that differentiates it from other hybrids. A simple press of the Auto-Sliding button reveals the keyboard which emerges from behind the screen for instant touch typing action. The Tab-Book’s in-plane switching (IPS) display delivers a premium picture with lifelike color expression and a wide 178° viewing angle to further enhance the user experience. The hybrid device comes with solid-state storage as well as LPDDR2 random access memory. Just like other mobile devices, the LG Tab-Book features 802.11 Wi-Fi, USB and HDMI ports, microSD card slot and other I/O capabilities. Thanks to 4G/LTE technology, the hybrid device allows users to connect to the Internet at high-speed, regardless of where they are. Thanks to its hidden slide-out physical keyboard, the Tab-Book is more functional than a conventional tablet, offering greater productivity when it comes to creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations. “The Tab-Book is going to appeal to consumers who want the convenience of a tablet but also the productivity of a notebook and do not want to carry two devices all the time. Many other products that claim to do both require making too many sacrifices in performance and weight. We think we have hit the perfect balance here and with super-fast 4G/LTE connectivity, we are delivering true convergence of computing and mobile devices,” said Il-geun Kwon, senior vice president and head of the LG Home Entertainment company’s IT business unit. LG’s new 4G/LTE-enabled Tab-Book will be available this week in South Korea, with additional market availability to be announced at a future date.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361328718000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:51:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361329499267-114</Id><Title>Just shaking my head and filthy, good for nothing Liberals</Title><Msg>Ohio Officials: Poll Worker May Have Voted Six Times By Eliana Johnson Melowese Richardson is the Ohio poll worker who admitted to casting two votes in November for President Obama. Now, Ohio officials are investigating if she voted in the names of four other people as well and cast a total of six ballots in the 2012 election, according to Fox News. The investigation is part of a wider one into a number of cases of alleged voter fraud in Hamilton County, Ohio. Richardson says she filled out and submitted an absentee ballot on her granddaughter’s behalf, and her granddaughter has confirmed that claim, saying, “It wasn’t a big deal.” Furthermore: Three other absentee ballots in the names of different people were submitted to the Board of Elections from Richardson’s address on Nov. 1. Officials say the handwriting on those ballots is similar and that they were all received together, on the same day that Richardson’s absentee ballot arrived at the office. Richardson maintains that some of the other voters live at her house. Attempts by Fox News to reach Richardson were unsuccessful, but she claimed to the local station that the votes were “absolutely legal votes.” Richardson is currently facing charges of voter fraud but maintains her innocence. “I can’t understand these charges against me of voter fraud,” she told Cincinnati’s Channel 9 News. “Have they never heard of . . . overlooking mailing in a ballot or registering to vote at a precinct after you’ve forgotten that you’ve mailed in a ballot or you’ve been told that the ballot may be too late?” The local news report below includes an interview with Richardson, who is set to appear before Ohio’s Hamilton County Board of Elections on Friday, as well as footage from the testimony of five other Ohio voters accused of voting, or attempting to vote, twice. One individual revealed she was unaware that it was illegal to vote twice, while several reported confusion caused by absentee ballots</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361329499267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 22:04:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361333501937-115</Id><Topic><Title>Just shaking my head and filthy, good for nothing Liberals</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361329499267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 22:04:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, us filthy good for nothing liberals.
