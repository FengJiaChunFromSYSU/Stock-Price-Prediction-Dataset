When Mike Bell was asked about the pricing of Medfield phone chips (by ExtremeTech, if I remember right), he mentioned that Otellini had told him that "...they will not lose a deal on pricing". Which clearly indicates that in markets where Intel has to enter or protect, Intel will be competitive with ARM pricing on a part-by-part basis. Intel has further demonstrated this by signing up Motorola, Lenovo, ZTE, and several other smartphone vendors proving that they can provide a price-competitive part. As it is, Intel estimated the market of these micro-servers to reach only 10% of the whole server market. Being an incumbent with 64-bit, ECC, and the all-important enterprise software compatibility etc., I think Intel will hold on to most of this 10% market segment.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1354272013140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 05:40:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354277624441-8</Id><Topic><Title>Creeps Covello and Cramer belong in prison</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1354270977570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 05:22:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is also an interview on Cramer were he openly admits how he controls stocks which is absolutely corrupt and this was on a interview which I will try to dig up and put on this board for all to see and gasp!

The next closest competitor in the ARM space - Applied Micro - has yet to tape out its X-Gene design. It's only running on FPGAs as of November 5th. ----- The ARM server push is coming from different vendors (CPU designs &amp; SoC designs) and will be hitting subsections of the market so will be very difficult to compare solutions. The X-Gene CPU (if Applied Micro's numbers are to be believed) will be the most powerful of the ARM 64 bit designs (so far announced), much more powerful than ARM's own 64 bit cores. It'll be up against low end 'real' servers designs from Intel, not Atom derived micro servers. ARM micro servers are shipping *today*, it's still early in the cycle, but do a search for calxeda to see what's what. It's an impressive SoC, not so much the CPU but the fabric that links everything together.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354282611123</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 08:36:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354283084489-14</Id><Topic><Title>Why ARM servers don't seem to be threatening...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1354256604568</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 01:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I don't see how the ARM stuff will really win" Of course you don't !!!!

Intel will have no choice but to plug all the low-end markets with perhaps lower margins than the high-end CPUs. But keep in mind, the ARM guys have to pay ARM, the processor designer, and the foundry - so they can't afford to give it away either. Most monopolies including Intel have a cash cow to rely on and build their adjacent spaces.

Intel will have no choice but to plug all the low-end markets with perhaps lower margins than the high-end CPUs. But keep in mind, the ARM guys have to pay ARM, the processor designer, and the foundry - so they can't afford to give it away either. ---- I am sure they will. In the case of X-gene - it's their own designed core. They'll still have to pay something to ARM but it'll be a tiny fraction of the SoC's selling price. Even in the case of an ARM designed core (such as with AMD) the total cost of the licence and royalty over the life of the product is still (typically) less than the cost of designing and building your own core. This is the beauty of the IP business model. Just like the phone market, it's not just about the CPU it's the SoC - Server-on-chip as these guys now say. Intel could have the best CPU in terms of price/performance/watt but if it's not contained in the correct SoC package (the fabric) then they will struggle.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354287235069</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:53:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354287268566-46</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Savior?</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1354286425713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:40:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be nice if it is possible.

It probably depends on Q4 and Q1 results. They would be declaring the Q1 dividend right after CES 2013 and just before Barcelona Mobile Conference in early Feb. Then they have the May shareholder meeting. My guess would be for the May dividend if markets are stable. Intel has historically bumped the dividend up every 2 to 4 quarters. Q2/2009 was when they payed the $1.45b EU fine and I think they skipped a dividend bump because of the cash to the fine. The BOD typically announces the increase before they declare the dividend. They normally declare the dividends near the dates: Jan 25th, Mar 20th, Jul 25th, Sep 20th The BOD would then anounce their intentions about 1 month before the declarations. The "cliff" might influence their timing but don't think so.

The employees using macbooks are using either bootcamp or some emulator program to run Windows programs. If Apple moves to ARM they will be cutting off this inroad into corporations. Alot (and i mean over 50%) of mac users on consumer side also use one of these method for using windows programs. Also, another reason is that not only does that Mac Os have to be converted over to ARM platform but also all their existing Mac OS software; we are talking about having every single branch of the company making this change...not easy. I have heard that Apple may try keeping the current Intel Macbooks but also try to create an ARM version to test out the market. Considering how the MS Surface RT did, I don't think they will. People hate no backward-compatibility support. My bet on Apple's next product will be a MacPad with Intel inside. A convertible with touch screen and slide out keyboard. It runs Haswell or some hybrid Haswell-ARM chip. Will run both ios and Mac OS.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354288900407</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:21:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354289293884-57</Id><Topic><Title>Where's Lucy_nuff also known as tooofunnny</Title><Username>joseywales_outlaw</Username><Timestamp>1354245057000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 22:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(or calling you stupid).

If and when Intel gets a 20% power and performance advantage over Arm chips, Intel quickly converts Iphones to Intel X86 chips. Problem I have with this report is that Intel Google are kissing cousins and Google might be tearing hard into Apple Iphone sales by this time next year with its Motorola brand. “In the inaugural study released by app analytics firm, App Annie Intelligence, data shows that, worldwide, the Apple store is seeing revenues four times larger than the Google Play store, but isn’t growing at an impressive rate — in fact, the year-to-date growth actually is greater for the Google Play store at 311% compared to iOS at 12.9% in 2012. And as the mathematicians among us will note you don’t need growth at 300% for all that long to close a fourfold gap. Indeed, if we straight line this then doesn’t the gap close in 18 months time or so? So--Intel could have two lovers soon. Android Motorola google phones and Apple Iphones. Double Intel revenue in three years.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1354300096333</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 13:28:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354300458423-95</Id><Topic><Title>RBC: Intel in talks with Apple to build Iphone processors</Title><Username>getsome_nads</Username><Timestamp>1354296018314</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:20:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel have got every process down to 10nm worked out already. The foundries in comparison are stuck with planar 20nm on which they are going to try to stick 14-16nm FinFET transistors which does not sound easy but hey it's their roadmap ;-). They haven't got a proper 14nm worked out yet as they don't even know what they will use in terms of technology. Bohr said Intel don't have to use EUV for 10nm if it is not ready, they have options at 10nm. Intel is not even competing with Apple SoC products directly anyway as they are a different o/s, iOS vs Android. So there could be a good deal to be made there in the future.

To make it perfectly clear, despite having nearly 100% of the smartphone and tablet market, as well as nearly the entirety of the microcontroller and embedded space, ARM fails to generate net income that comes out to even a fraction of that of its licensees and peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's initial success in the mobile computing markets has been primarily due to the firm's long-standing focus on the low power/embedded space, which allowed its products to evolve, due primarily to process technology advancements, to become fast enough to enable smartphones and tablets. The low power, low ASP application processor segment was largely overlooked by larger competitors early on, which gave ARM and its licensees the spotlight in the mobile processor world. However, going forward, it is clear that the actual ARM core designs will become less important, and that ARM's primary role in the mobile world will be as an instruction set licensee, given that there is now a substantial software base for the firm's instruction set in place. No other company could reasonably hope to compete in designing its own instruction set (other than Intel and its already established X86 ISA) since the software support and toolset -- usually the product of many years of development -- would be an almost intractable barrier to overcome. In short, ARM's business model will generate consistent, but low amounts of revenue and net income compared to its peers, which means that it is very unlikely that it will ever grow the top and bottom lines enough to warrant its valuation. However, the stock has seen an extraordinary run post-earnings and even more recently over the last couple of days.

Apple was not only stupid - they were arrogant completely misjudging Samsung If and only if Apple is smart they would hedge ARM/X86 and split the business. Intel would not be a second foundry - Intel would provide more or less x86 off the shelf just like in laptops.

Intel must crack CSCO foundry business - I hope Paul gets this one done Apple CPU orders raise concerns over TSMC production capacity Cage Chao, Taipei; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 28 November 2012] The semiconductor industry is now more concerned about how Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacture Company (TSMC) is going to distribute its production capacity, and what proportion of revenues and profits it can generate if it receives CPU orders from Apple in 2013. It appears more likely that TSMC will start producing chips for Apple's next iOS devices in 2013, according to industry observers. Samsung Electronics has been the sole supplier of CPUs that power the existing iPhones and iPads. Demand from Apple is expected to be huge, said the observers, adding that allocation of TSMC's available advanced process capacity among its major clients will be a critical decision to be made by the foundry. TSMC's advanced process offerings serve the world's major fabless IC firms including Altera, Qualcomm and Nvidia. While being capable of providing sufficient capacity to Apple, TSMC also does not want to upset its existing major clients, the observers noted. Allocating efficiently its production capacity will be a focus for the foundry in 2013, the observers believe. Apple's iPhone and iPad devices collectively demand almost 200 million CPUs every year, the observers estimate. TSMC will need at least more than 200,000 12-inch wafers ready to satisfy the huge demand from Apple, the observers said. In addition, market observers are paying close attention to how significant Apple's orders will contribute to TSMC's revenues and profitability in 2013. TSMC chairman and CEO Morris Chang previously hinted that it makes complete sense to dedicate a whole fab, or two whole fabs, to just one customer in order to supply enough chips for their high-volume products. TSMC recently broke ground for the sixth-phase construction of its Fab 14, a 12-inch wafer plant located in southern Taiwan. The new facility will become TSMC's first fab to mass produce 20nm SoCs, and 16nm FinFET chips, the foundry revealed. According to IC Insights, Samsung's IC foundry sales are forecast to rise 54% in 2012 after a 82% jump in 2011. Apple's orders have been the driving force behind Samsung's foundry business, said the research firm.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354314004256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 17:20:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354314923961-132</Id><Topic><Title>I hate to say it</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1354221073207</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:31:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blame someone else for your investment choices.

The company exhibits the classic signs of a bubble, similar in nature and sentiment to previous pie-in-the-sky stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Groupon (GRPN), and Zynga (ZNGA). These companies each saw a sharp drop in share price and valuation once it became clear that these business models could not hope to generate the kinds of returns that the hordes of sell-side analysts as well as giddy retail investors had previously expected. ARM Holdings is one of the most expensive semiconductors in the world, trading at 68x trailing-twelve-month earnings (against an industry average of 24.08x), 18.61x sales (against an industry average of 3.66x), and PEG ratio of 3.68 against an industry mean of 1.99. More importantly, ARM generated $386.31M in cash from operations, which values the company at 42.5x free-cash-flow. Compare this to its peers (data sourced from Yahoo Finance) Qualcomm (QCOM): 23.4x FCF Intel (INTC): 18.42x FCF Nvidia (NVDA): 17.75x FCF Texas Instruments (TXN): 11.6x FCF Broadcom (BRCM): 14.36x FCF One would suspect that for this premium, a potential investor would be buying fairly explosive growth. Not so with ARM Holdings. According to the 11 sell-side analysts that cover the company, ARM is expected to post 12.8% sales growth in the current fiscal year. While nothing to sneeze at, it certainly does not support the firm's current valuation. However, this but scratches the surface of the absurdity of ARM's current price, as we will detail here. Understanding The Company's Technology ARM Holdings is a U.K.-based semiconductor firm that focuses on developing low-power embedded processor IP for use in a broad range of applications from the now in-vogue smartphones and tablets to more mundane applications such as microcontrollers (which comprise the majority of ARM's business). In particular, there seems to be much confusion as to what ARM actually produces, so it is worth a few paragraphs to go into a little more detail. There are two critical -- but distinguishable -- aspects to microprocessor design worth mentioning here (there are others). First, we have what is known as "instruction set architecture," which essentially defines what commands that processor understands. These commands -- known as the processor's assembly language -- are what define a particular processor from a programmer/compiler writer's perspective. This is why a program written for an Intel-based machine (which runs a different instruction set) will not run on an ARM-based machine. The next aspect of microprocessor design is called the micro-architecture. This is the actual design of hardware that can execute the instructions defined by the instruction set architecture. The quality of the micro-architecture as well as the particular design target for that particular micro-architecture are generally what determine performance and power efficiency. For example, one could design a very low power 2W system-on-chip for a tablet or a 150W power-hungry high-performance processor by implementing the same instruction set with wildly different microarchitectures, fabrication processes, and so forth. ARM Holdings designs a base instruction set as well as a handful of micro-architectures for use by product licensees. Customers can choose either to simply license the right to design a CPU that implements the ARM instruction set (and thus gain software compatibility with all pre-existing ARM code), or it can simply use ARM's off-the-shelf designs and then build a system-on-chip around them. Separating The Hype From The Business Model There is no doubt that ARM's technology has come to the forefront of the technology stock universe as the media and the sell-side analysts champion ARM Holdings' positioning as the core and/or instruction-set supplier for the majority of the world's smartphones. The company collects a small royalty for every ARM-compatible chip that is shipped, and despite 2.2B ARM-compatible products shipped in Q2 (but license revenue recognized in Q3), ARM only saw $107M in profits before tax. To make it perfectly clear, despite having nearly 100% of the smartphone and tablet market, as well as nearly the entirety of the microcontroller and embedded space, ARM fails to generate net income that comes out to even a fraction of that of its licensees and peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's initial success in the mobile computing markets has been primarily due to the firm's long-standing focus on the low power/embedded space, which allowed its products to evolve, due primarily to process technology advancements, to become fast enough to enable smartphones and tablets. The low power, low ASP application processor segment was largely overlooked by larger competitors early on, which gave ARM and its licensees the spotlight in the mobile processor world. However, going forward, it is clear that the actual ARM core designs will become less important, and that ARM's primary role in the mobile world will be as an instruction set licensee, given that there is now a substantial software base for the firm's instruction set in place. No other company could reasonably hope to compete in designing its own instruction set (other than Intel and its already established X86 ISA) since the software support and toolset -- usually the product of many years of development -- would be an almost intractable barrier to overcome. In short, ARM's business model will generate consistent, but low amounts of revenue and net income compared to its peers, which means that it is very unlikely that it will ever grow the top and bottom lines enough to warrant its valuation. However, the stock has seen an extraordinary run post-earnings and even more recently over the last couple of days. The earnings report was nothing to write home about -- it beat analyst revenue forecasts by $2M (for a total quarterly sales figure of $227M) , and as a result, the company has gained over $4B in market capitalization. But now there's a new catalyst propelling ARM to even higher, more shortable, Internet-bubble like valuations: a buyout rumor. Intel Buying ARM Makes No Sense The rumor that began spreading was that ARM was in "off-the-record" talks with Intel about a potential acquisition. The source is questionable, as vague notions of "dealers" hearing "whispers" certainly does not lend itself to credibility. However, shady sources are not the problem here. The problem here is that this makes zero sense. First, there is a misconception that Intel cannot design low power chips to fit into smartphones. This is patently false, and has been disproven by highly competitive shipping products from Intel today. For instance, Intel is now shipping its Atom Z2460 mobile processor for smartphones, and in every relevant metric -- performance, power consumption, and compatibility -- it is as good or better than leading edge ARM processors. In fact, Anandtech -- a leading technology review website -- compared the Motorola Droid Razr i (powered by the aforementioned Intel chip) to the leading smartphones with the highest-end ARM processors in them, including Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. The site had this to say: At least based on this data, it looks like Intel is the closest to offering a real competitor to Apple's own platform from a power efficiency standpoint. Further, performance is not a concern (the "rumor" suggests Intel's chips are slower than the various designs from the ARM camp) as evidenced in the very same review. Not only is the Intel chip a formidable competitor, it is also the fastest processor available: Intel's Atom core remains very competitive with the best of the ARM world. A single core Atom still ends up being the only CPU that can regularly outperform Apple's Swift So right off the bat, the rumor is predicated on a very serious and egregious error. Keep in mind that Intel's processor is using what is essentially a design that has been unchanged since 2008, only fit into a lower power envelope. A next generation chip, built from the ground up, should only further Intel's lead. In terms of chip design, Intel is fighting the best of the best in the ARM ecosystem. With a 5-year-old design. Compatibility - Still No Reason To Go ARM Since ARM processors were in mobile devices before Intel's, a substantial software base for ARM's processors was built up. However, due to the way that the Google (GOOG) Android operating system and its programs are designed, instruction set is not relevant to the majority of applications since almost every Android application is written in Java. Java programs are written in a high level language and then compiled down into an intermediate form called bytecode. This bytecode is then, at execution time, translated into the actual machine instructions by a virtual machine. This means that the only barrier to compatibility is having a virtual machine built into Android that can translate Java bytecode into native instructions. Intel and Google have achieved this, which is why software compatibility on Android is essentially a non-issue. This is also why we have shipping Android phones with Intel processors in them today. So the main barrier to entry for a new instruction set -- X86 in the mobile world -- is a non-issue on the target platform that Intel is aiming for in phones. It also helps that Android's global market share is 75%. That means that Intel's chips could power the majority of the world's smartphones without any technical limitations. The remaining 25% -- which consists of iOS, Blackberry, and Windows Phone -- is locked up mostly by Apple, which designs its own processors. There should be very little in the way of a barrier to entry for an Intel-powered Windows Phone, as Microsoft's applications are built in a very similar "virtual-machine" based way. This is how Windows RT and Windows 8 will be able to run the same, "modern UI" applications despite running on different instruction sets. These arguments all apply to tablets, with an additional edge for Intel, as Windows 8 tablets are natively X86 compatible. Even If Intel Went ARM, No Need To Buy The Company ARM doesn't build chips. It licenses core designs and instruction sets. Intel, if it were to go ARM, would not use off-the-shelf ARM cores, but would likely design its own ARM compatible chips. There is, of course, no technical reason to do this (and certainly no financial, as it would need to pay for a license and royalty fees -- not to mention that it loses all ability to modify/enhance the instruction set). But if it were to do so, it would simply buy an ARM license and pay the 1.8% royalty to build and sell the chips. Why pay $17B (plus whatever extra fee) when Intel could accomplish the same goal with less risk, and for substantially cheaper? Keep in mind that Intel already builds many ARM chips for things such as network processors and SSD controllers. In fact, Intel is one of the largest ARM licensees! Also, as discussed above, ARM trades at ~43x free-cash-flow and 70x earnings at current levels. A buyout premium would likely increase that significantly. This makes no sense when an instruction set license is cheap. Insider Sales Confirm Bubble While ARM is busy telling the investment public that it is going to take over the world with its licensing business model, the insiders are using these inflated prices as an opportunity to get out. ARM is not a U.S.- based company, so it does not need to register with the SEC. That means it is exceptionally difficult for U.S.- based investors (the ones generating all the media hype) to watch insider sales.

I'm lazy but know how and what to search for What’s After NAND Flash? Thursday, August 16th, 2012 By Mark LaPedus For years, many have predicted the end of flash memory scaling, particularly NAND, but the technology continues to defy the odds as it moves down the process curve. Still, there are signs that the floating gate structure in today’s flash memory is on its last legs. The floating gate is seeing an undesirable reduction in the control gate to capacitive coupling ratio. And there is an increase in cell-to-cell interference in the word lines. “The floating gate has been very successful in scaling down to the current 20nm node or even the 1xnm node,” said Gill Lee, a senior director and principal member of the technical staff at Applied Materials. “There is not much room for the floating gate to scale. Nobody really believes that planar NAND can go below 10nm.” Today, the Toshiba-SanDisk duo is shipping NAND devices based on the world’s most advanced process, a 19nm technology. Going forward in NAND, Lee and others see at least two or more nodes remaining in the 1xnm regime. The question is what’s after NAND flash? Currently, the industry is pursuing three basic categories in the NAND replacement sweepstakes: scaling existing NAND; 3D NAND; and the next-generation memory types. There is no clear-cut winner right now. But in some circles, the initial and most promising successor is 3D NAND. “3D NAND is an extension of existing NAND,” Lee said. “Vertical NAND is in the development stage right now. The timeline for mass production is as early as 2013. Some companies have announced 2015.” Defying the odds Clearly, flash scaling has defied the odds. Ten years ago, Intel, the first vendor that commercialized NOR flash, predicted that flash would hit the wall at 65nm. Banking on those predictions, a number of firms began to develop various next-generation memory technologies that could replace NAND, NOR or DRAM—or all three. FeRAM, MRAM, phase-change and ReRAM are among those candidates. The prediction was wrong, however. NAND has scaled down to 19nm, while NOR has migrated to 45nm. Thanks to 193nm immersion lithography and self-aligned double patterning (SADP), flash vendors have been able to scale the floating gate. The ability to scale NAND and NOR has also pushed out the need for the next-generation memory types. And besides, most of these new memory types are still in R&amp;D. They are expensive to make and difficult to scale. Scaling today’s NAND down to 10nm is also difficult. NAND vendors may have to use self-aligned quadruple patterning, as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography remains delayed. “NAND is even beyond current EUV resolutions. Even if EUV is available as of today, double patterning has to be used together with EUV,” Lee said. There is also a remote chance that today’s 2D NAND could scale further using charge trap technology. Charge trap uses a silicon nitride film to store electrons. “I think the generation of charge trap flash as a planar device is limited,” he said. Initially, if or when today’s NAND runs out of gas, the industry is banking on 3D NAND. “With 3D NAND, scaling is no longer driven by lithography. The gate length is defined by deposition,” Lee said. 3D NAND is also challenging, but the production steps are slightly different than 3D stacked DRAM and logic. The key step to 3D NAND is to build a multitude of oxide/nitride or oxide/doped polysilicon stacked layers. Another key step is to fill the deep memory holes or trench slits. “The top foreseeable challenges are ultra-high-aspect ratio ( 40:1) conductor etch and dielectric etch with high etch selectivity to the hard mask,” Lee said in a recent paper. There’s another challenge as well: Can the 3D NAND developers put their products into production? The main 3D NAND contenders are Toshiba’s BiCS, Samsung’s VG-NAND, Macronix’ BE-SONOS, Hynix’ vertical cylindrical FG, SanDisk’s 3D memory and Intel/Micron’s stackable PCM, according to Forward Insights. The 3D NAND industry emerged in 2007, when Toshiba unveiled its Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) technology. BiCs makes use of a “punch-and plug” structure and charge trap memory films. Toshiba has fabricated a prototype 32-Gbit BiCS flash memory test array with a 16-layer memory cell using 60nm design rules. In 2009, Samsung described its 3D NAND technology based on a terabit cell array transistor (TCAT). A year later, Macronix talked about a BE-SONOS charge-trapping technology. And Hynix is developing a 3D dual control-gate with a surrounding floating-gate. One of the newer candidates is the stackable phase-change memory (PCM) device from Intel and Micron. Micron recently announced a 2D PCM device based on a 45nm process. In PCM, it is difficult to scale the cell array. PCM is also limited by the power required to change from the crystalline to an amorphous state. Researchers are looking at new materials beyond traditional GST-225 schemes to overcome these limitations. Among those materials are binary and ternary alloys like germanium telluride (GeTe). “GeTe is one of the enablers,” said Jean-Luc Delcarri, general manager of Altatech, a CVD and inspection equipment subsidiary of Soitec. Altatech has installed its CVD system at CEA-Leti, which is developing PCM for the sub-20nm node. It’s unclear which 3D NAND devices will eventually move into production, but there is a huge appetite for NAND in mobile and other applications. “I can’t say which vendor is ahead,” Applied’s Lee said. “I think vertical NAND will likely be adopted in traditional applications. The biggest applications are smartphones, tablets and mobile computing. What is still to come are SSDs.” 3D NAND debate Analysts have slightly different viewpoints. “The only company that has told me a schedule is Toshiba, who plans to sample 3D NAND in 2013,” said Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective-Analysis, a research firm. “The thing that is driving (3D NAND) is the use for more bytes in video,” Handy said. “3D NAND is straightforward for a DRAM maker since it has stacked SiO2 and polysilicon layers like a stacked capacitor DRAM and trenches like a trench cell DRAM. I have heard that the aspect ratios for the trenches are somewhat tricky.” Greg Wong, an analyst with Forward Insights, does not see commercial production for 3D NAND until 2015 or so. “NAND flash manufacturers are pushing planar NAND flash to sub-20nm nodes. As they extend the roadmap for 2D NAND, the introduction of 3D NAND gets pushed out,” Wong said. “There are technical challenges with etching a high aspect ratio pillar and multiple stacks, but the big challenge is economic. The investment required is significantly more for 3D than 2D NAND,” Wong said. “3D NAND employing charge trapping technology will have some challenges in meeting the performance specifications of 2D NAND. However, by stacking multiple layers, lower cost per bit can be attained.” Alan Niebel, president of Web-Feet Research, agreed. “3D NAND should enter the market around 2015 (or after). Designing and qualifying 3D NAND will probably be a seven year process, which started in 2007. Concurrently, it takes easily another five years to perfect the manufacturing and especially in manufacturing 3D ICs,” Niebel said. “3D NAND should have a much higher areal density and lower cost than 2D NAND, since the F2 divides in half with each layer, probably four layers max per chip. Performance in both speeds (read and write) and endurance will deteriorate with 3D NAND compared to 2D,” he added. “The stacked structure will have more bits to address, more interconnects with each layer and longer distance from cell to controller that will add latency to the 3D. Perhaps endurance may not suffer too much if the lithography is the same for 2D and 3D NAND cells, but by stacking them in 3D, these additional steps could possibly fatigue the control gate oxides and further reduce endurance.” Besides the technology challenges, Applied’s Lee sees another hurdle—cost. “NAND vendors will go into 3D only if they can meet a cost target. We are quite confident the cost structure of 3D NAND will be lower than 2D NAND. The reason is that 3D NAND is less lithographic and double-patterning heavy,” he said.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354334710761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 23:05:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354334712750-161</Id><Topic><Title>Any thoughts?</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1354327903055</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 21:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why surround your post in quotes?... just curious.

Wouldnt be surprised to hear a Microsoft mea culpa-type announcement soon.</Msg><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1354336352735</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 23:32:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354336868081-163</Id><Topic><Title>Why ARM servers don't seem to be threatening...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1354256604568</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 01:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the case of X-gene - it's their own designed core. They'll still have to pay something to ARM but it'll be a tiny fraction of the SoC's selling price. Even in the case of an ARM designed core (such as with AMD) the total cost of the licence and royalty over the life of the product is still (typically) less than the cost of designing and building your own core. This is the beauty of the IP business model. ===================== From your first sentence above, it is evident Applied Micro has to spend on designing their own X-gene....even if it is their own designed core, it doesn't come free. They need to spend R&amp;D/Engineering dollars to design them....so they have costs...just like Intel. In addition, they have to incur IP costs to ARM, and fabrication costs to the foundries....and their respective margins. Whereas, Intel can mop it up from all 3 areas....IP, design, as well as fabrication. I really think that it is a stretch for ARM vendors to stay competitive a year or so down the road.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1354336868081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 23:41:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
