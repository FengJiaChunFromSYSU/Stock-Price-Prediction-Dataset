Apple does this because it is seen by so many of the same idiots as being the best. The best software--best hardware--Best look. Apple is in negotiations with Intel to get Intel to Fab chips for Apple phones and tablets as well as to get Intel to turn the top end X86 Intel chip into an Apple product for phones and tablets. Likely, Apple is threatening Intel now with this #$%$ about making their own Apple chips for Macs in a negotiation strategy. Intel of course just laughs and says take it or leave it. Our chips will be so so superior to any trash you can make using Arm design that we do not give a rat's if you do or do not. Because if you make your own, you will lose massive market share to phones that use our chips. The threat by Apple tells us that the two are likely getting close to a deal. Companies always threaten before the deal is signed. Intel at 30 the day the deal is announced and to 40 shortly there after.</Msg><Username>amdroadkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1352221812058</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 12:10:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352222052795-60</Id><Topic><Title>MIPS gets bought by ARMH ...</Title><Username>dale6el</Username><Timestamp>1352216709016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 10:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is also part of the patent buying consortium along with ARM foolDOTcom/investing/international/2012/11/06/arm-and-imagination-technologies-buy-mips-technolo.aspx</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1352222052795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 12:14:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352222308814-61</Id><Topic><Title>ANALYSTS SAY IF ROMNEY WINS STOCK MARKET WILL JUMP A LOT.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1352221809020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 12:10:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will, if only you will take your head out of my pocket!!!

Perhaps there is hope for us after all. DIVORCE AGREEMENT Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists and Obama supporters, et al: We have stuck together since the late 1950's for the sake of the kids, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course. Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way. Here is a model separation agreement: --Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes. --We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them. --You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. --Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military. --We'll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and you can go with wind, solar and biodiesel. --You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore and Rosie O'Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them. --We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart and Wall Street. --You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless, homeboys, hippies, druggies and illegal aliens. --We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's and rednecks. --We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood . --You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us. --You can have the peaceniks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security. --We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. --You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. but we will no longer be paying the bill. --We'll keep the SUV's, pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt and Leaf you can find. --You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors. --We'll continue to believe healthcare is a luxury and not a right. --We'll keep "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "The National Anthem." --I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute "Imagine", "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing", "Kum Ba Ya" or "We Are the World". --We'll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot. --Since it often so offends you, we'll keep our history, our name and our flag. Would you agree to this? If so, please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree, just hit delete. In the spirit of friendly parting, I'll bet you answer which one of us will need whose help in 15 years. Sincerely, John J. Wall Law Student and an American P.S. Also, please take Ted Turner, Sean Penn, Martin &amp; Charlie Sheen, Barbara Streisand, &amp; ( Hanoi ) Jane Fonda with you. P.S.S. And you won't have to press 1 for English when you call our country. Forward This Every Time You Get It ! Let's Keep This Going, Maybe Some Of It Will Start Sinking In!!

Fab plants now cost $8 billion each (versus $1 billion in 1993), but most of the cost is for equipment inside the fab (lithophographers at $20 million each and they need dozens of them). Only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics can compete with Intel on capex (you have to pay to play). Between them, they are spending upwards of $33 billion on capex. Intel is the only one at 22 nanometers and still they are pushing the envelope to get better performance with lower power consumption in their Merrifield chip for smartphones. Intel chips will be in 29 tablets this Christmas. Meanwhile, INTC investors receive a 4+% dividend yield. And Moore's Law will continue for a while longer. Applied Materials had the capability back in 1998 to make circuits at the 8 nanometer level (yeah, that's not a typo at 8). They are a couple of generations ahead of current production levels. There are more than 500 steps to making a wafer with chips on it and it takes more than a month to make one. If you really want to see what goes on in making a chip, see "Silicon Run Lite" from Silicon Run Productions. It's only a 30-minute film but the DVD costs $150. Every school district should have a copy to distribute to their science classes in their schools.</Msg><Username>hotstock13</Username><Timestamp>1352230267112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:31:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352230405311-95</Id><Title>So idiots vote today.</Title><Msg>I know--their count is equal but what kind of #$%$ lines up for hours to vote when he could have voted early?

If you really need to use a Windows 8 tablet that can run full Windows applications, and don’t need the higher performance of the Core processor, then you should be looking at the Atom Clover-Trail tablets from Samsung, Asus and Acer. I have used the ATIV Smart PC and can get about 10 hours of battery life with half brightness using to view web pages, Word documents, email and launching Metro apps for news. This is where the ATIV with the Atom processor gets a plus from me, runs all day with the ability to use my desktop application on the road, which is one thing you can’t do on an iPad or Android tablet. Not that I still wouldn’t use my Galaxy Note 10.1, but things might change for me .... The bezel around the tablet is wide enough that it allows you to hold it without having your fingers touch the screen and accidently scroll the screen. The screen resolution at 1366 x 768 might not be retina, but text, pictures and movies looks great. This is pretty much the same screen resolution as the MacBook Air 11.6-inch, but when I compare both, the ATIV Smart PC text looks much better and more readable compared the 11.6-inch MacBook Air. Also from my testing, the ATIV Smart PC is fanless, and after running several YouTube videos and running applications. The ATIV Smart PC was a bit warm but not hot at all. The Microsoft Surface Tablet actually gets a bit warmer than the ATIV Smart PC. Which did surprise me? I did expect having the Atom processor it would get pretty hot, but so far it hasn’t. This makes it again a great tablet to use in your hand when you need to sit back and enjoy some reading at home or office .... In comparison to the current iPad tablet, a 64GB iPad with no expansion slots, you would pay $699 plus $99 for a keyboard. The Samsung ATIV Smart PC with 64GB SSD storage and capable of using the microSD slot for an additional 64GB storage, a keyboard docking station with an internal battery to provide up to 16 hours of battery life can be purchased for $749.99, making the ATIV Smart PC a good buy for those that truly want to be mobile but yet have full Windows 8 with Metro apps as well.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1352232655458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 15:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352232669172-109</Id><Topic><Title>Why Apple is switching to ARM?</Title><Username>geobor2012</Username><Timestamp>1352170112535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 21:48:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's fixed costs are FAR higher than anybody else in the industry.

And they have their Merrifield chip for smartphones that has significant performance advantages over Samsung's own processors and others from Qualcomm, Nvidia and Broadcom. Intel is spending $12 billion in 2012, mostly for new equipment inside their existing fabs. You have to pay to play. The only ones that can compete with Intel are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics (all three are spending $33 billion on capex in 2012).

Why don't you go look one up before opening your mouth and proving you're a fool rather than just letting us suspect it. Also Intel has never truly been a monopoly in the x86 industry, when AMD brought out Athlon and Athlon 64 it caused a major shock to Intel prices, profits and marketshare. It recovered by outdesigning and outfabricating AMD which is exactly what it will do to all the ARM pretenders who covet its profits. AMD has been in Intel's palm ever since Core 2 Duo and it has skus as cheap as ARM now but which are still better performing yet still they have no effect on Intel's pricing. If AMD couldn't do it then ARM has no chance with relatively anemic designs like A15 and S4 which can't even beat Atom.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1352234380291</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 15:39:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352234884425-120</Id><Topic><Title>$50.00 ARM chips in MACs .

Don't Believe This Bogus Rumor</Title><Msg>Conclusion - Good Luck, Apple If Apple decides to try to become even more vertically integrated by designing its own high performance ARM microprocessor for the Mac products, then it will need a lot of R&amp;D expenditure and luck. It is a major business risk to migrate away from x86 in an environment that is so dependent on legacy applications, and an even further risk to try to go head-to-head with the world's largest and most competent chipmaker on its own turf. Apple has a lot of money that it could use to make this work, but it's unclear as to whether this would be the best use of shareholder cash. It would still need to pay ARM its license fee for the instruction set, and the fab would still need to get its cut (and given that none of the fabs actually need Apple's business, it is unlikely that they will give Apple any special deals). It is unclear how much of a gross margin savings Apple would get from such a move. On the bringing together iOS and MacOS thing, there is an easier way to unify the ecosystems without totally switching instruction sets and forcing recompiles of all existing applications. And there's no guarantee that an Apple-designed high performance CPU architecture would be good enough - or profitable enough - so as to justify the increasing R&amp;D costs associated with staying on the cutting edge of CPU designs. In any case, always be skeptical of these "rumors" from "unconfirmed" and "anonymous" sources - anybody can make up anything they want, and it is unwise to trade on fiction.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1352235080638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 15:51:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352235119202-123</Id><Title>Quiet Period!</Title><Msg>Why does INTC have a quiet period.

Below is a summary. We're just getting warmed up with testing Intel's new Clover Trail Atom Z2760 SoC, Windows 8 and the new Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T tablet. Over the next few days we'll be delving into our full review and showcase of the Samsung product and will look further into other performance characteristics of Intel's new tablet platform. For now, Clover Trail is impressive enough, in terms of general use performance, easily on par with what we've seen from Window RT devices driven by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 SoC. And that performance comes with the obvious added benefit of full X86 compatibility as well. Under certain test conditions, Clover Trail looks powerful but we need to spend a bit more time looking at graphics performance. The chip's on-board PoweVR SGX 545 GPU offers an interesting data point versus integrated graphics cores in both ARM-based architectures, as well as ultra low power integrated CPU/APU architectures. Where Clover Trail continues to feel a little pokey is with respect to memory bandwidth, though in practice and during regular use, the Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T was snappy, responsive and capable of anything you'd throw at it for a tablet usage model. Stay tuned as we hope to offer more insight into Clover Trail performance and take a look at battery life, in our full review, very soon.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1352250702447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 20:11:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352250789187-149</Id><Topic><Title>Initial Clovertrail review, extensive and good</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1352250702447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 20:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel Clover Trail Atom Z2760 Tablet Performance Preview Tuesday, November 06, 2012 - by Dave Altavilla in Gadgets</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1352250789187</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 20:13:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352250887508-150</Id><Topic><Title>Initial Clovertrail review, extensive and good</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1352250702447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 20:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was the BEST Sunspider speed of ANY device on the market.
