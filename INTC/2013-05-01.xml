"Intel Executive Vice President Dadi Perlmutter will...talk about Intel's next-generation Atom micro-architecture targeted at a range of market segments from low power tablets and smartphones, to microservers, the data center, and much more," Intel said in a statement Tuesday. The new Atom uses a higher-performance out-of-order design, just like Intel's mainstream Core processors, and uses a fast Intel graphics chip, also like its mainstream cousins. In other words, this is a very different creature from the Atom chip that's been around since 2008. And the new Atom will integrate up to four processing cores based on the company's 22-nanometer 3D transistor design -- all firsts for an Intel chip that's designed for tablets and small devices.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367381865062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 00:17:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367382041979-2</Id><Topic><Title>We learn more of Silvermont/Bay Trail next week - May 6</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367381865062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 00:17:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The following week May 16, we will be introduced to new Intel CEO.

For some strange reason, the new device has been nicknamed "Slippy," at least according to a few lines of Chromium code spotted by one Dinsan Francis. Additional specs are few and far between, although we do know the device, if it ever comes to market, also features an SD card slot along with two USB 3.0 ports. As previously discussed on TG Daily, Haswell is the long-awaited successor to Intel's Sandy and Ivy Bridge processors. The SoC is fabbed using an 22nm process, with Santa Clara expected to begin officially shipping Haswell CPUs this June, which just happens to coincide with Google's annual I/O conference. As you may recall, reports that Google was testing a Haswell-powered notebook first surfaced in March when ZDNet confirmed that Mountain View dev Stefan Reinauer had committed Haswell-related code changes to Coreboot, a fast boot open source BIOS replacement for Linux systems (Google Chrome OS vendor support was added to Coreboot last year). Indeed, Reinauer's new Haswell-related code commits last week included haswell: use dynamic cbmem and haswell boards: support added chromeos function. Intel claims that its next-gen 22nm chip - targeted at mobile devices - will offer double the battery life compared to devices using its third generation Ivy Bridge processors. If so, Chromebooks powered by Haswell will likely edge fairly close to the extended battery life boasted by Samsung's $250 ARM-based Chromebook.

The three-day annual conference, which typically assembles more than 5,000 developers, will begin May 15 in San Francisco with a three-hour keynote, according to the agenda released Tuesday evening. There will also be a host of satellite events, allowing developers around the world to view conference sessions and connect with other developers. Because the company uses the conference to make big announcements, the confab is always hotly-anticipated. Last year, Google demonstrated the next version of Android version 4.1 Jelly Bean and debuted Google Now, the Nexus 7 tablet, and Google Glass. Google has four sessions scheduled for Google Glass, its new high-tech eyewear, although Google cautions that more sessions may be added later. But the new products and announcements are only part of the appeal of Google I/O. Every year Google also gives away hundreds of dollars worth of equipment to every attendee, including last year's gift of the Nexus 7 tablet running the new Jelly Bean software. By far the biggest event at last year's conference was a live video of a team of skydivers jumping out of a plane and landing on top of San Francisco's Moscone Center. The whole experience was streamed live from the Google Glasses that the skydivers were wearing. It's possible that Google has it in mind to top last year's theatrics with the single, three-hour keynote.

Yes the while the future of computing with electrons is cresting on the horizon, there is a new sheriff in town that is in ways 2600 times better than silicon, a partnership or buyout? IMO at first it will be Electrons controlling light and then Light controlling light. I’ve been watching this for 8 years now and the last 2 or 3 I’ve been watching Intel and Lightwave Logic. I’m pretty sure I know where the main ingredient in that magic goo inside those new boxes is coming from and I think that is called Perkinamine Indigo. Why else would Fred Leonberger former JDSU CTO and Joe Miller Corning’s former CTO and Executive Vice President join this small company in Delaware. The next thing one has to ask himself is why did OpSiS a joint venture between Intel and the US Aif Force relocate 3,000 from the University of Washington to the University of Delaware which is where Lightaves Lab is located. Could it be a coincidence? Yes but I don’t think so. Good Luck, I posed it on here once I think it was 2 or 3 years ago, stay tuned.</Msg><Username>x993231</Username><Timestamp>1367406555028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 07:09:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367406804106-11</Id><Topic><Title>Optical computing, Silicon isn't enough</Title><Username>x993231</Username><Timestamp>1367406555028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 07:09:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh and for the research that we've done look at the Ihub board for LWLG this new format here is too hard to read so we moved over there a few months back.

The problem is that the only part of Intel worth keeping is manufacturing, and it takes special expertise to manage fabs. That's been Intel's problem all along - the fabs and manufacturing get all of the attention and product vision comes in second, so conservatism reigns. It's easy to understand how this happens when a new fab costs billions, but that sort of thinking would really mess up Apple. Look at what it's done to Intel. Missing mobile and tablets were stupid, inexcusable blunders. Thinking every computing problem on the planet can be solved by x86 architecture? Ridiculous.

I think their is only a 25% to 50% chance that they will even announce any changes for this year but if they do, I think it will be for the Nov. dividend. Historically, the BOD has announced a dividend increase some time before the dividend itself and its dates are announced. Looking at past dates when things happened, it seemed like the BOD announced an increase about a month before they announced the dividend. They do not seem to be rigidly bound to schedules.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367416187446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367416233162-24</Id><Title>Can't hold 24</Title><Msg>This isn't a good sign</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1367416233162</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:50:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367416253992-25</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Down Over a Buck</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366053080588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM Down Over a Buck It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.

Intel dominated PCs from the start, because IBM picked them. They didn't have to come from behind. Now Intel will have to be an absolutely compelling alternative to win in mobile, and that's very unlikely with x86 as a foundation. Maybe selling Intel to Apple isn't in the cards, but perhaps splitting Intel up, and creating a TSMC competitor and spinning out the clueless design group might work out for stockholders.

If you liked this thread, you will love the next 10 or 20 times he will post the same message. April is when Intel employees are reviewed and stock options are awarded. April is also the anniversary month when previous years options vest. The RSU options are awarded with a strike price of $0. When the options vest, Intel collects estimated taxes and moves the cost basis to the market price. Intel usually has to sell about 1/3 of the shares for estimated taxes. For every insider vesting option, you will see the award logged as an "option exercise" and then followed the next day by the SELL of the 1/3 tax shares. There are a couple of Intel insider sellers but nothing like you find on the QCOM or ARMH list.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367430564474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367430850779-157</Id><Title>INTC is going to lose a lot more than the price of the dividend, Remember to SAY OH NO down INTC goes</Title><Msg>INTC is going to lose a lot more than the price of the dividend, Remember to SAY OH NO down INTC goes</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367430850779</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367430975308-158</Id><Title>Apple picks AMD over Intel</Title><Msg>News will be coming out about Apple dumping Intel for AMD tech!</Msg><Username>sipx36</Username><Timestamp>1367430975308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:56:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367431164269-159</Id><Topic><Title>Apple picks AMD over Intel</Title><Username>sipx36</Username><Timestamp>1367430975308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:56:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get Off The DRUGS DIRTBAG!!</Msg><Username>bigcraigc</Username><Timestamp>1367431164269</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:59:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367431274004-160</Id><Topic><Title>I am short ARMH again</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367426138934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:35:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and therefore ARM is worth 1/5 of Intel. ?

ARMH says they have 980 licensees and are getting about 100 new licensees per year. ARMH says that their royalties are paid typically based on a % of the chip price. I imagine the newer licenses are for more modern CPU and are priced higher by ARMH. The newer CPU likely have higher volumes and are "priced" higher than the mature designs. I would expect that licenses (now 36%) are a decreasing component of ARMH revenue and royalties (now 53%) are an increasing portion of revenues. Just based on the design cycle lag between licensing and parts that affect royalties. ARMH says that their CAGR for licenses through 2020 is expected to be 15% and for royalties 22%. If ARMH gets the design wins that they expect and their customers ship the volumes that ARMH expects, their estimates seem to make sense when using their assumptions.. However: if there is overcapacity of ARMH CPU and/or price reductions, that will affect ARMH royalty revenues and CAGR negatively. If Intel takes design wins or if Intel offers their low end parts at a "other than value pricing", it could also affect ARMH forecasts. Innovative business model yields high margins  Upfront license fee – flexible licensing models  Ongoing royalties – typically based on a percentage of chip price</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367432660582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:24:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367432925351-167</Id><Topic><Title>I am short ARMH again</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367426138934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:35:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, not at all.

The newer CPU likely have higher volumes and are "priced" higher than the mature designs. ----- Yes, licenses are typically for newer CPU/GPU cores, but ARM have 'low end' cores as well (that go into microcontrollers and the like) which are much cheaper than the A class cores. The other thing to remember (which Ashraf forgets) is that as well as 'soft' IP such as CPU's, GPU's ARM also ship 'hard' IP and this is one of the reasons why the royalty per chip is increasing at 28nm and below.

The Web usage numbers are in: Windows RT can't get any traction, and Lenovo doesn't believe RT 'is what businesses want' By Woody Leonhard Microsoft insists that Windows RT has a grand and glorious future. But if the accumulated Web usage statistics from the past six months can be trusted (always a dicey proposition), the operating system doesn't even have a pulse. Adding insult to injury, Lenovo's Think PC and visual category manager says he doesn't believe Windows RT "is what businesses want." Looks like consumers don't want it either. I don't trust Net Marketshare's usage numbers, and neither should you. That said, it's hard to go below zero -- which is exactly where Windows RT's Internet usage share sits six months after it was released, according to Net Marketshare. Windows 8 pulls in a less than resounding 3.82 percent (I personally apologize for adding to that count), Windows 8 Touch rates an almost imperceptible and unmeasurable 0.02 percent, and Windows RT gets a big goose egg. Mac fans will note that OS X 10 -- all versions in total -- runs 6.98 percent. Even lowly Vista draws 4.75 percent, considerably more than Windows 8. Microsoft hasn't bothered to release any recent sales figures for Windows 8, much less Windows RT, but both products' fates seem pretty clear. Patrick Budmar at PC World quotes Lenovo's Think PC and visual category manager Simon Kent as saying, "Even Microsoft has started to review the RT path they have gone down." infoworldDOTcom/t/microsoft-windows/windows-rt-who-loves-ya-baby-217708</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1367436459997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367436674245-186</Id><Title>Extremely Cheap Tech Stock Ready for Lift Off Starting Tomorrow</Title><Msg>This extremely undervalued stock is ready for lift off starting tomorrow: CCUR, currently $7.04 per share - they just signed a major Time Warner Cable (TWC) multi-screen CDN deal and another with Virgin Media (VMED). TWC is the #2 largest cable TV operator in the US and VMED is the #1 in the UK! CCUR's breakthrough technology is allowing them to expand their VOD capacity from a central location and deliver VOD and live TV services to tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices over their new IP networks! CCUR just reported last night 3Q revenues of $16.9 million their highest in two full years. CCUR beat analyst revenue estimates of $16.3 million. CCUR also reported GAAP EPS of $0.11, beating analyst estimates of $0.09. CCUR's GAAP EPS has been exploding on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02 to $0.04 to $0.08 and now $0.11. On a non-GAAP basis excluding non-cash amortization and share-based compensation, CCUR has trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 up from $0.35 after their 2Q results in January. CCUR's trailing non-GAAP EPS is expected to rise to $0.50 for its full fiscal year of 2013 ending June 30th, 2013. CCUR's closest video software rivals HLIT and SEAC currently have P/Es of 25, which would value CCUR today at $10.75 based on its current non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 and also $12.50 based on its estimated year-end non-GAAP EPS of $0.50! CCUR has positive fundamental momentum and is growing, unlike HLIT and SEAC. CCUR truly deserves a P/E of 30 and it would value CCUR at $15 per share very soon based on estimated fiscal full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS of $0.50!</Msg><Username>jtdmnf533</Username><Timestamp>1367436674245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:31:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367436850558-187</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT doesn't even have a pulse...</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1367436459997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Though the article is overall negative on Windows 8, I think that can be safely ignored for now - Windows uptake is always slow and there will be a hockey stick growth after the first 2 or 3 quarters.

Consistent with Microsemi's strategy, this agreement signed in January 2013 will leverage the company's comprehensive technology portfolio into higher-performance, higher-dollar value opportunities. Intel's Tri-Gate transistors provide an unprecedented combination of performance and power efficiency, enabling Microsemi to develop digital ICs for high-performance computing, network acceleration and signal processing applications. Microsemi is currently engaged with customers and has started designs utilizing Intel's 22nm process node with product delivery anticipated to begin in late 2014 to early 2015. "The high-value applications we address require semiconductor solutions with unique performance and complex functional attributes," said Paul Pickle, executive vice president of Microsemi's Integrated Circuits group. "Using Intel's innovative process technology and silicon-proven IP will enable us to expand our opportunity in the markets we serve with higher-performance, lower-power digital ICs for the communications and defense markets." "Intel is pleased to manufacture Microsemi's digital IC solutions utilizing Intel's leading 22nm process technology and IP solutions," said Sunit Rikhi, vice president, Technology and Manufacturing Group, Intel. wsj</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367448439060</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:47:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367448522071-222</Id><Topic><Title>Microsemi Selects Intel Corporation Foundry Services</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367448439060</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:47:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreement was signed in January.

Silvermont is the biggest Atom redesign since Intel introduced the first Atom chips back in 2008. Silvermont uses a new Out-of-Order design like Intel’s Core series processors. It also has new graphics and it will be manufactured in 22nm. It looks promising to say the least and it should allow Intel to step up its game in the tablet space. *** Google I/O Developers Conference May 15-17, 2013 Moscone Center, San Francisco Look for joint Intel/Google announcements. *** Intel to release Haswell on June 3rd The processors will drop on Monday 3 June - a day ahead of the official opening of Computex. Haswell is the successor to Ivy Bridge. Ideal for Ultrabooks because it's designed to offer significant power savings, Haswell is a new architecture that will be built on the same 22nm process as Ivy Bridge. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum in Bejing, Kirk Skaugen, general manager of the PC client group at Intel, said Haswell would feature double the graphics performance of Ivy Bridge, claiming it offered "the same visual experience and gameplay as a discrete graphics card that users would otherwise have to add separately". *** Computex on June 4th COMPUTEX TAIPEI has become the largest computer exhibition in Asia and the second largest in the world, next to CeBIT in Germany. Each year, key global businesses come to this event to launch their new products. Since a large portion of the businesses in the world have research and deployment centers or production facilities in Taiwan, this exhibition attracts observers, analysts, and journalists of computer and information industries from all over the world to discover and report the latest technologies, developments, and trends.

Its new deal with Intel might help a bit in the latter department. The Southern California company on Wednesday became the fifth to disclose that it will make use of Intel’s newest major business–manufacturing chips for others, rather than reserving its factories for products designed internally. Microsemi, at first glance, might seen an odd customer for the new manufacturing service. The company has been largely known in the past for what the industry calls “mixed-signal” chips, which means those that combine analog and digital technologies. Such products rarely need the kind of advanced digital transistors that are Intel’s specialty. But Microsemi has been broadening its portfolio, largely through acquisitions. In 2010, for example, it announced a $430 million deal to buy Actel, a Silicon Valley company known for programmable chips called FPGAs that had a history of selling them to military aerospace customers. FPGAs need lots of transistors, something Intel is well-positioned to deliver by beating rivals to market with a production process that can create circuitry measured at just 22 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Three of the other four announced customers for what Intel calls its foundry service–Altera, Tabula and Achronix–all make FPGAs or comparable products. Netronome, the fourth, makes a networking chip called a flow processor.
