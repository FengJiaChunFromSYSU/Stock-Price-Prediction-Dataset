We own 1,000 shares of SPY. I lost my job and have been out of work for over two years. Wife couldn't take the stress and left with the kids and her cat, she left me the dog. We bought these shares around the high and are down quite a bit. The lawyer says all the stocks have to be sold and the cash split up. Why can't we just settle for the market value of the shares and split them up that way? I guess we can both carry the losses on future taxes. This is going to be fun on the house. We owe a lot more than it's worth. I didn't want the stupid thing anyway, it was her idea. That's probably what ruined our marriage, we couldn't afford the mortage, taxes and insurance.

Citing unnamed news sources and local analysts, China Post reports that Acer is planning to hold a launch party for the 8-inch Iconia W3 tablet in New York on May 3, an event which it says will also see CEO Wang Jeng-tang and corporate president Jim Wong introduce Intel’s Haswell chipset (the successor to the Ivy Bridge CPU) and other new Acer products. The source adds that the Iconia W3 is likely to appear at the Computex exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan this June while Singapore-based tech website, The Tech Revolutionist, claims that the model could hit retail stores in September. Purported photos and specs leaked on the Iconia W3 earlier this week, with French-language website Minimachines reporting that the Windows 8 tablet has a 1.8GHz dual-core Atom Z2760, 2GB of RAM and front and rear cameras. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi admits that she was unaware of an upcoming launch for Acer's latest tablet addition, but says that a forthcoming announcement would make sense -- so long as the model is priced to compete with Android. “It seems to make sense given the new support for smaller form factors that Windows Blue will allow," said Milanesi. "From a price point [of view], anything over $399 would not work. Ideally, they should match the $199 Android [starting] price but that would be hard, so $299 to $349 is where I think they should come in.” Acer refused to comment on the speculation and emailed TabTimes to say that it “doesn’t comment on unannounced products”. Adding further to the intrigue and China Post, which is a reputable source for news (if not necessarily tablet rumors) in the country, says that Acer and Asus are among the manufacturers preparing to release new low-end Android tablets later in 2013.

However, the rally ended almost exactly where it should have. Both the Russell 2000 and the DJ Transportation index rebounded up to their respective down trendline started in mid March, while the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ rallied to near their record highs. This week's rally didn't change the longer term technical picture as long term MACDs of the major indexes continued to move lower. In addition, since they reached a recent high in mid March, the RSIs of the major indexes have been in a downtrend. This week's rally didn't change that picture. All these technical indicators are saying that the market is still in the downtrend started in mid March. It will likely take an S&amp;P breakout to a new high to suggest a trend change.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1367053578888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 05:06:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367064191479-12</Id><Topic><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1367053578888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 05:06:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Click, on stew's name and look at his history.

The volume was normal through the close and then ended at 115m shares. The end-of-session total volume versus the 115m share total indicates that something happened with about 70m shares. It had to be part of the normal trading volume procedure to be included. I doubt that this accounts for 69m shares, BUT ... I got several SEC document alerts yesterday. They were SEC Form 4 filings where Intel insider transactions were signaled. After looking at the April date and the first couple filings, these Form 4 appear to be the annual RSU stock option vesting tax and transfer of ownership. Intel employees get their annual reviews and salary adjustments in mid-April. April then becomes the anniversary of those past salary reviews. Stock options awarded to the employees vest in 25% chunks on the anniversary of the awards. When the options vest, about 1/3 of the shares are sold to pay the income taxes on $0 awarded shares to bring the cost basis up to the market price. The remain 2/3 shares of the vested portion are transferred to the employees. I think that Intel uses UBS to handle the stock transactions. If you look at past year, there seems to be a couple days in mid-April that have spikes in volume that look like these transaction. IMO, it has something to do with employee (not just "insiders" but all employees) compensation. Intel as a company has always shared the successes AND the failures with the employees.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367071814726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367072324845-21</Id><Title>Should Intel Change Strategies?</Title><Msg>Article from Motley Fool that I actually agree with: "Although Intel earns a higher gross profit margin than TSMC, by the time it reaches the bottom line, Intel is about 42% less profitable than TSMC.

Xilinx is a fierce competitor on all fronts: financial, marketing, sales, technology, ecosystem, etc… so there is no way Altera can outrun Xilinx on a level playing field. TSMC is open to all customers and does not do exclusive partnerships so Intel was a smart choice for Altera. The question is: Can Intel be a good foundry partner for Altera? My guess is yes they can, as long as the new Intel CEO is on board with it and Altera does not need ARM (ARM and Intel do NOT mix). Not great news for Intel’s other FPGA partners though (Achronix and Tabula).

The added advantage is that QCOM works with multiple foundries so they have a much larger knowledge base than a traditional semiconductor company or a fabless company that only uses one foundry. Also, as one the larger purchasers of IP and EDA tools, every vendor bends over backwards for QCOm with custom IP, tools and flows. These custom tools and flows can then be sold to the rest of the fabless semiconductor companies. If you design a tool or IP for Intel or Samsung it can only be used by Intel or Samsung. Just my opinion of course.</Msg><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367074039608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:47:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367075720867-28</Id><Topic><Title>Should Intel Change Strategies?</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367072324845</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you are saying to go Long or stay Long at ARMH 45 and QCOM 62.

His group taped out a 20 nm test chip in April 2012 that showed working MIPI, PCI Express and USB interfaces using double patterning. A follow up 14 nm chip was a simpler device mainly focused on memory, and has not yet come back from the fab. “The design parameters for FinFETs are very different from those of the planar nodes,” Kunkel said. "The differences between the various FinFET processes available from the foundries today are significant enough that we have to start over [with IP development] each time," he said. "Also, most FinFET processes and design kits are still in the development phase, adding to the effort," he added.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1367078282957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 11:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367079934794-36</Id><Topic><Title>Should Intel Change Strategies?</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367072324845</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought the fabless ecosystem existed because the cost of the "next fab" became too expensive for them to individually afford.

So, it's a non-starter. There is no dynamic currently in place to draw more ARM foundries into existence and many to reduce the number further although at 3 there is not much room for shrinkage. LOL Without a quick move to 20nm and then 14nm FinFET, TSMC is in danger of being the next ARM foundry to drop by the wayside. That would leave just Samsung (don't even bother to talk about GloFo). So, it's not that difficult to see a scenario whereby Intel is the only fabrication choice left. Which then answers the question of why Intel built all that capacity. FinFET is going to separate the men from the boys. Without a smooth and quick move to FinFET, the ARM foundry world is toast. And unless Intel agrees to fab ARM chips (unlikely), the ARM world would then be toast except for the low-end of the market. Welcome to AMD's world, ARM. No one seems to realize that ARM is betting its existence on rapid evolution of a FinFET capability.

P/E ratio. A P/E ratio of 15 would get Intel to 30 instantly. A P/E ratio of 16 would get the stock price to 32. And a P/E of 17 would get the stock to 34. It would take a P/E of 20 to get the stock to 40 by itself. A little too much to hope for until we hear that Intel smartphone sales are doubling each quarter like is currently happening with tablet sales. I don't see 15 being unreasonable at all with Haswell, Bay Trail and tablet sales doubling each quarter. 2.) Increased capacity use. Intel easily has the capacity to generate revenues and profits that would support a stock price of 40. We have already seen some big foundry deals and will likely see more. ARM's fabrication struggles at 20nm and with FinFET will dramatically increase interest in Intel's foundry capabilities. We already know of a major mobility player deal that has yet to be announced in addition to the Cisco deal. It is likely that there are many deals being currently negotiated. 3.) Increased mobility sales. The trend in tablets is obviously going to be a major driver of increased profitability going forward. The trend in smartphones and LTE will lag a bit but should be very much in evidence by the end of the year. 4.) Dropping Intel tablet ASPs. As Otellini noted in the earnings conference call, Intel will be able through new fabrication to offer tablets at some amazing price points. This should pave the way to big volumes as Intel makes major inroads into ARM tablet market share. 5.) 450mm Wafer Production. Intel is going to be first to 450mm wafers by a significant margin. This will provide an important new layer of improved economics that will reduce Intel's costs just as ARM is experiencing worsening economics and lessening performance improvements at 20nm. Let's not forget that 20nm is planar and doesn't offer the benefits of FinFET.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367097361556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367098102360-63</Id><Topic><Title>How Intel Gets to 40</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367097361556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:16:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not that tough to figure out how Intel might get to 40: (continued) 6.)

The Wintel ecosystem continues to work its way from servers and desktops down to smartphones. The extension of the ecosystem down should boost revenues and profits. And while it's early on, I think Intel's web TV venture will get traction.

But it's trying to change that in a hurry. Enter Google. The fact that Microsoft and Intel no longer rule the personal computing world isn't news. But what happens next is. I'll start with a flashback from the early '90s. I remember attending the launch of Windows 3.1 when I lived in Japan. Kazuhiko Nishi, former friend and business partner of Bill Gates, made a statement that foretold the fate of the Japanese PC industry as well as the global PC market. I'm paraphrasing, but he said Microsoft was the chassis and Intel the engine of the personal computer. The point, of course, was that the two companies controlled the Windows PC and, as a consequence, controlled the digital computing world. That was then. Today, Intel needs to be the engine powering the non-Windows world. That's where the explosive growth is. So Intel is turning to Google. I've been hearing from sources at Intel for a long time that Android is the future. And Intel said as much to CNET this week. Expect to see Intel-based Android laptops and hybrids priced between, let's say, $200 to $500 in the coming months. (Likely, at first, from companies such as erstwhile Netbook vendors Asus and Acer.) But those aren't the only newfangled devices you'll see. Intel's Communications Group is also pushing hard into Android phones. The Lenovo K800 and Motorola RAZR I, and phonelike devices such as the Asus FonePad, come to mind. Intel will continue to expand this business in developing countries. And Intel-powered Android tablets are also in the cards. If you don't think that's possible, just look at all of the Intel-Android tablets being sold in China. Then there's the Chromebook. Intel is inside most of these, including the Chromebook Pixel, Acer C7, and HP Pavilion Chromebook. The question, of course, is how successful Intel can be when it's not calling the shots with Microsoft. I'll be watching carefully in the next 12 months.

Altera. I very much regret Altera's decision to work on the 14-nanometer with Intel even though the financial impact is relatively small and Altera remains a major and valued partner of TSMC's. We have gained many customers in the last few years but I really hate to lose even a part of an old one. We want them all, really. I regret it and because of this, we have thoroughly critiqued ourselves. If there was a thing like an investigative commission on what happened, we had it. And there were, in fact, many reasons why it happened and we have taken them to heart. And it's a lesson to us and I don't think that we -- at least, we'll try our very best not to let similar kinds of things happen again. Now -- but I just want to emphasize that Altera remains a major and valued partner of ours and I say this with Altera's concurrence. Now Intel as a competitor. I noted Intel's yesterday's analyst call, in which they said they have now gone from crawl to walk and then will go on to run and that's all very beautiful in metaphor. And then they also raised several conditions or several criteria -- 3 criteria but there's really nothing new in those and they have said those before. And I still view Intel as a selective picker among customers. As a foundry competitor, they will pick their targets and so on. And I don't view them as a general competitor because they have already said, through the 3 criteria that they used, they have already said themselves that they will not be a general or front [indiscernible] competitor. But they are a very serious competitor to our customers. I mean that, really, I would say, applies even greater pressure on us than they as -- than Intel as a direct foundry competitor. They are a very serious competitor to our customers. Our customers rely on us. That is very serious pressure and we respond to that pressure, of course. We respond to that pressure.

Xilinx was the first. From the article: A Brief History of Field Programmable Devices (FPGAs) "It is a familiar Silicon Valley story, Xilinx co-founder Ross Freeman wanted to create a blank semiconductor device that could be quickly programmed based on an application’s requirements. Even back then semiconductors cost millions of dollars to design and manufacture so this was not only a cost savings, FPGAs also dramatically reduced time to market for electronic products. Fortunately for us, Ross’s employer Zilog did not share this vision and Xilinx was created in 1984." "To minimize start-up costs and risk, the Xilinx founders decided to leverage personal relationships with Japan based Seiko Epson Semiconductor Division. Seiko started manufacturing the first FPGAs for Xilinx in 1985 using a very mature 1.2m process. The first Xilinx FPGA was a 1,000 ASIC gate equivalent running at 18MHZ. Xilinx also pioneered second sourcing for the fabless semiconductor market segments using multiple IDMs for manufacturing to keep costs and risks in check. One of the more notable second sources was AMD who’s CEO at that time, Jerry Sanders, made the infamous statement “Real men have fabs!” AMD is now fabless of course."</Msg><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367113519384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 21:45:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367113816678-84</Id><Topic><Title>Should Intel Change Strategies?</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1367072324845</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GLOBALFOUNDRIES has 14nm and 10nm in development.

It used to be 2 years per node and in the case of 16-nanometers FinFET, it follows just 1 year, by 1 year, the 20 SoC. So it is a quickening of cadence and that is because of market request, market requirements, customers' requests. Compared with the 20-nanometers, the 16 FinFET has same metal pitch but tighter front-end FinFET design rules. The reason we can introduce it so quickly after the 20 is because the 16 FinFET can leverage the learning from 20-nanometers in interconnect and in double patterning. The yield improvement of the 16 FinFET is ahead of schedule. It is on track to begin volume production within 1 year from 20-nanometers. -------------------------- Steven C. Pelayo - HSBC, Research Division What quarter will be the first few percentage of revenues will come from 20-nanometer for TSMC?

Apple doesn't have FinFET? Apple has already taped-out the A7 on TSMC 20nm. They will tape-out a FinFET version by the end of the year. Same with QCOM and a dozen others. I keynoted a conference on FinFETs last week. I'm involved in FinFET PDKs. There are 100+ articles about FinFETs on SemiWiki. How about asking questions instead of posting obvious disinformation?" [Nenni, there you go again - trying to deceive everyone by pretending that a tape-out is the same as volume production. It isn't and you know it. It isn't a guarantee of volume production and it isn't a guarantee of any particular time frame before volume production starts. It's a tape-out. That's all. So, here's some questions for you:] [What was the time lapse between the first 28nm tape-out and volume production? And by the way, when will any of the ARM foundries reach volume production on 28nm because they haven't yet.] [If ARM foundries haven't yet reached volume production on 28nm, how silly is it to suggest that 20nm will be done more quickly or even just as quickly?] [If ARM foundries have to have 20nm to do the half-step to 14nm and they don't have 20nm production yet and won't until 2014 or 2015, then how silly is it to suggest they will have the half-step to 14nm in any time frame?] [And a couple of statements: Having FinFET means selling products using it. Apple doesn't have FinFET. Apple won't have FinFET for years and years and years. So, stop with the silly tape-out delusions of being equivalent to volume production...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367120979634</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 23:49:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
