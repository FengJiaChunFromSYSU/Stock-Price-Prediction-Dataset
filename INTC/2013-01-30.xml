The patch is 300MB and has started its distribution in France, though it is expected to push out across Europe and the UK soon. Naturally it includes all the great improvements made over the already excellent 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) build, which means you get generally faster performance, the Google Now notifications service and Project Butter’s optimisations to make touch responsiveness silky smooth. ........ Users in France are reporting performance improvements but it’s not known what changes have been made to the Motorola launcher. The build has been described as ‘much more fluid’ and ‘prettier’, with some applications launching faster than before. Meanwhile for the camera the panoramic shooting mode’s interface has apparently been altered. Performance with Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 on Intel’s single-core 2GHz Atom processor was already very impressive and makes a compelling argument against the necessity of multi-core in the ongoing ‘core wars’ debate. If Jelly Bean has improved performance further that’ll be quite the thing to see. knowyourmobileDOTcom</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359556103673</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:28:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359556597603-30</Id><Topic><Title>Romit, Romit, where art thou Romit ?</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359479015491</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 12:03:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"CONCOLES ARE USING THE AMD CPU AND APU" The information that I can find says that they are using the AMD ATI GPU only and not the CPU. AMD has laid of a large portion of their company so their costs are down but their future prospects are dimmed too. I think that the reason that AMD announced they would do ARM is in preparation to sell the company. Congrats on the GPU win but the outlook for AMD is bleak. Wii U CPU "The Wii U CPU is made by IBM, based on its PowerPC CPU architecture, with all new instructions and features tailored for the Wii U system. The IBM Wii U CPU is made at 45nm and is based on the POWER7 architecture, which supports from 4 to 8 cores and 2-4 MB of L3 cache, although there are versions of the CPU with as much as 32 MB of cache. Nintendo has been rumored to use a scaled down CPU with just 3 cores @ 3 GHz, in order to keep power consumption low.

The extra volumes (IMO) is a dividend arbitraging exercise that I am trying to figure out. Watch the option trading volumes, especially in the near months and deep out of the money. In general, I think there is some combination that depends on buying ITM calls and exercising them before ex-dividend and then having some way to lock in an exit price to arbitrage the dividend. The guy in the middle is the option market maker who has to price his put/call option position for both before and after ex-dividend and has to also be prepared for someone not going for the dividend but making him eat options when he prices the options the other way.

Notice the words "associated" and "image". This is all about feelings with no facts. There are a lot of ways to measure this, but my "perception" is that INTC has always had a better ratio of UTILITY as defined as work done divided by power consumed. INTC simply didn't make chips that did very little, but used little power. They didn't try to make chips that used little enough power to be acceptable for cell phones. Now INTC has redefined UTILITY. They make chips that do vast amounts of work, but consume so little power that they now are the preferred CPU for high-function, battery-operated devices such as smart phones. They are also making low-function chips that beat the ARMH community UTILTIY at the very low end. ARMH is running out of niches. Just about all they have left are feelings and perceptions.

Fitch Ratings Cuts AMD by Three Notches, Seeing Cash Dwindling Font size: A | A | A 3:10 PM ET 1/30/13 | Dow Jones By Kristin Jones Fitch Ratings downgraded Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) rating three notches deeper into junk territory, as it expects the chip maker's cash to continue to dwindle this year. Fitch cut AMD's long-term issuer default rating to triple-C, eight notches into junk. "The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that negative free cash flow...in 2013 will drive cash below AMD's target level and potentially approach the company's minimum operating level," the firm said. Looking beyond the current year, AMD will need a strong end-market recovery and adoption of its new products in order to preserve cash during its turnaround efforts, Fitch said. Earlier this month, AMD reported a wider fourth-quarter loss, reflecting moves to cut costs and modify a manufacturing partnership along with weak demand for personal computers that use its chips. AMD competes with Intel Corp. (INTC) in the market for microprocessors and also sells graphics chips used in PCs and videogame consoles. The company in mid-October announced a restructuring that included a 15% cut in its workforce. Fitch expects revenue to decline by a mid- to high-teen rate in 2013, saying weak consumer spending, the growing popularity of tablets and excess inventory would continue to pressure sales. Strong sales of its new products could restore AMD's revenue growth in the second half of the year, the firm believes. The ratings agency expects AMD's profits to be lower in 2013, even as the chip maker uses its cash to make payments to supplier Globalfoundries Inc. as part of a deal to reduce its purchases of processed semiconductor wafers.</Msg><Username>dkeller1970</Username><Timestamp>1359577662105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:27:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359578421683-74</Id><Topic><Title>Guess what Obama's 2013 recession has started , Higher taxes in Q1 will also cause negative GDP</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359574562707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:36:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>recession has started , Negative GDP is a bad thing</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359578421683</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:40:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359578846323-75</Id><Topic><Title>Guess what Obama's 2013 recession has started , Higher taxes in Q1 will also cause negative GDP</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359574562707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:36:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nuff, do you think your comments have an effect on anything?

It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.

Fitch, the debt ratings agency, just sent word that it has downgraded AMD’s long-term debt to CCC from a B. For context, a B rating indicates debt that is considered two notches below investment grade, while CCC is three notches below. A company rated CCC, according to Fitch’s terminology, is considered “currently vulnerable and dependent on favorable economic conditions to meet its commitments.” Specifically, Fitch says it expects AMD’s free cash flow to turn negative and reach a level below AMD’s targets, and it might even go so low as to “potentially approach the company’s minimum operating level.”" From All Things D</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359592865248</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 19:41:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359595616953-94</Id><Title>pray big time open bust intel up24.00</Title><Msg>ok</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359595616953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:26:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359597000649-95</Id><Topic><Title>Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update for Motorola Razr i now live - Improved performance all around</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359556103673</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:28:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I had switched from iPhone 3 to SG II Skyrocket a year back. Screen size is what I liked (don't need a separate tablet) and the display is nice. However, when it got upgraded from Android 2.3 to ICS 4.0, the performance went down. It became less responsive. Recently, I got it replaced by another refurbished piece under warranty for some other reasons. However, performance is no better than previous phone. Battery life had got annoyingly worse on the old piece, and no better with the replacement piece. So I think it is not a particular piece specific issue, but general issue with the model, and possibly with the underlying ARM processor. As the processor is subjected to increasing performance demand, ARM processors can't keep up without consuming more power. I am surprised (rather not surprised) that the mainstream media is silent about this, either purposefully or unknowingly. The media is replaying the same 2-3 years old tape again and again. Ofcourse ARM camp has come up with more powerfull, more efficient processors since then. But I believe ARM dosn't hold general power efficieny advantage over Intel. Intel not gaining traction in mobile markets (or moving slowly) - I think this has something to do with strategic decision making, marketing and PR skill's of Intel management. Hope new management will overcome these shortcomings.</Msg><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1359597000649</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:50:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359598354941-96</Id><Topic><Title>It is funny watching the GOP completely surrender to Obummer.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359561258938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:54:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's your cost basis on INTC, Bush-for-Brains?
