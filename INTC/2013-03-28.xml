Although the PC supply chain had pushed the Windows on ARM (WoA) platform aggressively, the Windows RT's name, which has misled most consumers into believing that the operating system is able to support all existing x86 Windows programs, the lack of apps, as well as compatibility issues have all significantly damaged demand. The next-generation of Windows is expected to make its first appearance at the Microsoft Build Developer Conference 2013, hosted from June 26-28 in San Francisco, the US. The sources believe that Wintel PC demand is likely to drop significantly before Intel and Microsoft's next-generation products show up in the second half of the year. digitimesDOTcom/news/a20130327PD216.html</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364470547163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 07:35:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364470771208-15</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft to merge Windows RT into next-generation Windows OS</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364470547163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 07:35:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One thing is clear: Ballmer is destroying that company.</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1364470771208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 07:39:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364470863393-16</Id><Title>What is INTC up to?</Title><Msg>Chatter about set top boxes.

The new Atom, codenamed Bay Trail, is a SoC solution and is the most powerful Atom to date. Intel promises double the performance of current generation Intel based tablets. Intel also revealed that the new platform should hit the market this holiday season, with Windows or Android, and can deliver all-day battery life, weekends of standby and all that in sleek 8mm thin designs. We also learned that this 22nm quad core processor should debut between August and October 2013, ready to ship before the holiday season, in Q4 2013. The tablet part is simply called Bay Trail-T but so far we lack any frequencies or concrete performance details. Intel is having limited success with the current generation of Atom tablets, but it is continuously getting better. The plan is to make two kinds of tablets one with Bay Trail-T and one with Atom Z2760 dual core Clovertrail 32nm inside and more powerful with Bar-Trail T a 22nm quad-core that might end up as fast as 2GHz. The main competitor for both ARM and Intel in tablet space is the amazing success of Apple’s iPad, which still dominates the market, making it very hard to conquer. Intel on the other hand aims for the first 22nm quad core processor for tablets, at a time when the ARM based competition, including Apple, relies on 28nm manufacturing. fudzillaDOTcom/home/item/30906-bay-trail-quad-22nm-atom-in-q3-13</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364477166942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:26:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364477319335-20</Id><Title>One-chip Haswell ULT aims for 8- to 10-hour battery life</Title><Msg>Tablets and Ultrabook friendly SoC We managed to get a few more details about Intel’s one-chip Haswell platform that people internally also call Haswell ULT. ULT means that the part operates on ultra-low voltage and is quite self-explanatory. The main difference between one-chip and two-chip Haswell mobile CPUs is that the one chip part has the Lynx point LP PCH chipset inside of the CPU package. One can view this chip as a SoC (System on chip) and it will come in BGA package. Intel also referred to this chip as part of its Y-processor line of products, with a 11.5W maximum TDP and scenario design power of 7.5W. This is quite exceptional considering that this is the TDP of the complete SoC. In contrast, the Ivy Bridge Y-processor line had a 13W TDP (7W SDP), and that was only the CPU. The point of having a BGA package and making a SoC is to lower the production cost, lower TDP and footprint. Haswell ULT is the chip meant for Ultrabooks and tablets where footprint, TDP and lower cost play a key role. This is probably why Intel plans to further drop the Haswell Ultrabooks pricing, as mentioned here. Intel promises eight to ten hours of endurance with Haswell ULT based tablets and the lowest TDP we saw in Intel’s future plans was 15W, but maybe Intel can go even lower in the future. The plan is to see some of these Haswell ULT devices in Q4 2013 and onwards, while Ultrabook U-series parts will show up one quarter earlier. fudzillaDOTcom/home/item/30904-one-chip-haswell-ult-aims-for-8-to-10-hour-battery-life</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364477319335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:28:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364478048665-21</Id><Topic><Title>How can this news be anything less than DEVESTATING for Intel, if true?</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364475404639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 08:56:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Partnered with Google and Motorolla and STILL can't get in U.S. phones by the end of 2013?

To win the tablet market Intel first needed to make SoCs competitive with ARM on speed, battery life and price. It appears Clovertrail+ does this. Baytrail does it even better. But once the "good enough" x86 SoC is in place the battle for the consumer becomes the OS and the software ecosystem available to the tablet owner. The software ecosystem(s) bounds the ROI for the buyer. The ability to run Windows, Android, Tizen, Ubuntu Touch, etc is vastly more useful and productive to the buyer than having a device limited to just one OS. As impressive as the Intel's new Haswell-class processors are, the common distinction that separates all x86 based devices from ARM is its software versatility and consumers don't need to understand technology to appreciate that.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364484519694</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 11:28:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364484607091-47</Id><Topic><Title>How can this news be anything less than DEVESTATING for Intel, if true?</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364475404639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 08:56:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why Intel could be the company to finally crack internet TV Everyone else has tried, now it's the chipmaker's turn By Tim Carmodyon February 18, 2013 10:35 am "The fact that Intel doesn't by and large work in media could be a handicap, but if you stop to reconsider, it potentially gives Intel a huge advantage. Think about it: how was Google ever going to make a deal with Viacom when Viacom was suing Google? How were companies like Google or Yahoo built on selling advertising ever going to meaningfully share data and revenue with other companies built on advertising like TV networks? How were Sony or Samsung ever going to create a smart TV platform large enough to compete with cable when their businesses depended on selling giant multithousand-dollar screens that were only updated every few years? How would Apple, or Microsoft, or Amazon, or Netflix create new deals for live TV with networks when they already had huge businesses in selling digital video in completely different formats?" "Intel has no conflicts of interest with television; it has no strategy taxes. All it has are years of R&amp;D into hardware for the connected home, a solid history of developing hardware standards and prototypes, and many, many chips built for graphics-intensive, generally stationary devices that badly need somewhere to go." "The most important experiment, though, is even more recently in Intel Media's past. Intel played a key role in the development of Comcast's X1 service and gateway device. X1, Comcast's slowly unrolling, next-generation platform and interface, may give you the best indication as to how Intel Media would look and work, and it's really rather remarkable"</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364484607091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 11:30:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364484877191-48</Id><Topic><Title>How can this news be anything less than DEVESTATING for Intel, if true?</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364475404639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 08:56:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the interests intel will have to bring together still have the same interests.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1364484877191</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 11:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364485161351-49</Id><Topic><Title>Bay Trail Quad 22nm Atom in Q3 13</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364477166942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:26:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dual boot is nice for some.

Don't think of Intel as a company that makes processors. Think of Intel as a company that makes technological standards. After all, the genius of the Wintel era wasn't really in the Pentium chips or auto-cascading spreadsheet windows. There were a lot of ways those particular innovations could have played out. It was that two companies, Microsoft and Intel, were able to create a set of standards flexible yet rigid enough to support entire ecosystems of hardware vendors and software developers, but to also ensconce themselves at the top of that mountain for decades. Is there any market that more badly needs a flexible yet rigid set of technological standards more today than television? Are you really going to count out Intel, one of the most resourceful and resilient companies in the history of technology, when everything is pointing toward the living room as tech's next big battleground, and when Intel literally has nowhere else to go?

Apple can save themselves a lot of headache by working with Intel.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364493332018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 13:55:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364493459811-65</Id><Topic><Title>I wonder how people are dealing with living in the cold, dark endless torrent of rain</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1364439142387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 22:52:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A shell of a man that thinks anybody would believe that Intel would offer a temporary contractor stock options to stay.........LMAO.</Msg><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1364493459811</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 13:57:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364493666858-66</Id><Topic><Title>Finfets are beautiful but difficult to produce</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364417171285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 16:46:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't Otelini say they'll "never" figure it out?

ALTR continues to work with TSMC on planar 20nm but already has head start with TriGate. Intel is close to have 22nm trigate working for SoC in production (supposedly Q3). One very important point nowadays is that the manufacturing team and design team need to work closely together, the designer might have great ideas but the manufacturing guy provides a sanity check if those great ideas can be implemented - but look at TSMC ...20nm volume in 2014....so they put all this work into 20nm planar while knowing all this will change with introduction of TriGate/FF. I think UMC (the smallest guy) got it right by introducing 20nm FF or at least that's the goal. Keep in mind all the foundries are competing with each other - not only with Intel. Some analysts (and bluemonk) say Intel has no experience in SoC which might be true - however the move to TriGate/FF is a complete new ball game (according to QCOM guy SoC designers have more or less to start from scratch). Intel's SoC designers might be well ahead of all the ARM designers that are still waiting for the foundries. A tapeout (IMHO) won't cut it - you need to have a process.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364497442216</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364498043142-76</Id><Title>Intel's upcoming 'Haswell' chip primed for gaming</Title><Msg>Chipmaker's upcoming 'Haswell' processor isn't just about better battery life. It's better at gaming too. Intel wants to make its future "Haswell" chip better than past generations of silicon at gaming and announced tools to make this happen at the Game Developers Conference today. The world's largest chipmaker announced tools, known as extensions, for software developers that allow Intel's 4th generation Intel Core, aka Haswell, to process demanding special effects. The first of these extensions, called PixelSync, allows programmers to more realistically render smoke, hair, windows, foliage, fences, and other complex geometry and natural phenomena, according to Intel. "The artists working on Grid2 have been requesting this type of effect for years, and prior to this, it wasn't possible to achieve it at a reasonable cost," Clive Moody, senior executive producer at Codemasters Racing, the game's developer, said in a statement. The expected widespread adoption of Haswell on tens of millions of PCs "is very exciting to us," he added. PixelSync enables a feature called Order Independent Transparency (OIT). "Given that Haswell...will be more limited on memory and memory bandwidth than the highest end discrete [graphics processing units], it makes sense that Intel is motivated to find a smaller footprint and more bandwidth efficient way to implement OIT," said Anandtech. Intel also announced InstantAccess, which makes accessing data located in Haswell's central processing unit and graphics processing unit -- CPU and GPU, respectively -- more efficient. Developers of the game Total War: Rome II expect this feature to ensure "that the game looks great whether you're running it on a slim and sexy ultrabook or a monster desktop," the company said in a statement. Haswell, due this summer. is expected to boast two big improvements: battery life and graphics -- the latter will improve gaming and media processing.

ULT means that the part operates on ultra-low voltage and is quite self-explanatory. The main difference between one-chip and two-chip Haswell mobile CPUs is that the one chip part has the Lynx point LP PCH chipset inside of the CPU package. One can view this chip as a SoC (System on chip) and it will come in BGA package. Intel also referred to this chip as part of its Y-processor line of products, with a 11.5W maximum TDP and scenario design power of 7.5W. This is quite exceptional considering that this is the TDP of the complete SoC. In contrast, the Ivy Bridge Y-processor line had a 13W TDP (7W SDP), and that was only the CPU. The point of having a BGA package and making a SoC is to lower the production cost, lower TDP and footprint. Haswell ULT is the chip meant for Ultrabooks and tablets where footprint, TDP and lower cost play a key role. This is probably why Intel plans to further drop the Haswell Ultrabooks pricing, as mentioned here. Intel promises eight to ten hours of endurance with Haswell ULT based tablets and the lowest TDP we saw in Intel’s future plans was 15W, but maybe Intel can go even lower in the future. The plan is to see some of these Haswell ULT devices in Q4 2013 and onwards, while Ultrabook U-series parts will show up one quarter earlier.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364498156322</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:15:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364498352187-78</Id><Title>Blue screen of death for RT</Title><Msg>Software giant Microsoft will no longer launch products under its Windows RT line and will instead merge the product line into the software giant's next-generation Windows, codenamed Blue.

Analysts will be all over the stock channels being interviewed. The little David versus Goliath analogy will have run it's course Analysts will be asked about the possibility of Intel cracking the market. Sure a few will try and downplay it, but the ones who know the history of Intel and how they go to market know that within two years of this first phone Intel based Smarthphone Intel will be setting the bar not just trying to crawl up to it. The day of the first Intel based Smartphone is coming for the USA. And once it does it's a dogfight for market share by one company that has very little market share with nearly unlimited resources and other companies that by their design have to not only fight Intel but each other for market share.

However, if Intel's cable set-top box hits the ground running, the two tech titans could be a match made in heaven. Anyway, here's how it could go down. It's all but certain that Intel will launch its product in time for the holidays. Rumors persist that Apple will enter the living room -- quite possibly with an Ultra HDTV -- right around the same time. I have argued for months that Apple, contrary to consensus, wants (or, at least, should want) no part of high-profile content deals. It should stick to what it does best: making existing consumer hardware better -- more intuitive, beautiful and useful. Let Intel deal with the content end of things, which suits Huggers, a BBC veteran, better than Tim Cook. Tim Cook says he feels like he has stepped back in time when he walks into his living room -- you know, like some backwards#$%$ era where gay marriage isn't even legal (oh ... wait!). In this regard, Huggers speaks the same language as Cook. In fact, while Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings talks a big game about smart television and innovation in the living room, Huggers absolutely appears prepared to deliver the material goods. He has the cash . . . the backing of a giant blue chip institution. And Apple is a peer, at least if Intel -- throughout the organization -- can get its act completely back together. It's cheesy, but Intel and Apple do make a perfect match in the living room. Whether they know it or not, their interests are (or, at least, should be) aligned.

The service will be underway before the holiday shopping season starts and Intel will get customers signed on. Netflix offers just a streaming movie service...Intel is offering one better - Live TV streaming.....Netflix relies on hw makers to incorporate their service...Intel builds their own hardware which are far superior to the basic DVD players, read the following article: engadgetDOTcom/2013/03/19/intel-launches-media-server-reference-design/ The media server reference design supports Hillcrest Lab's motion control technology as well as Intel's own perceptual platform for gesturing and facial recognition. Intel will have this media server reference design in their set-top box that will be rolled out with the web tv service. The technologies embedded in the set-top box, it basically acts as a gaming console as well. With the media server reference design, Intel is hoping that other hw manufacturer will incorporate it to build their own set-top box or incorporate into Smart TVs.

Netflix has proven its business model, Intel hasn't. Other differences: Netflix provides the consumer access to a huge inventory of movies not available from the TV service provider. Intel's Web TV doesn't give the consumer access to any video material they don't already have from their HDTV service. Since Netflix has created a global ecosystem of TV and consumer electronic device makers, everyone with a DVD player or SmartTV can become a Netflix customer. Intel has to convince the consumer to buy a new piece of hardware to deliver the service. Netflix is highly affordable. Some Netflix customers drop their cable TV service and save $100 a month. Intel Web TV doesn't save the customer money, it doesn't give consumers a la carte programming, it doesn't even give them access to new content, there are a ton of options already for people to record missed shows, and plenty of products for gaming. Intel's Web TV is a confused product with a confused business mission.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1364511042336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 18:50:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364512805448-96</Id><Topic><Title>Why a Massive Apple, Intel (TV) Partnership Makes Sense</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364502810337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:33:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IMO, Intel's Web TV has a very clear mission - sell more Intel chips! As wallis stated, the primary role of Intel's web tv is leverage. There are many scenarios that can play out and how intel can use this service as leverage. Here are a few scenarios: 1) Intel creates 'smart' bundles and entice customers. customers using current cable operators (eg. Comcast) sign on. Intel wins by selling tv service and their chips (by way of set-top box) 2) Intel sign deals with other internet providers such as Clearwire, who currentl only offer data service. The deal allows Clearwire to offer Streaming TV service to compete against the comcasts. Again Intel wins here - sells tv service and their chips (by way of set-top box) 3) Roku wants offer Intel's web tv service to their customers (some are leaving roku because they prefer Intel's bundles). Intel agrees to allow roku offer their tv service provided roku uses intel inside their box (Intel's media server reference design). Roku agrees and builds their hw using intel but keeps their current interface...roku can now also offer gaming and add other gesture controls that they could not have had before. 4) LG, the TV maker, wants to offer intel's tv service and to use gestures and motion controllers for their new smart tv. They decide to use Intel's media server reference design inside their new smart tv. 5) Google wants to build a set-top box/Smart TV that runs Android to allow interoperability Android mobile device...at the same time, they can offer users with Intel's web tv service. Intel allows this only if google uses their media server reference design. Google can now allow android apps to be develop spefically for the TV with gesture controls etc. 6) A start up gaming company wants to create a new game console that offer Nintendo wii and Xbox gesture control features, wants to use intel chips ...</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364512805448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 19:20:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364515982063-97</Id><Topic><Title>Why a Massive Apple, Intel (TV) Partnership Makes Sense</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364502810337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:33:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're referring to the same Clearwire wireless company Intel financed then had to write down several billion dollars in losses because that company also never had a viable business model.

It is a replay of previous such struggles. History is a useful indicator to the future where it repeats. The first important battle was won by Intel (INTC). By wresting control of the business from IBM (IBM) who did not know what it had in the 1980's and by then working with its partner ecosphere, in this case just Microsoft (MSFT), between them, Intel and Microsoft monopolised the PC market and decided what consumers would get. Once you define the standards, e.g. homogeneous x86 architecture, and once the market accepts that as the standard, you can almost charge what you like and the consumer gets what is given to them. That is how Intel became a hugely profitable and seemingly dominant company with a monster mark up on each chip sold. Paying hundreds of dollars just for a hot CPU was commonplace. That time is disappearing, CPUs are on a path to being a commodity designed to a new heterogeneous standard. Winding the clock on, dominance led to apathy, arrogance even, and Intel ignored some blindingly obvious moves such as reducing power consumption for mobile applications. The fact it is now doing this as a belated competitive response when it could have done it earlier simply because we were living in the era of declining resources leads one to conclude that it had absolutely no morals when it came to wasting vast amounts of energy. That selfishness and crass stupidity left the door wide open to a company that had watched and learned from Intel how to do the same business model but better. ARM (ARMH), known in the UK as just ARM (Advanced RISC Machines), had no choice but to focus purely on design as a 12-man start-up in 1990. It had no choice but to give customers what they wanted but was astute enough to see 'the future is mobile' as far back as the very early 1990s and focused on minimal CPU power consumption. An early ARM CPU powered the first 'Tablet', the Apple Newton. Whilst it was not a commercial success, Psion, amongst early PDAs which followed on, was popular and powered by ARM. Apple (AAPL) became a significant early investor in ARM The lesson on standardised chip design from Intel was not forgotten but how to give customers choices as well as what they want? That led to:- 'Heterogeneity of microarchitecture whilst maintaining homogeneity of the software visible architecture', this is a phrase you may see if you ever attend ARM seminars or watch an ARM keynote speech on YouTube. This is key to ARM's success and has allowed the building of an ecosphere of 1,000 companies that contribute to the ARM evolution. Customers can have exactly what they want in an SoC and can call on ARM to help move things into new spheres. The Lilliputians are tying Gulliver down as between them all the ecosphere now own the Heterogeneous standard the market demands, and in the end, it controls the market together with ARM. For example LINARO became a standard in 18 months where previously it took 6 years to create a standard. Gary Smith (EDA) is the source for this and has many other such insights to offer. The ARM ecosphere licensees get new ARM designs in fully functional and software testable, simulation form one to two years ahead of the release of its silicon form. That means within one day of releasing a chip it works exactly how it was expected to. ARM have had no failures of released chips. The very largest ecosphere customers can adapt the SoC design to get exactly what they want, made where they want, differentiating themselves and using a rapid development environment whilst staying true to the software visible architecture. The genie is out of the bottle and isn't going back to the homogeneous, one-design-fits-all, one monopoly supplier, x86 model even for a temporary power advantage. This Intel iMac I am typing on, is six years old and is plenty fast enough until 4K is commonplace. Multi-core processors, correctly implemented lead to reduced power consumption! big.LITTLE does the same whilst both extend the reach of the ARM architecture upwards. All of these things can be and are tested prior to release of the silicon form. Hard to believe and comprehend so look at these linked videos. The world's SoC architecture of choice is now heterogeneous and will never revert. Intel's homogeneous x86 architecture for the big chip that does everything will gradually decay as it is no longer the standard and is carrying 30 years of often useless, historical compatibility baggage that they MUST, but dare not, cast out. This is why the forty plus billion highly optimised ARM CPUs are everywhere; Tablets, iPods, phones, cameras, E-readers, set-top boxes, TVs, Routers, HDMI sticks, games devices, cars, smart meters to name a few areas. They will have a bite at Intel's heartland of servers, PCs and laptops via partner initiatives that ARM has no ability or desire to control and will take a slice of that market too, particularly if ChromeOS gains traction. For a larger list of new devices, videos and links see:- armdevices.net Life does not progress in straight lines and Intel have some much anticipated and discussed moves to make as Seeking Alpha author Ashraf Eassa keeps telling us. But each move will reduce previous levels of profitability and it will only make moves forced by having to defend a market or where survival of profitability in a market is threatened. Increasingly Intel are now playing in markets where the best it can hope to be is an option as opposed to a standard. Intel already make ARM chips (via Infineon) and I predict, will make a whole lot more in years to come which is their future destiny. We should all thank ARM and the ARM ecosphere for bringing down both power consumption and the cost of computing but most of all for enabling the mobile era. I am sure the Intel devotees will flame this article for being against the faith. Some people just don't get how things have changed. Maybe they still drive 6 litre Buicks. If you didn't understand ARM's momentum before and if you miss a chance to buy ARMH cheaply on a dip such as is starting to appear as I write this, don't say you weren't told. Gulliver has been tied down by 1,000 Lilliputians; he may struggle to rise up again for a while but he isn't coming back, the world has moved on and the little people are growing into big ones fast. Additional disclosure: I sold most but not all of my ARM shares in February and plan to reinvest on a dip. I also have some Jan 2014 call options on Intel as the release of their new chips in the next few months should temporarily change sentiment. I am long-term bullish on ARM and bearish on Intel subject to changes of strategy by both companies.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364524812986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:40:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364524959229-111</Id><Topic><Title>GETANID61 STILL pumping RT after it's officially DEAD</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364516941319</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 20:29:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surface RT still exists.
