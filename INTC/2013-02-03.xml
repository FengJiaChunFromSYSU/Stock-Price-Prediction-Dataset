Do you think this is what Intel is doing? Given that, x86 is running later versions of Android (if not the latest), we can expect to see x86 based Android Tablets at MWC? If this happens, it is a huge plus for Intel giving it a play in the pure Tablet market. (Of course, convertibles/detachables with Clover Trail+ and Core will have an increasing segment as well.) (2) Given that dual-core Medfield is a 2W part, can this still be used for powerful Smartphones if its deep-sleep capabilities can provide an optimal Smartphone usage? In other words, what is the likelihood of seeing this dual-core Medfield part in high-end Smartphones? If this happens, Intel will begin to be seen as a performance leader in the Smartphone market. With the original Medfield, and now Lexington and dual-core, Intel will address the medium, low, and high-end segments of the Smartphone market.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359897431268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 08:17:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359901688311-13</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Plans Big Splash For Mobile World Congress</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1359821323776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 11:08:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The dual boot device would be useful.

It will be just fine in a high-end phone as is, as exemplified by the slimness of the K900. Bay Trail will battle with quad-core A15s later this year for the non-Core high end tablet crown and I fancy Bay Trail's chances ;-). Don't get too hung up about early market-share what is more important is getting x86 mobile brand positive mind-share first and the market-share will follow. Like Otellini said mobile is a marathon not a sprint. When all the 22nm Atom products are out in volume I believe Clovertrail+ and Medfield will then be used to combat the ARM A7 parts on performance/price.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1359902285034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 09:38:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359904024433-15</Id><Title>This is why you should short Apple and go long Intel and Google.</Title><Msg>The X Phone with Intel Inside shipping in huge volume early 2014.

I believe it will be a long lasting selling design in the mobile arena due to its unique set of qualities and being made on fully depreciated 32nm wafers. I can see it going up against 20nm A7s in its final steppings while 22nm Merrifield and Bay Trail concentrate on putting some manners on the A15. (2) Very likely. 2W is about the limit in a smartphone before you start having to think about throttling your cores e.g. the 3W QCOM Krait S4 Pro. The 4 threads also help because they will help to keep clockspeeds and voltages down when multi-tasking/threading.

The OEM's loved this because they didn't have to spend money on R&amp;D and they could focus on selling and serving customers. Earlier Intel decided to market a PC under their own brand and not suprising the OEM's revolted. Intel canceled that plan and never sold Intel branded PCs again. Intel has sold other branded products for videoconferencing, storage and networking but not the PC itself. However, by not selling PCs Intel created a global ecyosystem of partners that remains a key asset today. Could Intel sell branded PC's and smartphones? Of course, but they would be merely be replicating Samsung's and Apple's strategies which are huge vertical monliths. Intel already competed the monlith titans of the day called IBM, DEC and Data General with its horizontally-aligned OEM structure and won. While the monoliths may be able to introduce a new product class more quickly, Intel already demonstrated that a horizontally structured ecosystem can innovate faster over time and reach more customers more efficiently than the monoliths.

I wonder if we know this guy on the board by another name?] [Read all the comments to the article for some interesting dialogue. The author does some serious back peddling after Ashraf's comments...] *** First, your characterization of Clover Trail as "awful" is baseless. In terms of the CPU, it is just as fast, if not faster, than the ARM based SoCs from Qualcomm, Nvidia, etc. while at the same time offering similar power levels. It's a slow dog compared to a Core i7, but what do you expect at 2W power consumption and 32nm process tech? Next, your characterization of Kabini is a little bit optimistic. Kabini's TDP will be in the 9W - 25W range, hardly fit for a tablet -- these are competitors to Intel's low end PC chips. The tablet chips, on the other hand, codename "Temash" will fit in a power envelope of 3.9W - 5.9W (2core/4core, respectively). The 2 core edition will probably be what goes into tablets, and even then, AMD's chip doesn't feature a lot of the sophisticated power gating/power states that enable the really, really low idle power that the iPad-style tablets need. "Bay Trail" will have a derivative of Ivy Bridge's on-die graphics, and it will have 4 "Silvermont" based CPU cores. Each core is going to be more sophisticated than the current Atom cores, there will be twice as many of them, and they will fit in the same thermal envelopes as the ARM stuff, while also being built on much lower power transistors. Intel will also feature all of the power gating features necessary for the long battery lives. In short, Intel will have a 2 gen process lead over the ARM and over AMD guys (22nm + tri-gate), it will have a brand-new, ground up micro-architecture (the current Atom's is 5 years old), and Intel spends massive amounts of R&amp;D to try to win. So, with all of the strong ARM players and then Intel, things are very, very tough for AMD.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359924894487</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:54:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359925458497-37</Id><Title>OXF - Best Value of 2013</Title><Msg>Energy Boom Massive Breakout Trade!</Msg><Username>soundenergypartners</Username><Timestamp>1359925458497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 16:04:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359925660587-38</Id><Title>2/5/13 is ex-dividend date</Title><Msg>If you own INTC on 2/5/13, then you're qualify its dividend.

We needed to run a slide show, and then be able to stop it and use a finger to control the movement We didn't have much time to go research the various models and had to get whatever Bestbuy had in stock. We decided on a Toshiba Ultrabook with touch screen. My wife has been anti Windows 8 since hearing negative things about it from the Build conference a few years ago. I've run a few Beta copies of it, played with it and was never really impressed with it on a PC. My friends have given enough negative reviews about it since getting it on their new laptops. All I can say is that this pig can fly. Windows 8 was actually (dare I say) a wonderful experience. My wife who is Mrs. Android was actually more impressed with it than I was. The piece that was missing was the touch interface. When you have that, Windows 8 is actually very nice. The live tiles are actually compelling, and it was about as clean and neat as anything I've seen from Apple. But make no mistake about it, this is version one. It's more like a model home than a real home. But compared to other Microsoft first version products like Vista and Windows 2000 this is miles ahead. It's a very nice first version. We ran it unplugged in a slide show for about six hours, and the battery didn't die. My Android phone could never do that! It was a 15" screen with an i5 processor. You may think it's too late for Windows 8, I though so as well. But seeing that the world was all BlackBerry not too long ago anything is possible. My thinking is that a 15" tablet with a doc, especially something running a 22nm processor is going to be something that will catch on. By that time Windows 8 will have been out for a couple of years, and it will have something more going for it with enough compelling apps to make people comfortable using it. The biggest problem with Windows 8 is Microsoft. They still don't get consumers as well as they should and though they have something somewhat viable they don't have enough clout or market share to call the shots. If they are the first into the hybrid tablet/laptop market with a strong push, and more or less an aggressive plan to buy market share they can secure their future. Or they can pretend that it's 1992 again and they just released Windows 3.1.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1359931755628</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 17:49:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359933131854-43</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody think Intel can end up in ALL the Motorolla-made Razr's?</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1359931709205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 17:48:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would think that once Intel has a viable 4G LTE solution, Motorola will start becoming more and more Intel until Google/Intel are the new "Wintel".

Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds to me like you are guiding traditional PCs down a ton this year and yet you seem to making a very big bet on revenue growth in to 2014 because it seems like this flood of CapEx doesn’t really start getting depreciated until then. So how much do you need to take, in terms of share within tablets or how much of that tablet market needs to be eaten up by your convertible PCs in order to fill that big bet in 2014 that you seem to be making and avoid the underutilization that may otherwise happen from the CapEx that you are spending? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President I take issue with the characterization of guiding PCs down a ton and then some big snap back. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein But you said revenues were up of 2% with data center up in the double digits and phones and tablets ramping, which implies that the core PC business is down. Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President No, so I said for the company its low single-digits in terms of our expected revenue growth, data center up and back into the double digits. You still end up with client growth when you go through that and I think the point that Paul was making earlier was a really important one which was the lines between a traditional notebook, a convertible, a tablet have blurred to the point that it’s a market for computing and we are expecting some unit, now Q1 we think is seasonally down. That’s what we guided but when we get into the back half and you have a combination of new products in the market and an improving macroeconomic environment I think that’s a fairly reasonable assumption on the year. As we think, into the future, we think of it as just more or less normal growth, consistent with what we have historically seen, from a unit standpoint. It's just growth across a much wider range of devices than what we have historically supported. You want me to add anything to that? Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein Okay, I guess a follow-up on that. My math suggests that you are guiding depreciation this year at $1.7 billion quarterly run-rate, which is flat which suggests to me that your incremental CapEx spending doesn’t actually start getting depreciated on next year, which, again, tells me that you are looking for a fairly solid amount of growth in 2014 to cover that. At the same time, I know you talked about phones and data center and PCs and everything adding to that but the data center business, you sell what, right now 16 million chips a year, something like that which comes from a fab. You have phones which Paul admitted, we are probably sill going to be small. Then you have tablets where the dies are a lot smaller. So unless you are driving tons and tons of volume, it is actually not a ton away for volume. So what sort of growth, is your historical level of unit growth enough to fill the CapEx you are putting in and what gives you confidence that you can you have that same kind of historical level of unit growth? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President I think it is and I think that we have line of sight into what our customers are designing around Haswell which is this year's innovative new core product and Broadwell which is next year. So we know the specs on those. The customers know the specs on those. I have seen the prototypes of the industrial designs. They are really exciting products. Our customers have not had this level of performance in this kind of form factor before. To some extent, we are branch predicting that that level of product will generate sufficient excitement to keep the client growth going. In none of our numbers are we projecting an inflection point, upwards or downwards. We see renewed growth around these new form-factors.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1359949125470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 22:38:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359949997375-54</Id><Topic><Title>AMD to take market share away from Intel.</Title><Username>yuorbestfriendintheworld</Username><Timestamp>1359830245887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 13:37:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't spill any bong water on the carpet.
