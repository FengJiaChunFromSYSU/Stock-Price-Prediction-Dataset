"The White House's new health-care proposal promises the "largest middle class tax cut for health care in history," which is a creative way of describing a vast taxpayer-subsidized insurance entitlement. Naturally, the fine print goes on to describe one of the largest tax increases for health care in history, too. This new ObamaCare bargain would for the first time apply the 2.9% Medicare payroll tax to "interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents," so-called passive income that we are told includes capital gains, though the latter wasn't explicitly mentioned in the proposal. This antigrowth investment tax would apply to singles earning more than $200,000 and joint filers over $250,000 and comes on top of the Senate's 0.9-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax, which would bring the combined employee-employer share to 3.8%. The rate hike on investment income would presumably take effect at the same time the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts are due to expire next year, bringing the top rate to 22.9% as the current top capital gains rate would also rise to 20% from 15%. That's a 52% jump, and the last time investors were slammed with anything comparable was 1986 when the capital gains rate bounced to 28% from 20%—or a 40% increase—as part of the Reagan tax reform that reduced income tax rates. [obama] In part this is a sneaky way of waging the House's war on "the rich" by other means while appearing to compromise. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 5.4-percentage-point "surcharge" on modified adjusted gross income above $1 million—which also includes capital gains—was supposedly too extreme for the Senate, but the White House is trying to smuggle in its 2.9-percentage-point cousin. Of course, $250,000 is a lot lower income threshold than $1 million, and the rate can always be inched up later once the tax is already in place. The House surcharge is certainly destructive but it is at least above-board. The White House levy muddies up both the tax code and Medicare financing. The Medicare payroll levy was designed as a social insurance program with some connection, however attenuated, between taxes paid and benefits received. When Medicare passed in 1965 it was modelled after Social Security and the tax was supposed to be equivalent to a "premium" for guaranteed health-care insurance for seniors; everyone "contributed" at the same rate. Until 1993, the payroll tax was assessed only on the first $135,000 of wages, until the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress lifted the Medicare cap entirely.

Let's see the growth of IBM compared to Intel in the past 5 years. And let's look at Q3 specifically since Intel has been critisized about being weak in the latest Q3 results. IBM had revenues of $25.3 Billion for Q3 of 2008 and felt the weak economy just like Intel in 2009 which caused them to drop revenues down to $23.6 Billlion. A drop of 6.7%. IBM later delivered $24.3 Billion for Q3 of 2010 which is still lower than its 2008 results. Finally they delivered higher results of $26.2 Billion for Q3 of 2011, which was 3.5% better than their 2008 results. But more recently, their revenues dropped down to $24.7 Billion which is 2.4% lower than their 2008 results. Now for the stock that Warren does not like. Intel had revenues of $10.2 Billion for Q3 of 2008 and also felt the weak economy which caused them to drop revenues down to $9.4 Billion in 2009. A drop of 7.8%. However, Intel later delivered revenues of $11.1 Billion for Q3 of 2010 which was 8.8% better than its record 2008 results. Intel continued to deliver record results for Q3 of 2011 with $14.3 Billion in revenues, which is 40% better than its 2008 results. And more recently, Intel delivered $13.5 Billion in revenues which is still 32.3% better than its 2008 results. In summary IBM 3rd quarter revenue dropped by 2.4% within the past 5 years while Intel's 3rd quarter revenue rose by 32.3%. I will stick with Intel.

The thing is, most of them don’t get any attention because they’re budget devices that don’t exactly use the best components on the market. According to The China Post, that’s soon going to change. They say that Peter Shieh, Vice President of Acer’s Business Division in Taiwan, told members of the press that the company is going to launch an Intel powered smartphone by the end of the year. So why is an Intel powered smartphone important? Because during the next year or two we’re going to see an epic battle take place in the mobile phone market. Intel has been wanting to get into the smartphone space for years, and now they finally have the hardware to do it. The recently launched Motorola RAZR i received above average reviews. People were pleasantly surprised that it preformed so well while still managing to last a full day on a single charge. We admit, the RAZR i might not be the fastest phone on the market, but with Intel, a company that’s known for relentlessly innovating, it’s not going to be long until we’re all demanding that the next flagship phone from Samsung or HTC have an x86 chip under the hood. And hey, all that pressure is going to force Qualcomm and Samsung to design faster chips at an increased pace, so we’re going to win either way!</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350915132267</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350915462499-17</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like it's going to be a roller coaster today...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350914846575</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:07:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems pretty normal after the huge loss on Friday...

In a recent interview with EE Times, Intel's vice president and head of architecture David Perlmutter revealed the company's plans to push ahead with its sub 20nm and 14nm plans. Intel is currently biding its time, with the semi giant appearing quite prepared to wait a couple of generations until sub 20-nm nodes are breached before bringing the battle of low power processing to ARM and its mobile partners. The company claims to have line of sight all the way to a 7-nm process, with all the firm's CPUs becoming SoCs as of next year. Haswell will be Intel's 22-nm SoC for tablets and Ultrabooks, while Merrifield will be the company's SoC for tablets and smartphones. After that, 14 nm is expected to be Intel's killer node with the most dramatic power improvements and integrated base band—although the firm has yet to officially announce it. Meanwhile, the ARM ecosystem has a rather more challenging road ahead of it, with low cost continuing to present a challenge for foundry supply, yield and materials science. ARM is seeing Moore's Law slowing down due to a lack of foundry spending and a deficit in R&amp;D capabilities. Even at the 28-nm, the ARM ecosystem is feeling the squeeze. Until very recently only one foundry (TSMC) could yield 28-nm chips, with Globalfoundries just starting to produce 28-nm in volume, and the entire industry is under-supplied. With Intel pushing ahead to introduce FinFETs at the 22-nm and hoping to use EUV lithography at 14 nm and below, ARM faces an even bigger crisis of competition.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350917046114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917060632-29</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S INVESTMENT TAX</Title><Username>xquestor</Username><Timestamp>1350881793473</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 00:56:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One way or another "those who have achieved" will pay for those "loafers".

They can sell more core parts from the 1st gen, but they were probably close to capacity anyway. Looks to me like AMD will have to fill in the gap for desktop/laptop chips. Think about a million chips a day, seven days a week because that is the market, and you get an idea of why Intel can't fill the gap. Looks like a good chunk of the billion or so Intel is spending this qtr will go to AMD. More importantly, it brings Llano up to almost the same time frame if AMD can execute. I see this as being a lot better for AMD than what meets the eye. This is a huge mistake. It will grow with time.</Msg><Username>lucyboycots_chickfillet</Username><Timestamp>1350935343199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 15:49:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350936825628-67</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8: Quote of the day......</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1350881604895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 00:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some people are dumber than me... you don't have to use TILES and touchscreens with windows 8 if you don't want too... thanks for listening...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350936825628</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:13:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350936939652-68</Id><Topic><Title>Why Romney will be a great president..</Title><Username>migrationisahumanright</Username><Timestamp>1350851474751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:31:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like jobless rates are on the rise again... unemployment - HERE I COME!</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350936939652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:15:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350936996305-69</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like it's going to be a roller coaster today...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350914846575</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:07:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I was pretty close...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350936996305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:16:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350937786690-70</Id><Topic><Title>Intel aims to steamroll competition beyond 20nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350917046114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel steamrolled your portfolio, douchewad!

The option orders clamp the trading into a narrow price range. It reminds me of bowling with the kids and having bumpers in the gutters to channel the ball into the pins. When the Intel price goes up, option values change and it triggers the option market maker to take action. When hte Intel price goes down, option values trigger the option buy/sells. Intel will go down when they buy puts or sell calls when Intel is UP. Intel willl go up when they sell puts or buy calls when Intel is DOWN.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350938307277</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:38:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350939348686-72</Id><Topic><Title>Intel aims to steamroll competition beyond 20nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350917046114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOPPER!!! porto is greato!!!!

President Obama and Mitt Romney are tied in the critical battleground state of Ohio, according to the latest Suffolk University poll, but Obama has a significant lead over his GOP challenger among those who have already voted. Obama and Romney each took 47 percent support in the poll of likely voters. That’s nearly in line with the RealClearPolitics average of polls, which shows Obama ahead by 1.9 percentage points in the state. However, Obama has a massive 54 to 41 lead over Romney among those who said they have already voted. The president also leads among those who say they plan to vote before Election Day, 48 to 44, while Romney leads among those who say they will vote on Election Day, 49 to 44. A survey from Democratic-affiliated Public Policy Polling (PPP) released Saturday similarly shows a tight race, with Obama topping Romney 49-48. A CBS News/Quinnipiac poll released Monday shows Romney with a late surge in the state, but Obama holding a 5-point lead with 50 percent support to 45.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1350962959159</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:29:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350963009865-118</Id><Title>Only Flake liberals will fall for Obama's speaking abilities this time</Title><Msg>Community organizer that racked up more debt in 4 years than Bush did in 8....with 2 wars!

That means liberals tend to be the kind of people who want to try new things, including new music, books, restaurants and vacation spots — and new ideas. "Conservatives, in contrast, tend to be less open — less exploratory, less in need of change — and more “conscientious,” a trait that indicates they appreciate order and structure in their lives. This gels nicely with the standard definition of conservatism as resistance to change — in the famous words of William F. Buckley Jr., a desire to stand “athwart history, yelling ‘Stop!’?”"</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1350963545502</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:39:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350963661018-120</Id><Topic><Title>Only Flake liberals will fall for Obama's speaking abilities this time</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1350963009865</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:30:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liberal RAG Monday, Aug 27, 2012 7:31 PM UTC Study: Right twists facts A new scientific paper suggests political conservatives more likely than liberals to bend reality to their beliefs Last week, the country convulsed with outrage over Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin’s false suggestion that women who are raped have a special bodily defense mechanism against getting pregnant. Akin’s claim stood out due to its highly offensive nature, but it’s reminiscent of any number of other parallel cases in which conservative Christians have cited dubious “facts” to help rationalize their moral convictions. Take the twin assertions that having an abortion causes breast cancer or mental disorders, for instance. Or the denial of human evolution. Or false claims that same-sex parenting hurts kids. Or that you can choose whether to be gay, and undergo therapy to reverse that choice. The ludicrous assertion that women who are raped have a physiological defense mechanism against pregnancy is just part of a long litany of other falsehoods in the Christian right’s moral and emotional war against science. In fact, even as Akin reaped a whirlwind of disdain and disgust, a new scientific paper has appeared with uncanny timing in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, underscoring what is actually happening when people contort facts to justify their deep-seated beliefs or moral systems. Perhaps most strikingly, one punch line of the new research is that political conservatives, like Akin, appear to do this significantly more than political liberals. In recent years, the field of moral psychology has been strongly influenced by a theory known as “moral intuitionism,” which has been championed by the University of Virginia psychologist Jonathan Haidt. Dealing a blow to the notion of humans as primarily rational actors, Haidt instead postulates that our views of what is right and wrong are rooted in gut emotions, which fire rapidly when we encounter certain moral situations or dilemmas — responding far more quickly than our rational thoughts. Thus, we evaluate facts, arguments and new information in a way that is subconsciously guided, or motivated, by our prior moral emotions. What this means – -in Haidt’s famed formulation — is that when it comes to evaluating facts that are relevant to our deep-seated morals or beliefs, we don’t act like scientists. Rather, we act like lawyers, contorting the evidence to support our moral argument.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1350963661018</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350963895838-121</Id><Topic><Title>Where are the jobs, Mr. Obama??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1350961156239</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DA Bears 10 Detroit Lions 0 San Francisco Giants 7 St. Louis Cardinals 0 President Obama 65 Mitty Romney 0 Gotta love it all TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYY</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1350963895838</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:44:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
