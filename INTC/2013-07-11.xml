Microsoft might still believe in Windows RT, but support from the PC business is fading fast. Nokia is reportedly the latest company to abandon ship. Although a Windows RT tablet from Nokia has been rumored for months, sources told The Verge’s Tom Warren that the company is now working on a Windows 8 version instead. Other tech vendors who have cancelled their Windows RT plans include Acer, HP, HTC, Samsung and Toshiba. Of the three PC makers that have released Windows RT devices, only Dell has publicly made an ongoing commitment to the operating system. It’s unclear where Lenovo and Asus stand, but neither company has announced new Windows RT devices yet. Although Microsoft is unlikely to kill Windows RT outright, maybe it’s time for the ill-conceived operating system to fade away for a while. With poor sales, hardly any hardware support, and the potential to cause confusion with Windows 8, Windows RT is better off in hiding, while Windows 8 gets the entire spotlight to itself.

The next generation of low-power PC processors from Intel promise at least eight hours of battery life in thin and light tablet designs, and have outperformed ARM-based chips in some tests. Once these Intel processors, known as Bay Trail, begin showing up in Windows 8 tablets, Windows RT will become even tougher to justify. In the meantime, Microsoft can only make weak, artificial efforts to prop Windows RT up, such as a free version of Office for users and reportedly lower licensing costs for makers of small-screen tablets. The first strategy hasn’t worked so far, and it’s unclear why tablet makers would be swayed by lower licensing when they can create equally cheap (or cheaper) tablets running Android. Windows RT is either a few years too late or a few years too early. It might have made sense back when ARM-based processors were miles ahead of Intel in power efficiency. It may someday make sense again if the “Metro” side of Windows becomes popular enough–but only if Windows RT devices regain some distinct advantages to make giving up the desktop software worthwhile. Until then, Windows RT is better off on the back burner, where it can’t create any marketing headaches. Perhaps Microsoft knows that much by now; when the company took to its official blog to announce Windows 8.1, it didn’t mention Windows RT even once. Although Windows RT will receive many of the same new features as Windows 8 in an update later this year, the ARM-based operating system has received none of the fanfare–as it should be.

(slightly below consensus of $1.87) I am surprised that he did not raise estimates higher so the probability of an INTC "miss" would be higher. Expect Romit to say he is disappointed with Q2 results and "DOWNGRADE" INTC to $1.75 for 2013 after earnings. Nomura Equity Research’s Romit Shah weighed in on the prospects for Intel (INTC), whose shares he rates “Reduce,” with an $18 price target. Shah raised his estimates for the current quarter to 50 cents from 47 cents previously, and raised his year outlook to $1.84 from $1.75, based on an expectation of a reversal of prior quarters’ inventory reserves: "We expect gross margin to improve from 58.0% in Q2 to 61.5% in Q3 and 63.0% in Q4. One of the biggest drivers is the reversal of inventory reserves […] Between 4Q12 and 2Q13E, we estimate that Intel will record inventory reserves of 300bps (Figures 1 and 2). Those charges should largely reverse over the next two periods. In other words, Intel should benefit from the sale of previously written-off inventory to the tune of 150bps per quarter. In addition, Intel should recoup 450bps in startup costs over 2H13." Shah thinks Intel may forecast Q3 revenue of $13.5 billion, below consensus of $13.7 billion, given he thinks “uptake of Haswell has been lower than the company’s expectations.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373540236612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 06:57:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373542619245-17</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>This is still a stock market which wants to go higher.

A 300mm silicon wafer can produce about 250 of these chips. More arithmetic returns a number of over 14 million silicon wafers to produce a solid state drive to mate up with each of the Intel CPU chips. A very large wafer fab facility can produce about 100,000 wafer starts per month, 1.2 million per year. 14 million wafers would require nearly 12 of those monster fabs. Each of those monster fabs would cost $4-5 billion and take at least two years to build and equip. Samsung is building one of those plants in China, but it won't be ready for another year. Hynix (HXSCF.PK) is transferring 40,000 wafer starts per month from DRAM to NAND, a drop in the bucket. During the recent Micron earnings conference call, Micron CEO Mark Durcan described the future demand for NAND as "insatiable". I ( Russ Fischer of Seeking Alpha) think I will be shopping for one of those Haswell Ultrabooks with a solid state drive tomorrow before the shortage sets in earnest. ME too....

Personally I believe they will do $2.00 this year and 2.50 next year. Even the bear says they do 1.90. So I say with a 15x PE then that gets us the 30 that I am projecting.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1373553237747</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 10:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373553242099-61</Id><Title>Ms Mayer:</Title><Msg>Why is your Yahoo service so slow and so klugey?

Over the past eight quarters, Intel has moved 2.6 percent on an absolute basis post-earnings, below the 4 percent earnings move implied by the options market, Strugger said. Term structure is flat relative to recent quarters, suggesting the recent sell-off in shares has lessened demand for longer-dated calls. This contrasts with one-month call skew, which is steeper than recent quarters, Strugger said." It sounds like the option folks think INTC has 4% upside from here roughly 1 dollar, it does get you close to 25. I do feel a bit sorry for the shorts. A big reversal is coming they may not see it coming until it is too late.

Over the last four quarters, CCUR has grown operating income from $0.187mm to $0.413mm to $0.876mm and to $1.233mm, for total growth of 559%. CCUR just increased its dividend by 100% to $0.48 for a yield at $7.87 of 6.1%! You would expect a very profitable, rapidly growing company, with tons of cash and such a HUGE dividend to be trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of at least 2 or 3, but because CCUR is completely undiscovered - it's trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.74. CCUR has only 8.754mm shares out, $22.37mm in cash, no debt, an enterprise value of $46.52mm, with trailing revs of $63.23mm. Massive consolidation is taking place in the pay-TV industry, with rumors swirling about the next cable TV operator to be acquired. CCUR is one of the top tech vendors serving pay-TV operators. CCUR is the video on demand (VOD) market share leader with a VOD reach of 50 million households. CCUR also holds the largest market share for start-over/look-back network DVR services. Plus, CCUR provides the leading Big Data Analytics solution used by pay-TV operators, with CCUR's technology tracking the behavior of 35 million pay-TV subscribers. ARRS was rumored to be interested in acquiring CCUR in the past and with industry consolidation gaining huge momentum, CCUR could become a top takeover target. CCUR's rival Seachange (SEAC) has been seeing its fundamentals weaken while CCUR's profits rapidly grow, yet SEAC is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.74, which would value CCUR over $15. CCUR is about to explode past its 52-week high of $8.45 and into double digits. Pay-TV operators are rushing to upgrade to IP-based content delivery networks (CDNs) and CCUR's new CDN video technology was just selected by Time Warner Cable and Virgin Media! CCUR's 4Q results next month could be HUGE!</Msg><Username>jowslir632</Username><Timestamp>1373570249038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373570513306-143</Id><Topic><Title>analyst crooks</Title><Username>chinhle52</Username><Timestamp>1373569344953</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:02:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indeed..and we had that discussion last week.

I, for instance, believe that ARM is excessively over-valued but it does not affect my strong belief that ARM is a good company with talented, hard-working individuals. I feel the same way about AMD. In fact, I can't think of any company I would address in such a manner. Corporations usually employ large numbers of people. Even if certain ones were or are less than exemplary it would be silly to attempt to condemn all of them. When someone does use these kinds of epithets, it illustrates more about the psychological dysfunction of the critic rather than making a value judgment of the company itself. Primarily it means that the mom didn't slap the little sucker across the face enough times growing up to teach some basic respect.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373588599387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373589066637-190</Id><Title>I Can't Tell You</Title><Msg>I can't tell you how much it pains me to think that James Covello, Romit Shah, and Stacy Rasgon are right now sitting in a bar in Manhattan crying in their ten buck beers over yet another failed Intel short exit strategy having gone bad.

Intel is selling Atom motherboards with processors for around $70, and has been for the past few years. How does this argument hold up?
