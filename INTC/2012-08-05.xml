TSM +2.24% said Sunday it has acquired 5% of Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML Holding NV for 838 million euros ($1.04 billion) as it aims to accelerate the development of next-generation semiconductor-manufacturing technology. TSMC also said it will commit EUR276 million over five years to ASML's research and development programs that help produce cheaper and more-energy-efficient chips. "This effort will help the industry control wafer cost, and therefore protect the economic viability of Moore's Law," said Shang-yi Chiang, TSMC's executive vice president and co-chief operating officer, in a statement.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1344179425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344180550000-7</Id><Topic><Title>TSM buys 5% stake in ASML</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1344179425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:10:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel spends 4 billion, TSMC spends 1 billion on ASML.

This one seems to be. TSMC took a $1b 5% equity stake in ASML. INTC took a $3b 15% equity stake in ASML. INTC also invested $1b for "ASML’s research and development programme". The FT said that the equity stake would be returned to shareholders through a synthetic buyback/reverse split to prevent dilution. The Intel $1b goes to development but how much the equity stake by INTC/TSMC helps ASML when there is no dilution and funds are returned to share holders? The Intel investment put pressure on TSMC to react in kind. I would be interested in getting a peek at the Intel development agreement and see what special conditions (if any) were included. Maybe: exclusive access to jointly developed technology for some time period? Joint ownership of patents developed with the funds? Nothing? "ASML said that the stake would give Intel limited voting rights and the money would be returned to shareholders through a “synthetic buyback”, including a reverse stock-split that would prevent dilution."

There is the 1B + 275M in new money for R&amp;D though. What I don't understand is why ASML didn't just do a capital raise (or debt issuance) instead to provide money for increased R&amp;D and keep the company out of the hands of the chipmakers.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1344183670000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:21:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344184426000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Frankenstein Takes Over the Market</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344112268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I consider buying and holding quality companies as a "low-pass-filter" that filters out the HFT over the long time scale (ie, over an hour or so).

I would expect there is nothing unique with either the Intel or TSMC contracts then. The TSMC investment will then help get EUV lithography technology and 450mm lithography tools to market more quickly and at lower cost exactly like the Intel investment. Since the 450mm wafer has 2.25x the area, high volume products that can take most advantage of the larger wafers will get the best cost benefits. I guess this is why TSMC is converting to wafer pricing.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1344184962000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:42:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344185920000-15</Id><Title>Just show us your taxes Mitt you wooosey scum.</Title><Msg>Romney released one year of tax returns which showed he paid 13.9% in taxes...

Yes, you house members can win win win on the far right in those areas but how about state wide Senate races? Well the US Senate will end up with 70 Dems in 8 years the way the republican party is going. For you idiots who do not know, that is 70 out of 100 members and a veto prove majority. The GOP--their leaders are upset but they cannot stop the swing to the far right in their party. It is for sure a reaction to a changing American demographic that the older generation of whites dislikes. Yet the GOP sees that their were more non-white children born in America last year than white. Screaming you want your country back is not going to change things. The young people do not understand the rightwing hysteria from Grandpa? Their friends are all different ethnic groups and no one even notices. People 30 and younger will vote for pres OB in a 2-1 ration again. Now given that non-whites hate the GOP party more and more, this GOP train wreck will not end well. If they, the Repubs, lose to the Pres this time, and they will, they might now win the White House for 30 years after. They are trapped in their own hole getting votes from pocket of voters in their rural white area but making it impossible to be a national party. About Romney? The rich powerful in the GOP shoved Romney down the throats of the teabaggers in their party in hopes of being able to stay in the center so as to be electable in a national election. Problem is, he is a member of the Wallstreet gang and an easy target for a populist candidate like OB. Romney should be ripping into OB everyday about the economy, and he is, but all we will hear is about his Romney tax forms which he refuses to release. it is like your little kid--you ask to see something but do not care too much. But the kid refuses to show you and then you for sure want to see what he is hiding. Mitt is going down big and could lose 40 states. The Tax dodger and Chief draft dodging richboy was a terrible choice for the gOP but they say this. He is better than a teaparty nut. I disagree. if you ran a teapart nut and he got torn apart in a National election, it would allow the republican party to move back to the middle. But now, Romney loses and the Teabaggers say it is because you did not run a rightwinger.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1344188415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 13:40:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344199350000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Ex div tomorrow</Title><Username>lalupatel_99</Username><Timestamp>1343943824000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 17:43:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u had it all wrong ....u should sold or write covered call point higher on intc than that that u paid for the stock....that way u get the div. plus u get to keep call preminum if stock stays below the strike .....even if it goes above it it gets taken away from u but u get div plus premimum...plus dollars higer on the sales of the stock...if it goes lower u can simply buy back at reduced cost the call that sold...thus making money plus u get s div....more better trade opporitunity to make money then the one u had....</Msg><Username>shanepatel_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344199350000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 16:42:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344201573000-22</Id><Title>How'd that Dividend treat you WDBLAWGROW?</Title><Msg>Oh wait, you sold under 20 for a 20 cent profit.

We start to understand that trading successfully is going to take more time and more knowledge then we anticipated. Most People Will Give up at this Point as They Realize Work Is Involved. 15. We get serious and start concentrating on learning a 'real' methodology. 16. We trade our methodology with some success, but realize that something is missing. 17. We begin to understand the need for having rules to apply our methodology. 18. We take a sabbatical from trading to develop and research our trading rules. 19. We start trading again, this time with rules and find some success, but overall we still hesitate when it comes time to execute. 20. We add, subtract and modify rules as we see a need to be more proficient with our rules. 21. We feel we are very close to crossing that threshold of successful trading. 22. We start to take responsibility for our trading results as we understand that our success is in us, not the methodology. 23. We continue to trade and become more proficient with our methodology and our rules. 24. As we trade we still have a tendency to violate our rips and our results are still erratic. 25. We know we are close. 26. We go back and research our rules. 27. We build the confidence in our rules and go back into the market and trade. 28. Our trading results are getting better, but we are still hesitating in executing our rules. 29. We now see the importance of following our rules as we see the results of our trades when we don't follow them. 30. We begin to see that our lack of success is within us (a lack of discipline in following the rules because of some kind of fear) and we begin to work on knowing ourselves better. 31. We continue to trade and the market teaches us more and more about ourselves. 32. We master our methodology and trading rules. 33. We begin to consistently make money. 34. We get a little overconfident and the market humbles us. 35. We continue to learn our lessons. 36. We stop thinking and allow our rules to trade for us (trading becomes boring, but successful) and our trading account continues to grow as we increase our contract size. 37. We are making more money then we ever dreamed to be possible. 38.
