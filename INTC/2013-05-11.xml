The XMMTM 7160 platform from Intel is one of the smallest and most energy-efficient multimodal LTE platforms (LTE/HSPA+/EDGE), which can simultaneously cover a wide range of bands in all significant radio technologies. It is intended for use in smartphones, tablets, UltrabooksTM and machine-to-machine modules. The platform supports LTE with up to 100 Mbit/s in the downlink and 50 Mbit/s in the uplink. DC-HSPA+ (up to 42 Mbit/s), HSUPA (up to 5.7 Mbit/s) and EDGE will also be supported. The modem platform supports four GSM bands, eight 3G bands and 15 LTE bands, and also provides IMS features such as VoLTE. As Stefan Wolff, Vice President of the Intel Architecture Group &amp; General Manager of the Multi-Comm Mobile and Communications Group explains: "The successful and efficient cooperation with the Vodafone Innovation Park Labs allows our OEM partners to introduce consumer products such as tablets and smartphones onto the market with as little effort as possible. The close, intensive collaboration with Vodafone ensures maximum quality and stability in Intel's current and future modem and phone platforms, which in turn allows our OEM customers to provide outstanding quality on rollout of the product." Andreas Dorstel, Head of the Acceptance &amp; Innovation Services Department in the Vodafone Innovation Park, is already looking forward to further cooperation for the next generations in order to ensure a high level of end customer satisfaction, bearing in mind the numerous Intel-based mobile communication products in the Vodafone network.

The mobile companies chose SiON due to the low power characteristics. Mobile companies buy the majority of the wafers now which is why 28nm SiON revenues are higher than HKMG. That will change this year, TSMC will ship more 28nm HKMG wafers. AMD, NVDIA, Altera, Xilinx, Oracle etc..... the high performance companies have been buying 28nm HKMG wafers. That puts Samsung 1+ years behind TSMC on yield learning and production costs. Good thing Samsung does not break out their foundry numbers in regards to margins and profits.

The point you are missing about Samsung is that their 32nm HKMG came out about the same time as TSMC's 28nm HKMG as is of similar performance and density and it came out in volume as the Apple A6/A6X in the latest iPhone5/Pads. Samsung actually did a good job considering the absolute mess Global-Founderies made of their gate-first 32nm HKMG for so long. Their 28nm is a lower power evolution of their 32nm and not just a shrink which may account for some of the delay. Samsung is a big rich diversified company, I'm sure they will cope with the loss of Apple's business just fine, after all their Galaxy phones are taking business off Apple's all the time. They will also drop Qualcomm's Snapdragon once Intel have their LTE chip ready to pair with their Exynos series which will increase their own chip volume.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368301819656</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 15:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368302615733-29</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting, does TSMC know this guy is very unprofessional?</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368295156886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How different is this from Ashraf getting paid for his "PR work"?</Msg><Username>m00nsh1ner</Username><Timestamp>1368302615733</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 16:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368303127958-30</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting, does TSMC know this guy is very unprofessional?</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368295156886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>uhhhh, if you are comparing someone who claims to run a reputable website, claims to have a strong relationship with people in the SEMI industry, etc. with a college kid writing a blog then my point has been made.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368303127958</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 16:12:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368303291206-31</Id><Topic><Title>The Morphing of Intel's Monopoly</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1368110278033</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:37:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They will also drop Qualcomm's Snapdragon once Intel have their LTE chip ready to pair with their Exynos series which will increase their own chip volume._ _________________ The thought of this makes me #$%$.</Msg><Username>smokinghotblitch</Username><Timestamp>1368303291206</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 16:14:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368311559525-32</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf: Intel Drops An Atomic Bomb On ARM's 'Abomination'</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367878857308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Disregard, by the ARM camp analyst, of intel's ATOM potential is by far the best thing any ARM short investor has going for them. Simply, intel will execute it's plan for significant gain in market share of the tablet, ultra mobile PC space. Expect intel to post next quarter gains in product shipped and sales increases. Factories in full production and capacity. This will be the quarter of sales into the Q4 end user purchase cycle. OEM's (especially Apple) may ignore the ATOM, though at it's own peril. Simply, ATOM will outperform, use less power, and have more feature capability than an ARM powered Apple A6, even if Apple switches to ARM A15 for iPad, it will be too little, too late! I will be more surprised if Apple DOES NOT go ATOM for iPad 5. Likewise, Samsung Galaxy tab, will be severely under performed, when compared feature, and power to ATOM powered competitors. Big thing in the mix is Intel/Samsung Tizan, bodes well for China, especially with Chinese Govt, kind of, not comfortable with Google.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1368311559525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368314047341-33</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting, does TSMC know this guy is very unprofessional?</Title><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368295156886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:59:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not paid by Intel to do any "PR work", nor do I promote my articles on this message board (or any other).</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368314047341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:14:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368314914584-34</Id><Title>Qualcomm expected to grow while Apple shrinks its earnings?</Title><Msg>Did anybody notice that expectations for Qualcomm is for them to grow their earnings by 32% in 2 years while Apple is actually expected to slightly shrink its earnings?

Top of page 4 of their March 2013 10q SEC filing. Quarterly revenues from Licensing is $2.134 billion. Quarterly operating income is $1.877 billion. Same for last quarter, quarter before that, annually, .... licensing revenue exceeds their operating profit. From 50,000 feet up, it looks to me like QCOM is getting more licensing revenues than their profit. How much increment expenses are added by the licensing organization over not licensing at all? Not much. The gross margin of their licensing revenue is 99.9%. If you extracted the QCOM $2.134 billion licensing revenue from their profits, wouldn't their operating income be negative? With the world tilting toward 4G, guess where the 32% earnings is going to come from. QCOM is primarily an intellectual property company who makes and sells some chips below cost. ARMH with a US tattoo. Are these calculations correct?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368319824069</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 20:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368322218878-36</Id><Title>Gosh what an article.

His attorney's name is the only one I cannot find. This will linger until the attorney gets a few $$$ or Harvey realizes carrying this forward is worse. Intel fired the two culprits immediately. They were convicted of criminal offenses. Palacio is suing for unspecified damages and attorney fees. You would think that Palacio would pull his shirt around so he could see if their was anything on his back. That is what a 5-year old would do. He could have walked to the nearest room with a mirror so he could see for himself.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368326388950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 22:39:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
