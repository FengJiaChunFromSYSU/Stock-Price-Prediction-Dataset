And Mr. Obama’s competitive edge from 2008 clearly dulled, as he missed repeated opportunities to challenge Mr. Romney on his falsehoods and turnabouts. Virtually every time Mr. Romney spoke, he misrepresented the platform on which he and Paul Ryan are actually running. The most prominent example, taking up the first half-hour of the debate, was on taxes. Mr. Romney claimed, against considerable evidence, that he had no intention of cutting taxes on the rich or enacting a tax cut that would increase the deficit. That simply isn’t true. Mr. Romney wants to restore the Bush-era tax cut that expires at the end of this year and largely benefits the wealthy. He wants to end the estate tax and the gift tax, providing a huge benefit only to those with multimillion-dollar estates, at a cost of more than $1 trillion over a decade to the deficit. He wants to preserve the generous rates on capital gains that benefit himself personally and others at his economic level. And he wants to cut everyone’s tax rates by 20 percent, which again would be a gigantic boon to the wealthy.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355492717</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349355731137-26</Id><Topic><Title>Virtually Every Time</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355492717</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:58:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a poor loser.

He really hit his stride in the second 15-minute segment of the debate, when the questions turned to the issue of the debt and the federal deficit. Asked about the deficit, President Barack Obama launched into a pseudo-rambling spiel attacking Romney on everything from Big Energy subsidies, to refusing to raise taxes on the highest income earners, to tax breaks that go to companies moving jobs overseas. But Romney was ready for all of it. Asked to respond, Romney shook his head, "Well, he covered a lot of topics there." Then he turned the energy subsidies attack right around, calling Obama out for clean-energy loan failures like Solyndra: "I have a friend who says, you don't pick winners and losers, you just pick losers." And then came Romney's real coup, on Obama's claim that businesses get tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas: "I've been in business for 25 years, and I have no idea what you're talking about." This is how it went the entire night. In the end, it wasn't even close. Snap polls showed that Romney was the overwhelming winner among viewers, and the feeling now is that the race has been reset and that Romney has a real chance.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355748642</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:02:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349355762780-28</Id><Topic><Title>Do us a favor Wally so we can put your Wallisweaver alias on Ignore</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355426867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:57:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you hate everyone who doesn't want to give you another tax cut?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355762780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:02:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349355906939-29</Id><Topic><Title>Virtually Every Time</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349355492717</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:58:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You are a poor loser.

You may be right but at least it was obvious who is more intelligent. 4 more years of beating on businesses and wondering why they aren't hiring and running up debt will be just wonderful. Romney basically told Obama what needs to be done and I wonder if Obama gets it yet? Blaming Bush isn't going to get it done. Whining over your grandmother isn't going to get it done, hasn't gotten it done. One thing for sure, the country's heathcare system does need an overhaul. A 2,000 page healthcare policy that was not eveb read isn't the answer but it was a start. I will give credit where credit is due. I don't just say repubs good, dims bad. GWB was not a good President but neither is Obama. With 47% of the country bribed, he may very well get a 2nd term. I had no i ntention of wathcing the debate but glad I did. Now what i want to see is Biden. That guy is a bigger dingbat than Dan Quayle.

The Chrome browser was about the same, likewise the camera app. The Intel phone showed superior battery life as commented above, 9 hours vs 8 hours on the Snapdragon. So fundamentally Engadget is saying with currently shipping versions of Medfield that consumers will either see a benefit in overall use and battery life, or at worst equivalent performance to dual-core Snapdragons.

YEAH--he is full of sheiit but you have to call him on it like teddy Kennedy did or he will get away with it Obummer. Grow some nuts and take him apart. Let your Chicago Mob attack the sheeet out of Romney. Obummer hates to fight. He is too polite. SO--just run the add until Romney looks like a complete liar. Obummer wins with 53% of the vote and debates mean nothing this time. Romney is good at it--so what--he is still a liar and the 47% thing will take him down in Ohio and the middle of America. LIBs need to stop crying. Obummer is not a name caller. He is polite. That is why the ladies like him. Watch--one week from now--the polls will not have moved even 1 pt. I do not believe that the Libs who will vote for Obummer give a rats who wins a debate. The 4% that are undecided are liars. Most of them too have already made up their minds and it will split 50-50 among the undecided. Game over. Obummer loses all the debates and wins the election. Watch as the left and the minority voters turn out in record numbers. They are not going to get Swiftboated by Super flip flop Romney. Willard is going down hard and when he does--you rightwing trash can cry here and kiss my Lefty #$%$! I do not give a rats id Romney is a good liar. I already knew that.

Heading into the debates, the conventional wisdom suggests that Romney has fallen way behind and has to dramatically change the course of the race in these head-to-head events. Some even suggest that the debates are Romney's only chance to bring about a change in the race. If that's true, Romney's in trouble. The last time a presidential debate changed the race was in 1980, when Ronald Reagan outperformed Jimmy Carter. More recent history shows the debates having only a modest impact. In 2008, heading into the first debate, Rasmussen Reports polling showed Barack Obama up 50 percent to 45 percent over John McCain. After that debate, the numbers were 51 percent to 45 percent. On Election Day, it was Obama 53 percent, McCain 46 percent. The debate did little for either man. Four years earlier, there was a similar reaction to the debates between President George W. Bush and John Kerry. When Bush had a bad night, the only thing that changed was Bush supporters decided (after the fact) that debates didn't matter all that much. So barring a major misstep like President Ford's 1976 assertion that Poland was not under Soviet domination, the upside for either candidate in the 2012 debates is a minor shift in the race. But that may be enough. While national polling has shifted a bit in the president's direction over the past couple of weeks, the candidates remain very close. In the past couple of elections, the numbers have shifted three points between late September polling and the actual results on Election Day.

Design is important and one can do a lot of tricks but at one point the process technology will become the limiting factor for the designer. Regarding stock price: any discussion why too high or too low is a waste of time - as long as I feel Intel is on the right track I'm comfortable Apple iPhone 5 – the A6 Application Processor So this is the first Apple core we’ve seen done with custom digital layout. In fact, with the exception of Intel CPUs, it’s one of the first custom laid out digital cores we’ve seen in years! This must have taken a large team of layout engineers quite a long time. The obvious question is, why? This is a more expensive and time-consuming method of layout. However it usually results in a faster maximum clock rate, and sometimes results in higher density. Certainly one possibility is that Apple could not meet timing on a automatically laid out block, and chose to go with a custom laid out block. Was this a decision at the architecture stage, or did timing fail late in the design cycle and a SWAT team of layout engineers brought in to save the day? We’ll probably never know, but it is fascinating, and also 2X faster (according to the below image)</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1349405491756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 22:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349407214032-168</Id><Title>S&amp;P at 5-year high...SHAME on Paul O.</Title><Msg>Worse than Craig Barrett.
