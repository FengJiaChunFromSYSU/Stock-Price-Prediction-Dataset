For one thing, some weak hands got shaken out early this morning when the DJIA went from a 100+ point gain in the pre-market futures to a loss soon after the open. For another thing, the stochastics of most of the major indexes are now in oversold territory. In addition, the number of new 52-week lows contracted today despite the S&amp;P 500 making a new intraday low. Such positive divergence could bring some dip buyers back in the market. With that said, the uptrend started in mid-November was broken yesterday. Don't expect the market to go straight up like it did from mid-April to mid-May. With the Fed tapering, it will take lots of strong data on the economic and earnings front to keep the optimism in place. Stocks will likely look to the coming earnings season for direction. In the meantime, expect some summer doldrums. For the S&amp;P 500, watch for resistance near 1600, followed by its 50-day moving average which currently stands at 1618.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1371875543545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 00:32:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371876476786-2</Id><Title>just a fact</Title><Msg>capex for chip manufacturing equipment is very risky - laying out capex while anticipating to recoupe the investment in the future Chip makers are investing - they expect real demand to kick in North American Semiconductor Equipment Industry Posts May 2013 Book-to-Bill Ratio of 1.08 SAN JOSE, Calif. — June 20, 2013 — North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment posted $1.32 billion in orders worldwide in May 2013 (three-month average basis) and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08, according to the May EMDS Book-to-Bill Report published today by SEMI. A book-to-bill of 1.08 means that $108 worth of orders were received for every $100 of product billed for the month. The three-month average of worldwide bookings in May 2013 was $1.32 billion. The bookings figure is 12.5 percent higher than the final April 2013 level of $1.17 billion, and is 18.1 percent lower than the May 2012 order level of $1.61 billion. BTW the "A's" lead 6 to 3 against Seaattle The three-month average of worldwide billings in May 2013 was $1.22 billion. The billings figure is 12.6 percent higher than the final April 2013 level of $1.09 billion, and is 20.5 percent lower than the May 2012 billings level of $1.54 billion. “The SEMI Book-to-Bill continues to show steady improvement as the ratio remains at or above parity for the fifth consecutive month,” said Daniel P. Tracy, senior director of Industry Research and Statistics at SEMI. “The spending outlook for the year is improving as foundries continue to invest in advanced technologies and NAND manufacturers plan to increase spending on equipment.” The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving averages of worldwide bookings and billings for North American-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Billings and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.

Like so many other articles on this topic the author understates the problems any outsider competing directly against the cable operators for delivering live TV. The Barron's author does give some attention to the most recent battles Intel has experienced acquiring content and seems to suggest that if the content issue were solved the way would be paved for Intel's success. They refer to the 1992 FCC mandate that forced cable operators to sell affiliate programming to satellite operators, suggesting a new mandate could be done to force MSOs to sell content to Over-The-Top-Operators. The big difference in the example is that satellite operators already have their own distribution directly to consumer's TVs. All they needed was content and they were done. But OTTP operators have neither their own distribution nor content so they would have to buy the content then turnaround and use the cable operator's own bandwidth (which is not unlimited) to deliver the same content cable operators already deliver. The Barron's article seems to suggest that Eric Huggers was genius for not pursuing the $4.5 billion annual settop box chip business but rather preferred to chase the $500 billion of live TV business market. However I am not impressed with this business judgment. Intel has a very good chance of winning the settop box chip business while getting Intel's security architecture into households which could be strategically valuable to Intel - but they have virtually no chance of taking the cable operator's live TV business. So if the Barron's piece is true Huggers' seems to be walking away from a valuable piece of incremental chip business that leverages all of Intel's strengths, to instead chase a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371901216324-8</Id><Topic><Title>Mr Weaver has reduced his pumping.

In a meeting with VC's the comment usually goes something like, "There is this gazillion dollar sized market and if we only capture a small percent, we'll all be rich". Hearing this statement a seasoned investor may end the meeting, or if they are the mentoring type they may say something like, "No that's not interesting, but show me a product you can sell to 1,000 people who are not friends or family and we may be interested". The problem is that it doesn't matter how big the live TV streaming market is if it's unobtainable to Intel. One comment at the end of Barron's piece by Huggers seems to suggest Intel is slowly acknowledging the futility of their original "go it alone" dream where Huggers suggest that there are "all kinds of opportunities" to partner with incumbent cable operators. Partnering to help cable operators launch a cable branded streaming service may have been viable but not likely now after Intel first tried to take it all for themselves.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371901654976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:47:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371904223074-11</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I had assumed the much hyped Apple tv product would look like this.

I personally would not have fired that old bag for dropping the N bomb as long as she did not do it on TV--and she did not. I hate her food and she is not entertaining to me but others liked her so we need to lighten up and let it go people. What? You think older blacks do not call whites racist names too? They do some of them. But again--their sons and daughters are getting married to whites and so the entire thing is just falling into the trash. It is hard to be a card carrying racists dirt-bag whether Asian, black or white when your grandchildren you love are mixed and their friends are too. Lord knows blacks have a reason to be angry at the old south and KKK nuts north and south but the old south thing is on its last walk now so let it go. There are racists north and south but just more of them south. It is not the name that hurts you know. It is what people do with the money that is the fight. My papa taught me that I can laugh at any name thrown at me because it is not true and they are just angry is all I need to know. Tell you the truth--I have not been around any friends of mine white who have thrown the N bomb for 50 years here in the North. It is so so Confederate and southern that even KKK Yankees hate the term. The most evil thing ever done by Americans sure as heck needs to be thrown down and spit upon--slavery.

Intel hasn't launched its service yet, so I suspect they haven't burned any bridges. As they mentioned in the article, cable/satellite can be induced to provide their infrastructure for Intel's service if they can get the same or higher level of monetization for their infrastructure with higher broadband speeds and or a percentage of revenues as an example (with falling cable/satellite subscriptions, even staying at the same level may be attractive). I suspect all kinds of deals can be done. Intel has shown remarkable consistency in terms of not competing with their customers (OEMs) even though device prices/margins have been vastly higher than CPU/SoC price/margins - which should be encouraging to all prospective partners in the TV and other markets.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1371907267713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371908405315-15</Id><Topic><Title>Scorched daytrader Lucy Nuff's aliases - Lost EVERYTHING buying AMD at 40</Title><Username>lucy_mutt</Username><Timestamp>1371838804905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 14:20:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's the first day of summer for pete's sake who in H really cares?</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1371908405315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:40:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371908723418-16</Id><Topic><Title>Scorched daytrader Lucy Nuff's aliases - Lost EVERYTHING buying AMD at 40</Title><Username>lucy_mutt</Username><Timestamp>1371838804905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 14:20:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFY, loser.</Msg><Username>lucy_mutt</Username><Timestamp>1371908723418</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:45:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371909071542-17</Id><Title>Being short now like James cavello screwing his horse--is a major loser.</Title><Msg>Goldman suxxx needs to sheetcan him and put someone in who has his head out of his ashhh.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1371909071542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:51:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371909468621-18</Id><Topic><Title>Lot's of insider selling...</Title><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1371906598049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:09:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTL has a problem with worthless partners. MSFT deserted them with Surface even though they should have seen that RT was not going to make it- market research should have sold that. DELL and HP have to be drug along in PCs. INTC handed the industry the path with the Ultras and Best Buy still doesn't carry a 2 for 1. On demand TV is the obvious way that market needs to go. The carriers will fight it every inch of the way. Politicians may even side with the carriers. INTL does not have a partner to take this on. INTL has no other choice but to go it alone. Once consumers see it, they will probably demand it. This will put a powerful INTC computer chip in the middle of the house providing entertainment, but with the capability to be the focus point of the home internet of things. This will also create demand for a massive number of servers. Even if INTC doesn't take over the TV industry, they will have put the X86 (highest power computer chips) in the middle of the market. There would be no going back to ARM or AMD. If the strategy is to shake up the market and tear down the carriers monopoly, I fully support that. It will be messy, but INTC will be one of the winners. If they burned bridges, it was the bridges to the futurelosers.</Msg><Username>dewey_duhawk</Username><Timestamp>1371909468621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371910563725-19</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Intel's original "go it alone" OTTP strategy did was threaten the MSO's and make the top players circle the wagons to protect their own turf. Even if Intel wants to cooperate now the MSO's have already been put on alert and they won't easily let their guard down. Trust is difficult to regain. Secondly, if MSO's want to do more of their own OTTP content deliver they can buy as much streaming technology as they need. Obviously Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, Amazon and many others do this very well for non-live content. Any new codecs and server technology will be easily accessible, including Intel servers. Thirdly, Intel will not be able to monetize cable operator's infrastructure more efficiently than the cable operators can, and Intel certainly can't do it if they're paying 75% more than cable operators pay for the same content. The original Intel concept included turning consumer's privacy into a new revenue stream with the built-in camera and facial recognition but the chance of that happening today is near zero. The public has had their fill of being spied on and their privacy turned into someone else's profit.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371910563725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 10:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371910765716-20</Id><Title>Noe to board: Merlot_1 hates the Intel TV deal AND.........</Title><Msg>.........AND he's completely obsessed with saying "I told you so" when it comes to it's failure.

America is heading toward a solid 4% or better growth for the next 5 years and Obummer, as you call hom, is going to be hugely popular as he leaves office because of it. Mr. Behravesh now expects the annual growth rate to rise to 2.9 percent in 2014 and 3.5 percent in 2015. If he’s right, it would mark the fastest annual growth since 2005, when the economy expanded by 3.1 percent. It is also well above the 2 percent rise in output the economy has averaged over the last three years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also sees relatively fast growth of 3.4 percent next year, and 3.6 percent between 2015 and 2018. A few other private economists are even more bullish. Jim Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase’s commercial bank, estimates the economy could expand by 4 percent in both 2014 and 2015. If that were to come to pass, it would be the strongest back-to-back annual growth since the late 1990s. Oil and gas boom puts US on track for energy independence LONDON (CNNMoney) The United States will overtake Saudi Arabia to become the world's biggest oil producer before 2020, and will be energy independent 10 years later, according to a new forecast by the International Energy Agency.

Driven by high prices and new drilling methods, U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons is on track to rise 7 percent this year to an average of 10.9 million barrels per day. This will be the fourth straight year of crude increases and the biggest single-year gain since 1951. The boom has surprised even the experts. "Five years ago, if I or anyone had predicted today's production growth, people would have thought we were crazy," says Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets research at IHS CERA, an energy consulting firm. The Energy Department forecasts that U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons, which includes biofuels, will average 11.4 million barrels per day next year. That would be a record for the U.S. and just below Saudi Arabia's output of 11.6 million barrels. Citibank forecasts U.S. production could reach 13 million to 15 million barrels per day by 2020. Add the 5 million per day from Canada's sands this will be helping to make North America "the new Middle East."</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1371924920509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 14:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371925372582-52</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd agree 100%.

At this point Comcast and other cable operators are already streaming content to their consumers and of course they already deliver live HDTV. Where's the compelling value-add to consumers to switch from single their single billing integrated Internet &amp; HDTV service they have today to a separate video service that's no cheaper than cable that uses up their allotted monthly Internet allocation? The concept is not compelling. If Intel now wants to partner with cable operators instead of competing directly against them they need to identify their value-add as a partner and it is not at all clear why cable operators need Intel to operate a streaming service cable operators are quite able to do for themselves. Intel should focus on the settop box chip business and leverage their world class fabs to capture that $4.5 billion annual revenue. They might even build a settop box cable operators could buy to resell to their customers, but there is nothing Intel has announced in any of their plans yet that makes a rational case for them being a branded streaming TV provider competing against MSOs.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371932758277</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 16:25:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371933312331-65</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really don't comprehend or even bother to read articles &amp; posts by others do you? good luck with your tunnel vision &amp; Sunday morning quarterbacking I'm sure it serves you well.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1371933312331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 16:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371933757150-66</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's Web TV service hasn't launched yet has it.

MSOs making us pay $10/month extra for DVR is B S. From what I am reading, Intel will provide automatic archiving of all channels and programs. - Watch Live TV of any channel from any device anywhere. MSOs offers live TV streaming only on small number of channels. - better, simpler interface. There won't be the archaic concept of channel numbering system. "Intel should focus on the settop box chip business and leverage their world class fabs to capture that $4.5 billion annual revenue" The problem with this strategy is the MSOs does not have the same interest as Intel, nor anyone else for that matter. The only thing MSOs are interested in is maintaining the status quo. This is why we have not seen any kind of real innovation with the living room experience for decades. What Intel is looking at is real change and innovation in the living room. It starts by getting Live TV to "fully" go thru the IP prococol. Yes, you've mention before that MSOs are using IP for their own services, but the problem is it still maintains its channel numbering archaic system. Intel is try to change all this and start a chain reaction. Believe me, there are more large players out there that want the same thing. I expect Intel will be able to easily get partners and backers for their TV service in the future. IMO, the set-top could morph into something way more than what it is today. We are already seeing signs of the set-top box and gaming box merging into one device with games being offered over the cloud. In the future there will be more apps/services that will go thru the set-top than just gaming. I believe the set-top box has the potential to morph into a central hub/server for every home.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371939729973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 18:22:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371939956978-74</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Soon - or Not: Intel's Must-See TV</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1371900517610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One thing I forgot to add: Imagine: Intel TV service paired with Google Fiber service!

In fact I vividly recall on this very board that RT would have $200 PC's by now that people would be flocking to in droves. Jen-Hsun Huang characterized it as "Game Over." Then a few months later he was demanding that Intel to fab his ARM processors. Intel on the other hand doesn't say much, and when it does say something people seem to remember. You'll see the numbers show up in the future quarters with the only real grandstanding coming from tech writers. Intel is a good quiet little producer.

This device is said to be working with web connectivity that needs no television package plan, therefor aiming to do the traditional TV industry a blow that could be their last. In other words, Cablevision, Comcast, Charter Communications, and Time Warner Cable beware. This service has been revealed by author Tieran Ray of Barron’s, a fellow who seems to be a real supporter of the future or internet-only big-set entertainment. He’s made clear his viewing of a TV service at Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and he says it’ll be coming with an “over the top” video connection to change the industry. Ray described the user interface for this system as follows: “Without giving too much away – the user interface seemed to hover beautifully above the currently playing show. An elegant simple menu made it easy to switch between channels or to pick and rent a recent film. It was light years from the cumbersome garbage that takes up most of the screen when using a standard cable-channel picker.” – Ray From slashgear</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371947873090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:37:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371948349108-89</Id><Title>Variety: Intel Staffing Up Call Center for Internet Cable TV Service</Title><Msg>Intel is building out a large call-center operation internally dubbed “Audience Care” for the launch of an Internet television service targeted for later this year — a first for the chip giant, which has never had a direct-to-consumer business before.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371948349108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:45:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371948419658-90</Id><Topic><Title>Intel earnings, margins and forecast will thwart the skummy analsysts this year</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371945468379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 19:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anal Cysts?

The service is expected to feature an advanced cloud DVR and user-tracking support, and though a la carte subscriptions won't be offered, Intel is promising more service "flexibility" than what consumers normally get. Moreover, Intel has assembled a team with superb media/electronics bona fides, and its use of an Internet gateway design developed with Comcast (previous) could let it create a Web TV standard.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371948491197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:48:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371948796269-92</Id><Topic><Title>Intel talks set-top box for 2013: traditional TV’s last gasp</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371947873090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:37:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Barron's blogger, Tieran Ray, has been no friend of Intel's and has spliced together negative analyst quotes to maximize the damage to Intel.

Haswell offer major battery life and graphics improvements. Examples include the MacBook Air with 9hours-12 hours of battery life, or the Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus with 3200x1600 resolution and 12 hours battery life. Also with Haswell, we are seeing computers makers blending Android and Windows 8 in a seamless solution on Hybrid devices, this is what AE called "true hybrid". Examples of this include the Asus Transformer Book Trio and the Samsung ATIV Q. Haswell is offering compelling reasons for current Windows users to upgrade their XP and Windows 7 system. 2) Intel is taking the tablet market by storm. Since the introduction of Windows 8 tablets, Intel has already gained 7% of the tablet market. With release of Bay Trail products just a couple of months away, Intel will gain further traction. Not only is Intel now offering Windows 8 tablet, they are also offering Android too. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10" design win is a perfect example of just how far Intel has come. The Tab 3 is only a CloverTrail+ Soc. With Bay Trail, Intel is offering "twice the performance at the same power level or 4.3x less power at the same performance" against *PROJECTED* competitors...this means the Snapdragon 800. Also in 3rd quarter we will be seeing Y-series Haswell with SDP of 6W and lower. These will produce premium fanless tablets. With CloverTrail+ targeting low-end, Bay Trail for mid-range (arm's high-end), and Haswell Y-series for premium tablets, I expect Intel's tablet market share to double by this time next year. 3) Intel now has an LTE solution. With the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 win, Intel also announce that the tablet will come "equipped with Intel's XMM 6262 3G modem solution or Intel's XMM 7160 4G LTE solution". "Intel's XMM 7160 is one of the world's smallest and lowest-power multimode-multiband LTE solutions". With this news, it meansIntel will be able to equip all their future phones/tablets/hybrids/ultrabooks with LTE capability.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371951544302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 21:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371951929177-96</Id><Topic><Title>The Tipping Point, the Differential, and the End of the ARM Era</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371941405558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 18:50:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor Waldo, another year of pumping INTC and INTC is still down from this time last year.

The industry trend is still moving towards the cloud, which means Intel's server revenue will continue to grow. And with 2 years process lead and trend towards power savings, Intel will solidify their position with unmatched performance/watt/dollar. By the way, with Silvermont's Avoton, Intel will take a tremendous lead in the microserver market. 5) X-factors, such as the foundry side business and Intel TV, could prove to be major cash cows. With at least 2 years process lead and the only company to use 3D (FinFet) technology, Intel is strategically stealing top foundry customers from tsmc/Samsung/GF. Announced deals include Altera and Microsemi. There are strong indications that Cisco is also one of Intel's customer. With Intel TV, there are just too many potential here. At stake are the $4.5 billion TV-chip market and a $500 billion television market. Also, with a set-top box reference design that include gestures and voice recognition, Intel may be looking to go after the game-box market as well.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371952842711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 22:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371953339893-99</Id><Title>Shills Tell ARM Longs: It's All Good</Title><Msg>Shills are telling ARM longs to be happy because they have only given up $15 out of the $25 gain for the year.
