Why should anyone be surprised at this warning? Not only did they tell you but the PC market continues to get weaker. If I see near that $23.75 low in the regular session I might nibble for a trade. I went short on NVDA near $14 yesterday and I will cover today. They ran that thing up for no reason even after a downgrade to $13 the day before. Actually people thought NVDA would be in AMZN's new product and it turns out to be TXN instead. Now another downgrade today for NVDA. Now INTC dividend will help keep this between $24-$25 I believe for now. INTC is smart they waited for the 244 point gain to warn the day after smart move.</Msg><Username>vincent90157</Username><Timestamp>1347020743802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:25:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347021204781-12</Id><Title>since reality doesn't matter anymore...</Title><Msg>INTC will finish up today.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1347021204781</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:33:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347021519097-13</Id><Topic><Title>since reality doesn't matter anymore...</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1347021204781</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:33:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct about reality.

But in almost every case, the Company would have been âhistoryâ if it had not been for the Private Equity investment and the attempt to rescue the Company. Outsourcing: â¢ Probably the single most important thing that has made America the most productive creator of goods in history. â¢ For example, if Ford was not allowed to outsource, and had to make all its parts and supply all the services it needs â they could probably only make about 10 cars a year. â¢ The question is not âwhether to outsource or notâ, itâs about who do you outsource to. â¢ In almost every case where the outsourcing goes to a nonâU.S. Company, you can pretty much point to a Union situation that has made the American Company not cost competitive. Tax Fairness: â¢ The Top 1% pay 25% of the Tax bill. â¢ The Top 2% pay 40% of the Tax bill. â¢ The Top 20% pay 90% of the Tax bill. â¢ The Bottom 50% pay 0% of the Tax bill. â¢ Exactly what is âfairâ? Classes: â¢ The Democrats believe that there are two Classes: The Top 2% that are rich and evil, and the other 98% are all âMiddle Classâ. â¢ Same kind of thinking we saw from Christopher Dodd and Maxine Waters when they decided that âeverybody should own a homeâ. That one didnât work out so well. â¢ The Democrats donât even mention the âWorking Classâ (the PC version of Lower Class) anymore. When did a Factory Worker or a Walmart Retail Associate with a High School education become âmiddle classâ. â¢ The Democrats abandonment of the Working Class has led to outsourcing of these jobs.</Msg><Username>gguybbycc</Username><Timestamp>1347023398877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:09:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347023475687-25</Id><Topic><Title>Intel warned december 2011</Title><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1346254024897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 11:27:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump, 8 days ago I said this.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1347023475687</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:11:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347023741141-26</Id><Title>Cramer Just Said</Title><Msg>He is not recommending INTC but it has a good dividend.

A comparison between the market shares of handsets and tablet PCs equipped with ARM-architecture processors and models equipped with Intel processors clearly shows that ARM has a significant upper hand in power consumption, Hurley said. For Intel, the rival is not ARM but the powerful ARM army consisting of chip vendors including Qualcomm, Nvidia, Texas Instruments and MediaTek, Hurley emphasized, adding that Intel's advantage lies only in funding. According to Taiwan-based handset supply chain makers, Intel's Atom Z2460 processor is superior to ARM-based equivalents in performance but significantly inferior in power service life and management. Compared with ARM-architecture processors consuming less than 1W, Intel processors have high power consumption, the sources said. As to the launch of Windows RT, Hurley said that Windows RT will bring opportunities for vendors looking to in PC and other market segments with ARM-based products.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347029131420</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347029139642-58</Id><Title>PC sales always drop BEFORE a new Windows op sys comes out.</Title><Msg>Don't you hold back on your purchase when you know that, if you wait a month, you can get a better op system?

(point your phone at a restaurant to get details whilst walking in the street--Nokia MS phone will do that just for an example). PC sales with windows 8 and the true Ultrabook will take off (flip the screen around and have touch screen or just dedock the screen for an instant tablet.) But the winner is not Intel.

INTC-3.30% has done a poor job of forecasting demand in the personal computer market, underscored by its dramatic cut in its revenue outlook for the third quarter, an analyst said Friday. "Intel is always the last to know," Topeka Capital analyst Brian White said in a note. "Over the years, we have always been amazed at how poorly Intel has been at forecasting demand for the PC market and its impact on the company's overall business." Intel cut its sales forecast to $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from a previous target of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Intel shares were last trading down 3%.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347033134517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>28</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347033271297-75</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL CRITICIZED FOR POOR FORECASTING</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347033134517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:52:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice job Otellini.

The INQUIRER met in Beijing with Yunji Chen, one of the principal designers behind Longson, who detailed the firm's new announcements and its plans to open offices in Europe. For those of you unfamiliar with ICT and the Longson family, the Longson name is the commercial title for the chip series originally known as Goodson. It was originally designed without the proper licence from MIPS, but a couple of years ago ICT acquired a full MIPS licence. Up until now the most advanced chips have been manufactured in 65nm CMOS technology. The firm's biggest announcement is that the Longson 3B eight-core server processor, which has been available in 65nm for a couple of years, has been shrunk to 32nm with further plans for a move to 28nm. The new version of the processor is not only a die shrink, but also includes a new L3 cache. The original version of the Longson 3B chip had a 256KB L2 cache for each core. This was originally thought to be enough for a decent performance, but according to Chen, real life showed that there were too many cache misses that resulted in a performance penalty, as data had to be loaded from main memory. Therefore the 32nm version includes a shared 8MB L3 cache. In addition the processor frequency has been increased to 1.3GHz and the thermals are lower, although Chen would not reveal exactly how much. On the mobile side, the 2H processor that has been the focus for a couple of years has now sampled to customers, who have in total received around 10,000 samples. The Longson 2H is really a system-on-chip (SoC) with both a MIPS compatible processor and integrated graphics. The chip first taped out about a year ago, but the chips that came back from ST Microelectronics were in need of some improvement and a second tape out. ICT is now eagerly awaiting responses from customers who are testing the chip to see if further modifications and another tape out is needed. The intended audience for the Longson 2H chip is, among others, electronic classrooms, that are very much on the agenda in China, but we should also expect to see it in portable systems in the health care sector. And then there is the brand new Longson 3D. This chip is still about two years away and in the early design stages, but according to Chen the main focus of the chip will be single thread performance. The plan for Longson is to open sales and marketing offices in Europe and the US and to later establish research centres outside of China. At the same time, ICT is also actively participating in the definition of the Chinese Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). This work is still very much in progress, but it is certain that the final ISA will be close if not identical to MIPS. The purpose of the Chinese ISA is not to exclude foreign competition but simply to use domestic Chinese resources better with a common architecture. The common Chinese ISA will simplify things like compiler and systems development. The purpose of the Chinese ISA is to unite the disparate ISAs in China to better utilise resources, and to compete with other ISAs that are provided by, for example, ARM, x86, MIPS and SPARC. The Chinese ISA will resemble MIPS in its simplicity, but it has not yet been decided if it will be MIPS compatible.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347033885946</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:04:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347034914257-78</Id><Title>INTC Has Been Slow Because....</Title><Msg>PC users have been waiting for Windows 8.</Msg><Username>bizzybodytooyou</Username><Timestamp>1347034914257</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:21:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347034968554-79</Id><Title>time to start making ARMH chips.</Title><Msg>Looks like the BOD needs to step in and take OCOM up on its offer to open its wallet to secure it's supply of chips for its smart phones.

It has to be lower either before or after earnings are reported. It would be healthier for it to be lower before earnings, then rally after earnings, but the way this market is, I doubt that will happen. Just look at Ford, they warned a couple of months ago, it dropped 20+% in the following month after the warning and the stock is not yet back to the pre-warning price as the market has made a huge surge off the June low. Nope, you've got to expect something similar with INTC.</Msg><Username>stoptheinsanity2000</Username><Timestamp>1347049294790</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 16:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347049821152-145</Id><Topic><Title>I bought another 15K shares at $24.00 today</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1347048463718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 16:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should never average in, or buy at all for that matter, the day of an earnings warning.

QCOM has a 18 PE and INTC at 31 would be only be 14 PE. This offer would represent a 25% premium over their closing price and would look pretty good to the casual observer. If this offer came, expect AAPL, Samsung &amp; Google to join in the bidding war. Final offer would probably not be over an 18 PE or $40.00/share to the winner. QCOM and AAPL have already offered TSMC over a billion to get first rights on supplies and were rejected. Imagine what would happen if you had a snap dragon on 22 nm?

Intel's CPU is very very good but it is stuck in Computers we see sold as Notebooks and desktops and servers. Intel is missing the HUGE profits to be made selling into phones and Tablets --mainly Apple Ipods. Looks grim. In fact, if Intel were to stay locked out of phones and tablets for years, it would be very grim. The stock is being traded down based upon the Intel warning but it has been trading down for sometime now even before this warning based upon the view that Intel is unlikely to get a BIG piece of the Phone chip sales. Is it true that Intel cannot win over Apple for Iphones using X86? Time will tell but before you make that bet understand this. Intel will be shrinking to 14 nm soon and that chip will be vastly superior to all other CPUs used in phones. Apple sells its great Iphones and people love them because of the software and the applications. Yet--Iphones sell at a premium price and it would be a great selling point for Apple to have the very very best CPU in its Iphones. A chip that is faster and thus makes the Iphone faster than most PCs and Notebooks would be a plus for Apple. Intel is in talks with Apple and the talks are never ending. The two made offices of the two companies are just 10 miles apart you know. Apple hates Samsung who now makes the Arm based chips for Apple. The two companies are fighting in the courts. Apple is tired of having its design and secrets copied by Samsung. Intel make no phone and will NOT make phones. The deal between Apple and Intel, it if happens, will come just as a couple new Super Fabs come on line from Intel able to make the huge volume Apple needs. Does the market see this happening? NO but--the markets never see anything happening before they happen. Fab 42 Chandler, Arizona, USA 2013 450 mm[1], 14 nm I say Apple is with Intel using this fab to supply Apple in 2013.

Intelâs lead in process tech is now biting it, the competition, and the tools industry. Lets look at both of these as separate issues because in many ways they are not at all related. The first issue at hand is Intelâs lead on the rest of the semiconductor fabrication world, be they foundries or in-house producers. Intel is on 22nm, Intel is producing FinFETs in volume, and everyone else is two years behind. Make that two years behind getting to 22/20nm, closer to four years behind on making FinFETs, all taken with a large dollop of optimism. The public roadmaps of the competition, that would mainly be TSMC and the Common Platform trio, Samsung, Global Foundries, and IBM, are going to go to 20nm with planar structures. Their roadmaps all point to FinFETs at the 14nm node, ostensibly 2 years behind 20nm. Publicly, 20nm will be here in 2013 although most industry watchers think 2014 is a much more likely possibility. This is a massive lead for Intel, they have both a full shrink and a very difficult technical challenge, fins, developed and in mass production. No one else is even close. That lead however brings an even more thorny problem, tools. The tools needed for 22/20nm are expensive, hard to produce, and in demand from absolutely no one other than Intel. Therein lies the problem. Why? If you are the tools industry, why would you want to sink the time, engineering bandwidth, and money in to a product line that has one customer? Granted, that customer is huge, has gobs of money, and is willing to buy bleeding edge products, but they arenât stupid. Tools that go in to bleeding edge fabs are shatteringly expensive, price tags in the tens of million of dollars are not uncommon for litho equipment, and a modern fab needs a large number of them. Even with this price and quantity, the revenue from a single massive client pales in comparison to the multi-year tools development process that each new node requires. To make a profit from the new tools that enable the next fabrication node, vendors need to have a lot of clients. In the past, this was the case, there would be a leader that bought the initial units, and by the time production ramped, others would be there. Some lagged, some were closer to the first, but there was a range of customer demand. The system worked. Now, Intel is between 2-4 years ahead of the industry depending on how you count. If a vendor makes tools for Intelâs schedule, there is a long long lag between the time Intel buys their units and the day that the next order comes in. That type of lag is not desirable, and if you are allocating R&amp;D dollars, tool purchases, and manufacturing lines, why be 2+ years ahead of the majority of your customer base? That is why Intelâs lead is a blessing and a curse, they can produce transistors that no one else can, but they require tools that no one else,yet, needs to do it. If a vendor is going to produce those tools for Intel, Intel is probably going to be asked to pay more than their fair share or wait. At the 22nm node, this didnât bite Intel hard if at all. The litho tools are all use 193nm light sources, and the wafers are the same 300mm size they have always been. The new devices needed to enable 22nm are not all that different from the ones needed for 32nm, so it all worked out more or less to plan. Unfortunately, there are two major transitions needed for post 20/22nm nodes, EUV and 450mm. Technically speaking, neither is absolutely necessary to make 14nm transistors, but cost and throughput concerns mean these new technologies are needed to do so profitably. The more commoditized the chips produced, the higher the pressure for more efficient tools at the next node. So the debate rages on as to where the exact break points are, and what the downsides are to not having one or both, but in short order, there will be no choice. At SemiCon last year, all of the panels and talks on 450mm wafers said the same thing, the industry is moving there together. Some predicted this would be at 14nm, others are saying 10nm, but no one questioned that the major players would all have to move at once. That panel included high ranking Intel process personnel as well as other industry giants. If the industry decides that 14nm is the transition point for 450mm, everyone will be making 14nm chips on 450mm wafers, 10nm if that ends up being the consensus. What is clear is that no one will be doing a 450mm wafer a node earlier that the rest. Why? Because the tools vendors all said that once the crossover point is agreed upon, they will only make tools for that node that use 450mm wafers, the market isnât big enough to sustain both 300mm and 450mm variants of the same device. If Intel moves 2-4 years before everyone else, they will have to convince the entire tool chain to move just for them. To do that, all of Intelâs competition has to agree to do so as well. Possible? Yes. Probable? Not without guarantees of profitability for everyone. The same holds true for EUV. While most think this will be necessary at the 14nm node, you can make do with 193nm light sources and triple pattering in a pinch. It may bite foundries in the margins, but it can be done. If EUV comes to market at the 14 or 10nm node, it doesnât matter much because Intel will still be 2-4 years ahead, and face the same outstretched hands from the tools chain. Being a leader used to mean you could do what no one else could. Now it means you have to pay for what they donât need yet to get the ball rolling. What is the price tag for this lead? For lithographic equipment, the largest of the three vendors, ASML, needed a tad over $1 billion to grease the wheels. Of that, $680 million was for 450mm R&amp;D, $340 was aimed at EUV development. While litho tools are probably the most complex parts of the chain, there are dozens of other steps that each require a new compound, tool, or process for the whole process to work. Even if everyone else together only costs what ASML did, that is not exactly a minor outlay for Intel. If Intel doesnât pay up, or one vendor canât keep up for some reason, the rest are essentially paperweights. Second sourcing everything doesnât really help because with one customer, that just means Intel is funding two competing R&amp;D teams, and that just means twice the 10-digit price tag. That said, all this financial outlay will mean Intel can do what no one else can, and move to nodes before anyone else can too. The double edged sword is that they have to pay for what no one else needs, likely all by themselves. To make matters worse, if, and when the rest of the players catch up, they will have a fully debugged set of tools to buy off the shelf, paid for with Intel sweat equity and dollars. Both are seen as much preferable to the foundries doing it themselves, but the ever-increasing Intel lead is not viewed in such a fond light. Since Intel started mass production of 22nm wafers in late 2011, if their two year cadence on new nodes doesnât change, you can reasonably expect that 14nm wafers will start in late 2013. That would be 18 months away. Tools orders would probably have to be done by now, and equipment moved in to the fabs starting in 1H 2013. It is not a quick process. Since there arenât really 450mm wafer tools available in mass quantities yet, nor is EUV ready for prime time, that precludes either tech for initial 14nm production. That leaves 10nm, or possibly an updated 14nm process for EUV, and orders need to be placed for those in about two years, give or take, with initial equipment installation in three or so. If these devices donât exist yet, it is kind of hard to do either one. So Intel is laying out $1 billion to make sure ASML is there. Other fabs are said to be interested in the concept, but for the moment, whatâs their hurry? If Intel essentially has to pay for everything or twiddle their thumbs, guess what they will do. And what the others wonât, they can always jump on board when it suits their timetables. On current nodes, there are enough fabs and foundries running wafers to justify tools development for the âmassâ market, misnomer that it may be. No one expects any new players to jump in, and everyone expects one or two marginal players to merge or shut down. The number of buyers for semiconductor equipment is shrinking fast. With this shrinking pool of paying customers comes a need for vendors servicing them to have products that reach as much of the market as possible. This rush to the middle means no going out on a limb, no taking chances, and keeping in mind that a single misstep can end your company. If you go out on a limb, you do so knowing that there is either no cost in it, or have guaranteed returns. That is why Intel paid ASML for EUV and 450mm development, $1 billion goes a long way towards meeting the no cost goal. That same money is a good indicator that Intel is both willing and able to buy the devices when they are ready, but it is not a guarantee. For those vendors who are not recipients of Intelâs largess, it is a time for some serious soul-searching.S|A Share on google_plusone Share on hackernewsShare on emailShare on googleShare on redditShare on stumbleuponShare on favoritesShare on gmailShare on bloggerMore Sharing Services</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1347063304418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347063324817-167</Id><Topic><Title>CRAMER JUST THREW INTEL UNDER THE BUS</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1347055828069</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 18:10:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time to throw Cramer under the bus.

I participated in the PCI SIG, the USB Committee and the Plug and Play Association. And wrote several books and articles on the PC architecture. And spoke at many shows here and abroad, some sponsored by Intel. The beginning of the end was the USB bus. The thought within Intel was, "hey, all these jokers are making super I/O chips, BIOS, audio controllers, chipsets, IDE controllers, etc. We can steal all that money from them by making these gadgets in-house and not have to deal with the support issues any more." Joke's one them. These companies had top talent and were working for free because INTC paid as much as a cotton plantation. Fast forward to the post-USB era. You still have 40 million cables on your desktop and the performance is so-so. What was lost was twenty or thirty think tanks who were doing 20% of INTC's R&amp;D for them. Very stupid strategy. This basically cost them the computer market although it took a decade to unfold. Many of these people jumped ship to Apple, Google and the rest. INTC will never get this back. It's all karma. Apple people all laugh at the INTC-bots who loaded up at $70 bucks. That's it. I'm right, you know it and go home and beat your significant other.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1347070091151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 22:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347070675551-176</Id><Topic><Title>I will explain how Intel failed and how they will never recover.</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1347070091151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 22:08:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LoL.

Your mother must have had anal sex with a Bush and produced a fine product known as you, the King Idiot of all time, all universes and all parallel universes if such things are possible. I worked for AMD and Intel. Intel is the soul-less, godless, heartless stealer of all things monetary and intellectual. AMD is the kinder, gentler company with better engineers, but less propensity to lie, cheat and steal from others, hence their inferior financial status. Thus, a tie.
