TSMC is also going to make 20 nanometer chips, but production is going to start in the second half of the year. Said production will also be low volume. Our gut tells us that we’re not going to see any 20 nm Snapdragons from Qualcomm until very late 2013 or early 2014. Above from Android Authority [So, no one really expects any TSMC 20nm production until 2014. Which likely means, unless everything goes perfectly at TSMC, no real volume unit 2015. And when has anything involving fabrication gone perfectly at TSMC? They started having major production problems at 45nm for gosh sakes. Is Apple going to wait until 2015 for 20nm, by which time Intel will be close to 10nm? And the idea of building 20 and 14nm at the same time? That's a devastating sign that the ARM fabrication roadmap is totally broken and they are left with the "Hail, Mary".]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356238836305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 00:00:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356241002637-2</Id><Topic><Title>ARMs 20nm Doesn't Get the Nod, Even When It Does Arrive (Unknown)</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356235578093</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:06:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will probably come online I'd say 6 months after Intel's 22nm so Intel will have a short-lived lead on SOC process, the same as it had when it introduced 32nm Medfield.

It is still angling to overtake ARM through a combination of architecture and process technology such that its chips are clearly better than ARMs and therefore get a tight integration advantage for IA across computing platforms. It hasn't been able to do so in the last generation with Medfield and if you assume equal progress on both ARM and Intel camps on technology, which is a reasonable assumption, won't be able to do so at any point in time in the future. Where this decision of Intel's leaves Apple is that if it wants to get its in-house designed chips manufactured it has to go with the best manufacturing option available which appears to be TSMC or Samsung, possible GloFo. It doesn't really matter where they are on an absolute level as long as they maintain relative position with respect to Intel in terms of process technology. Most likely with the recent increase in investment we have seen at all the major foundries, the process lead will reduce because it is predicated on investment, not on Intel's unique understanding of IC production. This is the position stated by TSMC's Cheng and negated by Intel's Otellini in their claims that they have come up with something unique with 3D transistors. Qualcomm and NVidia are more or less in the same position as Apple because of ARMs architectural advantage which effectively negates Intel's current process advantage.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1356247176344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 02:19:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356249995156-4</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung, TSMC and 20nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356238836305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 00:00:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To assume equal progress by both on technology is ridiculous.

Sylvie Barak 12/10/2012 4:30 PM EST Scalable roadmap Ultimately, said Bohr, the distinction between regular processors and SoCs is blurring, with even CPUs like Ivy Bridge incorporating typical SoC elements like multiple computing cores, graphics, high performance IO circuits and cache. SoC,s however, are still taking those components to the extreme. “It’s a matter of degree,” Bohr said. Indeed, Intel’s SoC is almost identical to its CPU version in terms of structure, including only some “minor tweaking” to provide either the lower leakage or higher volatage. It could even be described as a “superset” of the CPU version with expanded features. The SoC and CPU versions share many of the same process features; the same transistor structure and pitch along with similar interconnect and fab process equipment. “These two technologies can be run side by side in the same factory,” said Bohr, noting that all the yield learning for Ivy Bridge had been translatable. Bohr acknowledged that SoCs had presented Intel with new challenges. “When you talk about leakage, once you get down into the below 30 pico amp range, you have to deal with multiple sources of leakage, whether it’s through the gate oxide or leakage from source to drain or leakage from the drain to the substrate,” he said, adding that it had taken a lot of “tweaking an balancing” to finally get it right. The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said. In terms of how Intel’s 22-nm SoC process stacks up against the 28-nm low power or forthcoming 20-nm processes from TSMC, Bohr claimed Intel had “far surpassed” the performance and low leakage capabilities of competitors. “We have a significant lead over our competitors,” he asserted. Intel is also banking on he new technology process having a long tail. “We know that it’s scalable to 14-nm,” he said, concluding that tri-gate was not only a big power advantage for Intel’s CPUs, but for other low power SoCs.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356278019909</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:53:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356278173429-14</Id><Topic><Title>ARM and Cadence Tape Out First 14nm FinFET Test Chip</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356277405351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:43:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the EETIMES IBM, Intel face off at 22 nm Rick Merritt 12/10/2012 8:29 PM EST SAN FRANCISCO – Intel and IBM went head-to-head with their latest 22-nm technologies in back-to-back papers at the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) here Monday (Dec. 10). Separately, a top Intel fab executive commented on increasing wafer costs and the company’s foundry business. IBM said it is prototyping server processors in a new 3-D ready, 22-nm process technology it hopes will deliver 25 to 35 percent boosts over its 32-nm node. Intel retains an edge with several 22-nm chips already in volume production, and disclosure at IEDM of a variant of the process for SoCs for a wide range of applications. The Intel paper showed support for “high drive current across the spectrum of leakage and a full suite of SoC tools,” Mark Bohr, head of Intel’s process technology development group, said in a brief interview. The process is geared for a much wider array of designs than that of IBM, he added. Bohr said Intel’s 22-nm FinFET process is cost effective, contradicting report it is 30 to 40 percent more expensive than TSMC’s 28-nm planar process. The addition of FinFET adds only 3 percent to the cost of the process. Its use of 80-nm minimum feature sizes can be made with a single pass of 193-nm lithography tools, making it cost effective. Projections from an IMEC keynote that 14-nm wafers will be 90 percent more expensive than 28-nm parts due to the lack of EUV lithography are inaccurate, Bohr asserted. The cost increase for 14-nm wafers at Intel “is nowhere near that,” he said. “Cost per wafer has always gone up marginally each generation, somewhat more so in recent generations, but that’s more than offset by increases in transistor density so that the cost per transistor continues to go down at 14 nm,” Bohr said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356278173429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:56:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356278623216-15</Id><Topic><Title>ARM and Cadence Tape Out First 14nm FinFET Test Chip</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356277405351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:43:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile, ARM just taped out a FinFET at 14nm...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356278623216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:03:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356278986378-16</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation Really Important Information Here...</Title><Username>clarepascalnvu9758</Username><Timestamp>1308758944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-06-22 12:09:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am surprised with their analysis!</Msg><Username>davidsamuel572</Username><Timestamp>1356278986378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:09:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356279168519-17</Id><Topic><Title>First Intel Tablet on Android from Chinese tablet maker Ramos - For $288 - Shipping early Jan</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1356274822255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:00:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>viva Ramos --featuring an Intel Atom Z2460 Medfield processor</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1356279168519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:12:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356280423894-18</Id><Title>Do we get to pick over the bones of AMD?</Title><Msg>How much bottom line does that give us, eh?</Msg><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1356280423894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:33:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356280487838-19</Id><Title>There was no information when 14 nm ARM processors will become available.</Title><Msg>Giggles</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1356280487838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:34:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356280654315-20</Id><Topic><Title>ARM and Cadence Tape Out First 14nm FinFET Test Chip</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356277405351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:43:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Taping out is not producing.

They continue to be by far the #1 semiconductor company, and the only one left to own its own fab network, which happens to be at least a couple of years ahead of its nearest competitor. They have the most design resources, the strongest performance micro-architecture on the planet, and the best track record for winning against any competitor who has tried to unseat them. In short, anyone who thinks Intel has had a bad year, or is off their game, needs to have their head examined. While Intel is not perfection, they are the closest thing to it in the industry, with dependable execution, and the cash resources and CapEx to stay ahead. The reality is just as such that it takes several years to change a semiconductor design pipeline, and Intel hadn't invested as early as a hand full of other vendors. That late decision alone has cost them billions in opportunity, but it hardly means they are out of the game. -------------------------------- from Tenchu Beamer, how could you forget the huge Romley server launch in April of 2012? That's a huge revenue stream for Intel, and it was key in offsetting some of the softness in desktops and laptops this year. Tenchu ----------------------------------- from wbmw again: Indeed, that was careless of me. Romley was Intel's final blow to the small bit of market share AMD had left in servers - and they did it with a 32nm product line. The entire systems architecture was built for performance, scalability, reliability, bandwidth, I/O expansion, and everything a traditional server could want. What I think is great is that Intel didn't stop there and call it perfection. They still developed Centerton for micro-servers, in spite of the fact that they had delivered Romley only several months back. I'm sure ARM and others weren't expecting Intel to move so fast. It was great to see them execute on several key server launches (didn't mention Poulson, but that happened too).</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356288035700</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 13:40:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356288321940-40</Id><Title>Current earnings estimates</Title><Msg>Another post from wbmw user on investorhub regarding current earnings estimate: Didn't your teacher ever tell you that two data points do not make a trend?? 2013 earnings is a blind estimate, based on the fact that 2012 came in lower than 2011 - and I don't believe it.

Well you have NO evidence Theo's info is incorrect... Are you suggesting Theo made it up...??" Yes. My evidence is from Theo himself. He shows his calculations and assumptions in the article. He states his assumptions. I also know that Intel negotiates all orders at the 100,000 part level. He also points out that he does not know what price Intel negotiated for the ongoing service contract. Did Intel sell below manufacturing cost? What is the cost of one 22nm 300mm Intel processed wafer? What is the die size on the Intel PHI?. What is the die size on the Xeon E5-2567W v2, is a 22nm Ivy Bridge EP? If you have the die size, you can make an educated guess about the wafer sort yield based on industry defect densities. With the wafer cost, sort yield and die sizes you can estimate the final product manufacturing cost. Theo is making assumptions on these. They are not public. "INtel did the exact same thing, mutliple times, and was forced to settle the multiple lawsuits a few years back..." What exact same thing are you referring to? Intel was sued for selling 100,000 Xeon E5-2567W v2 and Intel PHI?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356289871993</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 14:11:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356290898705-43</Id><Topic><Title>AMD was a much stronger competitor than ARM could ever hope to be...</Title><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356271468699</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:04:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you gotta be kidding.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356290898705</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 14:28:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356292217265-44</Id><Topic><Title>AMD was a much stronger competitor than ARM could ever hope to be...</Title><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356271468699</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:04:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From your previous post, you don't seem to realize that Motorola is now part of Google as Google acquired them last year.

The answer is Intel once had a de facto monopoly with the extensions it had patented on the 486. That is all for naught now with ARMH and others coming at them from a different angle. Intel can make the fastest and best of any chip, but that is only a part of what matters to consumers. ARMH is very aggressive and will challenge Intel on every turn because they have opportunities AMD never saw, or many times could not legally do, due to patent infringement. I am long ARMH and it has done very well. I had a position in Intel which I just sold off. I would never short Intel or any stock, shorting is just too dangerous if things turn against you.

With Haswell, Intel introduces three powerful features that lower the power consumption of its CPUs and increase its performance. Intel has built inside its CPUs a special processing unit, called "Power Control Unit". Bellow there's an excerpt from a PCWorld article by Loyd Case explaining how good its upgraded version works in Haswell: [...] Intel can manage power almost to the transistor level by using a special processing unit built directly inside the main CPU--Intel calls it the Power Control Unit. The PCU looks at which parts of the processor aren't being used, and can turn individual parts on and off as needed. The problem, though, isn't putting parts of the CPU to sleep. The problem is waking up the processor fast enough to be useful. [..] The solution in Haswell is to add a third power state, something Intel designers call "Active Idle." Active Idle, also labeled SOix, is an extremely low-power active state that uses 20 times less power than Ivy Bridge. The PC system itself thinks it's awake, but the CPU is still mostly asleep. This trick translates into wake times of, at worst, a few hundred milliseconds. [...] The second feature is Branch Prediction. In a few words, it is a way for the CPU to expect what work is coming and use its resources more efficiently, reducing power consumption and increasing performance. Here is how it works from the same article as above: [...] One trick is branch prediction, which lets the CPU peek ahead to see which instructions are likely to be executed in the near future. If the CPU knows which instructions will be coming down the pipeline, it can be much more efficient about allocating CPU resources, turning on only parts of the CPU that are needed. [...] Also, the more work a CPU can do in a single cycle, the better the performance at the same power usage. So Intel added the ability to do two floating point multiply-adds every clock cycle, doubling the performance throughput over Ivy Bridge for the same power usage. [...] Last but not least, comes Haswell's advanced graphics core. It is so powerful that it could bring, through Windows 8, modern PC games into tablets! That would expand tablet demand significantly as it would now become a high end portable gaming console! From the same article: [...]While Haswell's 3D graphics engine is substantially improved over past Intel efforts, desktop PC users will likely still want high-end discrete graphics cards for best PC game performance. But Haswell's graphics core will make extremely thin Ultrabooks respectable gaming platforms, and the new GPU opens up possibilities for modern PC games running on Haswell-based tablets.

What's unclear is how far down the TDP stack Intel will be able to take the architecture. Intel seems to believe that TDPs below 8W are attainable, but it's too early to tell just how low Haswell can go. It's more than likely that Intel knows and just doesn't want to share at this point. I don't believe we'll see fanless Haswell designs, but Broadwell is another story entirely. There's no diagram for where we go from here. Intel originally claimed that Atom would service an expanded range of TDPs all the way up to 10W. With Core architectures dipping below 10W, I do wonder if that slide was a bit of misdirection. I wonder if, instead, the real goal is to drive Core well into Atom territory. If Intel wants to solve its ARM problem, that would appear to be a very good solution. from anandtech</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356300561594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:09:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356301020730-64</Id><Title>Inside Job</Title><Msg>For those who haven't seen the movie "Inside Job", check it out.

This is a common sense observation that is often lost in the conversations about Intel and foundry work. The only two fabless semiconductor companies that meet the above requirements would be Xilinx (XLNX) and Altera (ALTR), since both companies make Field Programmable Gate Arrays and, therefore, are not competitive with Intel. Both companies would benefit greatly from access to Intel's 22 and 14nm processes. After the above two companies, virtually all other large fabless semiconductor companies compete with Intel in one way or another and would, therefore, not be candidates for Intel foundry work. The Intel foundry business will, of necessity, serve primarily OEM equipment makers such as Cisco (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL). I think that Mr. Otellini was giving an intended, or unintended, hint that Apple would be moving their business to Intel and we would not have a clue about it until Apple was ready to completely cut off Samsung. Cisco is no big secret, since the rumors seem to involve new business that is not being fabbed anywhere at this time. Altera and Xilinx are not particular secrets since the industry knows that both companies use more than one foundry and move their business around. Apple is the only potential Intel foundry customer that has a great deal to lose by early disclosure of their intentions. from Russ Fischer</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356301036789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356301364161-66</Id><Title>The clowns don't even have to vote.

So the likelihood that the device will debut at CES 2013 is extremely high, especially given that Microsoft may use the tablet as the flagship model of the glut of Windows RT and Windows 8 devices that will flood the event. What would be even more interesting is if the Surface Pro features a fourth generation Intel Core processor, rather than a third generation one, in a bid to stay ahead of the competition. Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it won't be holding a keynote presentation this time around, so its announcements will likely be kept to a minimum. Haswell, the fourth generation Intel Core Previous generations of Intel Core processors have been launched at CES, so seeing the fourth generation Intel Core processor, based on the Haswell microarchitecture, at CES 2013 should not be too much of a surprise. Intel described it last year as being the platform that will “fuel future of mobile computing innovation” with faster, thinner, lighter and more secure systems. What we know so far about the system is that it will use a 22nm manufacturing process and will include HD graphics support, new instructions for faster encryption and performance, new hardware-based security products and low-power processor sub-states which will reduce power consumption, with a thermal design power of only 10 watts. It's also likely that we will see systems with fourth generation Intel Core processors at CES 2013, though they may not be immediately available.

The new processors are expected to come in the first quarter of 2013, so we may even see a showing of the new processors at Intel's CES booth or press conference. Let's start with the bottom chip, as seen above. It will come with the Pentium branding and will feature a max TDP of 10W. Sporting 2 cores and 2 threads, the model will not make use of Turbo Boost or HyperThreading and it only features 2MB of L3 cache. The included graphics are just "Intel HD Graphics." Moving up the line, they have one Core i3 offering in the form of the i3-3229Y, which is a 13W TDP part. It will feature HyperThreading and will come in a dual-core model clocked at 1.4GHz. One of the two i5 offerings, the i5-3339Y, is a dual-core, HyperThreading part that comes clocked at 1.5GHz, with a max Turbo Boost of 2GHz. The i5-3439Y is similar, with the only difference being a higher max Turbo Speed of 2.3GHz. Finally, the i7 model, i7-3669Y, will start at the same 1.5GHz, but will Turbo all the way to 2.6GHz, all while remaining within that 13W TDP envelope. It will also come with 4MB of L3 cache. All of the parts feature a 7W Scenario Design Power, meaning that they will draw only 7W if kept at a cooler 80*C. The TDP is calculated with a processor temperature of 105*C, the highest the chip is allowed to achieve. It's not clear if these processors will work their way into the MacBook Air and other Ultrabooks or tablets, but I have a feeling they will.

The reason is simple. Only a relatively fixed amount of logic is required to decode x86 'CISC' like instructions into a more RISC-like core. Except for some minor tweaks, this hasn't changed in many years. However, because feature size on chips has gotten a lot smaller, the portion of chip required for this decoding logic has also gotten smaller. To the point now where the amount of space it takes up and the power it consumes is essentially zilch. A second reason is that it is NOT possible to improve performance these days by simplifying existing cpu core logic. All of those simplifications have already been done. The only way to improve performance is by adding fairly complex bits of logic such as bigger caches, larger TLBs, better branch prediction algorithms, on-cpu call/return address stacks and optimizations, register rename tables, and so forth. (There are concepts that can improve aggregate performance with simpler designs by moving to many (32+) cores, but software has a decade of catching up to do to take advantage of those sorts of cpus). To the author: I liked the article, though I should point out that in-order vs out-of-order execution is only a small part of a super-scaler design. Intel has the advantage of being able to start from much higher-end architectures (xeon, sandybridge, ivy, etc) and simply reduce cache sizes and remove features until the desired power envelope is met. The original Atom started from an older Pentium design and worked upward. What Intel is not really telling people is that the real golden egg for power efficiency is moving downward from the higher-end cores, not moving upward from the original Atom. At some point they will meet. I have no doubt Intel will pull more tricks to make them meet more quickly. Ultimately the power envelope for higher end cores will be measured by nanoamps per instruction executed rather than measured by core frequency or scaling optimizations. This means that in the next year or two Intel will be completely outgunning ARM cores on the low-end. ARM has a much more difficult task ahead of it. Intel has already solved issues related to high-performance execution and only needs to fit those features into a power envelope. ARM, on the other hand, has to research and invent high-performance execution solutions, which is a MUCH harder task. from MattZN2 on Apha</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356303442982</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:57:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356303778561-78</Id><Topic><Title>ARM and Cadence Tape Out First 14nm FinFET Test Chip</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356277405351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:43:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This is a tape-out of a test chip to help develop a process." how insightful "More PR fluff from the idiots" Why is taping out a FinFET at 14nm fluff...

To get an idea of what the announcement of a 14nm tape out mean, you can look back at history. October 18, 2011, ARM and TSMC Taped Out First 20nm ARM Cortex-A15 Multicore Processor. 14 months ago, they taped out the first 20nm ARM. "ARM's Simon Segars, general manager of processor and physical IP divisions, said that ARM-based 20 nm SoCs could be appearing in smartphones as early as late 2013." If my math is correct, it will be 2-years from the 2011 tape out and late 2013 when 20nm parts will "start appearing". 14nm parts are still 2 years away to "start appearing" unless they are able to compress the historical schedule.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356315891682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 21:24:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356315940702-90</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Why They Might Want To Be Apple's Processor Foundry</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356303024663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:50:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You've flooded this board with pro-Intel articles that we can all read for 3 or four years now (yet the stock has gone absolutely nowhere in a decade), bashed ARM relentlessly (as ARM stock price has gone nowhere but up), created lists as to why Intel was going to the moon, encouraged people to buy that stock at 29 on it's way to 20, encouraged shorts to cover at 29 on the way to 20, and on and on...........

[Well, butkus, if it doesn't result in volume production for years and years and years, it's irrelevant. And that's been the case. Have you seen any ARM 20nm production? It taped out ages ago...] Meanwhile, ARM just taped out a FinFET at 14nm..." [And maybe in four or five years we'll see some production. Kinda like that ARM 64-bit server stuff that you have been hyping forever but won't actually be here forever and even then won't amount to a hill of beans. ARMs fabrication is a disaster as indicated by its new plans to try to bypass 20nm and move directly to 14nm. As if that's going to work! You don't put desperate measures into your roadmap unless your roadmap is broken.
