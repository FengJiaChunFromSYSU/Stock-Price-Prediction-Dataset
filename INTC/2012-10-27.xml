There is a kernel of truth in that opinion if, and only if, your definition of "mobile business" is defined as smart phone and tablet SoC (System on a Chip) chips. If you zoom back from that narrow view it becomes clear that Intel has led the mobility trend beginning with the Centrino Platform of nearly 10 years ago. Centrino brought standardization and reliability to the mobile PC experience. During the past five years Intel has been engaged in an effort to gain control of the data center server chip business. Some of the competition for the server business at that time was Oracle (ORCL) SPARC, IBM (IBM) Power, and AMD (AMD) in x86. The current status of the server market is: SPARC is being put out to pasture. The IBM Power chip is still being used, but is losing ground rapidly to x86. Even IBM offers x86 server products. IBM will continue with the Power architecture because of corporate ego and they need to fill the fabs they have. Apple's move from the Power PC chip to Intel x86 in 2006 was because of lack of roadmap improvements for the Power architecture. AMD had some promise, but has since become a "dead man walking." The Intel x86 architecture has clearly won the server segment, and within the x86, Intel has 95% market share and AMD has 5% market share and is declining. All other server architectures have about 10% market share that is rapidly moving to x86. This is a huge win for Intel. Being the dominant architecture to power the cloud is certainly "mobile" business. You just can't carry it in your pocket. The high performance computing (super computer) market is an extension of the technology that has won the server business. Intel's Knights Corner chip has pretty much shut down all contenders in high performance computing. Intel needed to consolidate and control the server and HPC segments since it is a contest that will be won once and never fought again, due to the R&amp;D and capital requirements to be a player. The hundreds of millions of PC CPU chips sold by Intel has provided the necessary scale to win a dominant position in the server and HPC segment. Servers and HPC are a $12-15 billion business that is essentially sole sourced to Intel today. The company simply had to bolt down these segments before moving on to smartphone and tablet SoCs. For the tech challenged pundits who think that RISC trumps CISC, I might point out that SPARC and Power are both RISC architectures that will fall victim to the CISC x86 architecture. To summarize, Intel has a near monopoly on all computing CPUs from $30 entry level Atom chips through $4000 server chips, and on to $10,000 Knights Corner chips. What's left? The answer is the $10-15 billion smart phone and tablet application processor market. Much of the Intel resources that have been leveraged to control everything above these "pocket mobile" devices is now available to target the smart phone chips. The Intel Medfield SoC has found some non US smart phone designs. to get a little peek at what faces Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM), read this very slowly. The author has found a prototype of a Clovertrail powered tablet to benchmark against the Microsoft Surface and the ASUS VivoTab, both of which are powered by Nvidia Tegra 3 application processors. The Clovertrail tablet make the other two look like toys. The Clovertrail is basically a tweaked dual core Medfield. The Clovertrail is still made on the 32nm process. We can only speculate about performance of the out-of-order next generation Atom core built on 22nm and 14nm, that will ramp during 2013. According to Intel a 4G LTE function is coming by the end of 2012 and will ramp quickly in 2013. It is unclear whether it will be a stand alone device or be embedded in a quad core Atom based SoC, or both. In any case it will be a bad dream for Qualcomm. There will be a "forehead slap" of global proportions when this Intel story comes into focus for analysts and institutional investors. Better to buy Intel now with the knowledge that it is unavoidable that Intel dominates the smart phone chips just as they dominate all higher levels of computing devices.</Msg><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1351360894738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:01:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351362868980-21</Id><Topic><Title>Check Important Info Intel Corporation.</Title><Username>nikitacsx452988</Username><Timestamp>1351359233086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:33:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

This is the x86 mobile juggernaut heading their way. Once you basically understand that 32nm Atom is the architectural equivalent of ARM A8 (in-order 2 way issue) and it generally destroys it and that it also has hyperthreading as an inherent multithreading advantage you realize that ARM has a fundamental architectural handicap against Atom which forces it to throw out-of-order, 3-way issue and multi-cores at the problem to get parity. Atom isn't even trying architecturally but it will soon enough with the 22nm generation. [marsavian, I have seen your other posts/reply's but have been in airports all week] Do you think a genuine 30%+ performance profile is 'good' enough over the tegra 3? The tegra 3 in the surface is still a 'phone' SOC (T30) and has a very poor memory subsystem. Using geekbench as a comparison, you can find shipping A9 products with a 30% performance gain over Tegra 3 (on a core by core basis). As for OO, the A9 isn't the real deal, it's with the A15. The A9 is half cocked, and has a shockingly bad memory subsystem (even when implemented well). When we see real benchmarks I still expect tegra 3 to give Covertrail a run for it's money over many benchmarks especially (threaded) floating point. It'll all come down to the GPU, battery use, and BOM [I do share your view about ARM on windows]. As for the A15, benchmarks are starting to appear online and if sunsprider is your thing, then it kills Clovertrail (660+ V 909) but it's a different browser subsystem so pinch of salt and all that.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351363891042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351365679438-24</Id><Topic><Title>Check Important Info Intel Corporation.</Title><Username>nikitacsx452988</Username><Timestamp>1351359233086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:33:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have it already.

The new D2560 dual core is positioned above the D2550, which was launched in the first quarter of this year. The D2500 continues to be available as an entry-level model. The new CPU is also built using the 32 nm Saltwell architecture with a Cedarview processor core. It runs at 2.0 GHz, which is faster than the D2550's 1.86 GHz but 133 MHz slower than the previously canceled D2700 Cedarview chip. Intel did not provide any information on why the D2700 was shelved, other than noting that market demand had shifted when it was dropped not even three quarters after its introduction in Q3 2011. Like the other Cedarview processors, the D2560 is rated at a maximum power consumption of 10 watts. Like the D2550, it can run four threads in parallel and is priced at $47 (tray).

The journalist that said Microsoft "threw desktop users under the bus" is absolutely correct. Moreover, Microsoft threw everyone without a touch-enabled tablet or smartphone under the bus. OMG W8 is awful. The reviewers try to be kind to W8 but nearly every review goes to considerable effort to caution consumers how radically different and even awkward the user experience is. Virtually no one is recommending to rush out and buy this for an existing PC.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1351376841744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351377986593-31</Id><Topic><Title>W8 Reviews - What They Don't Say</Title><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1351376841744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last I checked, OS's can be updated and I have a hunch that Microsoft will indeed listen to people and make the necessary changes.
