Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very, Very worried. 8-} Republican Chris Christie praises Obama and throws ROMNEY overboard into the NY subways. ROMNEY declines to clarify FEMA position, when questioned 42 times. New Jersey Republican Chris Christie praises Obama during interviews on morning news shows. WASHINGTON — Barack Obama drew praise from one of Republican Mitt Romney’s top backers Tuesday for the government’s response to the Atlantic superstorm as both candidates tried to navigate the politics of a natural disaster with the election one week away. New Jersey Republican Chris Christie, the governor of one of the states hardest hit by Sandy, lauded Obama during interviews on morning news shows. “I have to give the president great credit,” Christie, who delivered the keynote address at Romney’s nominating convention, said on the Fox News Channel. “He’s done, as far as I’m concerned, a great job for New Jersey.” The furious storm left a trail of flooding, death and destruction along the East Coast and froze the presidential campaigns in place. With polls showing the race a dead heat nationally, political advisers for both Obama and Romney were struggling to #$%$ how the massive storm might tilt the contest. While federal agencies are taking a central role in relief and clean-up from the storm, one of Romney’s central messages in the campaign is a promise to shrink the government.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351661501593</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 01:31:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351667228296-2</Id><Title>ARM Primed For Buy With Stock Rise, record Cash: Real M&amp;A</Title><Msg>compare charts ARMH vs INTC ... and it's just starting !!!!!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------- ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)’s record cash and stock price near a 12-year high are giving the chip designer firepower for acquisitions to help keep a lead in smartphone processors and expand in more technologies. Shares of ARM, which posted the biggest gain in the MSCI World Information Technology Index in the past five years, surged this month to the highest since 2000 after the Cambridge, England-based company posted record quarterly revenue and said its order backlog had never been bigger. Cash and short-term investments at ARM, which licenses technology that powers Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s iPhones, reached an all-time high of 442 million pounds ($710 million) as of Sept. 30, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While a contract with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is helping ARM secure a foothold in the market for semiconductors used in computer servers, IC Insights Inc. said an acquisition could help the $15 billion company accelerate the process. Ceva Inc. (CEVA), a chip designer with expertise in wireless communications technology, would help ARM bolster its position in mobile phones, International Data Corp. says. Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS) and Mentor Graphics (MENT) Corp. also would make sense as targets, according to Forward Concepts Co. “When you have a lot of cash on hand, it opens up a lot of opportunities,” Jim McGregor, founder of Scottsdale, Arizona- based Tirias Research, said in a telephone interview. With computing technology in flux, ARM may seek to acquire companies with specialized intellectual property, he said. Charlene Marini, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for ARM, declined to comment when asked whether the company is considering an acquisition. Chip Blueprints ARM sells its chip blueprints to companies from Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) of San Diego to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and receives royalties from shipments of semiconductors. Its technology is used in smartphones, tablets and other devices including Apple’s iPhone and iPad. Shares of ARM surged 7.7 percent on Oct. 23 after the company reported sales for the three months ended in September that exceeded analysts’ estimates and said it started the current quarter with a record backlog of orders. The stock, which closed yesterday at 675.50 pence to match an almost 12- year high set on Oct. 24, has gained more than fourfold during the past five years. ARM’s cash and short-term investments stood at 442 million pounds at the end of the third quarter, more than 36 percent higher than a year earlier and a new high for the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Server Technology This week, the company introduced a new line of faster, more energy-efficient processors for use in handsets and to expand in the server market now dominated by competitor Intel (INTC) Corp., which has a 95.5 percent share of that market, according to Mercury Research. Intel rival AMD will start using ARM technology in some of its products for servers in 2014. With the company seeking to expand its market share in applications used in everything from cars to digital cameras, ARM may consider making an acquisition to aid in these efforts, said Rob Lineback, a Fort Worth, Texas-based senior market research analyst at IC Insights. “ARM is expanding its core technology into a wide range of various servers, computers and embedded processing applications, from televisions to automotive,” Lineback said in a phone interview. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see ARM making acquisitions in specific applications.” Ceva Synergies Michael Palma, a San Mateo, California-based analyst with IDC, said it would make sense for ARM to purchase Ceva, the Mountain View, California-based designer of communications chips that allow cell phones and tablets to connect to the Internet and make calls. Ceva has a similar business model to ARM’s and works with many of the same customers, Palma said. Its patents would let ARM grab more licensing and royalty fees per mobile device shipped, he said. Ceva, with a market value of $342 million, is “already an IP licensing model, so there are nice synergies,” Palma said. For ARM, an acquisition of Ceva “would allow them to expand their revenue per customer.” Richard Kingston, a spokesman for Ceva, said in a phone interview that “there are very good synergies” for ARM and Ceva, “but there’s nothing to talk about right now.” “In general, in semiconductor IP, there should be some consolidation coming at some point,” he said. Design Services ARM could expand the types of design services it provides by purchasing Mentor Graphics or Cadence Design, said Will Strauss, president of chip consultant company Forward Concepts in Mesa, Arizona. The companies -- Mentor Graphics with a market capitalization of $1.7 billion and Cadence Designs valued at $3.6 billion -- provide software, technology and consulting services to makers of components and electronic systems. Nancy Szymanski, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California- based Cadence Systems, and Suzanne Graham, a spokeswoman for Wilsonville, Oregon-based Mentor Graphics, didn’t return phone calls seeking comment. MIPS Technologies Inc. (MIPS), another chip designer and direct competitor to ARM, also could be a target, said Gary Mobley, an analyst at Benchmark Co. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, with a market value of $390 million, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to identify and negotiate with possible acquirers, Bloomberg News reported in April, citing people with knowledge of the situation. ‘Shopping Around’ “MIPS is shopping around its IP, and ARM wouldn’t want that IP to end up with a patent troll,” Mobley said in a phone interview. “For strategic reasons, it might make sense for ARM to buy MIPS to protect itself.” Jen Bernier-Santarini, a spokeswoman for MIPS, declined to comment. Still, with its expansion into the server and PC markets already underway, ARM may be more inclined to focus on the growth it can achieve on its own, according to Aalok Shah, a Lake Oswego, Oregon-based analyst at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. “They still have the wind at their back for a while,” Shah said in a phone interview. “They’re entering new markets such as servers so they don’t really need to do an acquisition.” It may make more sense for ARM to invest in a start-up technology company, similar to its partial-ownership of closely held Calxeda Inc., which designs chips that are increasingly used in so-called cloud computing centers, said Vijay Anand, a London-based analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank. ‘Organic Growth’ “You might see similar types of strategies being deployed for other companies,” Anand said. “If you look at the business model, it lends more to organic growth rather than growth led by acquisitions.” While ARM’s cash is at a record, its stockpile pales to that of technology giants Intel and Qualcomm. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, had $10.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, had $13.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, while ARM may not make any “game changer” acquisitions, the company’s cash levels do position it to target smaller services and software companies that could increase its reach and capabilities, according to Chris La Jaunie, a New York-based fund manager at Victory Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $21.5 billion, including shares of ARM. “You can buy companies for the $50 million to $100 million range that can enhance” the business, LaJaunie said in a phone interview.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351667228296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 03:07:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351680744229-3</Id><Topic><Title>Even ARMH's new partner, AMD admits ARM servers might be worthless</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351636998519</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:43:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what AMD is suggesting is that server customers can stay on an x86 architecture, avoid the expense and headache of using a foreign CPU and achieve the power savings goal anyway with x86.

If ARM really is the wave of the future for servers and laptops, Intel could shift to producing the most advanced ARM chips (which would obviously carry a premium price) without much effort at all.</Msg><Username>drensber</Username><Timestamp>1351694484264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 10:41:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351695104096-25</Id><Topic><Title>Before TEAANDTEA says it...

There is not enough power efficiency benefit to the proposed future 64 bit ARM server to justify the risk of software incompatibility, especially when Intel already has an arsenal of energy efficient CPUs and has many energy saving innovations in the roadmap, including a clear path to 10nm lithography. Really, would AMD be partnering with ARM if it weren't on the edge of insolvency? No. This is exactly what it looks like, a desperate move by a failing company.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1351696288296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351697377708-27</Id><Topic><Title>Even ARMH's new partner, AMD admits ARM servers might be worthless</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351636998519</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:43:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is not much different than the June 13th thread started by getanid61. AMD is only one of two companies who can put native x86 logic on a die with ARM CPUs. AMD is weakened and will need some help. AMD can build x86 and ARM 64-bit CPU and make them socket compatible so there will be a single socket design that both ARM and x86 can plug into. AMD can build ARM 32-bit and 64-bit CPU with some x86 transistors on it to do the instruction decode. A native x86 execution port on a 64-bit ARM solution would allow that CPU to run either programs. It would have access to the x86 SW library and ARM low power. There are a number of opportunities and I would not be surprised to see samples much earlier than they have scheduled. I don't know when AMD licensed ARM but I would expect they have gone farther down this path investigating that many give them credit for. Socket compatibility with x86 native execution might be attractive. I do think it is very late and Intel is farther down the power curve than many give them credit for too. Haswell is better than Intel has disclosed. There was a lot of low hanging fruit that they were able to capture on their own AND there has been power savings that they have been able to incorporate by examining the current leader: ARM. The race will tighten up quite rapidly. Intel has been searching for the "killer app" to justify their CPU performance for some time. ARM gave it to them.

(NTWK), a worldwide provider of global IT and enterprise application solutions, today provided preliminary revenue results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2012. Preliminary revenue results indicate the company's strongest first quarter ever, with revenue expected in the range of $10 million to $11 million. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An analyst covering the stock recently upped its earnings projections for NTWK based on significant increased global demand for all of its software products and services (legacy and cloud) Analyst comments: All business lines are very strong growth across the board. Significant demand for all legacy and cloud products. Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 net income projections. EPS forecast of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. . NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. Regarding the fast-growing high margin Cloud Divisions: The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America.

It may because of a market move that carries Intel with it. I think the out of the money puts are usually insurance. Buying the puts and selling the calls can be to encourage the option market maker to short the stock which pressures the share price down. There are people who buy the options and expect a share price movement to increase the value of the options. If Intel is down tomorrow, the puts purchased today and the calls sold today can be closed at a profit. Very few keep the options until they expire in the money. They can also be combined with other trades too which are hard to identify.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351714025382</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 16:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351719529856-72</Id><Topic><Title>Exynos 5 Dual handily beats Apple’s A6 chip, Intel’s Atom Z2460</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351590885743</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 05:54:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM licensees will need FinFET or FD-SOI process technology to take the edge off this power consumption. 22nm Silvermont does look as though it will have a worthy rival to take down ;-). ------ There is scope for an ARM mess up here in that the A15 is just to big and power hungry.

I don't think TSMC met its advanced revenue contribution % objective given by beginning of the year : The contribution to total wafer revenue has increased from 7% in the second quarter to 13% in the third quarter. We expect 28-nanometer revenue will exceed 20% of our total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter and will be more than 10% for the whole year. That would roughly correspond to $1.7 Billion Capex on the other hand (and most goes into advanced technology): Regarding capital expenditure for this year, up to the third quarter, we have spent $6.2 billion, representing 75% of our total year budget. I have finished my report on our financial highlights. Put this in perspective to Intel - nevertheless Dumbstreet assigns significantly higher PE to TSMC - but than again Dumbstreet does not mess with TSMC stock</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1351735046794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 21:57:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351736123992-92</Id><Title>48 Cores, baby</Title><Msg>The 48-core chip could give smartphones significant computing power and help reduce power use, according to Intel researchers. Intel reportedly is developing a 48-core chip for mobile devices that could begin appearing in smartphones and tablets within the next five to 10 years. According to a report in Computerworld, researchers at Intel Labs in Barcelona are working on determining ways to use and manage so many cores on a mobile chip, but said that such processing capabilities could lead to significantly more powerful and energy-efficient chips in devices. Eventually, it could result in the creation of smartphones that have the capability of being a user’s primary computing devices, enabling them to do away with tablets and laptops, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy, told the news site. "If we're going to have this technology in five to 10 years, we could finally do things that take way too much processing power today," Moorhead said. "This could really open up our concept of what is a computer. ... The phone would be smart enough to not just be a computer but it could be my computer." Currently, ARM-based mobile chips like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 and Nvidia’s Tegra 3 are coming with as many as four cores. (Tegra 3 actually has a fifth core that runs at a lower frequency than the other four and can run certain workloads, which can save energy.) Intel is looking to gain traction in the smartphone market with its low-power Android platform, with current smartphone chips offering one core. Intel researchers said that with so many cores, workloads on smartphones could be divided between the cores and run in parallel, rather than splitting all the tasks between a smaller number of cores. For example, they said, a user could encrypt an email while at the same time work on power-intensive apps, or enjoy a much better video experience. All that can be done now, though much more slowly because the workloads have to share resources. In addition, running jobs in parallel rather than at capacity on a single core would result in less power being consumed. Intel CTO Justin Rattner told Computerworld that despite the predictions of company researchers, a 48-core chip could reach the market sooner than 10 years, in large part due to the demand from users. "I think the desire to move to more natural interfaces to make the interaction much more human-like is really going to drive the computational requirements," Rattner said. "Having large numbers of cores to generate very high performance levels is the most energy-efficient way to deliver those performance levels." The 48-core project echoes the efforts Intel is making with its Xeon Phi MIC (Many Integrated Core) coprocessors efforts in servers. The Xeon Phi chips—which will offer more than 50 cores—will be used in high-performance computing (HPC) and similar data center environments to run highly parallel workloads and take some of the load off the larger Xeon processors. Intel officials earlier this month gave journalists a tour of the Stampede supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The massive supercomputer, which will be based on Dell systems and offer performance of up to 10 petaflops, also will feature Intel's eight-core Xeon E5-2680 chips and Xeon Phi coprocessors.</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351736123992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 22:15:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
