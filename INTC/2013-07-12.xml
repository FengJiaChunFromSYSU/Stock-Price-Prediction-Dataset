Also, if you read through Romit Shah downgrade details over history, he said "this quarter was an anomaly and will not happen in the future". Pulling units forward .....

One of the biggest problem with these reports is that they do not count tablets or detachable devices in their numbers. Those devices are the hot sellers and would most likely show a different picture if they were counted. Having said that, if we assume the Gartner and IDC numbers are correct for desktops and non-detachable notebooks/ultrabooks, I find it interesting that the US numbers were extremely better than the rest of the world. Here's a quote from a zdnet article: "The silver lining from the report (if there is one) could be the U.S. market. Not only did Gartner find a 1.4 percent decline on an annual basis, but researchers also pinpointed that the market grew by 8.5 percent sequentially." What could account for such a difference (1.4% vs 11%)? Improvement in the US economy? Maybe. But I think it has more to do with the fact that new PCs with Haswell inside, as with all new PCs, start to sell in the US market first. Haswell just started shipping towards the end of the 2nd quarter and most were probably shipped to the US. This is the Haswell effect. I think we see growth in PC this year as Haswell gets shipped to the rest of the world. And we also need to take into account that Bay Trail starts to ship this quarter. IMO, Intel will have an incredible year!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373615242509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 03:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373619021312-8</Id><Topic><Title>Filth/POS</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373588599387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can’t believe you'd drag someone’s mom into this and call them a sucker....it contradicts your touchy feely rant.</Msg><Username>base16grep</Username><Timestamp>1373619021312</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 04:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373622371698-9</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell effect</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373615242509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 03:47:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT Surface systems have a detachable keyboard and are counted as tablets. 900k units in Q1. and ....

End of Windows XP support spurring PC sales By PATRICK SEITZ Posted 07/11/2013 05:53 PM ET Personal computer sales are getting a much-needed boost from businesses replacing their aging Windows XP machines ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for the nearly 12-year-old operating system next April. Market research firm IDC said second-quarter PC shipments were better than expected, especially in the U.S., thanks to commercial buyers upgrading their PCs to Windows 7 machines. Consumer PC buying remains weak, however, as the public continues to shun Microsoft's poorly received Windows 8 operating system and spends its money on tablets and smartphones instead.

Acer officials on July 9 unveiled the Aspire M5-583P-6428, which includes Intel’s fourth-generation Core i5 processor and the chip maker’s Wireless Display (WiDi) technology. In addition, the new notebook has an improved sound system. For its part, Lenovo reportedly is preparing to release a new notebook, the ThinkPad T440s Ultrabook, which also will be powered by a Haswell chip. The company—the world’s second-largest PC maker, behind Hewlett-Packard—is building out a page on its Website featuring the T440s, and the partial page has been seen by such tech sites as Liliputing and Endgadget.

White Feb. 11, 2013 Sales of consoles in the U.S. dropped 21% in 2012 to just over $4 billion, and figures from the manufacturers of the three top systems were lackluster over the crucial holiday season At a quick glance, it looks like it could be “game over” for the video-game-console business. Sales of consoles in the U.S. dropped 21% in 2012 to just over $4 billion, and figures from the manufacturers of the three top systems were lackluster over the crucial holiday season. When announcing its quarterly earnings last month, Microsoft said its Xbox-division revenue dropped 29%. At Sony, lower PlayStation 3 and PSP sales were responsible for a 15% drop in revenue for its video-game division. Nintendo’s next-gen console Wii U also failed to generate as much interest as originally predicted. Last month, the company said it had sold only about 3 million consoles and that it would sell a million more through March, a sharp drop from the 5.5 million it initially anticipated selling. There’s less demand for the physical games these days too. According to research company NPD Group, game sales fell from a little over $11 billion in 2011 to less than $9 billion last year. Retailer GameStop says sales of new video games over the holiday season dropped by about 5%, and sales of used games dropped by 16%. “It’s tracking to be the worst quarter the company’s ever had in the used business,” Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co., told the Wall Street Journal. Analysts blame a lot of the slump on timing. “It is a cyclical market,” says Lewis Ward, research manager of gaming at IDC. “The usual lifespan is 10 to 12 years for a console, and we are in a trough right now.” Read more: http://business.time.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373637580173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 09:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373637727489-28</Id><Topic><Title>Two Tech Giants Lead the Dow's Gains</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1373573308603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 16:08:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel will have to compete on price, no question about it.

As chip-baking processes shrink, it's getting more difficult to develop manufacturing techniques at a reasonable cost. Breakthroughs are needed even at the upcoming 14-nanometer process node, Manocha told his keynote audience at SEMICON West 2013 on Tuesday in San Francisco. "We desperately need EUV," he said, "and EUV is still not ready." Manocha didn't mention one other problem with die-stacked packaging that has also been discussed in the industry: the fact that die testing has to be improved and made more logic cell–specific – perhaps even transistor-specific – so that if you can find a hidden defect in a logic cell in one die before its packaged you won't waste the other perfectly good dies that you would have already stacked with it. Costs are also a concern due to the number of masks needed in chip manufacturing. Back in the far-distant days of 180nm process, Manocha said, 15 to 20 masks were needed in the photolithographic process of chip manufacture. At 14nm, that number has grown to 60, "plus or minus," he said. The more masks, the more complexity; the more complexity, the higher the cost.

Good to "hear". Certainly one of my picks and long holdings. Bought in a month ago or therabouts at $34.50. Liked the pe, the peg, and the 7 plus yield. Tucked away in the Sep IRA to defer taxes on the dividends, and knock on wood, the nice rise in the stock price off of these levels. Has served me well in an otherwise nasty market.

They are getting the coupons, but when the share price goes higher than their conversion price, they can short INTC since they own shares by proxy through the convertible notes. example .... SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jul 21, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Intel Corporation today announced the pricing of its offering of $1.75 billion principal amount of 3.25 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039. The debentures were offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The sale is expected to close July 27, 2009. Intel has also granted to the initial purchasers of the debentures the right to purchase up to an additional $250 million principal amount of debentures to cover overallotments. Intel intends to seek a rating for the debentures promptly following the offering. Interest will be payable on the debentures semiannually at a rate of 3.25 percent per annum. In addition to regular interest, beginning on Aug. 1, 2019, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures. In certain circumstances, the debentures will be convertible into cash up to their principal amount and any conversion value above the principal amount will, at Intel's option, be settled with shares of Intel common stock or cash. The initial conversion rate for the debentures is 44.0917 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $22.68 per share, representing a 20 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of Intel's common stock of $18.90 per share on July 21, 2009. The debentures mature Aug. 1, 2039.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373649557151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 13:19:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373650035202-81</Id><Topic><Title>Short covering started already</Title><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1373642816977</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:26:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>235 million shares short.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1373650035202</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 13:27:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373650151333-82</Id><Topic><Title>WDBLAWGROW has been daytrading since 2002</Title><Username>wdblowhard</Username><Timestamp>1373647826686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 12:50:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If he put the same amount of energy into investing he does jacking around with idiotic aliases he might have something to show.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1373650151333</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 13:29:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373650889538-83</Id><Topic><Title>Filth is still down almost $30 a share on the same date in 2000</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1373573698661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 16:14:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jerry Blown happens to be my real name.

This is a fools market and the biggest fool is Uncle Ben Bernanke. This market is setting itself up for a big fall, just a big big fall of close to 30 percent I can assume. If in this earnings season the companies still give a downbeat expectation after the earnings have been slashed close to 83 percent, then the markets will focus on earnings and it will sink. That means he feds QE has not bee as effective as all it did was print money and provide it basically free to the financial institutions but hasn't helped much to the ordinary citizen and the feds effect with its QE is vaning. The feds have so far prevented a big selloff with promises of cheap money policies to continue as well as will not raise rates but all that can go only so far and with the markets where it stands today there are simple JUST 2 Choices, either the earnings catch up to the markets or the markets will catch up to the earnings period. Goodluck and be cautious. I am long intel, bought at 24.12, then at 23.75 and and again at 23.67 to the brim. I suspect intel will beat expectations and possibly even give a rosy outlook with the holiday season coming up, but the reason I say possibly is because the emerging markets are in trouble as well as Europe is bankrupt so I don't see much help or expectations in these to geographical areas of the globe. Put your buy orders on hold until October. Have an enjoyable day.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1373667921870</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373669470893-101</Id><Topic><Title>Filth is still down almost $30 a share on the same date in 2000</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1373573698661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 16:14:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jerry.blown • Jul 8, 2013 3:46 PM Hey, j-wad, you should change your alias to butt monger or rump ranger.

When going into the manufacturing process, Woodside revealed that the Moto X will actually be built here in the US — Fort Worth, Texas, specifically — something you just don’t see from smartphone manufacturers who typically outsource the building of their devices to overseas manufacturers like Foxconn. While around 70% of the device will be built here in the US, he went on to clarify that system components like the OLED display and CPU will be built in Korea and Taiwan, respectively. However, there are other devices coming from Motorola and Intel might be inside one of them from theverge Details are still relatively scarce, though Woodside did cite breakability and battery life as two of the things Larry Page is most focused on, which dovetails nicely with what we've heard before about Motorola's plans. Motorola's also apparently working with a number of different carriers, and Woodside said "the response has been great." The phone's coming by October, along with "a handful" of other devices.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373675788355</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 20:36:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373675815555-109</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Intel miss the game console market??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1373636651236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 09:44:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD is down from at least $34 a share in 2006, please stop trying to tell people that POS co is anythiing but a POS.

Who will benefit most as a result?</Title><Msg>Q: Why is the PC market being cannibalized? A: There are many people who do not need heavy-duty PC compute power on a daily basis. What they really need is a light-weight laptop or even table to satisfy their daily web browsing, email or media consumption needs. For them, lower cost laptops or tablets will surface. Of course there is also a segment of users that need a main PC to do heavy lifting such as video editing, work-related productivity work, etc. This segment will not go away any time soon. Many will just keep refreshing one main PC + one or two tablets. Q: Who will benefit as a result of this PC-cannibalization? A: Think of why people dump PC. They want to do daily browsing, email with a piece of cheap hardware. Introducing to you Samsung Ativ Q and Asus Transformer Book Trio. These are tables, with attachable keyboard. They are also "laptop". They can dual-boot Window 8 and Android. Besides the usually web-browsing and emailing, you can perform the usual Window productivity works, as well as downloading and running Android apps. You can even launch Android apps from the Window 8 tiles. This kind of dual-OS, hybrid "lapblet" will be the future. This segment will capture a large portion of the users that had “dumped” or are planing to "dump" the PC. The initial versions of these "lapblets" will be expensive. But thanks to competition, over time the prices of these "lapblets" will come down to $300 - $400 range, comparable to the mid-tier tablets today, since the added complexity is quite minimal. Now my question is: with this new and growing segment, who will stand to benefit the most? Let's see. Intel has tons of experience with Window. It is now entering Android and picking up pace (Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and many other design wins for Android). Beside Intel, who else is better position to capture this market? Hint: The Arm-based Window RT is a disaster.</Msg><Username>jctailman</Username><Timestamp>1373676457081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 20:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373676490611-113</Id><Topic><Title>so many fools here listen to WW</Title><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373638552928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cuz he's an a**hole! and no one has been more wrong on Intel. 22-Feb-12 05:04 pm Two out of every three people receiving stock dividend payments are rich, many totally, incredibly rich and should be paying more taxes instead of us soaking the middle class.

Now you can pick up an upgraded model, for the base-model price thanks to a promotion on Amazon. Apple sells an 11″ $999 model for the latest Macbook Air but that is the base installation, with (1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Intel HD Graphics 5000, 4GB memory, 128GB flash storage) but starting today the 13″ Macbook Air model on Amazon for $999 comes with (2.5 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, 4 GB, 500 GB Hard Drive and Intel HD Graphics 4000). So you are trading the latest video card for an incredible boost in capacity. There are a few other combinations that you can create with the deal, a 13″ with 750GB of storage is also $200 off for a limited time and the 15″ model with 500GB of storage comes with the NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1GB Graphics card. That model is currently $100 off for a limited time.
