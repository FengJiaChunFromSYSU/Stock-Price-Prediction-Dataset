Thanks to popular tablets like the iPad*, the thin, touchscreen-operated computers have become the weapon of choice for many computer users as they offer a great experience when browsing the web or using one of thousands of specialized apps. Tablets vary by their power and operating systems. Processors like the Intel® Atom™ provide considerable power for the current generation of tablets, and some tablets have dual core processors, including the Motorola Xoom* and Asus Eee Transformer*. Tablet operating systems. Most tablets use a special operating system designed to make the most of a touch interface, this gives the tablet the cool interactive feel that makes them fun and useful. A good operating system is an important part of a great tablet computer. Popular tablet operating systems include the Honeycomb* version of Google Android*, mobile versions of Windows 7* and XP*, and Apple's iPad OS*. All of these operating systems have distinct advantages and disadvantages and all feature proprietary app stores which expand the capabilities of tablets. Apps include everything from games to specialized word processors and even instruments. Generally, apps make use of a tablet's touchscreen to deliver an experience that a user couldn't get from a typical computer. A touchscreen is a very intuitive control system, so tablet manufacturers try to deliver the most easily accessible operating systems and apps possible to make sure that tablets offer a different experience from what a user would get from a laptop or netbook. Keyboards and docks. Nevertheless, there are quite a few situations in which a tablet can benefit from the addition of a keyboard or keyboard-equipped docking station. While it's possible to type on the face of a tablet, an attached keyboard can make this process much easier. Tablets like the Asus Eee Transformer have optional docking stations with built in keyboards which cost extra, but can basically turn a tablet into a full-featured netbook. Apple also sells an optional keyboard for use with its iPad. Cameras. Most of the current generation tablets also have forward and rear-facing cameras. These cameras are meant to make it easy to use video-conferencing apps and to take a quick high-res photo. It's another way that tablets differ from traditional computers. Since they're flat and portable, an included camera can be a great feature.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1348426067421</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 14:47:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348430111384-15</Id><Title>GloFlo and the Media Provided Some Laughs</Title><Msg>The media is now telling us that GloFlo will produce 14nm production soon and draw even with Intel in fabrication. Really? Well, just a couple of comments after the belly-laughs: 1.) GloFlo isn't producing 28nm yet. So they would have us believe that they will do 28nm, 20nm and then 14nm - all in two years. That's three process levels in two years or triple the rate that Intel, which is the fastest in the world with its every eight quarter cycle, can do. If you believe this then I'll start gift-wrapping the watch, the bridge and the swampland because you are going to want all of them. 2.) The press says GloFlo will do this at the same time as Intel. Of course Intel actually is getting some 14nm off the line now but the roll-out date is the end of 2013. GloFlo's roll-out date is the end of 2014. The end of 2014 is NOT the same time as the end of 2013. 3.) In regards to GloFlo's new 14nm process: "Kengeri agreed that this probably won't result in as much of an improvement in density as you would normally expect moving from 20nm to 14nm using classical scaling." Just a minor detail right. It's not really equivalent to what Intel is doing. 4.) Posters on the Intel board may remember the many boasts of the ARM fanbois on how quickly 20nm production was going to be available. Of course, the ARM foundries then ran into huge problems ramping up 28nm and now you don't hear so much about the imminence of 20nm. In fact, no one is talking about ARM 20nm at all because it's way off in the future. 5.) To say that it's grossly dishonest to say you are going to jump three levels in fabrication in two years would be a vast understatement. But an ARM marketing department that would send shills to camp out on the Intel message board is apparently capable of the most egregious forms of bee ess.

This includes things like a secure facial or palm-vein login to remove passwords or a Kinect-like near-field air gestures to play games or manipulate objects in the air for commercial applications. Intel has tied this up in what they call their Perceptual Computing SDK (software development kit) to incent developers to write cool and useful apps. If that’s not incentive enough, Intel is offering $1M in prizes for application developers. This all makes a lot of sense given the PCs superior performance to be able to handle all of these interactions locally, and not in the cloud.

Intel has it. ARM doesn't...] Look at the back of your PC right now. If you are trying to get some “real” work done, your notebook is probably connected to a bunch of wires. As I write this, I have my notebook connected to multiple cables: HDMI, network, VGA (cough), USB keyboard, USB mouse, USB Neat scanner, and power. It’s a total mess. Intel wants to remove all of these cables through wireless docking. So now imagine just laying your notebook down and everything is connected. This is not just some engineering pipe dream as the underlying technology has already been developed. The technology is called WiGig and it can operate at a max speed of 7mbps, nearly 10X the fastest WiFi network today. Given its speeds, it not only carries traditional network data, but video data to displays and even data from mass storage devices that are nearby. This then enables the removal of most physical ports, which enables even thinner notebooks. One reason phones and tablets are so convenient is their lack of cables and the PC is just about to get it.

Guess I'm not the only one who has issues with Wall Street...] The only people who know what business Wall Street is in are the high frequency and automated traders. They know what business Wall Street is in better than everyone else. To traders, whether day traders or high frequency or somewhere in between, Wall Street has nothing to do with creating capital for businesses, its original goal. Wall Street is a platform. It’s a platform to be exploited by every technological and intellectual means possible. The best analogy for traders ? They are hackers. Just as hackers search for and exploit operating system and application shortcomings, high frequency traders do the same thing. A hacker wants to jump in front of your shopping cart and grab your credit card and then sell it. A high frequency trader wants to jump in front of your trade and then sell that stock to you. A hacker will tell you that they are serving a purpose by identifying the weak links in your system. A trader will tell you they deserve the pennies they are making on the trade or the rebate they are getting from the exchange because they provide liquidity to the market. I recognize that one is illegal, the other is not. That isn’t the important issue. The important issue is recognizing that Wall Street is no longer serving the purpose what it was designed to . Wall Street was designed to be a market to which companies provide securities (stocks/bonds), from which they received capital that would help them start/grow/sell businesses. Investors made their money by recognizing value where others did not, or by simply committing to a company and growing with it as a shareholder, receiving dividends or appreciation in their holdings. What percentage of the market is driven by investors these days ? I started actively trading stocks in 1992. I traded a lot. Over the years I’ve written quite a bit about the market. I have always thought I had a good handle on the market. Until recently. Over just the past 5 years, the market has changed. It is getting increasingly difficult to just invest in companies you believe in. Discussion in the market place is not about the performance of specific companies and their returns. Discussion is about macro issues that impact all stocks. And those macro issues impact automated trading decisions, which impact any and every stock that is part of any and every index or ETF. Combine that with the leverage of derivatives tracking companies, indexes and other packages or the leveraged ETFs, and individual stocks become pawns in a much bigger game than I feel increasingly less comfortable playing. It is a game fraught with ever increasing risk. So back to the original question. What business is Wall Street in ? Its primary business is no longer creating capital for business. Creating capital for business has to be less than 1pct of the volume on Wall Street in any given period. (I would be curious if anyone out there knows what percentage of transactions actually return money to a company for any reason). It wouldn’t shock me that even in this environment that more money flows from companies to the market in the form of buybacks (which i think are always a mistake), than flows into companies in the form of equity. My 2 cents is that it is important for this country to push Wall Street back to the business of creating capital for business. Whether its through a use of taxes on trades(hit every trade on a stock held less than 1 hour with a 10c tax and all these problems go away), or changing the capital gains tax structure so that there is no capital gains tax on any shares of stock (private or public company) held for 1 year or more, and no tax on dividends paid to shareholders who have held stock in the company for more than 5 years. However we need to do it, we need to get the smart money on Wall Street back to thinking about ways to use their capital to help start and grow companies. That is what will create jobs. That is where we will find the next big thing that will accelerate the world economy. It won’t come from traders trying to hack the financial system for a few pennies per trade.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348434863555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 17:14:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348443180114-21</Id><Topic><Title>No way INTC can sustain a $20+ stock price</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348372994711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 00:03:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worth repeating......

Do us a favor and keep venting here instead of hurting someone on the streets.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1348444243005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 19:50:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348444272331-27</Id><Topic><Title>No way INTC can sustain a $20+ stock price</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348372994711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 00:03:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tablets are still toys for kids to play games or some grown ups with simple use. I can not imagine the complicated work at work place can be done with a tablet. Yes, I have iPad and use it to check the news, but never ever can do any work with it. So, PC will be here for many years to come but in different format but not as a toy. AAPL once a dog of wall street, will go the way many techs ended up eventually. Wait until tablets produced by many companies with price under $100. INTC will be there to provide all kind of chips for any future PC and tablets.</Msg><Username>veqasfletch2001</Username><Timestamp>1348444272331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 19:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348444443690-28</Id><Topic><Title>No way INTC can sustain a $20+ stock price</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348372994711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 00:03:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then why is Intel a cornerstone of your retirement account, like you said here when the stock was priced at 29?

So, if you are a foundry you just "plan" to pick up some 14nm FinFET technology as in "Hey, honey, if you are going out can you please pick up some Intel 14nm FinFET technology at 7-11 and another six-pack of beer?" Intel spent ten years and billions in developing FinFET. In other words, it's too late. There isn't enough time or money for the foundries to close the gap. They not only can't close the gap, they can't even make it any smaller. Intel is advancing the bar every eight quarters. No other company on earth can match that pace. Just the facts, shill boy.

The main argument centers on the disconcerting fact that a disaggregated supply chain makes optimization of the semiconductor product increasingly difficult to achieve, especially when coupled with the inherent complexity of advanced process nodes and leading-edge designs. In particular, the data interfaces between design teams, foundries, and EDA vendors are becoming increasingly complex. The result is a dramatic increase in cost, and more importantly, risk.

The fruity firm pulled Google's much-loved Maps from its latest iDevice, and replaced it with its own app packed with TomTom data. Which would be fine if the thing wasn't occasionally inaccurate and somewhat shoddy. One fanboi moaned: The maps app is shocking! It looks rushed, half-baked, delivers a really poor user experience. Compare the aerial photograph with that of google maps for areas outside London, Cardiff, Portsmouth... Another pointed out: My home town (pop. 25k) is labelled about a mile north of where it should be, and a sub-district of my home town is in the place of the center of my town! Shockingly, it has also emerged that Apple might be artificially creating a market for its iPhone 5s by PRETENDING THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF THEM. This unheard-of tactic had to be resorted as the company worried that the mobe might not be that great actually. Reg clandestine source Dry Throat explained the strategy: Don't let anyone have many. That way you're not saying, 'hey, buy our mediocre and really expensive offering'. You're saying, 'see this? Over here? Where everyone else is looking? You can't have this'. That way if you do get hold of one, you feel really pleased regardless of the fact it's not much good. And if you can't get one, you really want one. It's so simple - but so effective.

It's clear enough that Apple was in a hurry to end its products' reliance on Google Maps, which tended to feed the coffers of the archrival maker of the dominant Android smartphone operating system. The stakes are high: roughly a quarter of mobile ad revenue comes from ads associated with maps. Apple's map software comes preinstalled on the iPhone 5, and also comes with the new iOS6 upgrades for other iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads. With Apple trying to distance itself from Google products, Google Maps is not available as an iPhone app, but Google Maps can still be used on a Firefox browser. The gaffe may do little to temper demand for Apple's new iPhone 5—the early indications are that it will fly off the shelves. But to build its own mapping app, Apple used data—from a number of sources, including the company TomTom—that obviously lacks the detail it needed. It also rushed to market with an accuracy-be-damned attitude. Some of the more amusing examples highlighted by frustrated users include Dublin's airport stuck on a farm, nothing found in a search for "Canada," the Golden Gate Bridge misplaced, and countless others. This comes just a week after CEO Timothy Cook declared in interviews, referring to iPhone 5: "I feel the need to be the best." The development is puzzling, to say the least, says Sunil Gupta, a professor at Harvard Business School. "I am surprised with their collaboration with TomTom that basic things like streets, and where Golden Gate Bridge is located, are misplaced. It's sort of shocking," he says. He added: "The direction of Apple to go into maps is the right direction, but people will probably start questioning whether Apple products are as wonderful. It's been almost like a cult. We can always forgive people for one mistake, and for the post-Steve-Jobs era, this is the most significant. Another slip of this kind, people will start questioning Apple." Maps are a crucial tool for users of mobile devices (see "Smartphone Makers Can't Afford to Mess Up Mapping"). Building an accurate mapping application with every street, building, and other landmark properly labeled takes years and regular daily updates. Many companies are working on next-generation mapping technologies (see "All Over the Maps"). In some sense, Apple's decision was not entirely inconsistent with its history of releasing imperfect beta products. "I don't think there is a problem with [the] approach; it has worked well," says Chetan Sharma, a wireless research analyst in Seattle. "Just like Siri, they released it before it was fully baked." However, Sharma says, there is a difference between beta and unfinished. "It is perfectly fine to launch competing apps and services—but not at the expense of quality," he adds. "The maps app wasn't fully baked. It was rushed through."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348456174900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 23:09:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348457511157-43</Id><Topic><Title>GloFlo and the Media Provided Some Laughs</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348430111384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 15:55:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where there is a will, there is a way and the likes of Qualcomm, Nvidia and Apple are putting their money where their mouth is in offering to buy up dedicated resources from the foundries. It's a misconception to assume that Intel is the only one that's been doing research on next generation technologies. They are clearly the biggest but the next few are now strongly motivated to catch up. This was not the case before. The foundries never had the capital resources to invest in research at the level of Intel before. This has changed now and that is the trend for the future.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1348457511157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 23:31:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
