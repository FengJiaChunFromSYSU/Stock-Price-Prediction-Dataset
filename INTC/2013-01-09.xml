According to McGregor, not only is 28nm more expensive than 40nm now, as might be expected at the start of a node, but that, on Broadcom's current projections, 28nm will never be cheaper than 40nm across the whole lifetime of the node. "What we're seeing in the industry is the cost of next-generation nodes rising exponentially," says McGregor, "what this means is, unless you need the advanced process because of performance reasons or die-size reasons, you're not going to get a cost benefit from converting to the new node."

(QCOM), the largest maker of mobile-phone chips, will accelerate the introduction of faster semiconductors to put more pressure on Intel Corp. (INTC) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), which are targeting the wireless market. Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs is showing off the new Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors today in a keynote speech opening the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chips, which will make their way into phones and tablets by the middle of this year, perform 75 percent faster, according to Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf. San Diego-based Qualcomm climbed IHS iSuppli’s rankings of the largest chipmakers in 2012, jumping three places to trail only Intel and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) by revenue. Benefiting from surging demand for mobile phones, Qualcomm has amassed a 42 percent slice of the mobile-application processor market, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. “The pace of mobile is really accelerating and we think we’re driving it,” Mollenkopf said in an interview. “The game is getting more challenging, and the benefit to the consumer is that you’re going to see much more exciting devices in the market.” Mollenkopf said that Qualcomm, which licenses ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology and designs its own processors, is able to beat its competitors on efficiency, delivering the same performance with half the power in a phone or tablet. The new chips are already in 50 different handsets and mobile computers, he said. Mobile Lineup The new 800-series chip has four processors, each capable of running as fast as 2.3 gigahertz, the company said. It also offers the ability to integrate the latest cellular modem standard, called long term evolution, or LTE, something that no other manufacturer can do, according to Mollenkopf. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is the second-largest maker of applications processors, since it supplies Apple Inc. (AAPL) and manufactures the Exynos chip for its own handsets. It’s also one of Qualcomm’s largest customers. Intel, the largest maker of processors for computers, got its start in phone processors last year, featured in smartphones from Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility Holdings and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) The company has yet to grab more than one percent of the mobile processor market.</Msg><Username>man_of_troy_rules</Username><Timestamp>1357708257454</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357708591499-4</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm Upgrades Mobile Chip Lineup Fending Off Intel Challenge</Title><Username>man_of_troy_rules</Username><Timestamp>1357708257454</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel x86 runs Android, so the game will be decided on performance, power, integration, and cost.

Indeed, Intel claims to have line of sight all the way to a 7-nm process, with all the firm’s CPUs becoming SoCs as of 2013. Haswell will be Intel’s 22-nm SoC for tablets and Ultrabooks, while Merrifield will be the company’s SoC for tablets and smartphones. After that, 14 nm is expected to be Intel's killer node with the most dramatic power improvements and integrated baseband. Meanwhile, the ARM ecosystem has a rather more challenging road ahead of it, with low cost continuing to present a challenge for foundry supply, yield and materials science. ARM is seeing Moore's Law slowing down due to a lack of foundry spending and a deficit in R&amp;D capabilities. Even at the 28-nm, the ARM ecosystem is feeling the squeeze. Until very recently only one foundry (TSMC) could yield 28-nm chips, with Global foundries just starting to produce 28-nm in volume, and the entire industry is under-supplied. With Intel pushing ahead to introduce FinFETs at the 22-nm and hoping to use EUV lithography at 14 nm and below, ARM faces an even bigger crisis of competition. Having said that, ARM and its partners might do well to worry a bit more about Intel’s progress, with the firm’s 14-nm node already in “extremely advanced stages of design.” Perlmutter said his firm is holding firm to its schedule of putting its first products on 14 nm in production later in 2013 . “We will launch many products on 14nm. Our plans are advancing and we believe that we will grow the gap and it will give us more advantage,” said Perlmutter. “Experience is enabled by performance. The better performance you have the better you are. It’s all about performance,” he said, adding “high performance computing in a small form factor.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357708721202</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:18:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357708904338-6</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm Upgrades Mobile Chip Lineup Fending Off Intel Challenge</Title><Username>man_of_troy_rules</Username><Timestamp>1357708257454</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>See post "Intel plans to crush ARM beyond 20 nm", boy of troy.

He said it wasn't cheaper. That means higher prices, reduced margins, reduced profits and less competitive ARM products. And what was their choice? That or go out of business. Kinda like the ARM choice at 20nm but 20nm is even more of a dog because of the problems with it being planar instead of FinFET.

(QCOM), the leading chipset maker for mobile handsets in the world, recently unveiled two new Snapdragon chipsets: Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors, targeting high-end mobile devices. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 processor, which supports 4G LTE technology mainly caters to premium smartphones category, delivering 2.3 GHz clock speed and better battery back up. It is powered with new quad core Krait 400 CPU, Adreno 330 GPU, Hexagon v5 DSP, hence offering 75% improved performance than its earlier Snapdragon S4 Pro processors. Snapdragon 800 chipset is also integrated with New IZat location technology, thus allowing users a perfect navigation system. Apart from supporting UltraHD video recordings and display, it also supports third generation 4G LTE modem with 150 Mbps data speed. While Snapdragon 600 processor is powered with Krait 300 quad-core CPU with a clock speed of 1.9 GHz, thereby offering 40% improved performance than the S4 Pro processor. Both these processors are distributed as samples but expected to be commercially available from the second half of 2013, Qualcomm has already gained 50 design wins, hence expected to deliver better performance from mid-year onwards. According to the latest report presented by Gartner on worldwide semiconductor industry, Qualcomm holds third place, with 4.4% market share just behind the market leader Intel Corporation (INTC) and Samsung Electronics. As per the report, except for two chipset manufacturers, Qualcomm and Broadcom Corp. (BRCM), other semiconductor vendors declared fall in revenue in 2012. In the last quarter, Qualcomm shipped around 141 million chipsets and expects to ship in between 168 to178 million processors in the next quarter. The company also raised its revenue guidance for full fiscal 2013. So, with the availability of Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors, the company will not only raise its revenue outlook for fiscal 2013 but at the same time will retain its third spot.</Msg><Username>man_of_troy_rules</Username><Timestamp>1357710272221</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:44:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357710322151-14</Id><Topic><Title>ARM reality check</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357707425051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:57:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know a lot of suckers like Hans are still employed...

This is later than usual for Intel and on a different night for the semiconductor giant. Typically, Intel reports on the Tuesday night of the first full week of earnings. Per Thomson Reuters, analyst consensus is looking for $0.45 in earnings per share (EPS) on $13.766 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year declines of 30% in earnings and 1%, respectively. The stock was down 15% in 2012, excluding the dividend. The Q4 2012 gross margin guidance in the third-quarter earnings report just crushed the stock, as INTC management lowered the expected Q4 gross margin to 57%, from the third quarter's 63%. Even revenue guidance was lowered for Q4 2012, as the typical seasonal revenue growth is +7% for Q4 2012, but the Street was given a +4% guidance range to chew on. Since the October earnings report EPS estimates have been further reduced to the $0.45 from the $0.47 estimate we saw immediately after earnings, even as revenue estimates have actually ticked a little higher, from $13.618 to $13.766 in the last three months. (That likely means gross margin continues to get squeezed in the analyst models.)

"In mid-2012 Intel doubled down on LTE/4G when it opened a new office in San Diego, Qualcomm’s home territory, with the express intent of recruiting from the area’s deep pool of baseband talent to build a new modem design team for LTE/4G technologies. There are rumors that Intel will be making at least one more LTE/4G investment in 2013. A second source for LTE/4G baseband modems from Intel will be welcomed by smartphone manufacturers as an alternative to Qualcomm’s near monopoly of LTE/4G modems and will relieve supply constraints." "Delivering LTE/4G to smartphone manufacturers in the first half of 2013 is a critical milestone for Intel." [Also, let us not forget what Intel will have that Qualcomm won't in two years:] "At IDF 2012, Intel showed off an experimental SoC codenamed "Rosepoint," targeted at low power mobile consumer devices.

They got China's ZTE, Motorola in China Mobile, and now Lenovo. The second largest smartphone supplier in China behind Samsung. Here's the details just released today. Lenovo Group Ltd., the world’s largest personal-computer maker, is seeking to extend its push into the smartphone market by becoming first to sell a handset based on Intel Corp. (INTC)’s latest chip design. The K900 will work on a new Intel dual-core version of its Atom processor, the company said. The phone will be sold in Asia, part of Lenovo’s effort to capture the attention of consumers there who are upgrading to their first smartphones. “Like our PCs, we’re going to grow in faster-growing markets first,” said Nick Reynolds, a Lenovo director of marketing and strategy. “In 2013, we’re going to bring new markets online. We’re going to do it with a new phone.” Lenovo, the second-largest smartphone seller in China, behind Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), more than doubled sales at its mobile Internet and digital-home unit in the first half of 2012. The decision by the Chinese company to use Intel is a step forward in the chipmaker’s effort to gain a foothold in phones, a market that’s growing faster than PCs, where its technology dominates. Santa Clara, California-based Intel has less than 1 percent of the market for phone processors, compared with more than 80 percent share in chips for PCs, a market that shrank last year for the first time in more than a decade. In addition to Beijing-based Lenovo, Intel has recruited Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility, China’s ZTE Corp. (000063), India’s Lava International Ltd. and France Telecom SA (FTE)’s Orange as phone-chip customers. The new Lenovo K900 phone, based on a design by Intel, sports a 5.5-inch screen and has a 13-megapixel camera. Intel may have had less than 1% of the smartphone market to ARM's nearly 99% in 2012. But with the current developments it's looking more and more as if it's Intel's market for the taking.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1357713860203</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 01:44:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357714276156-40</Id><Topic><Title>DANG! - Lenovo K900 (Intel inside) commercial</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357709674493</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:34:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow!

Just because they defined the PC market, people expect more from them in this space. Six years ago they ventured into low power. Today you can see that their focus changed. All their chips now conform to power budgets. Mobile is new for Intel and as of now, they are still feeling their way in this space. Google/Motorola's a big win for them. This alliance gives them a critical window into the virgin mobile device space. Like Microsoft-Nokia's phone partnership, they need a straight path that leads to their user. In PCs they defined how end use happened. In this space they have to follow the leaders. It may take them 5 more years to establish and they may just lose their way on the way. In hindsight selling XScale to Marvell was a mistake that they made due to impatience. If they had stuck it out with their ARM license today they would not face this predicament.

Though it is very evident for someone who follows the SoC market closely (that Samsung did something similar on its Exynos offering), the so-called tech journos have seized upon this to create more FUD. See below a comment from NetSoerfer in response to an article in The Verge: "Intel's new low-power processors are high-power marketing hype" ==================== NetSoerfer says: It’s not just marketing hype when Intel change how they measure power draw. Traditional maximum TDP just doesn’t make sense in mobile SoCs (or Intel’s CPU&amp;GPU processors, for that matter) anymore. Most (mobile) computing scenarios are strongly bound either by CPU or GPU performance. So if the cooling solution is designed to handle 7W of heat dissipation from the SoC, it doesn’t make sense to limit the sum of all SoC components to 7W. Instead, the individual components (CPU, GPU) are limited to 7W each, so they can individually hit the power consumption limit. This raises maximum performance significantly where it’s needed. In most scenarios, this allows for smooth interactions and high performance. The processor spends most of its time idling anyway, so being able to return to idle more quickly can make up for the increased power consumption during load. This is what Intel call “Race to Idle”, a strategy they have put significant effort into with Ivy Bridge. And that strategy appears to work well: Ivy Bridge is so power efficient that any improvements would be negligible compared to the power wasted by cheap motherboard components (1). Of course, there may be scenarios that stress all SoC components equally, which then require throttling to stay within the cooling solution’s specification. But even then, they will distribute the available power (thus performance) optimally, resulting in performance no worse than an SoC with a traditional 7W TDP. Furthermore, Intel allows Ivy Bridge to actually exceed its TDP for short periods of time while the cooler is still “heating up”, so even with full load on one component of the SoC, the other can still process small tasks without interrupting or slowing down the main process. Intel have made Ivy Bridge processors available for devices with a 7W power envelope, providing power comparable to their regular LV Ivy Bridge processors in most situations. This opens up the tablet market for the x86 architecture, which benefits Intel, obviously – but by creating competition, it will push innovation and lower prices, which benefits the customer, too. Traditional TDP is a tool that’s too blunt for scenarios where multiple components are cooled by the same solution. And by the way, Samsung do the same with their Exynos 5 SoC (2) – CPU and GPU can each consume about 4W, but together they are limited to 4W total as well. So this is hardly just Intel changing definitions to lower numbers, it’s simply time to move on from TDP to a more modern approach. (1) “With Haswell U/ULT parts, Intel will actually go in and specify recommended components for the rest of the platform […] from voltage regulators to random microcontrollers on the motherboard.” – Anandtech – Intels Haswell Architecture (2) “Exynos 5250 […] is allowed to reach 8W, making that its max TDP by conventional definitions, but seems to strive for around 4W as its typical power under load.” – Anandtech – ARM vs. x86 The real showdown Posted on Jan 09, 2013 | 7:10 AM EST</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357739248986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 08:47:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357739267596-60</Id><Topic><Title>China will soon be the largest smartphone market.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1357713860203</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 01:44:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You left out the part about it not having 4g.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357739267596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 08:47:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357739800161-61</Id><Topic><Title>WOW! - Lenovo K900 (Intel inside) hands-on</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357709822768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:37:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32 nm chip, China only for now, 3G, 16 GB max. and too expensive due to intel inside.

As 2012 was winding down, the company surpassed Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) market cap for the first time ever. In the two months since, Qualcomm has extended its valuation lead over Intel. In a way, the fact that Qualcomm CEO Dr. Paul Jacobs hosted the pre-show keynote at CES 2013 last night is yet another milestone that embodies the broad consumer shift to mobile that's taking place as we speak. This time Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is the one conceding the floor to the mobile chip giant, after the software giant had long kicked off the technophile festivities for years on end. In a matter of months, Qualcomm has enjoyed symbolic events undermining the WinTel duo, which have each missed out on mobile opportunities. Jacobs probably didn't mean it as a jab at Microsoft, but he noted, "This is the first time a mobile company has opened the Consumer Electronics Show." Intentional or not, he's clearly (and correctly) implying that Microsoft is not a mobile company. More mobile According to Jacobs, there are more than a million mobile connections added daily and mobile connections will soon outnumber us. Qualcomm has shipped a cumulative total of over 11 billion chips. Jacobs said that while the chip industry is highly competitive, Qualcomm's advantage is that it's always been mobile first. That could easily be a passing reference to Intel's disadvantages in mobile right now. While Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer wasn't the guest of honor, he did stop by to show off and discuss various Windows devices. After all, Qualcomm is the exclusive supplier of processors for Microsoft's Windows Phones, so Ballmer and Jacobs go way back. That includes both the Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) Lumia 920 and HTC 8X that Ballmer was touting. Ballmer also talked up Windows RT devices, but of course didn't mention Microsoft's own Surface RT tablet, as it runs on a Tegra 3 chip from Qualcomm's rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) . NVIDIA was out unveiling its newest Tegra 4 alongside a handheld gaming console at its own keynote at CES on Sunday. Oh, snap Qualcomm also unveiled its newest Snapdragon processors built on its Krait architecture, the Snapdragon 600 series and Snapdragon 800 series. The high-end Snapdragon 800 uses four Krait cores and should achieve 75% CPU performance gains and double the GPU performance using a Qualcomm Adreno GPU. Also on the spec sheet is faster integrated LTE speeds and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Source: Qualcomm. These are also built on one of Taiwan Semiconductor's (NYSE: TSM ) 28-nanometer nodes. The new processors will maintain Qualcomm's lead over the competition in the smartphone space, particularly from NVIDIA. It still offers the best System-on-a-Chip, or SoC, for smartphones, with its unrivaled LTE integration and focus on balancing power efficiency and performance. The chip giant already has over 50 design wins in the pipeline that should start showing up around the middle of the year. Everything else Qualcomm's been talking about its "Internet of Everything" ecosystem for a while now, and Jacobs circled back to some of its strategic initiatives. He also added that Qualcomm enables "all of the major mobile OS platforms," while displaying a logo of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Android. That depends on your definition of "enable," since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) doesn't use Snapdragon processors in iDevices but it does use baseband modems from Qualcomm. Jacobs also talked about a handful of new mobile technologies that Qualcomm is working on. Streamboost optimizes Wi-Fi bandwidth and manages network traffic to improve streaming performance. Car makers like Audi and BMW are integrating LTE into their vehicles using Qualcomm chips. Qualcomm's open-source framework for peer-to-peer communications isn't exactly new, but can play a role in connecting the tidal wave of smart TVs on the horizon. Qualcomm also has a Vuforia platform for augmented reality applications that will be used in wearable computing. The presentation had other various tangents, like a NASCAR driver, Big Bird from Sesame Street, Pacific Rim director Guillermo Del Toro, Star Trek Into Darkness actress Alice Eve, an electric Rolls Royce, and a closing performance by Maroon 5. Most of these were barely related to the "Born Mobile" tag line and theme of the keynote, but primarily served as eye candy for attendees. CES usually sets the stage for what types of gadgets that consumers and investors can expect throughout the year, and as more and more devices become mobile, it's rather apt for Qualcomm to be the guest of honor.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357740412170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:06:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357740619685-64</Id><Title>Intel Has No Process Advantage In Mobile, says ARM CEO</Title><Msg>Intel Has No Process Advantage In Mobile, says ARM CEO Intel has no advantage in IC manufacturing when it comes to manufacturing processes used for mobile ICs, Warren East, CEO of ARM, tells EW. "This time last year there was a lot of noise from the Intel camp about their manufacturing superiority," says East, "we're sceptical about this because, while the ARM ecosystem was shipping on 28nm, Intel was shipping on 32nm. So I don't see where they're ahead." Furthermore, with the foundries accelerating their process development timescales, it looks increasingly unlikely that Intel will be able to find any advantage on mobile process technology in the future. "We're supporting all the independent foundries," says East. That includes 20nm planar bulk CMOS and 16nm finfet at TSMC; 20nm planar bulk CMOS and 14nm finfet at Samsung and 20nm planar bulk CMOS, 20nm FD-SOI and 14nm finfet at Globalfoundries. It gives the ARM ecosystem a formidable array of processes to choose from. "I'm no better equipped to judge which of these processes will be more successful than anyone else," says East, "our approach is to be process agnostic." The important thing is that the foundries' process roadmap is on track to intersect Intel's at 14nm. 14nm will be the first process at which Intel intends to put mobile SOCs to the front of the node i.e. putting them among the first ICs to be made on a new process. Asked if the foundries were prepping their next generation processes with the intention of putting mobile SOC at the front of the node, East replies: That's the information we're seeing from our foundry partners." Globalfoundries intends to have 14nm finfet in volume manufacturing in 2014, the same timescale as Intel has for introducing 14nm finfet manufacturing. In fact, GF's 14nm process may have smaller features than Intel's 14nm process because, says Mojy Chian senior vp at Globalfoundries, because "Intel's terminology doesn't typically correlate with the terminology used by the foundry industry. For instance Intel's 22nm in terms of the back-end metallisation is similar to the foundry industry's 28nm. The design rules and pitch for Intel's 22nm are very similar to those for foundries' 28nm processes." Jean-Marc Chery, CTO of STMicroelectronics points out that the drawn gate length on Intel's ˜22nm" process is actually 26nm. Furthermore Intel's triangular fins, which degrade the advantages of finfet processing could underperform GF's rectangular fins which optimise the finfet advantage. At the front of the GF 14nm finfet node will be mobile SOCs says Chian. GF has been working with ARM since 2009 to optimise its processes for ARM-based SOCs. At TSMC the first tape-out on its 16nm finfet process is expected at the end of next year. That test chip will be based on ARM's 64-bit V8 processor. Using an ARM processor to validate its 16-nm finfet process should give TSMC's ARM-based SOC customers great confidence. Asked about the effects of finfets on ARM-based SOCs, East replies: "There'ss no rocket science in what you get out of it. The question is does it deliver the benefits at an acceptable cost? You don't get something for nothing. How much does it cost to manufacture? How good is the yield? And that, of course, affects cost." And so on goes Intel beating its head against the wall to get into the low-margin mobile business. Recently Intel said it expected its Q4 gross margin to drop 6% from Q3's 63% to 57%. Shock, horror said the analysts But if Intel succeeds in the mobile business, its gross margin will drop a lot more than that. It's a funny old world.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357740619685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:10:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357740723076-65</Id><Title>All day battery life with Haswell (9-13 hours of battery life WILL SELL)</Title><Msg>Posted Jan 9, 2013 at 3:00AM EST by Christopher Groux If there's been any huge trend in tech over the past few years, mobile computing would undoubtedly have to be it. Thanks to some incredibly small but powerful hardware we have been able to create devices that fit in our backpacks and pockets easily that can sometimes feature the horsepower of a full-featured laptop. Intel has seen a huge rise in popularity of its ulrtabooks and tablets, and as such they have unveiled an awesome new piece of CPU greatness that should bring smiles to computer users everywhere. When ultrabooks first hit the market, much of the industry lead with a "wait and see" type attitude when it came to public consumption. After all, at the time, cutting back on certain features like disc drives and ethernet ports sounded like a somewhat crazy idea. These weren't things that we necessarily used regularly, but there was a sense of comfort in still keeping them around. It would be a waiting game to see how the masses reacted to that kind of bold move. The answer was simple of course when we saw just how thin and light these little machines could get. Sure your tablet or ultrabook may not be able to play a DVD without an add-on, but the good news is you can now take it pretty much anywhere you go. Still, what's the use in mobile hardware if the battery isn't going to keep up with your pace? That is the exact philosophy behind Intel's fourth generation "Haswell" processors. According to the company this is the first time they have designed a CPU specifically with ultrabooks in mind, and as such they have created hardware that truly is portable. Running on just #$%$ of juice for the entire system, these new chips will give you anywhere from nine to thirteen hours of hardware operation. Essentially with on and off use, you should have no problem making it through a day. Now we'll just have to see how the hardware from manufacturers will be able to put the Haswell to use!</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357740723076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357740752252-66</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Has No Process Advantage In Mobile, says ARM CEO</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357740619685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:10:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That article is like a year old, lol.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357740752252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:12:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357741059269-67</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Has No Process Advantage In Mobile, says ARM CEO</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357740619685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:10:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is only about 3 months old.

And includes an impressive camera too. By smartphone standards, the K900 has a massive 5.5-inch screen 1080p IPS display. So, no better time to tap Intel's new chip to manhandle all the pixels in that giant display. Lenovo K900 hands-on The Atom Z2580 roughly doubles the central processing unit (CPU) performance of Intel's single-core Medfield processor used in Lenovo's K800 phone. The new Atom silicon also boasts an improved graphics chip. A few more deets on Intel's Z2580: it's a 32-nanometer chip, so it does not use the 22-nanometer 3D chip tech seen in Intel's Ivy Bridge PC processors. That 22-nanometer phone chip will come later this year, Intel's Erik Reid told CNET today. In addition to the spanking new Intel chip, other K900 goodies include 2GB of RAM, up to 16GB of NAND flash storage, a 2MP front-facing camera with a wide viewing angle, and a 13-megapixel F1.8 lens camera with dual flash. And that camera alone may make it a contender. The K900's camera takes 13-megapixel pictures using a Sony CMOS Exmor BSI sensor. That could yield image quality on par with stand-alone digital camera.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357741721407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:28:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357741727634-74</Id><Topic><Title>Windows8 selling like hot cake: 60Million sold.

I also remember when ARM based processors had lower power than Intel processors. I also remember when ARM based processors had higher performance per watt. The GOOD OLD DAYS of last month. Stock price performance will follow. When the market stops shorting 1mil shares a day, Intel share price will respond. If you look at the short interest, the market has been shorting 1m shares of Intel EVERY DAY since last May 15, 2012 when the short interest was 93m shares. Today it is 229mil shares. They have short 229m - 93m = 136m shares in the last 8 months. 8 months is 2/3 of a year. 2/3 of a 200 trading day year is 133 trading days.

The Intel appeal of that decision finished on July 8, 2012. I am surprised it is taking so long for the EU appeals court to say "we want to keep your $1.45b". Maybe they are rewriting the 500 page original decision. Intel has a "slush fund today". They have TWO that they use and will discuss the same as they always have. Slushy #1. Join marketing program. YES. It still exists and was never changed. Intel will help pay for advertisment for customer products with Intel chips in them. Intel cannot be expected to help pay for advertisement of competitor products. Slushy #2. $300mil Ultrabook enabling program. Intel still does "REBATES". An Intel customer makes an order and is given a price for that rate of order. If that customer increases their order, the pricing on all the parts is adjusted to the rate of the total parts. In all the litigation, the evidence against Intel was comments from Intel customer, internal email. These customer comments were opinions and not quoting anything from Intel. It was a very rare occasion that an Intel comment was used and used out of context. Intel VALUE prices which means that they will forego some sales for profits. Intel will price aggressively for strategic purposes to build the infrastrucure. Think Intel PHI pricing for key contracts.

Shock, horror said the analysts So TSMC lower SoC margins are OK - but it's not OK for Intel. Why is that ? Stupid is as stupid does - it's amazing how a guy like Covello can brainwash people that consider to be investor. And ...like you repeat it. Tell me why are TSMC lower SoC margins OK? but NOT for Intel It's funny that foundry customers like BRCM, NVDA and Marvel pointing out margin/cost related issues while ARM analysts seem to be completely in the dark McGregor went on to say that the same would be true at 20nm. The consequences will be dramatic: companies will stick longer with a node, foundries won't be so aggressive in their process development and the old learning curve of chips getting cheaper by 30% a year will decelerate. Apple, reportedly, has stuck with 40nm and 65nm technology rather than risk its products on the availability of 28nm parts. Broadcom's strategy on 28nm was to wait on the HPM process which, says McGregor, "tends to have a better figure of merit than the HP or the Poly/SiON processes that some of our competitors are using. So when we do come out with 28nm products, they should have better specs, better power performance and whatnot." So, McGregor points out, Broadcom has not suffered initial ramp issues of its competitors and its business has not been limited by access to wafers. However TSMC is currently pulling out all the stops to get 20nm into production as soon as possible to give its mobile customers a competitive process to Intel's 22nm finfet process. It was reported last week that TSMC is putting another $700m into bringing forward 20nm deployment.

LInux systems shipped = ??? bare-bones, no OS systems shipped = ??? (I bought one of these in Q3) MacOS systems shipped = ???</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357746905519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 10:55:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357747555583-108</Id><Topic><Title>That 22-nanometer phone chip will come later this year, Intel's Erik Reid told CNET today.</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357741721407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:28:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice find...later in the year could mean MWC :)</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357747555583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 11:05:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357747597767-109</Id><Topic><Title>2013 will not help Intel much on Smart Phones.By 2014 Price war will become too brutal and INtel faces Margin and revenue Hell</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357741716533</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:28:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are not only taking on ARMH, but also Apple, Sammy, Nvidia, and others.

Most people are cost conscience so they figure they can replace a 7" tablet or not have to buy one if they buy the larger screen size phone. why buy a phone and a 7" tablet and have to pay extra in data plan? 2) Convertibles and detachables are winning against larger tablets 9" and up. Same argument here, why pay for 2 separate device when you can have both in one. 3) In emerging countries, most people cannot afford anything else other than the most basic phone. So a smaller form factor phone is what they will buy.

For the second year in a row, Samsung is expected to be ranked as the fourth largest IC foundry. However, IC Insights believes that the company will challenge UMC for the number three spot in the ranking in 2013. Samsung has the ability (i.e., leading-edge capacity and a huge capital spending budget) and desire to become a major force in the IC foundry business. It is estimated that the company’s capacity dedicated to its IC foundry business reached 130K 300mm wafers per month in mid-2012. Using an average revenue per wafer figure of $2,500, Samsung currently has the potential to produce annual IC foundry sales of about $3.9 billion.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357751684469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:14:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357751902585-118</Id><Topic><Title>How is that ARMH short working out ??</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357751027976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:03:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ohlala I like it.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357751902585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:18:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357751946368-119</Id><Title>INTC not trading well at all.</Title><Msg>No shortage of shares lined up for sale.

The firm also has a couple of interesting Series 7 notebooks with Ivy Bridge CPUs and discrete Radeon graphics—and one of them is an ultrabook. That particular model is the appropriately named Series 7 Ultra, which will be available in touch and non-touch configurations. Both versions have a 13.3" display with a 1080p resolution. The Series 7 Ultra's metal chassis meaures 0.7" thick on the standard model and 0.74" for the touchscreen variant, with respective system weights of 3.2 and 3.6 lbs. That might seem a little hefty, but these machines combine Radeon HD 8570M discrete graphics processors with either Core i5 or i7 CPUs; they're not exactly short on horsepower. The Radeon GPU has 1GB of dedicated memory, and up to 16GB of RAM can be plugged into the system. On the storage front, SSD capacities are available up to 256GB. A version of the machine with built-in LTE connectivity is also in the cards, although it looks like that option will be reserved for touchscreen models. Samsung estimates battery life at eight hours. If you want a bigger display, the Series 7 Chronos offers a 15.6" touchscreen with the same 1080p resolution as the Ultra. This larger model measures 0.8" thick and tips the scales at 5.2 lbs, but its internals are even more potent than those of the ultrabook. The CPU is Intel's quad-core Core i7-3635QM, a 45W chip with a 3.4GHz peak Turbo speed. AMD supplies the Radeon HD 8870M GPU, which comes with 2GB of its own memory. Like the Series 7 Ultra, the Chronos can be configured with up to 16GB of system RAM. Samsung is shipping the system with Condusiv's RAMaccelerator software, which promises up to a "150 percent increase in speed for browsing and running apps." Sounds fishy to me, and I can't help but wonder why Samsung didn't go with a solid-state cache to complement the system's mechanical hard drive. The claimed 11-hour battery life is a pleasant surprise, though. Both Series 7 systems sport backlit keyboards and large, clicky touchpads. The Chronos serves up an extra USB 3.0 port and a numpad, but that's about it for extras. Unfortunately, Samsung's press materials make no mention of whether either system uses an IPS panel. Our own Scott Wasson has seen both notebooks, and he says the screens look gorgeous even under the harsh lighting typical of trade-show settings. Fingers crossed.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357760052580</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:34:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357760069347-163</Id><Topic><Title>Look like MSFT can sell software without INTC inside, Thats very good for MSFT</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357757484561</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:51:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC is in deep $ h i t</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357760069347</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:34:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357760207837-164</Id><Title>Get ready here comes the INTC Wall Street sellers.

While we don't have full details at the moment, this sounds very much like the \chips that we heard about back in November that is expected to run dual quad-core set ups (1.8GHz A15 for the hard work, 1.2GHz A7 for lighter tasks) all on a 28-nanometer process.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357768746672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:59:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357768789829-183</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Series 7 notebooks with Ivy Bridge</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357760052580</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:34:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Samsung 13.3" Series 9 laptop is 2.7 pounds weight.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1357768789829</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:59:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357768954177-184</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung announces eight-core Exynos 5 'Octa' chip at CES</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357768746672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:59:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to be outdone by NVIDIA's Tegra 4 announcement, or Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 news, Samsung has announced the Exynos 5 Octa. It's an octa-core CPU that was designed with low power mobile devices in mind and uses ARM's big.LITTLE processing. What that means, is that there are two groups of four cores that can run at any given time. When performance is needed, four Cortex A15 cores can handle the heavy lifting, and when doing more common tasks, you have four Cortex A7 cores to take care of things. Because it's using this strategy, this chip is more suitable form small form factor devices like phones. Samsung says this tech will allow the chip to use up to 70-percent less power than a traditional quad-core A15 SoC, or even a dual core Exynos 5 like the one seen in the Nexus 10. We may not have received the Galaxy S4 news everyone was wanting, but this may be even better. Expect to see this chip make it's way into tablets, Chromebooks, and phones this year.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357768954177</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:02:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357769271110-185</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung announces eight-core Exynos 5 'Octa' chip at CES</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357768746672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:59:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung seeks broader chip base as Apple cuts loose Stephen Woo, president of Device Solutions Business for Samsung Electronics, talks about the new Samsung Exynos 5 Octa processor during a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas January 9, 2013. The processor is faster and uses less power than Samsung's previous models, Woo said. REUTERS/Steve Marcus (UNITED STATES - Tags: By Miyoung Kim LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co is looking to supply chips to more Chinese and other emerging smartphone makers, the head of its system chip business said, to counter any fall-off in demand from Apple Inc, which is weaning itself off Samsung chips used in its iPhones and iPads. Samsung and its main U.S. rival, and biggest customer, together account for more than half the global smartphone market, and the South Korean group is the main supplier of mobile processors, or application processors (AP), powering both Apple devices and its own range of Galaxy phones and tablets. But, as Apple looks to be less reliant on its rival for parts for its gadgets - it is already buying fewer Samsung memory chips and display screens as the two have gone to war over patents - concerns have grown that Samsung may see its processor revenues tumble. "As there are just two smartphone makers that are doing really well, chipmakers supplying them have grown in tandem. So we plan to bolster our relationship with those key customers," Stephen Woo, president of Samsung's System LSI business, which makes processors for Apple products, said in an interview. Supplying processors for Apple products has been the mainstay of Samsung's system chips business. Goldman Sachs estimates Samsung's AP chip sales to Apple will rise to 9.3 trillion won ($8.8 billion) this year, or nearly 80 percent of Apple's spending on Samsung processing chips, memory chips and flat screens. But that could tumble to just 2.5 trillion won next year, as Apple will shift 30 percent of its AP business from Samsung and eventually 80 percent by 2017, according to Goldman. "(We) should diversify our customer base and are making such efforts already, adding some Chinese customers," Woo told Reuters ahead of his first keynote speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Wednesday. China's Meizu, one of the local smartphone newcomers, uses Samsung's Exynos quad-core chip for its MX smartphone, and Lenovo's K860 LePhone is also powered by Exynos. Still, Samsung's mobile processor business is almost entirely tied to the fortunes of Apple and its own mobile business - the Galaxy range. By comparison, chip rivals such as Qualcomm Inc, Texas Instruments and Nvidia have a broader client base - from LG Electronics Inc and Nokia to HTC Corp, Huawei Technologies Co and Google's Motorola. "We see emerging players who have potential to grow in smartphones and we will continue to make efforts to supply them with our chips," Woo said. EYEING BASEBAND The mobile processor market, driven by roaring sales of smartphones and tablets, is a bright spot for a semiconductor industry that is struggling with falling computer sales. Research firm Gartner estimates the mobile processor market will grow 30 percent this year to $13.5 billion and hit $16.5 billion next year. To strengthen its chip capability, Samsung bought UK chipmaker CSR Plc's mobile phone connectivity and location technology for $310 million last year, and it is now looking at how it can improve modem chip technology, especially the baseband chip solution that enables wireless devices' radio communications. "Baseband is a very important segment, but we don't have it. Given its importance, we're reviewing various options," Woo said, suggesting Samsung could be scouting for potential targets. Qualcomm is the biggest baseband chip company with nearly 50 percent of the market, followed by the likes of Mediatek, Texas Instruments and Broadcom. SINGLE CHIPSET Chipmakers are increasingly seeking to produce a single chip solution that combines AP, modem chip and connectivity chips that support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and near-field communication functions, in one chipset. This combo-package is popular among low-end smartphones as it allows phone makers to cram various chips into compact devices. Woo said Samsung, however, was not considering expanding into a single chip solution and will instead continue to focus on pure AP chips favored for high-end phones, as it allows manufacturers to differentiate their hardware offerings with various chip combinations. The explosion of mobile devices has opened a big opportunity to Samsung as Intel Corp, the world's top chipmaker, struggles to crack the mobile processor market dominated by the makers of ARM Holdings licensed chips. Samsung is the biggest maker of ARM-based chips, such as Apple chips and Samsung's Exynos brand. Intel's market share in mobile devices is just 1 percent, as UK chip designer ARM holds a near monopoly. Woo said Samsung was not looking to break into the desktop computer or server processor market - which Intel dominates, but is under threat from ARM-based chips that boast low-power consumption and compact design. "For the time being, our focus will pretty much be on enhancing our AP offering, especially for high-end mobile devices," he said.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357769271110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:07:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357769439606-186</Id><Title>Tegra 4 chip is complete garbage</Title><Msg>Crushed by analysts.

"I hope so," the Intel chief said when asked by Fox Business Network whether he expects an insider to take the helm. Mr. Otellini surprised many observers in November by announcing plans to retire in May, putting the dominant maker of microprocessors for personal computers and servers in new hands during a pivotal time in its evolution. Analysts have shortlisted software chief Renee James, Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith for the job, noting there are few executives from other companies considered up to the task. Intel's board, however, has said it will consider inside and outside candidates. Mr. Otellini said he has a preferred candidate in mind that he discussed with the board, though he declined to name that person. The chief executive's departure comes at a challenging time for Intel, which is working to gain a firmer foothold in the fast-growing market for mobile devices after seeing designs from rival ARM Holdings Inc. (ARMH, ARM.LN) gain a dominant share of the sector. PC sales, meanwhile, have gone into a tailspin. Market research firm IHS iSuppli in October predicted 2012 PC shipments would decline for the first time in 11 years. Mr. Otellini acknowledged that problems with the PC market have pressured the company's stock, though he suggested the headwind to Intel is only temporary. "At some point those things go" away, he said.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357774526467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 18:35:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357774957297-194</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell Internal Graphics Equal To Nvidia 650M?</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1357774629120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 18:37:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anandtechDOTcom/show/6600/intel-haswell-gt3e-gpu-performance-compared-to-nvidias-geforce-gt-650m</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357774957297</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 18:42:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357775768962-195</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 chip is complete garbage</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357769439606</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:10:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big Little is #$%$.

Aside from the never-ending march toward thinner, faster and lighter computers, here are five main things to expect from the company throughout the rest of the year. Expect Cheap Touching (and Lots of It) Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of the PC Client Group at Intel, claims that touchscreen Ultrabooks will get down to a starting price of around $599 by the end of the year. What’s more, Intel is making it a requirement that any Ultrabook using one of the company’s upcoming fourth-generation Core processors must have a touchscreen. Basically, if you buy an Ultrabook sometime later in the year, it’ll have a touchscreen. Expect to Be Able to Leave Your Charger at Home Intel’s Ultrabook reference design that it’s showing off to hardware partners sports a 13-hour battery life with a screen that pops away from the keyboard to become a 1.9-pound, 0.40-inch tablet with 10 hours of battery life. Skaugen says this jump represents the largest increase in battery life in the company’s history. Hardware similar to this reference design should cost between $799 and $899 when it launches later this year. Expect to Finally Have a Decent Password By the end of the year, Intel-based systems will utilize facial recognition and your computer’s webcam so you don’t have to rely on typed passwords. The company plots up to seven unique points on your face and analyzes muscle movements to prevent someone from using a photo or video of you to unlock your machine. For an added layer of protection, this facial recognition can also be combined with the unique sound of your voice. Expect to Do Less Mousing Your overworked mouse might finally get a little bit of rest this year. Intel-based systems will be able to use eye-tracking, voice-recognition and advanced hand recognition sensitive enough to sense your individual fingers. Depending on the situation, you may find yourself using any or all of these tricks to control your computer instead of using your mouse. The above demo video shows a digital version of Where’s Waldo? being played using eye-tracking technology to find Waldo simply by looking at each page, and a hand gesture-controlled version of Portal 2. Such features will initially be available via an optional camera peripheral before being integrated directly into Ultrabooks and all-in-one machines. Expect to Turn Your Connected Devices into Little TVs (If You’re a Comcast Customer) Later this year, Comcast will roll out an Intel-powered home gateway box that’ll do away with the need for individual cable boxes. You’ll be able to watch live TV and video on demand from Intel-based Windows 8 devices. Should you find every TV in the house being watched, you’ll be able to use a computer or tablet as extra TV sets, for instance.

So Intel will dominate the Android phone space in two years time, since it takes sustained dramatically superior performance to unseat the incumbent.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357784945755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:29:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357785598540-210</Id><Topic><Title>That 22-nanometer phone chip will come later this year, Intel's Erik Reid told CNET today.</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357741721407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:28:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the 22nm (Merrifield) will.

At CES, Intel demoed software that it says will let developers integrate better controls into their apps, so they can move beyond the simplistic Windows 8 controls of scrolling, raising volume or opening or closing applications. The new gesture software also works with games. It will let you use your hands to move your avatar in a game or create a virtual hand in the game that can grab things. As the photo shows, the demo looked promising as the virtual hand appeared in the game and moved to interact with the characters. Since the software recognized individual fingers, the user could even grab and release onscreen coins. The software is still under development. Products based on this technology should appear in the middle of the year. Intel's Wireless Display (WiDi) has also been around for awhile. With a TV and laptop that both have WiDi, you can wirelessly transfer whatever appears on your laptop's display to the TV. Intel said that the new version it was demonstrating had improved performance with less lag time between the two displays than earlier WiDi versions. Intel also demonstrated a new HDMI adapter that lets you run a WiDi app on your computer, Android phone or tablet and "flick" the image to any big screen TV. That adapter should be available later this year."

Computerworld - LAS VEGAS - After Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer made a surprise appearance during a Qualcomm keynote at International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), some analysts wondered how married the company is to Snapdragon chips and the ARM-based ecosystem. Specifically, some said, will Windows Phone smartphones ever run on Intel chips? "We have nothing to announce at this time," about Windows Phone running on Intel, Greg Sullivan, a senior product manager for Windows Phone told Computerworld at CES. Still, he left a wide opening for alternatives to Qualcomm's Snapdragon, which is widely deployed on phones by many manufacturers. "Our architecture is such that it's hardware independent. For the same reason that Windows 8 [tablets] could run on 'Wintel', right now Windows Phone is on Qualcomm. We have a portable OS architecture." Several analysts at CES said Sullivan's answer sounded like Microsoft will eventually work with manufacturers to offer Intel-based smartphones. And why shouldn't it, since Lenovo Motorola, ZTE and and other phone makers are building smartphones for Europe and China on Atom and other Intel chips? In fact, China might be the reason that Microsoft could support an Intel-based phone. Windows Phone 8 on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is "selling like hotcakes in China," Sullivan said. In theory, a Windows Phone on Intel could lower prices for smartphones even further than now in China and other locales. Microsoft is also gaining success with Nokia's Windows Phones in the U.S., Sullivan said, although Microsoft has not shared any sales numbers. At the Qualcomm keynote on Tuesday night, Ballmer said that Windows Phone 8 sales in November were four times higher than in November a year earlier. Sullivan also noted that sales were five times higher for the last week of December when compared with a year earlier. "The sales trends are there for Windows Phone," Sullivan said. "They are going in the right directly absolutely and strongly." In the U.S., all four major carriers offer Windows Phones, and Verizon and T-Mobile USA both announced at CES that they would be adding more Windows Phones to their lineup. "There's sales momentum, carrier momentum, and app momentum, with 125,000 apps," Sullivan noted. Sullivan acknowledged there's a long way to go to even gain 10% market share in smartphones, with Windows Phone at less than 5%. Still, he said focus group research shows an increase in how often consumers consider buying a Windows Phone, which is helped by a robust marketing campaign that some reports have put at more than $1 billion for the Windows Phone 8. "With Windows Phone 8, we're in this for the long haul," Sullivan said. "We used to think about Windows as software on a PC, but it's also on the server and in the cloud and in Skybox and other services\u0014even Xbox. Windows is not only Windows and Windows Phone. It's across all parts of Microsoft."</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357786101250</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:48:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357786282053-214</Id><Topic><Title>That 22-nanometer phone chip will come later this year, Intel's Erik Reid told CNET today.</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357741721407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:28:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice to see that Intel is going to be taking business from Qualcomm: "In mid-2012 Intel doubled down on LTE/4G when it opened a new office in San Diego, Qualcomm’s home territory, with the express intent of recruiting from the area’s deep pool of baseband talent to build a new modem design team for LTE/4G technologies. There are rumors that Intel will be making at least one more LTE/4G investment in 2013. A second source for LTE/4G baseband modems from Intel will be welcomed by smartphone manufacturers as an alternative to Qualcomm’s near monopoly of LTE/4G modems and will relieve supply constraints."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357786282053</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:51:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357786666727-215</Id><Title>Win RT is dead in the water.

However, for the second time in a row, some analysts and embed customers are not impressed. For that, we need to look into several answers we got from Nvidia. However, after all is said and done, Tegra 4 might have an Achilee's heel in the making. While the company representatives often stated that Tegra 3 competitiveness was stifled by the lack of 4G LTE supporting hardware (HTC One X+ 4G LTE smartphone combines Tegra 3 and Intel/ex-Infineon baseband chip), Tegra 4 might be suffering from another issue: lack of API support. Back in 2010, when Nvidia disclosed its roadmap for the future, it was stated that the desktop architectures will move inside Tegra as well, and that future parts such as Wayne (T40, Tegra 4) and Logan ("Wolverine", T50, Tegra 5) will offer computational capabilities. To put this answer in perspective, Nvidia - a company almost always known for innovation in the desktop and mobile computing space - does not consider that API's such as OpenCL and its own CUDA are important for ultra-efficient computing. This attitude already resulted in a substantial design win turn sour, as the company was thrown out of BMW Group, a year and a few quarters after it triumphantly pushed Intel out of BMW's structure. According to our contacts close to heart of the matter, OpenCL was the reason why Nvidia "is out". Witnessing that the company does not believe in CUDA (currently), does not believe in OpenCL (currently) and furthermore, has an issue with believing in success of Windows RT / Windows 8 as it does not support DirectX higher than 9. This will probably end up being painfully exposed through next-generation cross-platform benchmarks from Futuremark (next-gen 3DMark is cross-platform: WinRT/8, Android, iOS) and Rightware (Basemark X), all coming out in the upcoming weeks. Too bad for Nvidia, as Tegra 4 could have been a 1-2-3 punch for its competitors, tired of Qualcomm's inability to deliver functional Windows RT drivers (just ask HP and others how they feel about their Qualcomm-based RT tablets and the R&amp;D money blown on getting that hardware/software to work). From the looks of it, Tegra 4 looks to be a great design product for Google Android smartphones and tablets. Windows RT and automotive/embedded markets on the other hand... obviously the company will have to limit damage there.

I don't understand why you want to change this discussion into a chess match. INTC is five years behind in mobile, that's what counts, and OEMs aren't suddenly going to cross the street to use INTC products when they have their production lines stuffed with products from ARM, QualComm, etc. The performance advantages are specious at best and there is no reference design.
