However, the conflicting materials and design requirements for N- and P-type devices make achieving balanced performance and desired threshold voltage challenging. Meanwhile, extremely thin SOI (ETSOI) technology is a viable device architecture for continued CMOS scaling to 22nm and beyond. Among the reasons why are that it offers superior short-channel control and low device variability with undoped channels. At the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in December, a team led by IBM will report on the world’s first high-performance hybrid-channel ETSOI CMOS device. They integrated a PFET having a thin, uniform strained SiGe channel, with an NFET having a Si channel, at 22nm geometries. A novel STI-last (isolation-last) process makes the hybrid architecture possible. The researchers built a ring oscillator circuit to benchmark performance, and the hybrid planar devices enabled the fastest ring oscillator ever reported, with a delay of only 11.2ps/stage at 0.7V, even better than FinFETs.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348289259160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 00:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348289890309-2</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and th ARM ecosystem</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348289259160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 00:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's no such thing as "ARM fabrication".

"Analyst Expectations We are forecasting revenues of $9.06 billion and EPS of $.29. This would represent an 11% decline in revenues from last year's $10.22 billion in the same period. The current analyst consensus estimates calls for revenues of $9.02 billion and EPS of $.27. On August 28, the company increased their third quarter revenue guidance range to $8.8 - $9.2 billion up from their initial range of $8.1 - $8.9 billion. Business is picking up nicely for Intel and this will likely be the last quarter they will have to report y/y sales declines. Beginning next quarter, Intel's revenue comps become much more favorable and the company will be able to demonstrate both revenue growth and solid profits. We view positively the company's surprise announcement that stronger than expected demand for microprocessors and chipsets would help Intel deliver stronger sales results in the third quarter. However, INTC's stock price has only increased 1% since the announcement which may indicate that the stock will receive a nice jump following their earnings announcement. Valuation Shares are now trading at 16x consensus 2010 EPS estimates. This is above the relative valuations of their peer group. Given Intel's improving prospects and favorable comps in the coming quarters, we feel that investors should continue to buy this stock." Expectations for 2010 EPS at the time were $1.25. So a respectable 10% annual growth rate thereafter would have been considered very healthy for a company like Intel and the stock would have been very much respected. Looking at Intel through the expectations back then, the company has done very well and is expected to continue to do well. Growth was obviously much much higher than expected for 2010 and 2011, making the potential results for 2012 seem mediocre. However, back in 2009, some actually thought Intel's earnings for 2012 could be less than 2009 due to the success of the smartphones. But that did not happen. Instead, Intel is now expected to growth to an EPS of $2.14 from 2010's expected EPS of $1.25. And if Intel only reported the expected $1.25 EPS in 2009, they would have stil shown a growth of 62% which would have been close to the highest earnings level for Intel. So relative to those expectations, Intel's potential EPS of $2.14 for 2012 would mean an annual growth rate of 31% on average. Nobody back then even dreamed of Intel earnings growth to be along those lines. So Intel's stock price currently is only a victim of the company's own huge success in 2010 and 2011. And if the market refuses to raise the stock price, I'm sure the company will step in and create buying pressure with the huge earnings numbers they have been and will continue to be posting. Anything over $2 EPS for the foreseeable future, even with no growth at all, means over $10 billion net income per year.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1348293933432</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 02:05:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348297219768-8</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and th ARM ecosystem</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348289259160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 00:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There's no such thing as "ARM fabrication".

Just saying it doesn't make it so. You did say one true thing this time: "There's no such thing as "ARM fabrication". In comparison to Intel that's absolutely true. Tell us how the 28nm ARM ramp compared to the 22nm Intel ramp. Intel ramped up smoothly in a quarter. After a year, ARM still isn't ramped up. And Intel was FinFET whereas ARM is the same old technology that they struggled with at even 45nm. Just the facts: ARM fabrication isn't comparable. It's not going to be comparable. Intel's fabrication lead is growing. No one but Intel can move the fabrication bar every eight quarters. Intel smoothly moves to new fabrication levels. ARM lurches from pothole to pothole with each new fabrication level. GloFlo isn't anywhere near 14nm and isn't going to be for half a decade. Intel will pass ARM in power efficiency performance in 2013 and ARM will never regain the lead. The fabless model is broken. The IDM model (Intel) is a considerably superior model at smaller and more complex die sizes. No ARM foundry other than Samsung can afford $10 billion for a new fab. And Samsung doesn't have the technology to move to 14nm and won't for years. Some comments to an article by EETimes: "Let me repeat myself : the free ride that the "fabless wonders" and offshore foundries have been enjoying at the expense of serious IDMs is coming to a close. IBM is discredited after they misled hanger-on foundries into the HKMG fiasco. They can no longer play the spoiler even with SOI ( to lower leakage )." "When asked if the multipatterning issues at 14-nm applied to both integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundries Meurice said: "At 14-nm, foundries have a challenge that the IDMs (like Intel) would not have. The challenge is that thay have to deliver design rules which are less restrictive and they have to deliver a shrink that is very aggressive." As such the decision to go to EUV for 14-nm concerns the foundry environment more than the microprocessor environment, Meurice said."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348297219768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 03:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348301096051-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and th ARM ecosystem</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348289259160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 00:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell us how the 28nm ARM ramp compared to the 22nm Intel ramp.

As for comparing an Intel ramp to a foundry ramp, it's like comparing oranges and apples. In the foundry world fab lines stay alive for a decade or more, you don't migrate everything over like Intel. You also don't seem to understand the differences between LP and HP processes, why one can have issues and the other not. Clearly Intel has a process lead, but not currently in LP. Some facts for you: Intel is at the same node as the foundries Historically it's LP processes haven't been that good compared to the foundries (eg 45nm). Intel uses a foundry to produce it's own base bands 'on old technology' as you put it (40nm). Yes, Intel claim all this will change. Next year. A lot can happen in a year. The bulk of your ARM fabrication (fantasy) arguments are at best confused and at their worst, wrong.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1348301096051</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 04:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348314922038-10</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's recent warning or slowdown is all relative.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1348293933432</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 02:05:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The slide in INTC stock is telling a different story.

Once the unstoppable juggernaut who put the “silicon” in Silicon Valley, Intel is now a Dog of the Dow. But though temporarily upstaged by ARM in the race to mobile, and only now emerging from a decade long price war with AMD, the Santa Clara-based microprocessor giant hasn't laid down its hand and quit the holy game of poker, quite the contrary; Intel has been hard at work re-inventing the rules of the game itself. Clocking in at 10 years of development, more time and effort have been spent on “Radio Free Intel” than two Manhattan Projects. To understand what Intel has done, you first have to understand something about Moore's Law. Moore's Law was discovered at Intel by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper, "Cramming more components onto integrated circuits." Moore's Law states that the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip will double every two years, while costs decrease by half. Over the last 40 years, Moore's insight has proven to be correct. The problem is that Moore's Law doesn't apply to most WiFi components. If you squeeze transistors onto a silicon chip, the efficiency of the microprocessor increases in tandem with heat. But with analog components, like the ones found in WiFi chipsets, the opposite is true. That's because wireless radios and processors both give off radiation that interfere with each other. The more you shrink WiFi components, the less efficient they become. So Intel decided to find a way to put a digital WiFi radio directly on a chip. Intel has christened the result “Moore's Law Radio”, although it is more commonly known as Rosepoint or “Radio Free Intel.” Intel estimates that it will be packaged and ready to ship in just over 2 years, after which it will appear in everything from your mobile phone and television to your car and even your kitchen appliances. Because it’s on a chip, you can keep shrinking it smaller and smaller, until Intel is literally inside everything. The shake up couldn't come at a better time for Intel. While consumers reap the benefits of ever-cheaper computing power, the cost of "growing" and fabricating the chips haven't decreased at all. Any benefits the manufacturers recieve due to economies of scale are quickly canceled out by the rapid pace of innovation. Every technological advance in miniaturization requires an overhaul of expensive wafer fabrication plants. Intel's new plant in Arizona cost $5 billion dollars. This "technology treadmill" has already crippled AMD. In 2008, AMD outsourced its fabrication plants to Globalfoundries, with the majority stake of the new company going to the government of Abu Dhabi. A year later, AMD's market valuation fell off a cliff, and the stock has yet to recover. The real threat to Intel's continued dominance is ARM. ARM doesn't manufacture its own processors like Intel does, and has none of AMD's outsourcing headaches. Instead, the company licenses its intellectual property directly to customers, who can fine-tune the designs any way they want, and have the finished chips assembled anywhere in the world. Enter Rosepoint. Rosepoint has given Intel is a generational advantage that ARM can't replicate with a 6 month crash R&amp;D program. Intel's scientists and engineers have been tinkering with this for 10 years; which means that Intel already knows what works and what doesn't. If there's more than one way to cram WiFi onto a chip, you can bet that Intel has patented it too. Intel didn't stop there. In anticipation of a drawn out legal battle that could block the sale of Rosepoint while buying ARM valuable R&amp;D time, Intel purchased Interdigital's portfolio of 1,700 WiFi patents in June, 2012; which include core patents relating to 3G as well as LTE and LTE-Advanced 4G technologies. The message to ARM Holdings CEO Warren East could hardly be clearer: ARM's core business may be chip design, but its SoC technology, along with hundreds of ARM's ecosystem partners rely on the patents Intel now holds. If ARM seeks an injuction against Rosepoint's in 2015, it can expect Intel to seek a similar injunction against its SoC technology every WiFi/LTE product with an ARM chip. Intel is pitting ARM against Moore's Law, and its a fight ARM can't win. Intel can just keep shrinking and shrinking Rosepoint until ARM folds. Even if it threw everything it had into its own version between now and 2015, ARM will still be years behind Radio Free Intel. And that's very good news for Intel investors.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348342494782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348343015816-18</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is pitting ARM against Moore's Law, and its a fight ARM can't win.</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348342494782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:34:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.

"] This is an enormous challenge for ARM-based tablets running on Windows RT. because as of now, Metro Mail (sorry, I’m going to call it Metro until Microsoft gives us a real alternative) is the only mail client available for RT. Outlook 2013 has the same architecture and essentially the same user interface as Outlook 2010, and its computational, memory, and storage demands always made it unlikely as a component of Office on RT. Microsoft made this official in a somewhat backhanded reference in an Office Next blog post, that said that the Mail app does not support “certain [Office application] email sending features, since Windows RT does not support Outlook or other desktop mail applications (opening a mail app, such as the mail app that comes with Windows RT devices, and inserting your Office content works fine).” Unless some third party comes up with a more capable Metro mail client soon, I think RT tablets will effectively be disqualified for enterprise use. Yes, the Metro Mail app is an Exchange client, but it’s a wretched one, far worse than iPad Mail. Enterprise users may have to rely on Outlook Web Access (OWA) for a decent Exchange experience–but the current version requires an active network connection to do anything. Exchange Server 2013 will add offline access capabilities to OWA, but it is likely to be at least a couple of years before this versions is widely deployed by enterprise IT. The fact that Microsoft, which owns the back-end mail systems of the corporate and institutional world with Exchange, has failed to offer a first-rate mail client for a tablet it considers a key to the future is just baffling.

The keynote, delivered by Intel's own Justin Rattner, CTO, detailed a future that could be distilled to just one, eight word phrase: "In the future, if it computes, it connects." Those eight words carried a lot of weight, and a lot of exciting implications. To back up the keynote, Rattner showed off what Intel is referring to as a "Moore's Law Radio", showing how a purely digital radio can follow Moore's Law--that computing power, as measured by the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles, roughly, every two years--thanks to improvements in digital chip processes, especially the new 22nm tri-gate model from Intel. This in turn allows for what has come to be called "system-on-a-chip" technology, which can offer many of the same services that a full-sized computer system would offer, yet do so in an extremely small space, like for smartphones and tablets. With digital radios steadily declining in both size and price, their use in other devices becomes not only possible but more likely, as an old concept called "The Internet of Things" comes into its fullest fruition. Under the concept of "The Internet of Things", home appliances, complete with sensors, can communicate effectively between each other, and can even be operated via remote. This combination of features opens up a wide variety of potential uses. But that wasn't all; Rattner also showed off a new wireless standard, dubbed WiGig. WiGig is a part of an industry-encompassing effort to bring several different 60 GHz wireless standards under the banner of the current Wi-Fi standard. But WiGig, meanwhile, can offer some impressive speeds all its own. Bandwidths over 5 Gbps are possible with WiGig, and the whole thing is sufficiently fast to not only allow for a wirelessly-docked Ultrabook, but also multiple displays at once. Rattner went on to show improvements in battery life thanks to Intel's Smart Connect technology, which wakes up an Ultrabook just long enough to receive packet traffic and then return to standby mode, thus ensuring that the least power possible is used and the battery is prolonged. He also showed a new kind of biometric interface that would replace passwords--allowing users to essentially authenticate at the device level--for websites and cloud-based information, and even showed a cloud-based radio access network. Naturally, this was material shown at the developer level. Looking for any of this to hit shelves by Christmas is likely going to end in disappointment. But where this has its truest value is in showing users, and developers, just what Intel hardware can do in no uncertain terms. They're opening up the concept of home appliances that can be controlled by remote, passwords that are tied to unique biological identifiers, and plenty more from there. The implications are almost dizzying in scope and represent the potential for technologies we can barely imagine.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348350719709</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 17:51:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348350986948-26</Id><Title>New WiFi Technology is About to Change Everything</Title><Msg>To hear the Wall St. Journal tell it, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) best years -- the halcyon days of Pentium processors and the Wintel Monopoly -- are behind it, the phrase "Intel Inside" are as charmingly dated as the words "It's toasted!" on a pack of Lucky Strikes. Once the unstoppable juggernaut who put the “silicon” in Silicon Valley, Intel is now a Dog of the Dow. But though temporarily upstaged by ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH) in the race to mobile, and only now emerging from a decade long price war with AMD (NYSE: AMD), the Santa Clara-based microprocessor giant hasn't laid down its hand and quit the holy game of poker, quite the contrary; Intel has been hard at work re-inventing the rules of the game itself. Clocking in at 10 years of development, more time and effort have been spent on “Radio Free Intel” than two Manhattan Projects. To understand what Intel has done, you first have to understand something about Moore's Law. Moore's Law was discovered at Intel by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper, "Cramming more components onto integrated circuits." Moore's Law states that the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip will double every two years, while costs decrease by half. Over the last 40 years, Moore's insight has proven to be correct. The problem is that Moore's Law doesn't apply to most WiFi components. If you squeeze transistors onto a silicon chip, the efficiency of the microprocessor increases in tandem with heat. But with analog components, like the ones found in WiFi chipsets, the opposite is true. That's because wireless radios and processors both give off radiation that interfere with each other. The more you shrink WiFi components, the less efficient they become. So Intel decided to find a way to put a digital WiFi radio directly on a chip. Intel has christened the result “Moore's Law Radio”, although it is more commonly known as Rosepoint or “Radio Free Intel.” Intel estimates that it will be packaged and ready to ship in just over 2 years, after which it will appear in everything from your mobile phone and television to your car and even your kitchen appliances. Because it’s on a chip, you can keep shrinking it smaller and smaller, until Intel is literally inside everything. The shake up couldn't come at a better time for Intel. While consumers reap the benefits of ever-cheaper computing power, the cost of "growing" and fabricating the chips haven't decreased at all. Any benefits the manufacturers recieve due to economies of scale are quickly canceled out by the rapid pace of innovation. Every technological advance in miniaturization requires an overhaul of expensive wafer fabrication plants. Intel's new plant in Arizona cost $5 billion dollars. This "technology treadmill" has already crippled AMD. In 2008, AMD outsourced its fabrication plants to Globalfoundries, with the majority stake of the new company going to the government of Abu Dhabi. A year later, AMD's market valuation fell off a cliff, and the stock has yet to recover. The real threat to Intel's continued dominance is ARM. ARM doesn't manufacture its own processors like Intel does, and has none of AMD's outsourcing headaches. Instead, the company licenses its intellectual property directly to customers, who can fine-tune the designs any way they want, and have the finished chips assembled anywhere in the world. Enter Rosepoint. Rosepoint has given Intel is a generational advantage that ARM can't replicate with a 6 month crash R&amp;D program. Intel's scientists and engineers have been tinkering with this for 10 years; which means that Intel already knows what works and what doesn't. If there's more than one way to cram WiFi onto a chip, you can bet that Intel has patented it too. Intel didn't stop there. In anticipation of a drawn out legal battle that could block the sale of Rosepoint while buying ARM valuable R&amp;D time, Intel purchased Interdigital's portfolio of 1,700 WiFi patents in June, 2012; which include core patents relating to 3G as well as LTE and LTE-Advanced 4G technologies. The message to ARM Holdings CEO Warren East could hardly be clearer: ARM's core business may be chip design, but its SoC technology, along with hundreds of ARM's ecosystem partners rely on the patents Intel now holds. If ARM seeks an injuction against Rosepoint's in 2015, it can expect Intel to seek a similar injunction against its SoC technology every WiFi/LTE product with an ARM chip. Intel is pitting ARM against Moore's Law, and its a fight ARM can't win. Intel can just keep shrinking and shrinking Rosepoint until ARM folds. Even if it threw everything it had into its own version between now and 2015, ARM will still be years behind Radio Free Intel.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348350986948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 17:56:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348351603594-27</Id><Title>Are will be putting its Chips exclusively in Coffee makers 5 years from now</Title><Msg>lkadjflajfkdljfdlsa</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1348351603594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 18:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348351642223-28</Id><Topic><Title>Are will be putting its Chips exclusively in Coffee makers 5 years from now</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1348351603594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 18:06:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1348351642223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 18:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348351727980-29</Id><Title>Looks Like</Title><Msg>Looks like amongst Radio Free Intel, being able to help diagnose diseases like Lupus and its highly superior fabrication, Intel is preparing to show the technology-lite chumps on Wall Street just how wrong they have been.

Dr. Barrett became Intel's fourth president in 1997, chief executive officer in 1998 and chairman of the Board in 2005. Merced: Itanium was released in June 2001. Think about when the development and decisions were made for this product. Diamond Substrate: muliplte patents issued in 2001. NETPC: Intel unveiled the first NETPC systems in 1997. Mobile Module Connectors: 1995 through early 2000 for SLOT-I and SLOT-2 (servers) You seem very familiar with the late 1990's and the Barrett version of Intel.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1348369696784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:08:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348370757991-39</Id><Topic><Title>We like the 4% dividends and we are buying shares now</Title><Username>johnboy2680</Username><Timestamp>1348246253924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:50:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My entry point was below $20 in late 2010.
