The firm showed off an array of tablets, smartphones, cameras and laptops — as well as products that fit in multiple product categories. And while the company didn’t offer specific announcements about when consumers can expect to see most of these products on store shelves, it did offer plenty of eye candy to whet their appetites. One of the most original products the firm introduced was the convertible ATIV Q, which is a hybrid device that works as both Android tablet and a Windows PC. That means that users will be able to switch easily between Android apps and Windows 8. The ATIV Q also comes with the Samsung S Pen and full keyboard to make it more like a laptop. It weighs in at 2.84 pounds, which is a bit hefty for a tablet but lightweight for a laptop. The tablet’s 13.3-inch display is optimized for use in bright sunlight — an effort to make the device easier to tote around. The company has not announced when the ATIV Q will be available for sale.

Samsung also introduced two new computers: the ATIV Book 9 Lite notebook and the ATIV One 5, an all-in-one that has a narrow bezel and is less than .2 inches thick. Company executives said new, sleek forms of its tablets and computers are meant to remind users of the design of its popular Galaxy line of gadgets. Executives were quick to highlight how these products prove that the company is an innovator. “Anyone who says we are not has not been watching closely,” said Patrick Povel, head of European marketing, in what could have been a dig at the company’s ongoing patent litigation with Apple.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation.

"Those from the government sector, especially in the field of education and even the corporates, will benefit from our latest innovation. They can use it for a variety of purposes. "The made in Malaysia processor is able to transform work with its right combination of functionality, speed and flexibility," Country Manager of Intel Malaysia and Singapore, Prakash Mallya told Bernama. About 3,000 Intel engineers worldwide participated in the making of the processor, and 30 per cent were Malaysians. Yesterday, the American multinational semi-conductor chip maker, which has been present in Penang since 1972, officially launched the new processor. It is the first to be built from the ground up for the ultrabook and the most significant change since the Intel Centrino Technology. The fourth generation Intel core processor combines the normal personal desktop performance, with a tablet-like mobility, to accelerate to a new category of two-in-one devices.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371818280990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 08:38:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371818297904-22</Id><Topic><Title>Intel confidend new processor will be well received</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371818280990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 08:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With a power level as low as six watts, the processor enables thinner, lighter, cooler, quieter and fanless designs. "The fourth generation Intel core processor offers the most significant gain in battery life enabling ever achieved by Intel, and double the graphics and significant CPU performance improvements to deliver exciting new consumer experiences," Prakash said. Intel has also expanded its range of graphics in the highly integrated system on chip (SOC) to deliver even more stunning visuals in thinner and lighter devices. This is a good news for gamers as it can double the 3-D performance. Prakash said when watching movies or surfing the internet, the new processor will bring about a 50 per cent improvement in battery life over the previous generation. Based on all these features, Intel is expecting to see a substantial portion of it in market by year-end. "We are very bullish about the adoption. It's a great product," he said, adding, Intel's partners such as Dell, Acer, Toshiba and HP, will help create consumer demand for the Fourth Generation Intel Core processor. -- BERNAMA</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371818297904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 08:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371818393746-23</Id><Topic><Title>anybody looking at Micron?</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371750606579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting at first glance.

Courtesy of Amunts, Zilles, Evans et al A new 3-D map of the brain is the best thing since sliced cold cuts, at least to some neuroscientists. “It’s a remarkable tour-de-force to reconstruct an entire human brain with such accuracy,” says David Van Essen, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis. Using a high-tech deli slicer and about 100,000 computer processors, researchers shaved a human brain into thousands of thin slivers and then digitally glued them together. The result is the most detailed brain atlas ever published. Dubbed BigBrain, the digital model has a resolution 50 times greater in each of the three spatial dimensions than currently available maps, researchers report in the June 21 Science. The difference is like zooming from a satellite view of a city down to the street level, says coauthor Alan Evans, a neuroimaging scientist at McGill University in Montreal. BigBrain allows researchers to navigate the landscape of the human cortex, the rugged outer layer of the brain. And unlike previous maps, the tool also lets scientists burrow beneath the surface, tunnel through the brain’s hemispheres and step slice-by-slice through high-res structural data. Around 100 years ago, neuroscientists relied on thick slabs of brain tissue to crudely chart out neural regions. More recently, imaging tools such as MRI have let researchers take a more detailed look. But even the very best MRI maps are still a little fuzzy, says Hanchuan Peng, a computational biologist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seatt</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1371819517584</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 08:58:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371819559684-27</Id><Topic><Title>anybody looking at Micron?</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371750606579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Upon some additional checks, negative ROA, ROI, ROE, negative Operating and Profit Margins.

They have a 50 cent premium and there is the August Intel dividend before expiration that is priced in. When I seen future in the money put option activity with a premium, I have to think that is PUT WRITING where they expect to get the shares back. A variation on that occurred to me this week. Someone could be writing the options as a "pre-buy" for shorting Intel. 1. it appears that someone has WRITTEN 40,000 SEP $27 PUT option contracts 2. 40,000 contracts controls 4,000,000 shares 3. TRC Capital mini offer is 4,000,000 shares at $23.75 (probably a coincidence) SHORT PUT, SHORT INTC EXAMPLE: I can WRITE 100 SEP $27 put options right now at $3.20 when INTC is $24.25. I can then immediately short 10,000 shares of Intel stock. I get the $3.20 premium for the SEP $27 for an effective INTC acquire price of $23.80. I short Intel at $24.25. The difference is $24.25 - $23.80 = $0.45 per share. There is a 22.5 cent August dividend that I would have to pay on shorted shares which would leave $0.22.5 per share profit. If I hold until Sep, my other costs are: option buying commissions borrow costs share assignment costs in Sep Any guess what the per share cost to write the 40,000 puts, borrow costs and share assignment in SEP would be for a hedge fund?

Windows 8.1 will be launched at the Microsoft Build developer conference in San Francisco on June 26 and the final version will be available as a free downloadable Windows 8 update. Microsoft also said last month that there would be a preview version available before full release which we'll get on that day in late June. The "first look" blog update posted by Microsoft's Antoine Leblond in May doesn't talk about a Start button. It does, however, say that the Start "tip" will change to "be the familiar Windows logo".</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1371829467805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 11:44:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371829479030-78</Id><Title>ARMH getting crushed - thanks to Aessa</Title><Msg>He single-handidly has changed the sentiment on this stock with article after article bashing the company's valuation.

[That's funny that you would conclude that with the stock having gone up by five bucks since November and Intel really just starting to get traction now. With Intel's 14nm FinFET volume production on the way in early 2014, I can't see Intel not breaking 30 on or before its arrival.

In fact, roughly 18% of INTC's intraday call volume of 56,000 has crossed at the strike for a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $0.06. Almost all of these contracts went off at the ask price, and volume is outstripping open interest, hinting at buy-to-open activity. In order for today's call buyers to profit from their play, INTC -- currently docked at $24.25 -- has to scoot northward a mere 1.3% to finish above the breakeven price of $24.56 (strike price plus the VWAP) by the end of the today's session. As of now, prospects are unclear, considering INTC sits just 0.2% higher than it did at the opening bell. If the stock continues to linger below the 24.50 strike, today's call buyers stand to lose their initial premium paid. Technically, INTC has advanced almost 23% from the start of 2013 to its year-to-date high of $25.98, reached on June 4, before stooping to its current levels. Despite Intel's recent pullback, speculators during the last 10 sessions have bought to open more than two INTC calls for every put, according to the stock's International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) call/put volume ratio of 2.35. This ratio ranks in the 90th percentile of its annual range, meaning calls have been accumulated over puts at a quicker pace just 10% of the time throughout the past year.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1371845372847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:09:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371845417421-166</Id><Topic><Title>breakeven for 20nm ARM SoC</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371841598838</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 15:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I saw the very unprofessional posts from Mr. Nenni.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371845417421</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:10:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371845830525-167</Id><Topic><Title>This pig lost more than everyone but ORACLE and the rest are up and this pig wallows</Title><Username>chartstradamus</Username><Timestamp>1371843657645</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 15:40:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I is hard to see for two days on my chart but Intel was not the worst over 2 days.

UNLESS the price of Intel moved up and the OMM cleared the ASK supply into his own book at the ASK price as he moved the BID up. Someone selling covered calls for a few cents profit could have offered them at the ASK. These would be SELL TO OPEN and not BUY TO OPEN. One problem with figuring out whether a buy or sell triggered the action is not tracking the underlying stock price. One trade of note even more interesting was the 18k July $25 calls. The open interest is over 100k and the date falls just after Intel earnings. There was 3.9k of Jan 2015 $30. Steady action in the far out of the money calls. These are 90 cents.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371847493211</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:44:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371849320871-171</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like High Hopes faded for these guys</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1371845372847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well most people arrive late to the party which is a good time to take the opposite view, go with the crowd and make no money, be a contrarian and make some money.</Msg><Username>njmozg</Username><Timestamp>1371849320871</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 17:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371850538364-172</Id><Title>23.75 offer between now and 7/15 - doesn't this guarantee a floor?</Title><Msg>Anybody else get this from their broker where you have the option to take 23.75 a share for your stock between now and 7/15 if you want?

They are simply trying to keep their names out there so that unsuspecting Asian employers will hire them long enough to make a few more bucks before a much needed retirement. They are simply shills for rent and after Intel gets done with their market they'll be working for cheap if they can find work at all. Semiwiki is for blowhards who don't want to be told that they are wrong, don't want to defend themselves as they present their skewed views of reality. They don't take comments from the general public which only proves that they are are full of #$%$. Whatever you say on on MF is open for healthy debate, both for and against your point of view. There's none of that on Semiwiki. I haven't looked at Semiwiki in well over a year. When you go to it you can see the desperation of the writers. It's just a sad state of affairs. Five years from now when ARMH has some mystical processor that will bring Intel to it's knees you can rely on Daniel Nenni to bring up the secret FAB that is 3 years ahead of Intel that will crank out this amazing processor in mountain loads sometime in the following year. But that day never comes and he kinda forgets he ever mentions it. Which reminds me, hey Nenni, how's that 20nm working out over at TSMC? Funny, I haven't heard anything about it other than you talking about the tape outs last year.</Msg><Username>armsuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1371851990659</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 17:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371852119597-174</Id><Topic><Title>The Snapdragon 800 benchmarks look very impressive</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371651138585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not too worried about it, when they go with ARM they get to pay for all their own advertising.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1371852119597</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 18:01:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371852513006-175</Id><Topic><Title>Daniel Nenni</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371845976850</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DN is busy riding his convertible hot rod around right now, acting like he's 30 years younger than he really is.

Once that level broke, the drop was sharp and quick, coupled with high volume, and that key area that was support has now become resistance, but we all know you'd still be pumping INTC non stop even if the entire world economy fell apart. non stop pumping of INTC and right back where it was 6 weeks ago despite the never ending pumps.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1371869885442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:58:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371870808407-185</Id><Topic><Title>Daniel Nenni</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371845976850</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 16:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Semiconductor Wiki Project, the premier semiconductor collaboration site, is a growing online community of professionals involved with the semiconductor design and manufacturing ecosystem.
