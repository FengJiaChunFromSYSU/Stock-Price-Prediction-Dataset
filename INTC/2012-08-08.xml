Intel sells processors. You nitwits...]" I say, well said! Let me add to that. Articles keep on claiming that PC sales overall are hurting because of the tablet sales. First of all, iPad is the only tablet seller that has a noticeable number. The latest being 17 million iPad sales in the latest quarter. So the article's headline says, "The PC looks like its dying". In the article it says that IDC reported that there wer 86.7 million PC shipments last quarter. This of course being during a very weak European environment. A large number of PC shipments were for upgrading purposes. Being that the iPad is mostly used for gaming purposes, how many will decide to buy a second iPad in the next 3 years. I say very few. The sales of 17 million or even 20 million iPads per quarter in the near term could be attributed to it being a new and exciting product. Not a PC replacement.

Intel has been offering a motherboard without a video card for years. It wasn't until a half generation before Sandy Bridge that they started offering a viable solution. They were able to play 1080P video and do a reasonably good job with games. The internal GPU was good enough to take on the sub-$150 video card market. For a good portion of the market this was good enough. To a real gamer, this is never good enough because they are into much higher end graphics. What you are asking is if in a few years can you change out your GPU and CPU. I was under the impression with Sandy Bridge that the GPU was in part under the die of the CPU. The other thing that you may have not taken into consideration is that the motherboard changes as well over time. It can take on more RAM and faster ram, offer new ports such as SATA 6 and Thunderbolt. When your CPU starts to get technically obsolete chances are that there would have been so many improvements in the motherboard technology that you will want a new motherboard as well.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1344432971000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 09:36:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344434573000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone with technical computer knowledge?</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1344425971000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 07:39:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Technical reasons aren't holding back your dream: "If INTC bought NVDA, then could they incorporate the tech into the motherboard?"

But on a more basic level, I think even users who may be able to live with Office RT will find that the Tablet form factor is not optimal for their basic word processing / spreadsheet tasks. I can't imagine typing a bunch of stuff on a virtual keyboard or on the flimsy keyboard on the Surface Tablet cover. And if you keep needing to hook up a real keyboard/mouse, you may as well go with a touch-based or hybrid laptop. I think the Tablet is primarily an entertainment device and may be ok for a few FB postings. But not for doing word processing or spreadsheets. Those who think that Office is a compelling offering for Surface are going to be disappointed - Apple iPad and Google Nexus cover both the premium and value sides of the market, Surface may end up being another Zune/Kin for Microsoft.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344445154000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:59:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344446341000-36</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT Office is garbage</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1344443117000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:25:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Defend your shareholders Paul O.

Each lost phone sales is a lost ecosystem sale. The iPods now their iPhones were the gateway into the Apple Universe. The article said that the phone sales came at the expense of RIMM and other small players. Sure, today it's not worth it to contract for a phone with an OS that may not be around in a couple of years when the phone contract is finished. The BS we heard from Apple was that consumers were waiting for the new iPhone. What we saw was that the market was in fact growing and Apple has sold more iPhones year over year. The problem is that Android is growing four times faster. What this means is that new customers were more likely not to buy the iPhone. You will see this trend happen with the iPad as well in the next couple of years. Keep in mind that 80% of Apple's profits are based on those two ARM based products. What can we learn from this? 1. Consumers aren't as likely to buy an iPhone because it has an Apple logo on it as they used to be. 2. iPhone gets new models once a year, Android at least every month. This raises the bar faster than Apple can respond. 3. The modified ARM processor isn't unique enough for Apple to have a have a selling feature that stands out over the competition. Consumers don't know of the A5 processor or why they should buy it over a Tegra3. All they know is that they found Samsung phones that are better fits for them.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1344459201000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:53:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344459453000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is in the iphone 5</Title><Username>skepticalofeverything</Username><Timestamp>1344443073000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:24:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This would be an win/win for Apple and Intel.

They got slammed for bigger batteries in the Ipad and they are not going to sacrafice and go backwards. If they were to come out with a bad Iphone 5 after the 4S, they're toast and they know it. Even with Samsung's headaches they have to keep up with them, even if that means they have to stay another year and use their chips. However there will come a day when Intel will blow them all out of the water and the plates will shift yet their latest ref chip probably won't do it.

It would be smart for Microsoft or anyone else to not compete against Apple on the same platform. In this case, being an ARM based tablet. A limited functioning device would only work for Apple. Everyone else has to think about serious performance advantages.
