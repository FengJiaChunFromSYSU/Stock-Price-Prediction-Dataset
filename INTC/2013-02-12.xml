How many "Liberals" did you use in your sample to find the typical? There is better than a 50% probability that your "typical Liberal" on this board is just a "typical Conservative" pretending to be what he thinks a "typical Liberal" sounds like. One of the best insults is an ugly parody. "This dork forgets that we go to war to prevent people from ramming planes into American buildings, killings innocent people." The Trade Center attack cost $3b to $4.5b and 3,000 lives. The cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars since 2001 has been $1,422b. 4488+2177=6965 deaths, 33k wounded not counting the native population. I bet the "dork" could have figured out a more efficient defense than spending $1,422 bil. Why, I bet you could have figured out a better response. "Food stamps?" You use this as a disparaging label. There are some who do not deserve to be on the program. The program could simply be killed if Americans did not mind people going to bed hungry. Which groups of people would you deny food? Demographics... Participants According to the United States Department of Agriculture (based on a study of data gathered in Fiscal Year 2010), statistics for the food stamp program are as follows: 49% of all participant households have children (17 or younger), and 55% of those are single-parent households. 15% of all participant households have elderly (age 60 or over) members. 20% of all participant households have non-elderly disabled members. The average gross monthly income per food stamp household is $731; The average net income is $336. 36% of participants are White, 22% are African-American, 10% are Hispanic, 2% are Asian, 4% are Native American, and 19% are of unknown race or ethnicity.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1360688478632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:01:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360688567860-32</Id><Topic><Title>Flumoxed' aliases</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1352671230820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:00:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAAA HAAA My life is good and I feel fine.

Year after year, California officials reported bigger and bigger deficits and sought to respond with spending cuts that left the state reeling.

Connect With Us on Twitter Follow @NYTNational for breaking news and headlines. Twitter List: Reporters and Editors .So it was something of a moment when a jaunty Gov. Jerry Brown strode before cameras here on Thursday to present his budget for 2013-14. “The deficit is gone,” Mr. Brown proclaimed, standing in front of an array of that-was-then and this-is-now charts that illustrated what he said were dramatic changes in California’s fortunes. “For the next four years we are talking about a balanced budget,” he said. “We are talking about living within our means. This is new. This is a breakthrough.” Mr. Brown was not just talking about a balanced budget. He projected that the state would begin posting surpluses starting next year, leading to a projected surplus of $21.5 million by 2014, a dramatic turnaround from the deficit of $26 billion — billion, not million — he faced when he was elected in 2010.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1360690837046</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:40:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360690869155-40</Id><Topic><Title>Hey GOP teabagging trash.

In the meantime it's fun watching the stockholders order more Kool-Aid... 1.) Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. It means a extra cost of 50-100M USD per year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360694999284</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:49:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360695043758-52</Id><Title>If you voted for Mcpain, Romney and on AMD, you are a three time loser.</Title><Msg>Intel will see 40 this year.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1360695043758</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:50:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360695530638-53</Id><Topic><Title>Hey amdmokney, go #$%$ off to Hillary or Nancy Pelosi</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1360689220869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:13:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to get out of Moms basement and go get laid, you're way too angry.

Broadcom has revealed it’s prepping a smartphone modem that supports super-fast data speeds known as Long Term Evolution or LTE. The company is currently sampling its chip, known as BCM21892, to clients and will begin production next year. It says the chip takes up 35% less space than its previous offerings. Broadcom's Future Look Bright Heading Into Earnings Trefis Team Contributor Qualcomm Girds For 2013's Smartphone Battle With New Chips Announced Trefis Team Contributor As a result of being so small the modem chip will also be more energy efficient and cheaper to produce. “It will cost less than those of our competitors,” Broadcom Chief Executive Scott McGregor said plainly in an interview. “So customers will be pretty pleased.” Shares of Broadcom ticked up 0.8% in New York to $33.65 on Tuesday afternoon; they’re also up 8.9% in the last three months, suggesting investors have already priced today’s somewhat-expected news into the stock. The Broadcom-Qualcomm battle has echoes of the skirmish between Intel and AMD over PC chips, except theirs is a war over three key sockets in a smartphone: the processor (brain), the modem, and the connectivity combo chip. They and others are making varying attempts to combine some of those functionalities into one system on a chip (SoC). Qualcomm is the market leader for the first two areas and Broadcom for combo chips, which help smartphones access WiFi and Bluetooth. Broadcom has around 90% market share for smartphone combo chips, according to analyst Patrick Wang of Evercore Partners. But it has just 4-5% share of the market for modems, where Qualcomm is also the leader in LTE. Complicating matters is that Qualcomm’s latest 860 Snapdragon processor also integrates LTE connectivity, having made a smart, early bet on LTE. As such, the company supplied 86% of the 47 million LTE-capable chips that were shipped last year, according to Bloomberg. Other processor-making rivals like Samsung, Nvidia and Texas Instruments don’t make processors with LTE integration, but Broadcom is working on offering the same eventually. Until then, Broadcom hopes that the extra features on its new modem will make it a better standalone chip than Qualcomm’s integrated processor. Among those features: voice-over-LTE support and technology that helps a carrier make full use of its bandwidth, as well as technology that helps in spectrum sharing between carriers (which won’t be till a few years down the line). “The real advantage with this chip coming out as a very competitive chip is it offers choice for our customers,” said McGregor. In a veiled reference to Qualcomm he added: “Our competitors have announced chips but I question they will be fully-featured support of world bands and data rates. They may be an LTE chip, but remember that LTE is a family of standards.” Broadcom also stands to benefit from better margins on the new LTE modem. While the connectivity combo chips typically cost handset manufacturers between $3 and $5, the modem chip is in the high teens to 20s, says Wang, who anticipates that Apple will choose to put Broadcom’s current combo chip in a (rumoured) iPhone 5S, and that Samsung would also put it in its forthcoming Galaxy 4S. “Broadcom and Qualcomm will be trading body shots here for the next couple of years,” said Wang. “Broadcom won’t make [LTE] processors to displace Qualcomm in the near term, but six to 12 quarters out, who knows.” Broadcom does make processors, including the low-end chip that powers the Raspberry Pi computer. When asked when Broadcom might bring out an LTE processor to challenge Qualcomm, McGregor only said that it made sense to integrate processors and Broadcom’s connectivity products, “but that’s not what we’re announcing today.”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1360696622989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:17:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360696771955-59</Id><Topic><Title>MORE HELL FOR INTEL IN SMART PHONE SoC chi[s</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1360696622989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:17:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sorry nuff, nice try.</Msg><Username>harrydick836</Username><Timestamp>1360696771955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:19:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360696859103-60</Id><Title>Intel Working on Internet Television Platform; Taps Top Talent for Media</Title><Msg>Intel (INTC) Working on Internet Television Platform; Taps Top Talent for Media Dividend Yield: 4.2% February 12, 2013 1:15 PM EST Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is developing an internet television platform, according to VP Erik Huggers.

At this point it doesn’t benefit Intel to announce it, as such news can change in a heartbeat, but it looks as if the Haswell 2 chip platform, a part of Shark Bay 2013 platform, should have significantly better battery life than the previous Ivy Bridge 2012 generation. Our sources close to Intel claim that we can expect as much as up to 70 percent more battery life compared to an equivalent Chief River (Ivy Bridge) platform. This is a huge success. Compared to an existing generation platform and even in the Shark bay Ultrabook baseline feature Intel dares to share that we can expect whole-day battery life. When Intel and other companies talk about all-day battery life, it usually means a working day, or eight hours, so don’t be tricked into thinking that whole day battery life means 24 hours. Most Ultrabooks today can deliver 5 to 6 hours and it looks like this is about to change with Shark Bay Ultrabooks, that are expected in Q3 2013. Haswell just got a bit more attractive in our eyes as it will bring a lot of computing power and decent battery life that makes it much more competitive against tablets. It appears that Haswell convertible notebooks really have a chance in the war against ARM based tablets.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360697035485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:23:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360697111103-62</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360588971971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 08:22:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How's that short on ARMH, Ash?

In other words, expect bundled programming like those offered with other major TV packages. But Huggers’ pitch is for a better bundle, smarter and more well-curated. “If bundles are bundled right … I think there is real value in that,” "the largest sticking point of all is, it isn’t a “value play” by Intel, as Huggers put it. Meaning it won’t necessarily be cheaper than any of the existing offerings in the field." "biggest marketing point is also Intel’s most difficult sell: The built-in camera that comes with Intel’s new mystery box. It watches your movements and TV viewing habits with the aim of personalizing the way your household watches television — not to mention being much more helpful to those in the ad biz doing the targeting." I am long INTC but not so sure about this service. Not a la carte, not cheaper and more targeted ads does not really benefit the viewer.</Msg><Username>magic1313131313131313</Username><Timestamp>1360697141635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:25:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360697256617-64</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Web TV Service</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360693769264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel gives up on A la carte TV just like that with a wimper.

Also one can buy Internet service from a cable company without buying its TV service. Today, cable companies require consumers pay for a separate settop box for every HDTV that is to receive live programming. One feature that was described serveral months ago about the Intel service is that supposedly once one has the Intel box, they could deiver live HD programming to any Intel based PC, ultrabook, tablet or smartphone in the consumer's home. I presume by "new" it means devices that have Intel's recent CPU=based security features that perform the security functions of the cable settop box. This is all grand and potentially very useful to the consumer and a great way for Intel to encourage the purchase of Intel tablets, etc. My only issue with the proposed service is the built-in camera that spies on family members. However that one feature is a show stopper. Intel needs to find another way to create value than this.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360703003062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:03:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360703178619-84</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Web TV Service</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360693769264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL 50 MB to 100MB - That's 1 Gbps on the top end.</Msg><Username>mrpoorguy</Username><Timestamp>1360703178619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:06:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360704415376-85</Id><Title>How low will INTC go after Chamber's talks tomorrow.</Title><Msg>How low will INTC go after Chamber's talks tomorrow.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1360704415376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:26:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360704556017-86</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Web TV Service</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360693769264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You seriously LIKE this move?

Ever since, the Xolo X900, Lava has managed to get a lot of attention. Earlier in the year it even launched the first smartphone based on Intel’s Lexington chip, the Xolo X500 and today the folks at Fone Arena have published a hands-on of the Xolo A1000, which becomes the company’s first 5-inch Android smartphone. Apparently they managed to get their hands on a prototype in the capital. According to the post, the A1000 flaunts a slim form-factor of 8.8mm and is superior to most 5-inch phablets in terms of industrial design. Unlike the X900 it is based on a dual-core ARM chipset. It also has a 2,100-mAh battery and it will run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The report states that the device could land in the market by the end of February and will have a price between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1360708985186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 17:43:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360709794710-95</Id><Topic><Title>Web TV will be big - bigger than you think</Title><Username>dr_robinhoood</Username><Timestamp>1360707269473</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 17:14:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what keeps T, Comcast and wireless (like VZ) from raising their rates for high data rate usage thru their DSL?

Let me preface this with an "as I understand it" and then those more knowledgeable can correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't spent a lot of time on due diligence but I think I understand the reasoning. Intel is attempting to control content and delivery whereas others are working primarily on delivery. It's not delivery that is king, it's content. Why do you think Comcast acquired NBC Universal? It was because they realized that all delivery will eventually be IP with nothing to significantly distinguish one delivery provider from the next. Only control over content allows a sustainable business model. Intel appears to be following this same reasoning. Having control over content makes you a part of the ecosystem in a way that control over delivery doesn't. Especially when you can proliferate it to a multiplicity of devices. One of Apple's huge strengths in the marketplace is their extensive and pervasive ecosystem. If you want to be a big player then you need a well-evolved ecosystem. Intel's moves into the entertainment ecosystem are intelligent strategic steps as they are integral to the use and sharing of information on devices for which Intel makes chips.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360714483366</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 19:14:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360714627876-103</Id><Topic><Title>TV's are coming with cameras these days..

Chinese makers, such as Lenovo Group, ZTE Corp and Huawei Technologies Co, have released a series of low-end handsets priced at around 1,000 yuan ($160), targeting buyers with lower incomes. The US research company Gartner said in November that Lenovo will become China's top smartphone maker before the end of this year. "Lenovo is positioned at the mid-to-lower end, which will drive much of its future growth, and this is where global brands are less competitive," said Gartner. Low-cost smartphones have drastically accelerated the decline of feature phones in China, and a similar trend is expected to be seen in other emerging markets in the next three years, Canalys predicted, adding Chinese companies will be given an opportunity to copy their business model to more emerging markets.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1360715437251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 19:30:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360715875474-107</Id><Topic><Title>Intel TV went over like a fart in church</Title><Username>livindalifeaquatic</Username><Timestamp>1360714910817</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 19:21:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should give serious thought to creating the "Failed Humor Channel" on cable...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360715875474</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 19:37:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360716408500-108</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Web TV Service</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360693769264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 13:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I am extremely skeptical also of this new venture.

[Nobody is going to own all the content and the content owners are not going to own the delivery companies. So, it's silly to suggest that this needs to happen. It therefore all boils down to the economic models and the agreements that a company is able to make. If Intel can provide a model that streams more revenues to the content providers then they will be wildly successful. Intel can do some things that other companies can't because of their ability to work at the processor level. All you critics haven't really thought this out. No surprise. It's much easier to take your tiny bit of information and extrapolate it as if that makes sense. Your arrogance is that you think your 90 seconds of extrapolation is equal to the huge amount of work that went into evaluating this opportunity.

These days they prefer the safe, incremental moves rather than the bet the farm Steve Jobs leaps of faith. I expect to see this risk reluctance to come into play in Apple's choice of fabrication partner going forward. When it comes to fabrication, Apple is already in a high-risk situation. Using Samsung means giving business to their prime competitor. A situation that has already led to a parcel of lawsuits. Using TSMC means exposure to a foundry that struggled with ramping 28nm and that won't have 20nm production soon enough to demonstrate reliability in the face of Apple's huge demand. To insure the presence of a reliable supplier with state-of-the-art technology and a roadmap reaching far enough into the future to justify the enormous costs of changing fabs, there is only one low risk choice. And that is Intel. This reluctance to take excessive risk is the reason I believe that we will see Apple strike a deal with Intel in the next 12 months. I also think there is a fifty-fifty chance that the iWatch will be the early indicator that a much larger deal is taking shape...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360730410568</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 23:40:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
