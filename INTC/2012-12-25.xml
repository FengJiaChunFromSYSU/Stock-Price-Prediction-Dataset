Sylvie Barak 12/10/2012 4:30 PM EST SAN FRANCISCO -- Intel will describe its 22-nm tri-gate (FinFET) SoC technology for mobile applications Monday (Dec. 10) at the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) here. The chip maker introduced a CPU version of its 22-nm offering in June, but Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr said in an interview that the recipe has been tweaked in order to scale down to a more mobile, ultra-low leakage version. The change means Intel will now be able to boast product support from high performance servers down to cell phones on a tri-gate 22-nm process, with transistors covering a wide range of performance barriers. Intel’s new SoC technology also includes high voltage I/O transistors, precision resistors, capacitors and inductors that were not included on the original CPU version of the chip. The SoC’s will be ready for high volume manufacturing in 2013, Bohr said. Intel had tended to focus heavily on performance, but is now looking to widen its transistor scope. On the performance side of the scale is the CPU version of Ivy Bridge, which also exhibits higher power leakage. On the lower end of the scale, however, Intel is seeking to offering a range of choices.Bohr acknowledged that SoCs had presented Intel with new challenges. “When you talk about leakage, once you get down into the below 30 pico amp range, you have to deal with multiple sources of leakage, whether it’s through the gate oxide or leakage from source to drain or leakage from the drain to the substrate,” he said, adding that it had taken a lot of “tweaking an balancing” to finally get it right. The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said. In terms of how Intel’s 22-nm SoC process stacks up against the 28-nm low power or forthcoming 20-nm processes from TSMC, Bohr claimed Intel had “far surpassed” the performance and low leakage capabilities of competitors. “We have a significant lead over our competitors,” he asserted. Intel is also banking on he new technology process having a long tail. “We know that it’s scalable to 14-nm,” he said, concluding that tri-gate was not only a big power advantage for Intel’s CPUs, but for other low power SoCs.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356451362869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 11:02:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356451786709-30</Id><Topic><Title>ARMs 20nm Doesn't Get the Nod, Even When It Does Arrive (Unknown)</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356235578093</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:06:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's Bohr sees path to 10-nm chips Rick Merritt 9/12/2012 11:00 PM EDT SAN FRANCISCO – Intel Corp. has found a way to create a 10-nm process technology using immersion lithography. In addition, the processor giant is on track to start making chips in a 14-nm process technology before the end of next year, an Intel fellow said in a talk here. The 10-nm process would debut in 2015 or later. It would require quadruple patterning for some mask layers but “it’s still economical,” said Mark Bohr, director of Intel’s technology and manufacturing group, speaking to EE Times Bohr did not reveal details of either Intel’s 14- or 10-nm process plans. His comments focused only on technical feasibility. The company has long worked to develop extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and recently agreed to invest $4.1 billion in tool maker ASML to drive it forward. “EUV is very important to us, and that’s why we invested in ASML, but we have multiple paths that we pursue such as immersion with multiple patterning,” Bohr said.Intel expects to use at least double patterning in some layers of some chips at 14 nm. If immersion is used at 10 nm, more layers will require double patterning, and some will even require quadruple patterning, he said. At 14 nm, Bohr said, "the increased wafer costs [associated with double patterning] is still being offset by improved density, so our cost per transistor continues to go down with each generation on a very steady trend." That trend would continue, he suggested, even if immersion is used at 10 nm. As of today, “EUV is later than I would like, and I can’t count on it for sure,” he said. “We are probably the last company continuing to stay on a pace of having a new process technology every two years or so,” Bohr said in his talk.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356451786709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 11:09:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356452084544-31</Id><Title>There is one good thing to be said about HP CEO Whitmann.</Title><Msg>This is from an article on Google Finance on HPQ stock.

TI stopped leading edge process development at 65nm, deciding that competing with Intel just created financial nightmares.

To make matters even worse, if that is possible, Qualcomm will be able to see and know what is in store for them when Intel moves to a new Atom architecture SoC built on the 22nm Trigate process later in 2013. Qualcomm will soldier on in order to see if TSMC can actually build anything on a planar 20nm process. This should be known by June of 2013. The chance of TSMC success is low due to the leakage problems with a planar process at 20nm (that's why Intel moved to Trigate). TSMC talks about running a 16nm "finfet" process, but not until 2015.

Response: Why would you EVER think that Intel will not be able to maintain margins in the mobile business? Take the Apple A6 for example. The chip is 97 mm^2. With a new 32nm process at Samsung, still in a learning curve, the yield is probably 250 good parts per wafer. That wafer at Samsung has a cost of about $5000 including depreciation. That pretty close to a $20 part at cost. Samsung knows they have Apple by the soft parts, so they would have to be dumb as a box of rocks to sell that wafer for anything under $10,000...and probably $15,000. So the A6 part costs ~$20 and sells for $40-60. Don't believe the #$%$ from iSuppli about a $27 chip. They are very wrong. If intel made the same part with no changes on a fully depreciated, high yielding 32nm line, they would yield about 400 good parts on a wafer that cost $3000 (no depreciation). That's $7.50 cost. Intel selling the part for $25 would get 70% gross margins. Imagine for a minute that same part built on a 22nm line. We would be back to $5000 wafers (damn depreciation). The chip size would go to about 50mm^2 and the yield would be much higher just due to smaller die size. About 800 good parts per wafer would make the cost ~$6.25. Selling that part at the current Samsung cost of $20 would give Intel a 69% margin. This low margin mobile chip thing is just a crock.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356463308933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:21:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356463716553-51</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver, do you get triple time for pumping on holidays ??</Title><Username>intciscrud</Username><Timestamp>1356458645945</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 13:04:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL your so worried your pumping this junk on the QCOM board.

As long as you stayed out of PC CPU chips, you were safe. Lately, as long as you stayed out of server chips, you were safe. There have been direct competitors with Intel in the past. anyone remember Cyrix? How about Transmeta? These were guys who thought they might take a shot at Intel. TI just plain gave up. AMD, after decades of throwing money into a hole, appears to be finally giving up. If TSMC can deliver a competitive 20nm process to Qualcomm by the summer of 2013, all bets are off and everything I have said and written will be in question. Now, let's push our noses away from the chalkboard for a minute. TSMC had a terrible time bringing up 45nm. Yields were and probably still are terrible. 28nm has been a nightmare for the fabless guys that have been hung out to dry by TSMC's unfulfilled promises. They had this level of trouble and there is very little difference between 45 and 28nm. Just a smaller version of HKMG. There appears to be unanimous agreement that 20nm planar is a step backward in performance, both speed and power performance. TSMC, even in their dreams, say that finfet is over two years away. By that time Intel will be sampling 10nm 4th or 5th generation Trigate while Qualcomm will be selling parts from an expensive, leaky, bad yielding 20nm planar process....and that will be the GOOD news. The bad news is that TSMC can't build even a bad 20nm planar process let alone a node-behind finfet process. In that case, Qualcomm and Nvidia will have no choice but to give up. If Intel hasn't learned anything else over the past 42 years, they have learned that domination of a market is the only way to obtain margins high enough to fund continual progress in semiconductors.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356467556354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 15:32:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356468262925-59</Id><Topic><Title>Intel and Qualcomm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356463308933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:21:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There goes Wally again, watch him go!

He knows they can make it nearly impossible for Qualcomm to get much AP business in the Android world (when Intel has a good LTR solution)(also remember that the 2nd or 3rd guy often comes up with the best solution) If Intel has the Apple ARM based business and a great deal of what goes into Android products, TSMC could lose their largest customer and have no need for the capacity that he is getting ready to fund. By the middle of 2013 Intel will have 2-3 empty 22/14nm fabs.....that is a huge boulder hanging over the head of anyone trying to make a decision to fund new capacity. These guys play for keeps."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356468421334</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 15:47:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356468754791-62</Id><Topic><Title>Intel and Qualcomm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356463308933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:21:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"LOL, what a joke."

Intel has to be concern about turning into a monopoly since AMD is now exiting the x86 market. I believe Intel will be content to develop their technologies in such a way that the Atom SoC, their future low-end SoC, will remain competitive with arm's best while positioning their future Core SoC for the high-end. So in the future (14nm and down) you will see EOMs come out with smart phones and tablets with Atom SoC inside, which represent the low end products for Intel but these will be competitive with the very best of arm's. On the high end, since at 14nm and down Core (Broadwell) SoC will fit into a phone, you will see EOMs creating much more sophisticated smartphones that will run full-fledged Windows/MacOS/Chrome OS. At 14nm (just a little over a year from now), arm's best cannot compete with Intel's core and Intel will basically own the high-end market. This is why when in my view, Intel will be in the strongest postion it has ever been in it's history. Buy and hold here. Do not believe the mass media #$%$ and hype. Intel doesn't fear arm, it fears that arm won't be competitive enough, and Intel would then turn into a monopoly, which it doesn't want. Arm fanboys think arm has intel by the ropes, when in fact Intel is toying with them.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356479228237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 18:47:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356480339372-66</Id><Title>7 inch tablets are it. 10 inchers are fading fast, ultrabooks and convertibles</Title><Msg>and 7 inch tablets from below are cannibilizing the 10 inchers.

I expect in the next couple of months, with introduction of Haswell (Intel's fourth generation Core) we should see ultra ULV Haswell parts that can go down near the 4W TDP. In 2014, Intel will introduce the fifth generation core called Broadwell which will use the 14nm process (to be introduce in 2013). By that time we will see that Intel's core has reached under the 2W TDP power envelop. This means that the Intel core CPU products can now go into a phone; it will have reached the point where it can directly compete with arm chips in terms of power consumption. As you can imagine, with 2014 only less than 2 years away, there is just absolutely no way arm will have anything near close enough to compete with Intel. What does this all have to do with Apple? Well, in 2014, it just so happens that Apple's contract with Samsung ends. My belief is that the recent rumor about Apple engaging with Intel to do their foundry work and having an Intel SoC inside the next iPad makes perfect sense. Apple is all about having the best hardware for the best design. In 2014, the Broadwell SoC will be in a class of its own. Arm's very best will only be good enough to compete with Intel's lower end Atom SoC. Apple partnering up with Intel gives them 3 options in terms of their product lines: 1) Keep the current iPhone running arm, while the iPad in 2014 can run the Broadwell SoC. 2) Switch completely to Intel for both their iPhone and iPad. This gives them ease of maintainability because all their products will be running x86. This also gives their product a differentiator from the rest of the arm-based phones and tablets out there. Intel's Broadwell will be far superior to the rest of the market. However, the disadvantage will be that they will be dependant solely on Intel for all their products. 3) keep the current iPhone and iPad running on arm, but in 2014, develop a new high-end product lines of iPhone and iPad running the Broadwell SoC. Even though they have to maintain iOS to run on both arm and x86, the advantage with this model is that they are not totally dependant on Intel and can slowly develop the arm-base SoC to hopefully be competitive with Intel's in the future. Option 3 is probably most likely since it is good for both companies. Intel would be willing to do the foundry for Apple's arm SoC in this situation because Apple will have to differentiate between the low-end products (arm-based) and the high-end (Intel) so in a sense there is no direct competition with Intel. When i posted this scenario some time back, someone commented that Apple's current iPhone is already high enough. And in my previous posts someone again mention that arm has "good enough" products and doesn't need to get to the performance level of Intel. I have to disagree with this line of thinking. There is distinct advantage to having the best product. Think about it from the position of EOMs. Given the choice between a SoC that performs better and one that only performs "good enough" which one would you rather put in your phone? Certainly cost of the SoC comes into play. Since an arm-base SoC will not be able to compete with a Broadwell SoC, Intel can definitely price the Broadwell SoC for a premium. On the low-end where arm will be competing with Intel, what if Intel's low-end Atom SoC performs better than arms' SoC and the cost of each is about the same? which one would you pick if you were an EOM/phone maker? Certainly, you will go with the Atom. This is exactly the scenario that will play out when Intel releases their next Atom. EOMs/phone makers will start choosing Intel's Atom over arm's. In 2013, Intel will start establishing itself in the market in preparation for 14nm in 2014. Atom SoC for low-end, Broadwell SoC for high-end.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356481698870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 19:28:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356485063465-69</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be going with Intel - here's why</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356481698870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 19:28:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OEMs will surely go with Intel, where are the RT devices?

ARM foundries are still unable to produce enough 28nm capacity to satisfy demand. 2.) Opinions of 20nm planar technology have now reached a consensus level that the technology is noncompetitive with FinFET and therefore doesn't have the economics to be viable. 3.) The ARM foundries are therefore left with two equally ugly options. Stick with a doable move to 20nm planar leading to production of a inferior product that leaves Intel a huge opening into the mobile world. Or attempt the almost impossible two process level jump to 14/16nm FinFET that would take three years even if successful. 4.) The other option which appears to be the most reckless due to costs is to do both at the same time. This appears to be the approach that has been settled upon. There is almost no chance that this is going to end well for ARM. The stakes are immense and no ARM roadmap appears to have a good chance of success. Only two foundries remain players at this point in time due to the huge costs of building new fabrication plants: Samsung and TSMC. It appears that this will soon be just Samsung. With Samsung competing with its own customers, this leaves no viable ARM foundry choice for companies such as Apple. ARM has reached the fabrication tipping point and Intel's 2013 roapmap provides them little opportunity to avoid the abyss...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356488769320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 21:26:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356488812043-76</Id><Topic><Title>By the middle of 2013 Intel will have 2-3 empty 22/14nm fabs.</Title><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1356478637635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 18:37:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Intel were to actually have 2-3 empty 22/14nm production fabs by the middle of 2013, losing any customer would be bad news and would directly reduce Intel revenues and profits.
