The three companies sold a large number of Windows 8 PCs last week as consumers endured massive crowds and long lines on the biggest shopping day of the year. In conducting a retail survey, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry found that Acer and Sony produced the "hottest-selling Windows 8 notebooks." According to Chowdhry, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stores had a "very strong promotion" on the Acer Aspire V5 notebook, which is powered by an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Core i5 processor. He estimates that each Microsoft Store had about 500 units. "[They] were completely sold out within the first 30 minutes," Chowdhry wrote in a note to investors and reporters. During the promotional period, Microsoft sold the Aspire V5 for $399. Not to be outdone, some Microsoft Stores also sold out of a $1,500 touch-enabled Ultrabook from Sony. "Sony Vaio Touch Intel i7 was the fastest selling Windows 8 notebook in the high-end category," Chowdhry added. While this may be the year that the desktop PC died, Dell has not given up on the market. And it's a good thing, too -- if it had, it could not have built the fastest-selling all-in-one Windows 8 desktop. On Black Friday, Dell's XPS One 27 earned that crown. Chowdhry said that while he could not get any color on the number of units available, the converged view was that the "demand was too high" for Dell's $2,000 machine. Not every Windows 8 device performed well on Black Friday. Chowdhry estimated that Microsoft lost one in five sales on the Surface RT because of the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH) chipset. "Had Microsoft first shipped Surface on Intel chips vs. on ARM chips, sales of Surface would have been 5X better than current levels," the analyst wrote. Regardless, Chowdhry found that Microsoft "had decent sales on Windows Surface RT." "We observed a lot of interest in Microsoft Surface, but interest was not necessarily leading to sales," he said. "We spoke to no less than 30 people, who showed the most interest in Microsoft Surface RT, but did not make the purchase. 'We are going to wait for the Pro version of the Surface, as that will run on Intel Chips,' was the unanimous view we got."</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1354616392962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 05:19:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354616423284-12</Id><Title>Microsoft Surface would have done better on Intel.</Title><Msg>Not every Windows 8 device performed well on Black Friday.

I can also show you benchmarks that show Razr i is better than the Razr M (Javascript benchmarks) but the reality is that these benchmarks are so dependent on the browser that you can't compare them to other devices in the way Intel has done. At the end of the day, the whole point of independent benchmark suites such as Geekbench is to get past the spin of the tech companies involved. If the Geekbench numbers are right, then Qualcomm's M has almost 50% more CPU performance than Intel's CPU (on that benchmark). Intel will get better, but the reality is that they are falling short on both CPU/GPU performance for their current generation.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354617811999</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 05:43:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354618929927-15</Id><Topic><Title>Results are in for Motorola Razr i comparison.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1354609122135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 03:18:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only way Intel can get ahead is if they accelerate faster than ARM and its partners over time and they can do that if they advance their process technology faster than the foundrys since they seem to be unable to catch up on microarchitecture.

However, almost of the reviews on Razr i have been very positive. When it comes to PCs, there is a general feeling that there is too much performance which is not necessary for most users....the argument goes that Intel is overkill and ARM can replace Intel in PCs. When it comes to cellphones, the argument is Intel doesn't have enough performance/GPU vis-a-vis ARM. And Intel needs to do a lot more to even make some dent in the market....(of course, Intel will have this higher performance also soon). My thought is: What if there is sufficient performance in Razr i....and the customer is happy with its performance and user experience....and more reasonable pricing...the slightly higher benchmarks you are quoting for Snapdragon would be irrelevant. So my point is: "People don't buy by benchmarks alone!" Good user experience combined with decent pricing may get a lot of customers for Razr i. We will see from the sales #s soon. Note that ZTE and Motorola continue to expand their Intel-based offerings worldwide. So there is some compelling anecdotal evidence to suggest that the Intel Medfield platform has legs!</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1354632617217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:50:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354632747882-41</Id><Title>Tech Geek Blueredmonk and Benchmarks, LOL!</Title><Msg>If 1 million people buy a smartphone, 999,250 of those people don't even know what a benchmark is.

Check out the last sentence below which is part of the iphone review) where he says: ============== Very interesting. Atom is the only CPU that can complete the Kraken benchmark in less time than Apple's Swift. Peak power consumption is definitely higher than both the Qualcomm and Apple devices, although Intel's philosophy is likely that the added power usage is worth it given the quicker transition to idle. Note that Atom is able to drive to a slightly lower idle level than the Snapdragon S4, although the Swift based iPhone 5 can still go lower. At least based on this data, it looks like Intel is the closest to offering a real competitor to Apple's own platform from a power efficiency standpoint. We're a couple quarters away from seeing the next generation of mobile SoCs so anything can happen next round, but I can't stress enough that the x86 power myth has been busted at this point. ===============</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1354634053025</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:14:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354634422574-50</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Life</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354626657323</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 08:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prove that statement,if anything INTC is moving ahead in the battery life curve.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354634422574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:20:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354634580772-51</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Life</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354626657323</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 08:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the articles i've read, Haswell ultrabooks will have battery life of 9 hours to 20 hours.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354634580772</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:23:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354634864479-52</Id><Title>Intel down from 7 Billion shares to 5 billion shares</Title><Msg>And it will keep ratchiting lower as time wears on.

He makes far fewer mistakes than I do. He tilts toward ARM so you should expect what he says is true but not necessarily the whole story. Just as I titl toward Intel and I am tempted sometimes to leave out the "bad for Intel" stuff. Benchmarks are not simple and many turn on small differences. The Intel SoC effort is still on a steep learning curve and optimization for power and for performance is very young. Most of the Intel work in the past has been focused on CPU only optimization. Now, there is great important in breaking code excution into sections and have the best part of the chip do the work while powering down the rest. That is a new paradigm for Intel and one being tackled today. Haswell and Hawell learnings are being purcolated through the Intel silicon designs. Not only is performance going to increase non-linearly but the power consumption drop is going to accelarte too as more sections of the chip are shut off during computation.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354635107773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:31:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354635355558-55</Id><Topic><Title>Tech Geek Blueredmonk and Benchmarks, LOL!</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1354632747882</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:52:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing you said refutes the bottom line.....this is about the bottom line, right?

(MoneyWatch) LG Electronics has reportedly begun to design its own mobile processors. The South Korean electronics giant, one of the world's five largest vendors of mobile devices by unit sales, has 900 engineers working on chip designs for smartphones and Web-enabled TVs, according to the Korea Times. LG has taken a lesson from both Apple (AAPL) and Samsung. Creating its own chips gives the company greater control over the parts it needs for its products. The result may be good for LG, its designers and the company that will ultimately physically manufacture the chips, but it is bad news for Intel (INTC). The chipmaker's dominance has been based on making products for PC, while the world is increasingly moving toward mobile computing. For Intel, the question is whether that shift is too far along for it to adapt. There was a time when Intel and personal computing were synonymous. But the days when the company's x86 architecture partnered with Microsoft (MSFT) Windows to power the world's desktops and laptops are waning. The latest wave consists of smartphones and light tablets that have a long battery life and that deliver the functionality that people need. In her year-end report on trends in mobile, Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist analyst Mary Meeker, well regarded in tech circles for her analyses, noted that 13 percent of Internet traffic now comes from mobile devices. Only two years ago, that number was 4 percent. In some parts of the world, mobile traffic has actually outpaced Web usage coming from desktops. In India, for example, mobile represents 60 percent of all Internet traffic. Meeker estimates that by the end of 2013 unit sales of mobile devices running either Google (GOOG) Android or Apple's iOS will outsell Windows devices by almost 2.5 times. In 2015, the difference will be a factor of 4.25, she predicts, with PC sales remaining largely flat. Even now, 30 percent of U.S. adults own either a tablet or an e-reader. Of course, flat PC sales still means on the order of 400 million units a year. However, even that enduring business is likely to move away from Intel's architecture. After all, how long before Apple moves many of its desktops and notebooks to its own chips? How long before Microsoft provides a full version of Windows, not just Windows RT, for non-Intel chips that manufacturers use to save money and control availability? The latter was once a tool Intel could, and did, use to maintain product margins and control over its customers. These factors will put increased pressure on Intel's profits and revenue, which in turn will cause investors to question the company's current market value.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1354635959625</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:45:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354636032308-58</Id><Title>Why would anybody buy Intel after reading this article?</Title><Msg>Intel could be left behind by march toward mobile .

These factors will put increased pressure on Intel's profits and revenue, which in turn will cause investors to question the company's current market value.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1354636032308</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:47:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354636196762-59</Id><Title>Moody's - Ratings Reflect Intel's Dominant and Defensible Position</Title><Msg>Moody's: A1 Long Term And Prime-1 Short-Term Ratings Reflect Intel's Dominant And Defensible Position In Microprocessor Sector INTC 12/04 09:04 AM</Msg><Username>hardballnick</Username><Timestamp>1354636196762</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:49:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354636302320-60</Id><Title>Moody's Expects Intel's Performance In 2013 To Be Similar To 2012</Title><Msg>Moody's Expects Intel's Performance In 2013 To Be Similar To 2012 INTC 12/04 09:05 AM</Msg><Username>hardballnick</Username><Timestamp>1354636302320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:51:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354636581331-61</Id><Title>last two years at a loss</Title><Msg>Intel Corp.

However, almost of the reviews on Razr i have been very positive. When it comes to PCs, there is a general feeling that there is too much performance which is not necessary for most users....the argument goes that Intel is overkill and ARM can replace Intel in PCs. When it comes to cellphones, the argument is Intel doesn't have enough performance/GPU vis-a-vis ARM. And Intel needs to do a lot more to even make some dent in the market....(of course, Intel will have this higher performance also soon). ---- There are several points you make and they are valid. Benchmarking is an important way for us 'geeks' (as someone called me) to evaluate hardware. The reality is you can't trust any vendors numbers (or articles/reviews for that matter) so you have to use benchmarking suites and even then there are serious issues. The best way to benchmark any CPU is to use your own workload:) The reality is most people buying a phone don't care about performance benchmarks but OEM's do as it's them who design the phones that the chips go into. So, given the same price for two SoC's, and one was more performant which would you choose? Sure, Intel can reduce it's price... Expanding out the OEM point to include Apple, why would Apple Intel switch to Intel given that it's chip is so 'poor' compared to it's own?</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354637498895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:11:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637803082-66</Id><Topic><Title>Tech Geek Blueredmonk and Benchmarks, LOL!</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1354632747882</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:52:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He tilts toward ARM so you should expect what he says is true but not necessarily the whole story.

A clear case of management acting in their own interest and not in the interest of shareholders. If there is a 70/30 allocation between "stocks being retired/executive compensation", I think there is scope to believe that both interests are fairly aligned. There should be some mechanism for stockholders to be able to put something like this in place.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1354661676281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 17:54:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354662478571-179</Id><Title>Which pocket is my money in?</Title><Msg>They have $10B overseas that they can't bring home because American fools re-elected Obummer.

Microsoft's Surface Pro devices, the second tablet device from the software giant, boast Intel Core i5 processors and feature the ability to run legacy x86 applications and the full-fat version of Windows 8. This comes at a cost, however: while the ARM-based Windows RT-running Surface RT tablets manage around eight hours of battery life, the Surface Pro tablets hit just four under average use. An easy way to boost battery life is to drop the power draw of the processor. Accordingly, an anonymous 'industry source' speaking to CNET claims that Intel is shortly to release an ultra-low power version of its Ivy Bridge chip family with a thermal design profile (TDP) of just 10W. It's almost half that of the company's current low-end 17W Ivy Bridge model. Were Intel to release such a chip, and Microsoft to adopt it for its second-generation Surface Pro devices, battery life would be improved without too much of a sacrifice to performance. It's certainly a start, however, and may convince other tablet makers to dip their toes into the high-performance Core-series tablet market. A 10W Ivy Bridge chip would also help bridge the gap between current models and the upcoming Haswell family, which Intel has already indicated will include low-power 10W models. A 10W Ivy Bridge chip would also provide builders of embedded, small form factor and ultra-portable systems with an alternative to Intel's Atom-based products, offering significantly improved performance for just a little extra power drain.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354671154621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:32:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354671605895-186</Id><Title>Oh sheeeet.

First came rumors that the company was in talks with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to replace Samsung as the processor supplier for its mobile devices. Then, as the first shipments of Apple’s new iMac PCs arrived, reports rolled out that at least some of them bore an “Assembled in USA” sticker. CEO Tim Cook rose to prominence at Apple for moving production to China, but could the company be on the verge of a shift back to “Made in America?” If Intel manages to score the coup of becoming the chip supplier for Apple’s mobile devices, that would be a big story for both Intel and U.S. manufacturing. It was only weeks ago that Apple was supposedly in talks with Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (NYSE:TSM) about the possibility of replacing Intel CPUs in its PCs with TSMC chips based on ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) architecture. Intel CEO Paul Otellini (the guy who brought Apple into the Intel fold but failed to break into the mobile market) retires, and all of a sudden Apple and Intel appear to be making up for lost time. With most of Intel’s chip fabrication plants in the U.S. (including factories in Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona), domestic manufacturing would benefit tremendously. Apple sold 43 million iOS devices last quarter alone — that’s a lot of chips. Then there’s the story of the “Assembled in USA” iMacs that’s burning up the tech sites right now. Some (but not all) of Apple’s latest iMacs have been arriving on doorsteps adorned with the usual “Designed by Apple in California” message. But instead of “Assembled in China,” they’re marked “Assembled in USA.” The FTC has very specific rules about how to qualify for that label. To comply, Apple has to be doing much more than just screwing bases onto cases. A factory somewhere in the U.S. has to be building these things. How could you justify assembling a computer in the U.S. if you can pay ridiculously low wages in China? First of all, those low wages aren’t as low as they used to be. According to The Atlantic, they’re five times what they were in 2000 and expected to continue rising at the rate of 18% per year. At the same time, U.S. labor productivity has risen, while U.S. manufacturing wages over the past five years are now back at the level they were in 2000, adjusted for inflation.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1354673225388</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:07:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354673379371-188</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D.</Title><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1354668900431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:55:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It should increase EPS by 6% if Intel were able to buy the 300m shares at today's price of $20. The interest spread should add about 1 penny per 1% of spread. Showing my work ..... If Intel could buy back $6b at today's price of $20, that would be 300,000,000 shares. I have not seen any specific disposition of the shares described other than to say "repurchase". Intel historical actions speak loud. Intel seems to retire 100% of the shares they repurchase or at least they remove the shares from diluting the total. The float is currently of 4.97b and shares outstanding is $4.98b. From their last SEC form 10q Intel had 4.996b float and 5.153b fully diluted Sep 2012. 5.194b float and 5.340b fully diluted same time in 2011. Intel burned 200m shares during the last 12 months from Sep 2011. Intel will have extra interest cost: interest cost on $6b notes at say 3% Intel will save: dividends on 300m shares with current yield of 4.5% Intel will have a 1.5% positive spread. There will be 1.5% spread x $6b = $90million of "dividend saving" over "interest expense". Intel profits are bumped up by $90million per year by the positive spread. Shares go from 4.996b down to 4.696b . A single penny across the 4.996b shares will be the same as 1.06 pennies for the remaining 4.696b shares.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354673379371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:09:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354673953097-189</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D.</Title><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1354668900431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:55:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel seems to retire 100% of the shares they repurchase or at least they remove the shares from diluting the total. ____________________ Music to my ears.</Msg><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1354673953097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:19:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354676259950-190</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith presentation</Title><Username>dundarra</Username><Timestamp>1354457102852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 09:05:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>muchas gracias - don't know how I missed it before.</Msg><Username>dancingluminousfleshgiants</Username><Timestamp>1354676259950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:57:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354677549634-191</Id><Title>What we now know</Title><Msg>Intel's "low power IA" project, started in 2006, now into its sixth year is on its last legs. Based on current performance of its Medfield offering compared to what's available from competitors, it's only been able to garner 0.2% market share for smartphones in the first half of 2012. On the tablet side, the abject failure of Microsoft's Windows 8 platform has not helped of sales of CloverTrail based devices. In other words, in the current generation, Intel's low power processors have failed to make any dent in the market and this after six years of working on them. Now the question remains, will they be able to do something in 2014 when they accelerate their process roadmap for mobile. The biggest challenge they face is the absence of any high market visibility customer who will buy their tablet or smartphone targeted chips. As you know, the market for both these kinds of chips is mature and well fed by ARM licensees. Its been this way for several years now. Motorola, their best hope, is still only a fringe player in the smartphone/tablet market. In such a scenario, even if they are able to produce a market competitive chip, they may not be able to sell it. In light of these observations, what's the prognosis for Intel? 1. They stop working on low power IA and start fabbing ARM chips. This way they can still leverage their process advantage while recognizing their inability to design microarchitectures in the low power space. They need to let go of their grand vision of a single instruction set architecture (IA) satisfying the needs of a range of power consumption scenarios. The window of opportunity for doing this is rapidly closing as the foundrys with their newly found mobile driven wealth are all ploughing money into new fabrication technology development. 2. They need to realize their limits in their ability to innovate and take steps to correct this. For a high tech company such a scenario clearly spells doom. Since they have not been able to convince Wall Street to move their stock in the last 10 years, its high time they assumed this would not change and used other ways to attract better employees.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354677549634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:19:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354678073611-192</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D.</Title><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1354668900431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:55:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, the interest cost will be a little under $140MM a year, less than 2.5% weighted. Furthermore, interest expense is fully deductible whereas dividends are paid out of after tax net income. Frankly, I would have liked to see INTC raise $20-$30B and do a much larger scale buyback (50% now and 50% reserved for the future). But, this will set things in motion.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354678073611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:27:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354678395400-193</Id><Topic><Title>What we now know</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354677549634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's nice to see that Intel is still deep Inside your head, even late at night..... and you need to justify to yourself that it is no threat to ARM.
