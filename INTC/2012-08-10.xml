With August being a typical period of summer doldrums, there isn't likely to be strong momentum in the market one way or the other. Although the S&amp;P 500 has been up five straight sessions, it is still confined by the top of the up channel started in June. As its moves in the past several months have suggested, it will probably pull back toward the bottom of the channel in the near term. However, should the broader market index break out above the channel, it could retest its April high in the 1420 area. have a nice day.</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1344580651000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 02:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344604542000-3</Id><Topic><Title>HURRICANE OBAMA WRECKS ECONOMY WHILE MEDIA CHEERS!</Title><Username>IH8W8N</Username><Timestamp>1314724627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-08-30 13:17:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...who's campaign is reduced to calling his opponent a felon - or worse - a capitalist.

Obama's lead grows as Romney's support slips</Title><Msg>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/09/fox-news-poll-obama-lead-grows-as-romney-support-slips/ Mitt Romney has had a tough couple of weeks on the campaign trail -- and it shows in the latest Fox News poll. After a barrage of campaign ads, negative news coverage of his overseas trip and ongoing talk about his tax returns, Romney’s favorable rating and standing in the trial ballot have declined. As a result, President Obama has opened his biggest lead since Romney became the presumptive Republican nominee. The president would take 49 percent of the vote compared to Romney's 40 percent in a head-to-head matchup if the election were held today, the poll found. Last month, Obama had a four percentage-point edge of 45 percent to 41 percent. This marks the second time this year the president has had a lead outside the poll’s margin of sampling error. Obama’s advantage comes largely from increased support among independents, who now pick him over Romney by 11 percentage points. Some 30 percent of independents are undecided. Last month, Obama had a four-point edge among independents, while Romney had the advantage from April through early June. There was also an uptick in support for Obama among women, blacks and Democrats. HAAA HAAAA SO what kind of idiot believes Rasmusuck polls? Do you know what Rasmussen does? He will bend back closer to the rest of the other polls the last two weeks to keep credability. But all of this stuff before is good for his busness because rightwing nutjobs like IH love to read that they are not losers even though they know they are.

Shortages of 28nm affected the financial results of customers such as Qualcomm, Nvidia and Altera. Now it is said that MediaTek, the Taiwan handset IC house, is having to accept longer lead-times from TSMC because of tight capacity. It is reported that shortages have doubled grey market pricing on some MediaTek chip-sets. The problems arose in June when MediaTek's China-based smartphone customers pulled in orders for MediaTek chip-sets. MediaTek, which expects to sell 95m wireless chip-sets this year, saw sales leap 18% in July on June and expects 13-18% growth in Q3. MediaTek says the shortage should be over by late September.

I found both moves odd for a variety of reasons. First, let me address why I think hiring Chandrasekher as CMO makes absolutely no sense for Qualcomm. Chandrasekher left Intel in disgrace. For over three years he had been given all of Intel's assets with one goal in mind; to develop a viable chip for smartphones and to get customer traction. He wasn’t able to pull that off. Menlo and then its follow-up Moorestown both had major execution issues and fell flat on their face. Inside Intel, Chandrasekher was seen as a showman - constantly making promises he couldn’t keep and showing off designs that would never see the light of day with customers. The LG phone hyped and slidewared at CES a few years ago was a prime example of just that. Chandrasekher was also one of the key figures in Intel’s Nokia/MeeGo debacle- a relationship where Intel invested much and gained little only to be left at the altar two years ago at MWC. But, no sooner was Chandrasekher unceremoniously outed from Intel, things took a turn for the better. Mike Bell and Dave Whalen took Chandrasekher’s place, and in just nine months, the company managed to build a fully functional reference design smartphone. Not only that, but the design went on to score multiple design wins almost immediately, including a major European carrier (Orange) and deals across India and China. So, what exactly does Qualcomm think it is getting in Chandrasekher? His track record shows him to be a guy who ran marketing but who couldn't bring to market a viable product to compete with any of the ARM partners over a three year period with unlimited resources at Intel. True, one could argue that with a long career at Intel and with involvement in Centrino, Chandrasekher knows the PC market, but how critical are these skills to a company that will only begin to dabble in the computing space with Windows 8? It’s puzzling to say the very least. Perhaps Qualcomm’s logic in hiring Chandrasekher was the thought he would be so eager for redemption after being let go by Intel that he would do anything to get back at his previous employer and prove them wrong. That option can’t be ruled out, and people should be given second chances, but from where I’m sitting, this looks like Qualcomm took a really sloppy second from Intel. Next, let’s examine AMD’s choice of John Byrne for head of sales. This is also an odd personnel choice, given AMD's relative lack of sales success over recent years. Byrne has been in sales at AMD/ATI for donkey’s years. Why would the company not look for new blood instead of promoting old guard? When Rory Read took over as CEO, he gutted virtually every other position of prominence in the company, and yet Byrne not only survived the purge, but now seemingly thrives. Byrne originally started his association with AMD selling discrete graphics at an ATI subsidiary by the name of Advanced 3D, based in the UK. He then moved on to more senior roles in ATI sales and then AMD Europe before moving to North America to manage global sales. While savvy and well respected in the channel, Byrne's experience with MNC OEMs is on the lighter side, and, under his tenure, AMD has failed to take any significant market share in graphics, CPUs or chipsets. That’s why, to me, Byrne's promotion and ascent defies conventional logic, but as with all executive moves at troubled companies there is always more than meets the eye. http://eetimes.com/electronics-blogs/other/4392157/Qualcomm-hiring-Intel-s-sloppy-seconds--</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344626992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 15:29:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344627399000-50</Id><Title>Semi market growth seen as doubling</Title><Msg>[As Wall Street intelligence drops by half...] Over the next five years the long-term growth rate for the semiconductor market is going be more than double what it has been, according to market research firm IC Insights Inc. (Scottsdale, Ariz.). The five years from 2006 to 2011 saw a compound annual growth rate of just 3.9 percent for the total chip business, with integrated circuits even lower at 3.3 percent. While unit shipments are generally thought to have held up well over the period average selling prices (ASPs) have fallen as companies compete to get into high volume consumer products such as smartphones and tablet computers. The semiconductor sector is going to see a return to a CAGR of 8 percent with ICs not far behind at 7.6 percent. The OSD sector – optoelectronics, sensors and discretes – will do even better growing by 10.6 percent per year on average. Within the IC sector McClean is predicting a return to growth for the DRAM sector and very strong growth for NAND flash non-volatile memory of 16.6 percent per year on average. Other key markets such as microprocessors (MPUs) and the analog market are forecast to enjoy modest increase in average annual market growth through 2016. The key will be a turn around in the ASP trend reckons the market analyst. Whereas ASPs declined by 2.9 percent per year on average between 2006 and 2011, going forward IC Insights expects a 1.7 percent per annum uplift in ASPs. IC Insights puts that down to consolidation in the industry making it less likely that it will get into an oversupply situation which can prompt steep price declines. http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4392122/Chip-market-growth-rate-to-double</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344627399000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 15:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344628056000-51</Id><Title>Qualcomm Acquires Intel's Playbook</Title><Msg>The Mobile Tsunami wave has yet to crest and the surfers strong enough to mount it are dwindling fast to the dismay of market watchers and experienced analysts.

Despite buying 4.2 billion shares since 1990 the float has only decreased by 1.6 billion meaning Intel issued 2.6 billion shares in compensation during that time. Seems like a lot of value going out the door to hide the fact a big percentage of the profits are actually compensation. http://www.intc.com/stockBuyBack.cfm http://www3.valueline.com/dow30/f4731.pdf</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1344642382000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 19:46:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344642451000-67</Id><Topic><Title>Fox news poll--Obama 49- Romney 40</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1344609857000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 10:44:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>49 is your iq nobody is surprised by that.Oblunder took the title away from carter as the worst president america has ever seen.</Msg><Username>nk499</Username><Timestamp>1344642451000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 19:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344643498000-68</Id><Title>Any Questions?</Title><Msg>Any Questions about the future of Intel and it's ability to keep growing and profiting??? http://www.bloomberg.com/video/cloud-computing-is-growing-at-a-tremendous-rate-BsmfgDvZQ4~EXYOn7W4txA.html?cmpid=yhoo</Msg><Username>san_warzone</Username><Timestamp>1344643498000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:04:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344643663000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Gap widening between INTC and AMD</Title><Username>v_shukla72</Username><Timestamp>1344510538000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 07:08:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any comment ?</Msg><Username>v_shukla72</Username><Timestamp>1344643663000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344644635000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Fox news poll--Obama 49- Romney 40</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1344609857000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 10:44:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD_monkey rules!</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1344644635000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344649208000-71</Id><Title>Son of Boss....</Title><Msg>Son of Boss... a rotten system... http://www.examiner.com/article/a-new-tax-avoidance-question-surfaces-about-mitt-romney</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1344649208000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 21:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344649396000-72</Id><Topic><Title>Son of Boss....</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1344649208000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 21:40:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally, you are beyond pathetic.
