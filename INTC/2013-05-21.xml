It seems like Sean's move from NVDA to AMD is taken as a sign that moving to AMD is not really a "career death sentence". Maybe moving to AMD is something better than a career death sentence.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369130656189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 06:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369131090063-6</Id><Topic><Title>ZOMBIE RETAIL: SEE WHAT ARMH Soc Has done to INTEL: Monopoly:London Calling: Did Allwinner outsell Intel, Qualcomm?

Such a track record suggests that it would probably be another up day for the broader market index today. However, with the Russell 2000 running into resistance and VIX heading higher (+4.6% at 13.02), expect some sideways consolidation. The overbought condition continues to suggest a normal 2-3% pullback, which is inevitable.

Fuxed up news and rightwing radio told you that the economy would collapse if Obummer were re-elected and so you went short right after barfing the day after Ob won re-election. So now you sit losing massive potential gains as other smart rightwing investors obviously go long in the markets.

Of course Obamacare will not be repealed and it is already taking down the rate of increases in medical care in America but you want the Black man impeached.

Haswell tablets, ultrabooks and hybrids will start shipping in the summer, while the holiday season will see Intel's cutting edge mobile processors being launched. There is a possibility that competitors may not be able to move to the next Moore generation in time, which means that Intel's manufacturing advantage will become overwhelming in 2014. Intel has already shown how it can use its technological and manufacturing muscle to completely capture an entire industry. The possibility that it can capture a monopoly position in the mobile processor industry is not impossible. I remain optimistic about Intel's prospects and would keep buying.

Personally I think it is the fact that Clovertrail+ will be in the next Galaxy Tab. If Samsung is prepared at this early stage to use an Intel processor in one of its mainstream devices how long will it be before we see Silvermont in a future Galaxy phone, say S5 or more likely S6 ? That will hit ARM's revenue hard especially as they are using generic A15s now. Samsung is quite brutal internally, if it can find a SoC that does a better job outside it will have no hesitation in using it regardless of what the in-house staff have produced.

Improving economic growth, rising dividends and potentially low interest rates. It’s all good for Wall Street and the stock market. That’s according to Goldman Sachs, which is taking an ever increasingly bullish view on the S&amp;P 500 SPX +0.19% with some target lifting in a note dated May 20. As they’ve previously said, their upbeat S&amp;P 500 outlook for this year has played out faster than they expected: “We are raising our S&amp;P 500 dividend estimates and index return forecasts for 2013 through 2015. We expect S&amp;P 500 index will rise by 5% from the current level to 1,750 by year-end 2013, advance by 9% to 1,900 in 2014, and climb by 10% to 2100 in 2015.” A team led by David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, say a big reason for the target lifts is down to expectations the U.S. economy will achieve above-trend real GDP growth in 2014, ending a six-year period of economic “stagnation.” And in developed economies, the final year of economic stagnation before GDP growth has been linked to price/earnings multiple expansions averaging 15%, note the strategists. They expect the S&amp;P 500 p/e multiple will continue to rise, reaching 15 times at year-end 2013 and 16 times by the end of 2014. That S&amp;P 500 forward p/e multiple has risen by 30% in 12 months to 14.6 times from 11.4 times, an increase that’s been bigger and faster than Goldman’s baseline forecasts assumed (Goldman recently cautioned that the S&amp;P wasn’t cheap), but it’s still in line with what happened in the post-1990s, so they aren’t overly concerned. The S&amp;P 500 forward p/e multiple has averaged 12.9 times since 1978 and 15.3 times since 1990, Goldman notes.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369154498052</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:41:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369155039218-72</Id><Topic><Title>I want my country back Wah WAH WAH.

They eat lunch together in some of those nice restaurants in Northern California. Apple will go all Intel and that will bring huge money to Intel but yes, Samsung will go Intel when needed as well.

No more cheap ARM SoCs...and there is a difference between an IDM process and a foundry process - not just with respect to Nanometers - the foundries are far more dependent on EUV compared to Intel. the strength of IDM is That manufacturing team and design design work very closely together from the very beginning. TSMC would work with several different customers together - and it's difficult to find a common denominator - foundry customer A,B and C all need to compromise on one process more or less. "Our foundry processes in the following sense that foundries are having another challenge that the IDMs would not have. The challenge is that they have to deliver design rules, which are less restrictive and they have to deliver shrink factor, which is very aggressive. So, yes, my comments on 14-nanometer being a competitor to being in the first to go concerns more the foundry environment than it concerns the microprocessor environment." ASML agree with our view that without EUV lithography, the transistor cost curve originally associated with Moore’s Law has decelerated if not disappeared, and that the successful implementation of EUV is necessary to return the industry to that 20-30% transistor cost curve […] The implementation of multiple patterning lithography to shrink chips has led to higher transistor costs as outlined in our “Moore Stress” thesis […] We remain challenged reconciling commentary from different industry leaders around high volume manufacturing (HVM) using EUV. ASML suggests it happens in 2016, however Intel and IBM suggest 7nm (2018-2019). On its recent earnings call, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) CEO Morris Chang suggested an optimistic scenario would be partial use of EUV Lithography at 10nm (we estimate 2017). We think EUV finds its first use in critical layers of DRAM manufacturing.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1369160103606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369160203784-89</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH probably down on the Samsung defection to Intel</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1369158113473</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 13:41:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Link ?</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1369160203784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:16:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369160235389-90</Id><Topic><Title>Why is it most people resist change?

Anyone who disagrees is in denial, has some ulterior motive, or is just dense. What all this means is that whoever builds phones or tablets using Intel processors can make them run faster and run longer on a given battery than by using an ARM (or AMD) processor. This argument cuts off the other arguments about market share, design wins, better architecture and other objections by the Intel opponents." It's downright scary holding ARMH because it is already priced as if its won the war.

Incoming chief executive Simon Segars outlined Arm’s longstanding plan to grow market share beyond smartphones but gave few specific targets. The problem is that Arm’s valuation “continues to defy gravity” at 55 times 2013 earnings, said Morgan Stanley, which advised clients to short the stock. Investors were “ignoring a potential design loss in a Samsung tablet to Intel, Intel’s new Silvermont chip, signs of commoditisation in the smartphone market and consumers’ appetite moving from number of cores to bigger screen sizes,” it said. “ARM remains best in class but the share price is pricing in a lot already.” In particular, Morgan Stanley picked up on Arm’s comments that by 2017, chip prices for low-end smartphones could be as cheap as feature-phone chips today. With unit growth most likely at the low end, consensus forecasts underestimate the pressure on Arm’s average royalties, it said.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1369165742077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:49:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369165840672-113</Id><Topic><Title>Weird price action on ARMH</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369146569102</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 10:29:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excuse me for a moment, but #$%$?

Intel Corporation The analysts believe that the launching of the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s Bay Trail atom processor might negatively affect the ARM processors market share for tablets. They also cited a report from AndroidOS.in that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (LON:BC94) (KRX:005930) might be using Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s Atom Z2560 Clover Trail + processor in its new 10-inch Android tablet. JP Morgan analysts Sandeep Deshpandee, Chetan Udeshi and Vipul Hirani cited that if the report is true, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will potentially benefit from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (LON:BC94) (KRX:005930) as the company is perceived to capture a meaningful share in the Android tablet market. According to the analysts, “We note than Atom Z2560 contains Imaginatio’s PowerVR SGX 544MP2 GPU and thus, this potential win for Intel would also be positive to Imagination’s royalty units/revenue.” Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are trading around $24.07 per share on Monday. Meanwhile, JP Morgan analysts noted that the semiconductor business continues to improve, citing every company present during the 41st JP Morgan Technology Conference indicated a growing rate of backlogs and orders. The analysts also cited that most companies projected a normal seasonal revenue growth in the second quarter this year. The analysts also believe that non-tech investors have been buying shares of semiconductor companies as they look for leverage and yield.

For starters, Reuters reported on Tuesday that the processor giant's new chief executive officer Brian Krzanich is shaking things up a bit with a new devices unit. AllThingsD followed up with another report that Mike Bell, general manager of Intel's mobile and communications group (and also a former Apple and Palm executive), wil be leading the new division. Intel's mobile strategy had been stalled a bit, but a new renewed commitment has been demonstrated through plans for cheaper Ultrabooks and the recent debut of the low-power Silvermont System-on-a-Chip architecture. To recall, Intel named then-chief operating officer Krzanich as CEO, replacing Paul Otellini. Krzanich officially stepped up to the plate last week. The restructure and addition of this department would mark Krzanich's first major strategic move as CEO while also stepping up Intel's mobile roadmap considerably.

But it won't be working in isolation. In today's Portland Business Journal, we present a cover story from our sister paper, the Silicon Valley Business Journal, about how Intel Capital, led by President Arvind Sodhani, is playing a key role in scouting trends and forging partnerships in key new technologies that could shape the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip-maker's future. Intel Capital last year was ranked the world's most successful venture capital firm. Of the 150 companies in its portfolio, seven launched initial public offerings and 28 were acquired or merged — a box score that outperformed every other VC in 2012. It's been pretty active in Oregon, too. Since it was founded in 1991, Intel Capital has invested more than $100 million in 24 Oregon-based startups. Its current portfolio includes five Oregon companies: Iovation (Portland), Avnera (Beaverton), NexPlanar (Hillsboro), Advanced Inquiry Systems (Hillsboro), and Urban Airship (Portland). Of those, only Urban Airship is part of a distinct mobile strategy. The company, which provides the software that app developers use to power push notifications in mobile apps, was the first recipient of capital from Intel's mobile-focused AppUp fund in 2011. Intel Capital followed that up by participating in Urban Airship's $25 million Series D round in February. Urban Airship CEO Scott Kveton this week told me about how Intel Capital's cachet opened new doors for the company. “Intel Capital has a phenomenal set of programs and people you can leverage, whether for hiring or introductions. Intel Capital knows everybody, everywhere,” he said. “I attend two or three events every year that are networking events among peers in mobile and media. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to have somebody like (Intel Capital) saying, ‘We invested in them because we believe in the vision.’” From bizjournals</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369178300852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 19:18:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369178380073-129</Id><Topic><Title>Intel has a secret weapon</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369178300852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 19:18:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee, how many people said that Intel's non-core ventures never work out?

I've realized a nice 25%gain since buying a little over a year ago. It met most of my value criteria: cheap PE, good cash flow &amp; balance sheets, solid business fundamentals, and excellent dividend. I am thinking of putting more money in, maybe $10k. I still feel Intel will be an iconic &amp; critical part of evolving technology for years to come. I am fairly confident their deep pockets &amp; world class R&amp;D will see them dominate even mobile computing. It's still cheap at a PE of 12. I guess I answered my own rhetorical question in some ways. But I'd appreciate any thoughts, advice, critique, or forecasts. In particular, is a potential pullback realistic? Or is this a cheap enough entry point? As might be obvious, I am mostly a value investor. I buy great companies at PEs lower than, for example, a 10 year average. I reinvest dividends. I try to hold forever. I put the bulk of my money in companies like KO, GLW, CNI, DOW, NOV, CAT, and JNJ. I consider INTC to be in this blue chip category.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1369186847552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369187640478-139</Id><Title>intc shareholders pay employee wages</Title><Msg>Execs get to reap the profits and share holders get to pay the bills. #$%$ company, no wonder it has done anything in 15 years.</Msg><Username>stjdavis7</Username><Timestamp>1369187640478</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:54:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369188204316-140</Id><Title>Report: Touchscreen Notebook Shipments Increased by 51.8% in Q1 2013</Title><Msg>tomshardwareDOTcom/news/Touchscreen-Increase-Intel-Ulttrabook,22640DOThtml Due largely to the “touch friendly” nature of Windows 8 and generally competitive pricing from ODMs, DisplayBank has reported that shipments of touchscreen-equipped notebooks increased by 51.8 percent in Q1 2013 (compared to Q4 2012) to 4.57 million units.

If you take that into account, Intel's PE is actually ridiculous lower than 12 ..at around 10. Beginning in Q3, we won't be seeing those charges/costs and Intel's earnings will really shine. Q3 and Q4 will be even better than Q4 2011, when their revenue was $13.9 billion and earnings of $0.64/share. So for Q3 and Q4 we are talking about earnings of $0.70 or more. This is Microsoft's numbers folks! Then in 2014, with 14nm in full steam and new refresh of products like Broadwell, which is when, for the first time, Intel's Core CPU can go into tablets FANLESS. Think about that! And with 14nm, we also get refresh of Atoms and other products for smartphones and servers. Make no mistake about it, Intel's future is bright and current stock price is grossly undervalued.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369189926319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:32:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369191023576-142</Id><Topic><Title>Intel planning new devices unit led by former Apple exec</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369177633020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 19:07:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bell is not a chip guy, but a device guy.
