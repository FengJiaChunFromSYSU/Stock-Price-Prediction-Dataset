And thanks to you for the thoughtful contributions - I think it is due to the onchip ATOM cache memory. The ATOM has to maintain coherrency of the cache even when idling but has a lower miss rate (accesses memory less) than ARM. When you access external memory, it takes larger buffer transistors to drive the address and data lines lines. When running an application, ARM has to access external memory more and burns more power than the ATOM because ATOM memory references are satisfied by cache hits. When idling, ATOM has to power the cache. Intel CPU designs in the future (maybe except server chips) will have an onchip voltage regulator that will allow them to lower the voltage (reduces power consumption) or completely power down chip sections. "Too bad they couldn't accelerate their deployment of 14nm for Haswell." A 22nm Haswell with its redesigned power distribution system will be fine. Intel release 14nm midyear with Haswell but it is more likely they will stay on schedule and move 14nm into productions this year but not with Haswell as a lead product.

But this is going to change. Every single point of the 16 made in the slide presentation is valid. Glofo and Samsung creating the perception that they are catching up by hyping 14nm FinFets - reality is that backend is still @ 20nm. Of course nobody talks about - everybody zoomed in on FinFets yadayada... They stick with 20nm because they can't do 14nm. Why did logic switch to copper - because of performance. Backend processing is extremely important for logic device (we talk about miles of copper wiring on one chip- RC delay! ). Backend consists of 9 + layers of copper separated by dielectric and all these layers need to be connected via dieletric etch. It is extremely capital intense and equally challenging compared to FinFet because the vias (that connect the varioius metal layers) have a very high aspect ratio. I don't think ARM will crash and burn but once the reality that the days of cheap ARM manufacturing are over becomes obvious it might start to deflate. Several ARM customers (like Marvel, NVDAl and BRCM and even QCOM) are already concerned with diminishing returns. 61 is living in the past where design played first fiddle and manufacturing was a necessary evil.

Despite all the talk that Google's Chromebook Pixel may be a fake, additional details have surfaced regarding its hardware. We already know that it will sport a full touchscreen display with a 2560 x 1700 resolution, but there are also signs that the Chrome OS-based notebook will have an Ivy Bridge CPU, a backlit keyboard and support for 4G LTE connectivity.. Google's supposed in-house Chromebook actually appears in the new Chromium OS code as "Google Link" – the company has previously used code names like Snow, Daisy, Butterfly, Mario and Parrot with other devices. Traces of Google Link can even be found within the code for support of HighDPI. According to Myce, Chrome OS developers are arguing to enable HighDPI only on Google Link because it slows down the booting process on older Chromebooks. This seemingly confirms reports of a 2560 x 1700 resolution, but the report speculates that it may actually be 2560 x 1600 given that this resolution was recently proposed as the default for laptops by Linux founder Linus Torvalds. On the Ivy Bridge CPU front, a specific change in the source code talks about adding support for the Link chipset. "By watching what changed in the file, it's obvious that the only thing changed is support for the Pantherpoint chipset which hosts Intel’s latest generation CPUs based on the Ivy Bridge architecture," Myce writes. Currently it’s unknown whether the CPU will be a Celeron or one of the three Intel Core chips, and at what clock speed. However a Celeron CPU will likely be what's chosen for Google Link given the fact that Chromebooks are usually thin clients. Also found in the Chrome OS code are signs of a highly-requested backlit keyboard. The LTE aspect was actually revealed over in a thread by Chrome OS developers who talk about using the Novatel E362 LTE modem (which is actually a PCIe board). While the Google Link / Chromebook Pixel video may have been fake, there's plenty of evidence to support the existence of the device in the Chrome OS code itself. We're still betting this new Macbook Air-style Chromebook will make its first appearance in June during Google I/O 2013.

Mid-February isn’t traditionally when we would expect a MacBook upgrade, but Mac system sales dropped from 5.2 million in Apple’s fiscal 2012 first quarter to 4.1 million units in the company’s Q1/13, a 22% decline year-over-year and a much sharper sales slump than the global average decline of 6.4% for the PC sector overall. With laptops accounting for the (Mountain) lion’s share of Mac system sales these days, that indicated a worrisome reversal of trajectory for Apple’s formerly high-flying laptop lines, obliging Apple to take some action to boost sluggish MacBook sales. Why has the market apparently soured considerably on Apple’s laptops? With the global economy continuing to struggle in general, it can be assumed that consumers are becoming increasingly price-conscious, and Apple notebooks are perceived as being expensive. PC Ultrabook prices are dropping, with $599 the lowest I’ve seen cited to date, while the entry-level 11.6-inch MacBook Air goes for $999 with a tiny 64 GB SSD. Apple hasn’t addressed that, but has significantly sweetened the value of its 13-inch MacBook Airs and both 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina display. As Arnold Zafra reported for AppleTell Wednesday, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display now starts at $1,499 with a 128GB SSD – a $200 price cut, or $1,699 for a a 13-inch rMBP speed-bumped with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor and 256GB of SSD storage. The base 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display also gets speed bumped to a 2.4 GHz quad-core processor, while the top-of-the-line 15-inch rMBP gets a 2.7 GHz Core i7 quad-core processor and its standard (non-upgradable) RAM configuration has been doubled to 16GB of memory. The 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of SSD storage capacity also gets a price reduction to $1,399. All revised models are available immediately. Meanwhile, the still-available (but probably for not much longer) non-Retina 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are unchanged in either price or specification. My expectation is that they’ve received their ultimate refresh, and will likely be discontinued altogether with the release of Haswell-powered MacBook Air and rMBP models, possibly in June, but more likely in the summer or fall. That raises the question of whether we can anticipate further price reductions on the Air and rMBP models when the non-Retina MacBook Pro machines take their final curtain. Currently, the base 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,199, which is still $300 cheaper than the base 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro after the price cut. That will amount to a pretty hefty hike in Apple’s entry-level Pro laptop price, which would seem the wrong direction to be headed these days (the Retina screens’ impressiveness notwithstanding) if Apple holds the just-revised price points. Aside from lower-end price competitiveness, another area where Apple has fallen behind its Windows PC market rivals is touchscreen displays. Personally, I don’t find that a serious shortcoming, but Intel will make touchscreen support a mandatory Ultrabook specification requirement with Haswell-powered models. Consumer sentiment being what it is, Apple will be increasingly seen as lagging in a key feature. Presumably, part of the reason for holding back is that Retina displays are already expensive, and Retina touchscreens would be even more so. It will be interesting to watch how that plays out. Speaking of Haswell, while the price cuts and specification upgrades announced Wednesday represent significant and welcome value-enhancement, prospective MacBook Air and rMBP purchasers might be well-advised to consider holding off a few months for the new CPUs, which will be significantly less power-demanding than the current Ivy Bridge Core i chips, as well as presumably somewhat faster. On the other hand, if you want a new MacBook with a traditional hard disk drive offering affordable 500 GB or greater storage capacity, upgradable RAM, a full range of legacy I/O ports, and an internal optical drive, better grab one of the non-Retina MacBook Pros while the getting is still good.

We certainly hope the next iPad is thinner and lighter, as we’ve tested a number of Android and Windows 8 tablets that are more portable. It’s time for Apple to catch up in that department while still delivering a Retina Display with less bezel. From laptopmag [Gee, what happened to everything being capable of being done with just design? Apple's superb design got them a fat, over-heating iPad in the last generation. This obviously is what happens when you don't have access to state-of-the-art fabrication, ie Intel fabrication. Has Apple learned anything? Enough to take the big jump?
