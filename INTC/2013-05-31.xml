INTC will have an old school Q3 and Q4, leading the technology stocks up. Nowadays, you can add Q1 2014 because of the Chinese New Year holiday.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369990210174</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 04:50:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369990247315-13</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives quickly changing in US markets</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369990210174</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 04:50:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The writing is on the wall, you just have to know how to read.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369990247315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 04:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369991392871-14</Id><Topic><Title>Acer $400 'PC' will run Android, pack Intel's Haswell chip</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1369971280651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:34:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The underlying message here is that Intel x86 runs all OSs and it makes sense for vendors to have Intel's x86 the centerpiece of their designs.

Any company that makes a tablet expected to sell above the $200 price point will likely have a Windows tablet offering. Once they've built this device it offers greater economy of scale to use Core or Atom for everything else they make because Android, Tizen, Ubuntu or every other Linux variant comes for free, plus the dual-boot option is very compelling. The case for Intel tablets becomes even stronger when Intel Core and Atom also perform better and offer longer battery life. Going forward the business case for ARM becomes much more difficult for anything more than low cost devices with very limited flexibility.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1369997203707</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 06:46:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369999677053-18</Id><Topic><Title>HTC Said to Cancel Large Windows RT Tablet on Weak Demand</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1369963825551</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 21:30:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1369999677053</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 07:27:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369999952043-19</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Needs A New Abuse Category</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369959576823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 20:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's wrong with "ignore"?

With the two new Windows 8 tablets plus the 7.9-inch Iconia A1 and the upcoming 10-inch Android-based entry-level model, Acer is expected to have no trouble achieving its shipment goal of 10 million tablets in 2013, the sources said. Acer will have Android and Windows 8 models account for 75% and 25%, of its tablet shipments, the sources added. The sources also noted that the touchscreen function is already believed by brand vendors to be the major driver of their profits and sales in 2013. For Acer, touchscreen models already accounted for 12% of its total notebook shipments in the first quarter and the percentage is expected to rise to 20% in the second quarter, 50% for the entire 2014 and 70% in 2015. Meanwhile, Asustek's touchscreen notebooks already had a shipment proportion of almost 25% in the first quarter, a lot higher than the 10% of the market average. The percentage is estimated to reach 25% in the second quarter and higher in the second half of 2013. Currently, Asustek has a 30-35% share in the global touchscreen notebook market.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370003471632</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 08:31:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370003767741-24</Id><Title>Global tablet shipments to grow 62% in 2013, says MIC.

Romit's assessment: "this can't be good". Romit's target has been $18 and I have not seen him drop it. Covello is the only analyst below $18 that I know of. Nothing yet from Covello and his $16 target. He might be waiting for Haswell and its "apparent success" to back track on his low target. StreetInsider "A rumored deal between Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is "less certain," according Nomura analyst Romit Shah. Information cited by Nomura claims the two sides may have disagreements over price." "While speculation about Intel-Apple partnership remains ongoing, our research suggests that a deal has recently become less certain," said Shah. "While we have not gotten a definitive explanation why negotiations with Intel could have stalled, we believe cost could be a key factor. Our understanding is that Samsung could be pricing wafers 20-30% below Intel. As such, we see TSMC (NYSE: TSM) manufacturing Apple's A7/A7X chips in 2013 and 2014 and Samsung at this point on track to manufacture Apple's A8x chips in 2015." Nomura Securities has a Reduce rating on Intel with a price target of $18.00.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370011061278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 10:37:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370011079678-46</Id><Title>BAY TRAIL PRODUCTS WILL BE SHOWN NEXT WEEK</Title><Msg>In addition to haswell products.

Carriers are now pushing low rates to steal business from each other. The hardware is out of the equation. The deal is, if you require new hardware they have $20 a month classic lease systems. If after a few months you decide to drop the carrier, you'll get a bill for the remaining balance on the phone which could be anywhere between $400 to $600. This is the European market model which will come to the United States. Essentially you buy your hardware and shop for service. This is going to affect demand of new hardware. I know the ARM fans are quick to point out benchmarks. But will consumers fork over top dollar for top hardware? Or will the second hand market grow? Though, you'll be surprised how much older smartphones are commanding. Keep in mind Intel still has specs for $175 smartphones. It must be maddening for tier one handset suppliers. Dropping demand from consumers and the potential of Intel being a loose canon in the market by pushing private labels carrier phones. The ARM fans really believe Intel may be locked out of the Tier 1 market. I wouldn't be so certain.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370013298645</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:14:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370013331883-59</Id><Topic><Title>:: $8B investment in Intel = Largest Shareholder STATUS :</Title><Username>peoplesoftepm</Username><Timestamp>1370011221036</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 10:40:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>warren buffet too..</Msg><Username>peoplesoftepm</Username><Timestamp>1370013331883</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370013386485-60</Id><Topic><Title>INTC would probably come to be the stock to watch this week.</Title><Username>christophercontreras874</Username><Timestamp>1370010532607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 10:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>co. actually has a strong ground presence in USA</Msg><Username>gay.eric51</Username><Timestamp>1370013386485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:16:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370013421516-61</Id><Title>Break Out?</Title><Msg>Looks ready.</Msg><Username>r.idonius</Username><Timestamp>1370013421516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:17:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370013450951-62</Id><Topic><Title>Why Samsung is using Clover Trail+ for Galaxy Tab 3</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370012551712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:02:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correct on all three points.

Naysayers will note that the chip giant's prospects against the ARM architecture aren't good. These naysayers are also likely to add that Intel's Haswell-based chips are designed for a PC industry that is getting thumped by tablets. The argument against Intel goes like this: 1.ARM, a low power processor architecture, will dominate as mobile computing (smartphones and tablets) routs PC sales in the years ahead. 2.Intel's manufacturing prowess and focus on performance is a waste in an era of good enough computing. 3.Intel doesn't seem to have a mobile answer that's been given a thumbs up by the market. 4.New Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is likely to stay the course so the chip giant may never solve for ARM. Folks following the semiconductor industry can recite those arguments in their sleep. To many folks, Qualcomm is the new Intel. Of course, Intel begs to differ with that opinion. Now there's an increasingly vocal chorus of analysts who believe that Intel can solve for ARM and ultimately pass that architecture in mobile computing. In other words, Intel's recent design wins with Samsung and Asus at ARM's expense are just the beginning. These analysts are largely backing Intel based on the company's next-gen Atom roadmap dubbed Silvermont. Intel presented its roadmap earlier this month and plans to improve Atom every year. Silvermont will have a burst frequency to handle various use cases.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370027887839</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:18:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370027890160-130</Id><Title>ipad will be toast</Title><Msg>if teh samsung tablet with intel inside is as advertized</Msg><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1370027890160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370027915450-131</Id><Title>RBC says Samsung could be "tip of the iceberg." Outperform rating with target of $29</Title><Msg>This morning it was reported that an upcoming Galaxy Tablet by Samsung will feature a processor built by Intel (Nasdaq: INTC). The win is a blow to ARM Holdings plc (Nasdaq: ARMH), which usually powers Android devices. The news is providing bulls with new ammunition, and some say this could be the tip of the iceberg for Intel's growing mobile presence. Checks by RBC suggest further traction in mobile is on the way, a realization that could catch many investors by surprise. Commenting, analyst Doug Freedman said, "The data point is in support of our thesis that Intel's mobile presence, which is currently being discounted in the marketplace, will become increasing visible on 32nm Clover Trail+, ahead of its move to leading-edge 14nm in 2014. We highlight this is particularly encouraging given that we expect Bay Trail 22nm to be more significant than Clover Trail+ based on its performance lead." "Even marginal upside from handset revenues should push the applied multiple higher, as it shows that Intel's bet on x86 against ARM is finally making in-roads," added the analyst. RBC has an Outperform rating on Intel with a price target of $29.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370027915450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370028128599-132</Id><Title>INTEL + SAMSUNG +$$$$$$$$</Title><Msg>Big things are happening as we speak!!</Msg><Username>donalhump</Username><Timestamp>1370028128599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:22:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370028670861-133</Id><Topic><Title>RBC says Samsung could be "tip of the iceberg."

Intel's Clovertrail+ already matches or exceeds the best ARM's shipping on performance and efficiency. Secondly, Bay Trail and Merrifield are vastly better than Clovertrail+ on performance and efficiency and will be even more competitive against ARM. For high-end tablets, Haswell is in a league of its own with nothing challenging it in performance, and all Intel SoC's are capable of running Windows or Android. Intel's manufacturing prowess isn't just about speed, it's also about energy efficiency and being the cost leader for volume chip production. Vendors are way ahead of analysts in understanding the impact to their future. This is why all the major vendors are preparing to release new flagship products featuring Intel's parts.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1370032191526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 16:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370033508661-148</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Haswell launch may take backseat to Atom vs. ARM</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370027887839</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:18:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It appears they have learned to use something beyond copy/paste and are starting to use the stuff between their ears.

True but not a logical reason for your short unless you know why it is this has always happend in the past and that the same things are in play now. Intel is old technology and the phones is where it is at nowadays. First, Intel makes chips and those chips will go into phones and tablets as well as they go into Desktops and Notebooks. Secondly, Intel CPUs are the state of the art in mass production chips and sell at a 60% margin and this is by no means a commodity or old. I hate Intel's guts and therefor I will short the POS! Well I hate lots of companies but I am not stupid enough to short them. I mean the bog banks are filled with jerks and they deserve to be shafted but they will likely make windfall profits as the American economy recovers so a short on Banks would be stupid. Intel short are stupid too. I do not believe Apple or Samsung will ever use Intel because Appledroids tell me so. Yeah and they said Jobs would not use Intel in macs but it did. The shorts look at the news from Samsung today and simply ignore it but when the sales numbers come in making profits for Intel, their anti-Intel play will be ROADKILL!

Before they are right, they will find multiple ways in which to monetize that in their core business by bringing out incremental performance that people will pay for, and in the nontraditional markets of tablets and smartphones by getting down their cost points and performance points that other people won’t be able to match,” Pitzer said. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW CLICK HERE. Intel further monetizes its advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities by partnering with other companies in foundry partnerships. Its leadership in this segment, Pitzer says, is expected to result in the world gathering at its factories for advanced chips. “What you are seeing is Intel‘s manufacturing lead is stretching out, but Intel is now signing up foundry partners. The most public one was Altera (ALTR) about a month and a half ago who has historically been a customer at TSM. Altera has decided to use Intel because they have a better manufacturing process. We think Cisco (CSCO) will also start to build chips at Intel, as well as Apple (AAPL). This is all based upon this view that Intel will be the last man standing on Moore’s Law. They will continue to stretch out their manufacturing lead, and the world will be forced to be on the path to their door,” Pitzer said.

Nothing really "new" but the analysts are slow to comprehend - the ARM FinFet is a hoax. The ARM foundries can compete with each other but they won't be able to compete with Intel. I am fairly confident that Apple decided a couple years ago to go with TSMC @ 20nm - and they stuck with it and they probably regretting it.

It makes no sense.

It is not functional or even powered on in the shipping product (i9500). In fact, this has been such of an issue, that as a result, the chip was almost cancelled. It was reportedly only salvaged by having it work in the cluster migration policy and bypass the CCI entirely. While contradicting, it questions the validity of ARM’s own videos while demonstrating the Octa. Internally at SLSI, as many as three projects were cancelled late last year. We don’t know the reasons for their cancellation, however it is said that the issues are related, and unacceptable power consumption also plays a big role. One can argue that ARM’s Cortex A15 is partly to blame here: The inherent architecture is to power consuming to be implemented in a smart-phone. big.LITTLE provides major breathing-room, but only in scenarios where continuous load is not an issue. HD gaming is a major Achilles heel where power consumption can run rampant. Nvidia is having it much worse with their Tegra 4: With only a single tablet design win besides their own Shield gaming console, it’s a chip that needs to, and will be, quickly forgotten. Plagued by delays, hardware bugs, and high power consumption, one could view the Exynos 5410 as nothing short of a failure. In fact, Samsung’s Mobile division was so dismayed at the whole situation that their next major products will completely forego the company’s own Exynos chips and go straight with Qualcomm’s offerings. Reports that the Note 3 would come with the S800 match with this information, and are probably very correct."

The business is failing to cater, not only in terms of support, like providing proper hardware documentation and source code to the public, but the current line-up is in shambles also in terms of hardware. Lackluster graphics performance and outdated GPUs have become sort of a habit for the company. This reportedly is due to an unwillingness to spend the money on IP licenses from third-party companies, and the use of Mali GPUs in their SoCs is due to a free licensing agreement they receive from ARM as a lead partner. The surprise use of the SGX 544MP3 in the Exynos 5410 is due to panic caused by Mali’s own T6xx GPUs: again an issue of extremely excessive power consumption. The first generation Midgard lineup was quickly scrapped, leaving the Exynos 5250 and its T604 as something of an orphan. Products like the T658 never saw the light of day and are not even mentioned anymore on ARM’s website. Meanwhile, while their shipping products are failing to properly compete, Samsung is spending a lot of money on developing their own GPU IP from scratch. Not much information is available as to when we will see this in actual products, but it will eventually come, if not cancelled or delayed due to its unorthodox implementation of an FPGA-like re-programmable design which might be hit-or-miss. Imagination’s Rogue architecture and years of experience as a leading GPU IP provider will be tough competition. CPU wise, things look just as bleak. Qualcomm currently dominates the performance per Watt scale for the high-end with the newest Krait architectures. With no custom design in the works, as done by Apple or Qualcomm, and no A57 or A53 as architectural refreshes from ARM, nor a new 20nm manufacturing process coming until 2014, the Exynos A15 line-up looks incapable of competing in the near-future.
