I have to say that your posts here and your MF articles have been spectacular. I spent the weekend at the home of an Intel employee a couple of weeks ago and she was wondering why I was such a fan. I forwarded on your article 16nm Finfet and said "Read this!" I told her that I really don't have a team that I root for more than Intel. I feel like a Kings fan last season when the Kings went to the playoffs. I really do appreciate your insight into Intel. You see the big picture and explain it far better than I've ever seen anybody else explain Intel. Trust me, the management at Intel can't explain Intel as well as you do.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370406298042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 00:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370406935404-3</Id><Topic><Title>This will seal the deal</Title><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1370391535217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 20:18:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Accelerating Fast: Tablets, Smartphones and LTE Intel's 22nm low-power, high-performance Silvermont microarchitecture is enabling the company to accelerate and significantly enhance its tablet and smartphone offerings. For the first time, Kilroy demonstrated Intel's 4G LTE multimode solution in conjunction with the next-generation 22nm quad-core Atom SoC for tablets. The Intel® XMM 7160 is one of the world's smallest and lowest-power multimode-multiband LTE solutions and will support global LTE roaming in a single SKU. With a number of phones with Intel silicon inside having shipped across more than 30 countries, Kilroy previewed what's coming.

We’ve heard a lot about the upcoming “Bay Trail” tablet and notebook chips based on the new 22nm Silvermont architecture. But Intel’s new “Merrifield” chips for smartphones are based on the same Silvermont technology. This week the company started showing off a reference design for smartphones featuring Merrifield low-power processors. Intel says Merrifield chips will offer better performance and longer battery life than the Clover Trail+ and Medfield chips that are currently available for smartphones. PC World reports we could see up to a 50 percent performance boost over current-generation chips. While Intel Vice President Tom Kilroy briefly showed off a reference design for a smartphone at Computex today, the company hasn’t released detailed specs for the device yet, other than saying it offers 3x the graphics performance of current chips and support for screen resolutions up to 2560 x 1440 pixels.

Oh, you're looking for a new laptop? Buy a MacBook Air. Apple's cheapest and lightest notebook is the easy choice – it's fast enough, has a fantastic keyboard and trackpad, has solid battery life, and comes with few of the quirks and issues that plague nearly every Windows device on the market. This year, every PC manufacturer is determined to change that. Toshiba's Kirabook offers the specs, size, and even service of Apple's best; nearly every other manufacturer has renewed its focus on quality as well. Rather than race to the bottom and leave Apple alone at the top, Windows-powered PCs are creeping back up to Apple's level. Sony's not even pretending about its designs for the new VAIO Pro lineup.

[I'm thinking that you couldn't tell a laptop from a gaming laptop and a desktop from a gaming desktop. Or carry on an intelligent conversation about processor cooling. Post up some information instead of the totally weak "I'm seeing some reviews"...] MSI’s Cooler Booster 2 tech makes a genuine impact by connecting the CPU and GPU cooling systems via a thermal bridge. Once either component gets hotter, the system transfers the heat to the opposite side faster. In simpler terms, even lefties aren’t going to get their mouse hand fried by the exhaust, and the external keyboard temperature remained within levels that wouldn’t impact gaming. I honestly expected the system to melt with so much next-generation silicon inside, but the chassis didn’t even approach levels I’d call hot, even after stress-testing the system.

One of them is the VAIO Duo 13, Sony‘s second pass at the slider idea. The company recently gave me a sneak peek, and it looked like a markedly more practical take on the concept than the Duo 11. That practicality starts with the touchscreen. It still sports 1920-by-1080 resolution, but it’s now a markedly roomier 13″, which makes it feel like a full-sized portable computer rather than a miniaturized one. There’s a touchpad now instead of the previous model’s oddball pointer, letting you work with the Duo as if it were an utterly conventional PC. As before, you also get a pressure-sensitive pen for drawing and note-taking; a pop-out “inkwell” lets you temporarily stow it so it doesn’t get lost on your desk. Despite the bigger display and touchpad, the Duo’s footprint and weight (2.97 pounds) are only a skosh larger than that of the Duo 11. For a system that runs full-strength Windows 8, it still feels ultra-portable, and it meets Intel’s specs for Ultrabooks. [image] Sony Dup 13 Sony Sliding up the Duo 11′s unwieldy hinged screen is a two-handed job; the Duo 13′s far less clunky redesigned version glides open and shut with one hand. And the system is among the first to use Intel’s fourth-generation Core processors (aka Haswell), allowing Sony to more than double its promised battery life to “up to” ten hours.

Firstly the measured power of both Ivy Bridge and Haswell is under all conditions less than Sandy Bridge so there is no power wattage problem. Yet Computerbase measured 51c, 57c, 67c for Sandy, Ivy and Haswell respectively. computerbaseDOTde/artikel/prozessoren/2013/intel-haswell-prozessor-fuer-desktop-pcs-im-test/17/ Why is that ? Well, temperature goes up as wattage goes up and die area decreases. Sandy Bridge has a larger die area but it burns more watts so all three cores should still be in the same range so why are they not ? Well, with the intro of Ivy Bridge the fluxless solder which has a tremendous heat dissipation of 80W/mK was substituted as the thermal conduit to the IHS by a cheap standard TIM paste with a thermal dissipation 1/20 of the solder i.e. 20 times less efficient ! A website removed this standard paste and replaced it with the best market alternatives and found temperatures drops of around 20% ! Frankly this is an unnecessary own goal by Intel and the two idiots who thought of it and ok'd it should both be fired as it undoes the efforts of the architecture team to keep wattage under control. In fact if they are going to go this cheap false economy route, remove the IHS altogether and just leave the die naked as in the old 1990s dies and let the OEMs do all the cooling rather than handicap them before they start. At least then some could do their own better solutions. This was a cost cut too far !! hexusDOTnet/tech/news/cpu/39369-intel-cuts-corners-ivy-bridge-thermal-interface-material-tim/</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370411245530</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 01:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370411615528-24</Id><Title>Intel whips out quad-core Surface-like tablet, runs Android</Title><Msg>Chip giant shows off a sleek, fast tablet sporting its quad-core Bay Trail chip during a Computex keynote from cnet</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370411615528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 01:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370411821561-25</Id><Title>Samsung galaxy s4 with Intel inside</Title><Msg>wwwdotengadgetdotcom/2013/06/05/intel-samsung-galaxy-s-4/</Msg><Username>srinism</Username><Timestamp>1370411821561</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 01:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370412463786-26</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung galaxy s4 with Intel inside</Title><Username>srinism</Username><Timestamp>1370411821561</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 01:57:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Huh?

You could make a killing 2. You could be waiting a while 3. You could lose your $%&amp; if you wait too long 4. You could lose your $%&amp; even sooner than expected 5. You could decide to take the profits you've already accrued and walk away happy I personally would be weary trying to keep a short position for too long here. Intel's seems to have the wind at it's back with all the media attention and positive reviews covering the power consumption (a huge spec. for mobile/tablet users). Further, this stream of good news doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon. I'd avoid holding into earnings like the plague. Then again, that's just me. I can't give you too much of a hard time on the high risk side of this maneuver, I'd just be concerned about selling short. If you're convinced that there's money to be made as INTC takes a turn to the downside (briefly or otherwise), it might be a better idea to play PUT OPTIONS. Then at least you have more control over your potential losses. Obviously we don't want to lose money here, but sometimes it's best to follow the old saying "Prepare for the worst, hope for the best." Selling short, your possible losses are theoretically infinite. Put options still make money going down, but you can't lose more than your original investment if things don't work out your way. Personally, I'm thinking that Jan 2015 calls are looking pretty intriguing at this point. I think we can all agree that it's quite likely that we're in the calm before the storm. At this point, it's a matter of speculation which way the winds will take us. Don't bet the bank on it, neither direction is guaranteed. Disclaimer: I currently hold January 2015 in the money options and may choose to sell, hold, or buy more at any point in time. This post should be viewed as my unofficial opinion and not as trading advice. I do not take credit for any profits or losses of anyone but myself, potential or realized. Do your own research before making any trade decisions.</Msg><Username>booman587</Username><Timestamp>1370435651603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370435884761-37</Id><Title>Booman I am 99% certain this short will workout now.</Title><Msg>Thanks anyway, but i need a target.</Msg><Username>testpilot1003</Username><Timestamp>1370435884761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:38:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370436522939-38</Id><Title>If you haven’t seen MISM you need to drop everything else</Title><Msg>MISM has proven gold reserves and trades at just .08 cents.

Intel’s mobile keynote slide had a device we were least not-at-all expecting, the Galaxy S4. So what if Samsung is using an Intel SoC in their newest Galaxy Tab 3, does that warrant for another Galaxy S4 edition using Intel’s Atom chip? Intel’s mobile keynote slide held something that picked everyone’s interest, more than the 9 other devices in the slide. If you count the numerous Galaxy S4 variants, the Galaxy S4 Mini, Active, (rumored) Mega, Zoom, it is completely plausible for Samsung to add yet another variant. If you count the Google Edition and the possible Intel Edition, you have 6 variants of the Galaxy S4. Add the fact that there are two variants of the flagship S4, one with Exynos 5 Octa and the other with a Snapdragon 600 chipset and you start wondering as to what the company is really trying to do. Flooding the market with products is one thing (that Samsung has achieved), this is more like a tidal wave. It is possible that Samsung was simply waiting for an Intel chip with LTE on-board. If our suspicions are true, this would mark the biggest triumph for Intel with Android devices till date. The Galaxy S4 is the world’s best-selling smartphone, and an Intel edition would only improve the company’s share in the Android chip supply chain. Perhaps this is exactly what is needed to kick-start community development on Intel-powered Android devices as well. Of course, if all this turns out to be true, the Galaxy S4 Intel Edition will most definitely pack a Saltwell based Intel SoC, dual or quad-core. We’ll simply have to wait and see how all this plays out. Nevertheless, we can’t deny that we’re very excited.

As a (simple example), if we take a large IP block such as one of Imaginations GPU's and build it on Intel's 22nm LP process and do the same with TSMC's 28nm LP process. You would think the Intel process would produce the smaller die, but this is not necessary the case. When you take the actual gate length into account (closer to 28nm than 22nm) and more importantly the design rules for the layout, it's actually possible for the 28nm process to produce the smaller die (even though the # of transistors is the same in both cases). TSMC has always had more flexible design rules and higher density than Intel for a given node. This is also one of the reasons why TSMC has yield issues - the process itself could be yielding fine, but various designs are having various yield issues. On the CPU front, the ARM variants are typically smaller than Atom (depending on who you listen to, Saltwell is 3 times the size of the A9) and this in turn has an effect on the SoC die size. This is the basis of the "Two node ahead" argument that the ARM fans use (Intel needs to be 2 nodes ahead to actually have cheaper SoCs). Until we see Intel's 22nm LP SoC's and get a feel of the die sizes and relative performance points we won't know if this argument will hold.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1370437724374</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 09:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370437734170-42</Id><Title>Ahhhh shorting is a thing of beauty...lol</Title><Msg>Dumb azzes</Msg><Username>testpilot1003</Username><Timestamp>1370437734170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 09:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370437750368-43</Id><Topic><Title>Booman I am 99% certain this short will workout now.</Title><Username>testpilot1003</Username><Timestamp>1370435884761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:38:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In an effort to help a fellow trader and for my own knowledge, I did some searching for such an answer for you.

I would recommend googling the title and/or author's name and giving it a quick read. For this specific article, bar chart analysis was used with respect to 20, 50, and 100 moving averages. The article sites a relative strength index of 75.54% and a technical support level of $24.55. Hope this helps.

While we knew the Galaxy Tab 3 is certainly coming with a Clover Trail+ chipset, there was another device that is apparently making the transition to Intel's mobile chip: the GS4. At least according to Intel's mobile keynote slide, seen above. Are the pair waiting on LTE capability to arrive? Quite possibly. During the Q&amp;A session afterwards, We asked Intel's Hermann Eur, General Manager for Mobile, who reiterated that the GS4's 3G model contains Intel's modem, although that doesn't explain quite why the phone is nestled alongside an otherwise all-Atom lineup of tablets and smartphones. We're looking into it. Update: We grabbed an Intel spokesperson who tells us the Galaxy S4 made the lineup due to the aforementioned 3G radios. We're taking their word for it, but we'll be hearing more from big mobile brands and Intel over the next year.

So you were responsible for all those volume numbers. 8-) I have done pretty well with the overnight trades on options too. Limited loss. I tend to buy for intermediate or long term. The only problem that I have encountered in writing calls in an up market is losing the shares. It helps me keep from falling in love with the shares. Even rolling forward runs out of gas as the lower price strikes disappear. I tend to like holding a core position and then some shares for trading or writing options on.

It's okay to be bearish in your trading strategy. It's annoying when the only thing I can tell from reading your posts is that you're a bear. Give us some reasoning, logic, and/or citations in your posts or just stop posting altogether.</Msg><Username>booman587</Username><Timestamp>1370444690985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:04:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370444719684-97</Id><Topic><Title>MS: Outlook coming to RT in Win8.1</Title><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370444664243</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:04:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>article on techcrunch</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370444719684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370444817762-98</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Cortex 12: Too Little, Too Late</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370410288409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 01:31:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A 12 is based on 28nm ....

Analyst Christopher Danely reported that he sees risk for INTC’s growth in the second half of 2013 as PC demand remains flat. Although gains from tablets have grown, it will not be enough to offset PC declines. The firm currently has a “Neutral” rating on INTC and a price target of $18. This price target suggests a -28% drop from the stock’s current price of $24.95 Intel shares were down 40 cents, or -1.58% during Wednesday morning trading. The stock is up 21% YTD.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370448173654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 12:02:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370448189064-136</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Down 45 Cents, ARM Down 87 Cents, NASDAQ Down 30</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370446990851</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:43:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wally both stocks are down about 2 percent today.

The Dallas Fed was the only outlier of the 12 Fed districts, reporting "strong" economic growth. Sequestration was only mentioned in cutbacks in defense spending in the Boston and Richmond districts.

Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein You spoke before about your increased confidence now versus last year. But if I’m just looking over the last three months, we have weaker results in Q1, which raises the operational bar for the second half, on both top line and gross margin, which suggests you’re even more confident in that back half ramp than you were three months ago, even in the wake of what looks to be pretty challenging market data. You’re also taking capex down, though, which would belie that increased confidence some. I was just wondering, could you help me identify the sources of that increased confidence in that back half ramp versus where you were three months ago, as well as help me rationalize that with the cut to the capex outlook. Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President First of all, just to make sure I’m not oversoaking things here, you really just need seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low single digit revenue growth. So I don’t think we have a hugely high bar out there, and I went through a dissection of where I think the revenue comes from. In terms of the things that give me confidence, or at least I personally believe it could be better than seasonal, it’s the things we talked about, improving macroeconomic environment, the fact that we now are participating across a range of compute devices, and so the mix between those don’t impact us nearly as much. And then third, as Paul said, you have innovative form factors coming out in ultrabooks, in convertibles, and in detachables, that are hitting these really compelling mainstream price points that are touch enabled. And as we get into the Christmas selling season, your expectation is you will see touch-enabled ultrabooks that are $499 and $599 pretty commonly out there. $599 commonly, and $499 as kind of special SKUs. And then we’ll see, because of Bay Trail coming into the marketplace, you’ll see touch-enabled thin notebooks with really good performance that are hitting kind of $300 price points. And then with our Android tablets, you’ll see things that are significantly, [hey, I have that]. So we’ll be participating across a broad range of compute devices as we get into the back half of this year. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein For my follow up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the trajectory of your fab output. It sounds to me like your current [time] to loading is similar to what you had last quarter, which I think was full fabs on the second half. It almost sounds like you may be running close to full right now. What does that mean for your expectations for how much your fab output may grow in 2014, year over year. I would think you anticipate running full in 2014, and we were pretty lean in the first part of 2013. Would double digit upside be the right way to think about that in terms of fab output? And how much of that increase might be inventory replenishment versus demand upside? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President I think it’s early to talk about 2014 at this point. We have the ability to respond to lots of different volume scenarios for 2014. If it’s large, we can put on more capacity. If it ends up being closer to a bust, we can play the playbook we played… Paul Otellini - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director We’ve also got the technology transition to the 14 nanometers. [unintelligible] a first order, all of our spending is focused on 14 nanometers , which gives us a fairly significant ramp capability. If demand for older products exceeds what we could build on 14, we could still build 22 for quite some time. So I really think it depends on whatever demand scenario you see out there. In any event, the most important thing for us is to make that transition to 14 and continue to have the leading edge.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1370463275410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 16:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370463326685-250</Id><Title>So which one of you bought in the 25s</Title><Msg>You won't be seeing that again for awhile</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1370463326685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 16:15:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370463341928-251</Id><Topic><Title>Up 12 cents?</Title><Username>walrusweener</Username><Timestamp>1370385994669</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 18:46:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I demand a recount!</Msg><Username>walrusweener</Username><Timestamp>1370463341928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 16:15:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370463385478-252</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Rasgon: last Conference call</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1370463275410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 16:14:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein And I understand that. Just mathematically, though, if I’m running full in 2014 and I was pretty empty in the first part of 2013, even if you’re not adding a tremendous amount of capacity, doesn’t that imply a very significant uptick in your fab output in ‘14 versus ’13, if ’13 is flattish to ’12, and in ’12 we already had too much? Mathematically, what does it imply if you’re running full in 2014 even if you don’t add anything? Paul Otellini - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director We haven’t talked about 2014. Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Yeah, and I think what you’re equation misses there is that we roll forward capacity. So we take capacity offline. Think of the change in capex at a first approximation of we took older generation technology offline a little faster than we thought. And we offset stuff that we were going to buy to make the transition and to build towards that 14 nanometer peak. We don’t actually have to choose the 14 nanometer peak today. We can continue to refresh capital. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein I understand. I’m just saying if you’re running full in 2014, and you’re not full for ’13, how much would your output [go up]? Forgetting transitions and 14 nanometers and capex, just on a rough basis, how much are we talking about in terms of increase? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President If we’re running full in 2014. I mean, I’m not sure how to answer that question, because I don’t yet know how much capacity we’re going to put in place for ’14. Mark Henninger - Investor Relations And Stacy, I think at that point we’ll want to move on to the next questioner. I’ll be happy to follow up with you a little bit later.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1370463385478</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 16:16:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370463537910-253</Id><Title>Will $24 hold??</Title><Msg>Intel was totally bashed today by the analysts &amp; in 1 day, sentiment changed 180-degrees.

Gauna cut his estimates for this year’s profit per share to $1.85 from $2.15, and cut next year’s estimate to $1.70 from $2.25, warning of what he thinks might be a delay in Intel’s “Haswell” processors for PCs and servers this year and next. Gauna says third parties he spoke to at a tech conference express the view Intel is experiencing some delays with Haswell, the latest “micro architecture” change to the company’s microprocessors, which was excepted to bring extra power savings, initially for PCs: The Intel effort to integrate a voltage regulation (VR) stage into the Haswell architecture appears to have fallen short of desired results, and the company is consequently reversing course and not pursuing this power management scheme with subsequent products. Our discovery of this issue came from discussions with multiple power management partners at the APEC (Applied Power Electronics Conference) trade show that was held March 17-21, 2013, and we were also informed that they had only just become aware of Intel’s change of direction in prior weeks. To be clear, the industry sources we spoke with indicated Haswell is working, but that “the new power approach did not live up to expectations.”</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1370477078073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:04:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370477080478-286</Id><Topic><Title>Inventec Lyon - First 7" Bay Trail tablet running Windows 8</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370476860881</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:01:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the looks of this, IMO, Bay Trail can be squeezed into a 5.5" phaplet</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370477080478</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370477249507-287</Id><Topic><Title>I bought</Title><Username>biotrader1</Username><Timestamp>1370467011406</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 17:16:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While some see support in the SPY500 area, and the potential for one more rally high with a possibility of SPY 500 1700, the prevailing thought seems to be that that will likely be a significant top that leads to a meaningful correction, as opposed to a dip.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1370477249507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:07:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370477474210-288</Id><Title>Another Bay Trail video</Title><Msg>youtubeDOTcom/watch?v=DTVRwA9nCoQ</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370477474210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:11:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370478659402-289</Id><Topic><Title>I bought</Title><Username>biotrader1</Username><Timestamp>1370467011406</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 17:16:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>probably not the cheapest level but I don't think intel is in secular decline as much as other PC manfacturers.

Walking in line with the latter, Fujitsu unveiled a new lineup of FMV series PCs, one of which it claims is the world's thinnest Ultrabook. The Ultrabook in question is the Lifebook UH90/L, and though it's extremely slender, that isn't the only eye-popping feature. Fujitsu squeezed a 14-inch wide format display into a standard 13-inch form factor body, but the real treat is that the panel utilizes IGZO technology to achieve an ultra-high display resolution of 3200x1800 (262 ppi). It's also a touchscreen panel, which is great for navigating Windows 8. Outside of the display, the UH90/L features a 4th Generation Intel Core i5 4200U processor and 500GB hybrid hard drive. Also on tap from Fujitsu is the Esprimo FH78/LD, a 23-inch all-in-one desktop with an advanced 30W high power speaker system jointly developed with Pioneer and proprietary eye-tracking technology, and a new 15.6-inch Lifebook AH45/K model.

Why? Because the differential represents recognition of the tipping point and the end of the ARM era.It represents Intel's move into mobility. 2013 continues to be the Year of the Intel Tablet, which gets demonstrated more every day and 2014 will be the Year of the Intel Smartphone with the arrival of Intel's 14nm FinFET and Airmont. Intel was down by 66 cents today, exceeded by ARM being down by 1.37, resulting in a positive differential for Intel of 71 cents. ARM has now dropped 20 percent since May 16th, primarily due to looming competition with Intel. Intel continues to get huge positive press out of Computex and new product announcements and this helps most where it counts - with consumers. We'll have the important Mac upgrades next week and then the Samsung event on the 20th where we might even get announcement of an Intel/Samsung smartphone. So, the press cycles are just going to keep coming in. Consumers are going to hear tons about Intel and almost nothing about ARM. Another really good day for Intel. Even with a terrible market day, Intel racks up another solid, substantial differential. The tipping point has arrived.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370488450499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:14:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370488708579-312</Id><Topic><Title>$12B in R&amp;D gets us an underwhelming Haswell?!?</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1370486149010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 22:35:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Haswell brings ultra high end performance to fanless tablets.

It comes with a brushed-aluminium silver reverse and on the front the outer bezel comes in one of four metallics: red, gold, green and a very nice sky blue. Add a very nice display to that (more on that later) and we have a head-turner on our hands. Or in this case, in our hands, and that was a very nice experience indeed. It’s about 20cm x 13 cm wide and a centimetre or so thick. The design includes concave curved edges along the two shorter sides, which make it incredibly comfortable (and secure) to hold in landscape. It feels almost cosy. Plus you can hold it stress-free in portrait with one thumb in the curve. There’s also a "real" button for the Windows Start in the outer bezel. The display is great. It’s an IPS screen that allows for viewing from wide angles. The resolution is fantastic, too: at first glance you could be forgiven for thinking that it was Full HD. It’s actually 1280 x 800, it’s just that the effect you get on the 7-inch ten-touchpoint screen. Under the hood there’s 2GB of RAM and a 1.66GHz quadcore running on Intel’s all new Bay Trail-M, which according to Intel is about to dramatically improve tablet battery life. The Lyon comes with either a 64 or 128GB SSD and you’ll find a micro-USB and micro- HDMI on the left side and a micro-SD card slot along the top. The Lyon is the first 7-inch that Microsoft showed off running Windows 8.1, and since Inventec is a contract manufacturer, we’re not sure who will release it, or what it will be called. And if you are wondering what Windows 8 is like on a 7-inch screen, it's okay. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 are so easily customisable that you can adapt it to work on any screen size. We had no issues. What we can promise you is that you read about it on Pocket-lint first and with its ultra-compact size and fine looks it’s sure to make waves this autumn.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370489433055</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:30:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370489546432-318</Id><Topic><Title>All About the Differential</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370488450499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:14:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bay Trail is getting huge press and looks like it will take the market by storm...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370489546432</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:32:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370489806143-319</Id><Title>Giving Microsoft the Opportunity to Shelve RT</Title><Msg>In the multiple choice world of tablets, Intel and Microsoft introduced upgrades and tweaks this week to their offerings that will prove attractive for future buyers in both the consumer and business worlds. So far, Intel's market share within the tablet arena has been constrained by power consumption. Products highlighted this week at Computex show the company continues to follow its roadmap and timing for improving performance and power consumption. Bay Trail, a redesigned Atom chip with four cores, was demonstrated in a "Microsoft Surface-like" tablet boasting all day battery life. One of the big knocks on the entry level Microsoft Surface RT is it doesn't run "real" Windows 8 because it uses a lower-power ARM processor, while the high-end Surface Pro provides a full Windows 8 experience at the cost of battery life and a higher price tag. A Bay Trail-based Surface tablet slots in nicely to displace the RT, offering cost-conscious buyers the ability to get all of the Windows 8 experience without having to pay upwards of $900 for a tablet. It also gives Microsoft the opportunity to shelve RT and streamline costs.

I could not find one good analysis about the MSCC foundry deal - mixed signal could be huge opportunity for Intel - as usual WS analysts are clueless - read Bohrs remarks about TriGate giving an edge to analog. Intel analog scaling is way ahead of TSMC Suitability of FinFET technology for low-power mixed-signal applications Wireless applications require a low power technology that enables digital/analog/RF functions on the same chip. FinFET technology presents a competitive alternative to planar CMOS as it features good digital, analog and low-frequency noise performances. Also, very good matching performance is presented here for the first time. Moreover, FinFETs are shown to be attractive for low-power applications below 10 GHz. The suitability of Fin varactors is evaluated and tradeoffs are given. An inductorless oscillator with large tuning range (1-8.5 GHz) for low-power wideband applications is demonstrated for the first time</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1370490863375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 23:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
