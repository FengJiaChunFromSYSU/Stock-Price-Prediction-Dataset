They would be worth more with the Intel fab IP attached to them. Note that the population of Fab buyers is very limited. I would expect that the value of a fab would be close to the price tag to rebuild an equivalent fab today. Intel says that Fab 42 cost is in the range of $5bil. Most of their modern 32nm/22nm fabs carried a price tag in the range of $3b to $5b. Many have had $1b to $3b upgrades. I would probably assign a $5b tag estimate to each of the modern 32/22/14nm 300mm wafer fabs. If Intel were to sell them on the open market, they would probably be worth less but to Intel, they are worth many times. It looks like there are 8 microprocessor 32/22/14nm fabs in place with a value of $3b to $5b each. Seems like a $24b to $40b estimate for the 8 fabs. The test facilities are not as expensive. Intel has 9 wafer fabs 22nm capable and 7 test facilities. Google for below and see Intel PDF file. Intel manufacturing facts Including .... Hillsboro, OR.

Apple and Intel reportedly working on a smart watch for 2013 By: Sahil 'Bones' Gupta | Dec 27th, 2012 at 05:45PM When Apple turned the iPod nano from a tiny little wearable watch like device to a much larger screen laden iPod many were distraught. We expected Apple to turn to the wearable computing brigade, but instead it chose a different route for the iPod nano. Now the The Next Web is reporting that Apple has partnered with Intel to develop a smart watch which will work via bluetooth. The device will reportedly have a 1.5-inch OLED display with indium tin oxide, ITO-coated glass on top made by a Taiwanese PMOLED glass manufacturer RiT display. We have already seen a slew of Smart Watch’s including Sony’s lacklustre attempt in the space, but to-date the 2010 iPod nano has been the closest thing to proper wearable smart watch. Many companies swooped-in and created straps to convert the iPod nano into a watch like contraption. Later, Apple even added more virtual clock themes to the iPod nano, including a mickey mouse theme based on a Disney made watch.</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356622883283</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:41:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356622945644-20</Id><Title>Haswell secret weapon - Integrated voltage regulator</Title><Msg>Intel’s Haswell to Feature Secrete Weapon: Integrated Voltage Regulator.

Such fine-grain regulation can decrease power consumption without compromising performance. For example, with Haswell it is possible to halt all CPU cores during video playback without halting ring-bus interconnections, which means that only graphics core will consume power and given the fact that the interconnection will continue to operate at full speed, video playback will be smooth. Eventually, Intel plans to build in IVR into microprocessor itself, which will further improvegranularity of power supply. This will not only be useful for code-named Broadwell chips for notebooks, but also for various system-on-chip solutions for smartphones and tablets. In the latter case this will significantly boost Intel’s competitive positions against various solutions based on ARM technology, which dominates the mobile electronics these days.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356623341931</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:49:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356623655190-32</Id><Topic><Title>Apple AND...drumroll please...INTEL working on SMART WATCH for 2013</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356622883283</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:41:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"sounds rather silly to me. people don't wear watches anymore. the watchbands usually smell bad after a day or so."

This is the first time that Intel has done this but ARM has the VRM on chip already. If ARM already has this, I was trying to figure out why this was such a big deal beyond being an equalizer. Thoughts... Intel has comparable low power already so this allows more compute in the same power envelope. This allows Intel to provide current performance in reduced power package and take better advantage of process lead.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356624348485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:05:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356624392132-40</Id><Title>WALLISWEAVER YOU ARE ON IGNORE IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>YOU ARE A COMPLETE FOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>fairwarning50</Username><Timestamp>1356624392132</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356624656350-41</Id><Title>Don't panic people!</Title><Msg>When all seems dire with people selling and the market capitulating, it's usually the time to buy.

It was Barack's second round of golf in Hawaii in the last week with Bobby Titcomb, who was popped in April 2011 after allegedly approaching an undercover police officer for sex in downtown Hawaii. Titcomb pled "no contest" to the charges and was fined $500. Since Titcomb stayed out of trouble for six months after the plea ... the charge disappeared from his record.

Building a smartwatch with an Intel chip would require Apple to provide x86-compatible software to run it. It’s been rumored for quite some time that Apple wants to bring iOS to the Mac lineup, and that would necessitate a port, too. If those aspirations are real, then it’s possible that Apple already has an x86-friendly version of iOS that would run on an Intel mobile processor (presumably Haswell) or would have one ready in time to launch a smartwatch next year. That’s never been officially confirmed, however. The other option would be custom x86 software that provides functionality similar to what the Pebble will offer users when it finally hits the market.</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1356637101391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:38:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637140065-122</Id><Topic><Title>New 7W Ivy Bridge parts</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354889715725</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 09:15:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for the input.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356637140065</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:39:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637207862-123</Id><Topic><Title>Pre-CES 2013 Crystal Ball - Intel's Atom might win the ARMs race</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355001253050</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 16:14:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting insight</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356637207862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:40:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637235898-124</Id><Topic><Title>more Intel stock being shorted.</Title><Username>luvinitallwu</Username><Timestamp>1356633533981</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 13:38:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor Waldo, he is correct in one regard, he's beyond fixing.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1356637235898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:40:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637239965-125</Id><Topic><Title>ISLAND REVERSAL</Title><Username>cdhscottsdale</Username><Timestamp>1148072843000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2006-05-19 17:07:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i love then island reversals. if i buy today will i get the divident? tia</Msg><Username>divident_man</Username><Timestamp>1356637239965</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:40:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637469428-126</Id><Topic><Title>The problem with TSMC's 20nm process is they have given up performance</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1354999345477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 15:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile Intel is improving performance while lowering power with 14nm</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356637469428</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:44:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356637600394-127</Id><Topic><Title>Can Intel save Apple from the LTE mess?</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1354898251361</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:37:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There could be a big opportunity for Intel to capture more of the baseband market.

It worked very closely with Acer on bringing the W510, W700 and S7 to market. With Haswell, Intel will work even closer with its partners - going as far as to specify other, non-Intel components on the motherboard in pursuit of ultimate battery life. The pieces are beginning to fall into place, and if all goes according to Intel's plan we should start to see the fruits of its labor next year. The goal is to bring Core down to very low power levels, and to take Atom even lower. Don't underestimate the significance of Intel's 10W Ivy Bridge announcement. Although desktop and mobile Haswell will appear in mid to late Q2-2013, the exciting ultra mobile parts won't arrive until Q3. Intel's 10W Ivy Bridge will be responsible for at least bringing some more exciting form factors to market between now and then. While we're not exactly at Core-in-an-iPad level of integration, we are getting very close. To kick off what is bound to be an exciting year, Intel made a couple of stops around the country showing off that even its existing architectures are quite power efficient. Intel carried around a pair of Windows tablets, wired up to measure power consumption at both the device and component level, to demonstrate what many of you will find obvious at this point: that Intel's 32nm Clover Trail is more power efficient than NVIDIA's Tegra 3."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356653039573</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 19:03:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356653123787-151</Id><Topic><Title>The x86 Power Myth Busted: In-Depth Clover Trail Power Analysis</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1356650441237</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 18:20:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Intel's 32nm Clover Trail is more power efficient than NVIDIA's Tegra 3."

As we've mentioned in both our Medfield and Clover Trail reviews: the x86 power myth has been busted. The good news is Microsoft is already engaged with Surface Pro.

Intel claimed its latest tablet SoC outperforms the Nvidia Tegra 3 while consuming less power. On another mobile front, the x86 giant will show Haswell Ultrabooks at the Consumer Electronics Show and discuss a sub-10W variant. Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3." Intel compared a Windows 8 tablet using Clover Trail with a Microsoft Surface tablet running Windows RT on Tegra 3. The systems were hooked up to meters measuring consumption on the processors’ power rails on a variety of jobs. The Nvidia chip uses four main and one helper core. Brookwood said Windows RT does not use the helper core as extensively as Android. Intel did not show Clover Trail’s performance running Android. In the second half of 2013, Intel will roll out Bay Trail which is expected to use the first out-of-order Atom cores to bolster performance. It will also roll out Haswell, a new 22nm PC processor geared for a variety of systems including ultrabooks. Intel “hasn’t given up on Ultrabooks by any means,” despite sluggish market uptake to date, said Brookwood. “They are convinced ultrabooks represent a journey,” Brookwood said. “They haven’t been able to quite deliver all the features and form factors they wanted to yet, but they think Haswell will give them the muscle they need” and better than all-day battery life, he added. Intel is expected to show at CES a reference design using a Haswell chip that consumes less than 10W and fits into an Ultrabook as thin as an Apple iPad. Separately, Intel demoed its Medfield chip running in Android smartphones, outperforming Qualcomm and Nvidia chips in some cases while having similar battery life. “The problem Intel faces is they have no hope of the U.S. market due to their lack of LTE support--that forces them to focus just on Asia and Europe,” he said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356661287053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:21:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356662480498-164</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's new smart watch is beginning of wearable devices</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356643203089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 16:20:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I figured as much but never saw confirmation and this is still just a rumor.

In July, IDC figured that worldwide semiconductor sales this year would increase by 4.6%, but that growth forecast is being toned down to less than 1% at $304 billion. Next year's sales are expected to gain 4.9% to $319 billion, also lower than its previous prediction of 6.2% growth in 2013. Two of the main culprits to the revision are tough macroeconomic conditions and a struggling PC market. A couple other headwinds include the political dysfunction we like to call the fiscal cliff, as well as decelerating growth in China. Still, it ain't all bad in the semiconductor market. Shocker: IDC expects that smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes will be the main growth drivers within the semiconductor in the next few years. Wait, that might not be a shocker, but it's great news for Qualcomm . Specifically, IDC analyst Mali Venkatesan believes "high-end smartphone demand in developed countries" will remain healthy and developing markets will see continued smartphone adoption amid the shift to 3G data networks. The mobile chip giant took home a 48.1% revenue share of smartphone applications processors in the second quarter. When you combine that with the 51% market share it boasts in the baseband modem market, investors will see there are plenty of ways for Qualcomm to play the smartphone boom. Intel's mobile ambitions are panning out quite differently. While the company enjoys a No. 3 spot with 12% of the baseband market thanks to its acquisition of Infineon years ago, it only collected a minuscule 0.2% share of smartphone processors. All of this is even before you consider Qualcomm's licensing business, which will also benefit from the shift to 3G in emerging markets. The U.S. is quickly transitioning to 4G LTE, but the rest of the world is still in the midst of moving to 3G data connections.</Msg><Username>intciscrud</Username><Timestamp>1356663717405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:01:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356664408774-168</Id><Topic><Title>clover trail dominates and ultrabooks as thin as ipads</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356661287053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:21:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"In the second half of 2013, Intel will roll out Bay Trail which is expected to use the first out-of-order Atom cores to bolster performance."
