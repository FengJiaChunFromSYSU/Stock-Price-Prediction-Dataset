From industrial machines that are increasingly connected to the internet to the smallest battery powered devices, from traditional PCs to ultrabooks, and from high performance servers to microservers, storage, and networking equipment, we now compete wherever there is computing. At the same time, we’ve put more distance between us and the rest of the semiconductor industry than ever before. In the first quarter, we shipped our 100 millionth 22 nanometer processor, using our revolutionary 3D transistor technology, while the rest of the industry works to ship its first unit. This leadership in materials science and manufacturing technology is the foundation on which our future success will be based, arming us the world’s lowest power and lowest cost transistors. ...as we begin to transition to 14 nanometer technology later this year, our architectural and [processor] technology investments and innovations will become increasingly apparent and valuable for our customers, and to the market. The company’s core architectural and manufacturing strength have never been more valuable, and the opportunity presented by the evolution and expansion of the computing industry has never been greater. It’s for those reasons that I’m confident that Intel will continue to invent, grow, thrive, and deliver the best technology to a world increasingly hungry for the products of the microprocessor revolution.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366171982041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 00:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366172244736-6</Id><Title>Q1 2013 Earnings: CFO Remarks: PCs and Servers</Title><Msg>Return to Growth: PC Client Group In the second quarter, we will launch Haswell, enabling a new wave of ultra-sleek designs across multiple form factors by our customers.

Server/Data Center Growth Moving to the data center group, data center group revenue in the first quarter grew 7% from a year ago. On a year on year basis, we saw significant growth in both the cloud and high-performance computing segments of the market. At IDF Beijing last week, we announced that our next-generation Atom processor for the microserver segment of the market, code named Avoton, and our Ivy Bridge product for Xeon [cloud] servers, will be shipping in the second half.

Increased demand from our customers allowed us to increase production of Haswell products prior to qualification for sale. The result of this was a higher than anticipated inventory writeoff, which we expect to get back throughout the rest of the year as the product is expected to qualify for sale in the second quarter. Faster Move to 14nm Prodution In addition, we saw higher than expected excess capacity charges in older generation process technologies. We are taking advantage of the excess capacity on older generation process technologies to take capacity offline and reuse more equipment and space for 14 nanometer and beyond. Reduced CapEx, Further Reduction in Inventories and Better Margins in Q2 The results of these actions allow us to lower our capital spending forecast for the year by $1 billion, down to $12 billion. In addition, our inventories decreased almost $400 million from the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 2 points to 58%, and the gross margin forecast for the year remains 60%, with gross margins in the second half back into the low 60s.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366172811564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 00:26:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366172998823-11</Id><Title>Q1 2013 Earnings: CFO Remarks: Manufacturing</Title><Msg>As Paul said, our manufacturing leadership is extending, and gives us the world’s lowest cost and lowest power transistors.

And as I look forward across the year, the prediction right now is we’re going to run at a healthy rate of utilization. In fact, we’re starting the quarter at that utilization rate. I think inventories will continue to be healthy. Foundry I’ve described the strategy before as a crawl, walk, run strategy. We’re past crawling. We’re in the mode of collecting serious customers. The design win activity leads the announcement activity, as you’d expect in this business, and there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly announced.

Gartner would call those ultramobile devices, so things like ultrabooks, detachables, convertibles. We’re seeing robust growth there. And then we’re now participating across a broad range of tablets between Windows 8 and Android. And with Bay Trail coming out and Merrifield behind that, we start to participate in a much broader set of screen sizes and price points than we are today. [Just some of the reasons that IDC can't keep up...] Reasons for Optimism in the Second Half I had a third thing, Chris, which I think is as the OEMs start looking at new form factors that they can design around our new chips, Haswell in particular, and maybe Bay Trail, and Windows 8, enabling touch, the explosion in form factors and the competitiveness of that platform is going to be substantially different, at price points down into the $300 to $400 range enabling touch. We didn’t have that last year. So you go into the prime selling season with new products, new technologies, new form factors, and new capabilities that, up to now, were unapproachable price points.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366173992934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 00:46:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366174478117-15</Id><Title>Q1 2013 Earnings: Q&amp;A: Covello Gets Weird</Title><Msg>Covello tried a gotcha remark in a comparison to the first year after the financial meltdown and got called on it by Stacy Smith: Stacy Smith I think if you do any quarter compare, capital spending tends to be over a long period of time. So if you look at it on an annual basis, what we’re forecasting for this year is kind of down a little bit on a percent of revenue relative to what we spent in ’10, ’11, and ’12. 2009 is a weird comparison point, because you’re in the aftermath of the financial meltdown, and as we disclosed to you at that time, that gave us the ability to roll forward entire factories full of equipment from one process generation to the next.

Stacy Smith And I’d say the big change over the last 12 months there is that Bay Trail is going to be a great product in that segment of the market.

According to company figures, a single HMC offers a 15x performance increase and uses 70 percent less energy per bit when compared to DDR3 memory, and takes up 90 percent less space than today's RDIMMs. The Cube is also scalable per application, which is not possible with DDR3 and DDR4. System designers have the option of employing the HMC as near memory for best performance or in a scalable module form factor, as far memory, for optimum power efficiency. This is a huge leap forward from a technology perspective, noted Graham, compared to DDRx and other boutique memory products that are out there. As HPCwire editor Michael Feldman explained in an earlier review of the technology: The speedup and better energy efficiency is achieved principally through parallelism. Because the memory chips are stacked, there is more space for I/O pins through the TSVs. Thus each DRAM can be accessed with more (and/or wider) channels. The end result is that the controller can access many more banks of memory concurrently than can be accomplished with a two-dimensional DIMM. And because the controller and DRAM chips are in close proximity, latencies can be extremely low.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366177119580</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 01:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366196055426-22</Id><Title>Continuing to maintain a hedged position</Title><Msg>Not clear to me if the company missed the analysts target, some places showed 40 where elsewhere showed 41.

He came across pretty confident with his familiarity with Intel's business and numbers. I also felt that Otellini was intentionally taking a backseat to Stacy Smith letting him do quite a bit of the talking. It is also possible for the Intel board to split the President and CEO roles. Stacy being named the CEO with a President who can spearhead mobility and assist Stacy. If they don't split the roles, they can look at finding someone for the COO slot.Though Brian Krzanich (current COO) may be a very capable person, he doesn't come across as a person interested in being one of visible outside faces of Intel.

Much better than your 55 cent quotes from yesterday. The Intel Q1/2013 top line was also lower than last year but higher than what analysts expected. Intel reiterated their single digit increase for revenue and profit forecast for 2012. Unchanged. Intel will do better than the market does for a few weeks. Intel product introductions, buybacks, short covering, buying interest will be mild positives. IMO, Intel will never see $18 again unless the overall market drops by the same 20%. Intel has a close correlation with the general market and tracks it closely.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366205903162</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366205908448-44</Id><Topic><Title>22.48 at the Moment</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366142865362</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ouch</Msg><Username>fatpiggyoinkoink</Username><Timestamp>1366205908448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:38:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366205917819-45</Id><Topic><Title>So Intel spends billions and billions on new fabs each year</Title><Username>stjdavis7</Username><Timestamp>1366166776809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:46:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>one of your more idiotic posts. how much is this dog up since 2010 when you loved it, as usual at 24, since 2004 when it was 34.00. keep pumping waldo</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1366205917819</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:38:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366205997244-46</Id><Title>Will Walmart Wally call the SEC again on this poor reaction to Intel ??</Title><Msg>The 29 to 21 dream team is confused.

The International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS) is being held April 14-18, 2013 at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Resort &amp; Spa in Monterey, CA. At IRPS, Intel will present new research in a paper titled “Self-heat Reliability Considerations on Intel’s 22nm Tri-Gate Technology.” This work elaborates on various measurements to observe self-heating as well as the associated reliability implications, not only in the transistors, but the overlying metal lines. “The self-heating of the finFET can locally increase the temperature in the metal wires above, enhancing electromigration effects,” Larosa said.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366223936119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:38:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366224183353-152</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is widening the gap</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366223936119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not only in the transistors, but the overlying metal lines.

Along with this the company said that it would keep an eye on the metric and reduce it if demand in the PC market declined at a faster rate than it had estimated. A large swathe of the company’s capital expenditure is being put to use repurposing factories in order to allow use of its new 14 nanometer manufacturing process.

By Rachel King for Between the Lines | April 17, 2013 Intel is in the process of acquiring Mashery, a provider of API technology and services, according to a new report. ReadWrite reported on Wednesday that the unit will be merged with Intel's Services unit. The deal also appears to be extremely fresh given that ReadWrite also noted that the San Francisco-based company's employes were notified of the merger via email this morning. Some of them could be staying on with Intel, but it doesn't look likely that will be the case for everyone. Financial terms of the deal haven't been revealed yet, but it is expected to close during the second quarter of 2013. Aimed toward business and IT managers as well as developers, Mashery produces a number of solutions designed for deploying and managing APIs while offering bundled tools that report back about performance and business. According to the private company's website, Mashery has worked with over 170 brands to power approximately 44,000 active applications created by roughly 200,000 developers. Some tech-related examples include Comcast, Klout, Rdio, and Travelocity. It would make an interesting purchase for the microprocessor giant, which just revealed its new strategy for cloud–based networking centered around software-defined datacenters. Of course, that's more from the hardware perspective, so the addition of Mashery's portfolio ties up more ends on the software level. We pinged Intel for confirmation, and we'll update this post as soon as we hear back. zdnetDOTcom/intel-reportedly-buying-on-demand-api-builder-mashery-7000014173/</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366230684564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:31:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366231057854-189</Id><Topic><Title>How many trading days left until ...</Title><Username>jimbo_homegamed_u</Username><Timestamp>1302902388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-04-15 17:19:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wallis Weaver Day?

As we have stated many times before 1 chip Haswell has BGA packaging packed with SoC that integrates a Haswell CPU as well as Lynx Point LP PCH chipset inside. The SoC packaging leads to lower production costs, power footprint and lower TDP, everything that you need in order to drive the SoC price down. We remembered Dave Orton, the former CEO of a company acquired by AMD that went by the name of ATI, explaining the importance of APUs and SoCs. The explanation is rather simple, the more you integrate the cheaper the chip ends up, the fewer pins you have and theoretically you can make more money. This conversation happened in the summer of 2007, roughly a year after AMD acquired ATI and announced its plans to produce Fusion APUs. Since the top ARM chips such as Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 / 600 and Tegra 4 have multiple cores, chipset elements and graphics all on the same package, it was only natural for Intel to take the same approach with Haswell. Qualcomm, Nvidia and Intel are after the same market, tablets, notebooks, convertibles with a slight advantage that Intel has X86 and the other two don’t. Let's not forget that Haswell 1- chip is much bigger than any ARM based top performers, but at the same time Haswell brings a lot more performance. Despite billions of transistors and 22nm SoC design tablets and Ultrabooks based on 1-chip Haswell or Haswell-ULT how some call it, you can expect 8- to 10-hour battery from products based on this Y processor line chips. This is a respectable score for PC like performance and having a scenario design power (SDP) typical expected TDP at 7.5W these products come close to the top ARM performers that have 5+W TDP. Intel stresses that these chips won't simply land in tablets and Ultrabooks. It plans to use them in detachable, foldable and similar designs.

They've begun insisting that price point is the driver of PC's. Actually, the PC should be selected for the application. Some people want lower power usage while others want to maintain performance. Also, a PC can run applications without being connected to the internet and this is the PC versus the Thin Client. Then they fully support Windows 8 instead of saying that Win 8 is for touch screens only. In fact the current results of MS are largely due to companies upgrading from XP to Win 7.

Why do you need that much capacity when units are at the same levels as then? However, this quarter, Intel's PC client group saw $8 Billion in sales. In Q2 of 2009, Intel's total quarterly sales in all groups combined was $8.0 Billion. So how can unit sales be the same as back then?

But they could at least be on the cutting edge of performance by doing a deal with Intel instead of trying to eek out an existence on ARM's pitifully fading fabrication.

In Feb, Apple Vice Chief executive Erik Huggers verified that the organization is operating on both the components and the assistance for a release sometime in 2013. But can Apple really make a product that could task what current satellite tv and wire suppliers have, along with set-top bins such as Windows System 360? A new review from Ad Age indicates that the response to that question could be, "Yes." The review, depending on un-named resources who have been among the few to test the assistance, statements that Intel's system will not have the common "clunky" development lines UI we see in other wire TV alternatives. It will also have a cloud-based DVR, a way to view content on pills, mobile phones and other displays and more. As far as the components, the review statements that the handy handheld control will be much much easier to use than others that function many control buttons. The set-top box is said to be amazing in design, complete with a front-facing photographic camera. It's even assume to learn what TV reveals a person timepieces so it can suggest new ones. The outcome, according to the people who have seen the assistance, is one that is a "significant enhance over any current satellite tv or wire system." That could magic trouble for Ms, which has been switching its System 360 gaming system into more of an enjoyment multi-media box in the past svereal years. Ms just declared this week it was promoting its Mediaroom IPTV assistance to Ericsson. Yusuf Mehdi, business v. p. of marketing, technique and company for Windows Entertaining Entertainment Business, said this will allow the company "to make 100 percent of its concentrate on customer TV technique with System."

APPL, which even with the drop has outperformed INTC quite dramatically has faced what many tech stocks do, ie competition in a world where at some point there is market saturation. Waldo should know this, as it has been a significant part of the reason INTC was 34. 00 in 2004 and is a whopping i'll call it 22.00 now, a glut of pc's in a mobile market, then a glut in the tablet market, ie the Crus discount from 42.00 to 18.00 due to a glut of chips in supply, but never fear, oversold stocks usually bounce, even though they may NEVER, fully recover. Waldo knows very little about anything that isn't chip geek related. safety in dividends, hah, horsefeathers. on April 11, 20013, a certain world leading company was about 39.00 a share, the annual dividend, 1.70, think INTC yield over 4, today the stock hit 32 and change for a drop of close to 20 percent with a yield now over 5 percent, that's hardly protection, similar scenario for energy trusts here in 2013 as oil collapsed with the rise in the dollar. 2013 Waldo, dividend protection, totally meaningless and as useful as Waldo's call for INTC at 30 when it was 29.00. The now oversold stock that was 39.00, now 32.and change, a new 52 week low. what, pray tell happens, if all the money INTC has been spending goes for improvements goes for naught and gets unused? Waldo never considers the downside, it's always a strong buy for INTC 100 percent of the time as he comfortably sits with INTC still below his prescient call in 2010 for INTC as a great buy at 24.00 right before it topped out there and dropped to 17. One wonders, will waldo even make any money on his ARMH puts given his deplorable track record of booking, or in his case, not booking, profits.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1366251243943</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 22:14:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366251646025-235</Id><Topic><Title>Apple</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366240181031</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 19:09:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do understand that you spend every day and every night worrying about someone that has no bearing on where you will go in this life, don't you?</Msg><Username>aintezbeinred</Username><Timestamp>1366251646025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 22:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366252482215-236</Id><Title>Upgrades and PT increases will continue throughout the year</Title><Msg>Q2 estimate currently stands at $0.40, but intel just projected $12.9 billion and 58% GM; so EPS should be around $0.44.
