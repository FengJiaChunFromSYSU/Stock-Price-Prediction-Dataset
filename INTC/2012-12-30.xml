Since it gets extremely difficult below 25nm, what if TSMC can never do 20nm and have to go to FinFet, which will take them 4 years at least. Think about it. Everyone is assuming 20nm can be done..

Over the years, our capitalist system has devolved and been constantly exploited by the few at the expense of our common good. One is the area of wealth concentration. At no time since just prior to the great depression has wealth concentration in this country been the highest, for example: In the 22 years between 1976 and 1998, the share of the nation's private wealth held by the top 1% nearly doubled, going from 20% to 39%. In 1982 the wealthiest 400 individuals in the “Forbes 400” owned $92 billion. By 2000, their wealth had increased to over $1.2 trillion. Since 1987, the adjusted gross income or AGI of the top 1% has risen 386% while their share of total tax burden has risen 53%. With wealth concentration, inevitably comes concentration of power. As evidenced by the gridlock in Congress, people today feel totally powerless against the rich and corporations, which the Supreme Court has regrettably now bestowed the same rights as an individual. As a nation, shouldn't we be concerned more about developing the next generation of millionaires rather than preserving the wealth of current millionaires? The stock market is no longer about investment but traders focus on how their co-ordinated efforts can be used to manipulate share prices, currencies, or interest rates to their advantage. The exchanges have sold out to the holy god of high frequency trading which has resulted in the SP500 going nowhere over the past 5 years despite the combined earnings of the companies in the SP500 growing 45%. The primary rationale of investing in stocks was to benefit in the success of a company, but high frequency trading steals the wealth these companies create away from the shareholders to the investment firms running these programs. Once again enriching the few at the expense of the many. If the SP500 index had just grown at the same rate as earnings of the SP500 firms over the past 5 years, shareholders would be $4 trillion richer. The ability to manipulate investment markets ranging from equities to the LIBOR has lead to widespread corruption. Hardly a week goes by, without word of a large fine against a major investment house. Over the past 40 years, there have been 7 financial scandals that have cost this nation trillions of dollars, yet very few have paid for their roles in these scandals. On a number of accounts, corporations are also not blameless either for our current plight. The dividend yield of the SP500 was fallen from 4.2% from 1970 to 1990 to average under 2% during the past ten years. While many executives believe they can get a better return for their shareholders by reinvesting profits back into their companies rather that paying dividends, this practice is defeated by high frequency trading that suppresses share prices, effectively transferring the wealth corporations create to Wall Street. Non-financial corporations, now hold a record $1.7 trillion on their balance sheets, but this capital is providing little return for shareholders and some firms primarily use it as a war chest for acquisitions. While I see nothing wrong with non-organic growth, a Goldman-Sachs study found that only 30% of all acquisitions between 2000-09 met the goals of the acquiring firm. Corporations warn Washington about high corporate taxes, but a growing number of firms such as Seagate, Apple, and Google, set up shop in such countries as Bermuda, Ireland, and the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes. So while our angst is focused on the dysfunctional Congress, there are primary forces beyond politics that are driving our current plight. We have met the enemy and they is us!</Msg><Username>p_is_for_profits</Username><Timestamp>1356885253315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 11:34:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356885919983-47</Id><Topic><Title>LET'S CLEAN UP THIS FORUM NOW!!!</Title><Username>cdhscottsdale</Username><Timestamp>1220630158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2008-09-05 11:55:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can we add Wally to the list.

There is also a terrible trend in ARM ramps. There is an excellent graph and I will try to post up the link to it. It shows that ARM foundry revenues are constantly shrinking with each new process as a percentage of total revenues in each of the first three years after introduction. Intel as we know is not suffering from this ramp problem as evidenced by how rapidly Intel has ramped 22nm production as a percentage of revenue. So, 20nm planar is shaping up as a disaster and 14/16nm is so far out that it can be totally discounted for at least a couple of years. And each and every new ARM generation is going to take longer and cost more to ramp. This will be the year that ARM will no longer be able to hide these facts. ] 1.) ARMs fabrication roadmap is in serious trouble. Enough that they are seriously contemplating an almost impossible jump of two process levels to 14/16nm FinFET due to the marginal returns that would result from a complex and expensive move to planar 20nm. 2.) Intel can move into major foundry work while maintaining reasonable margins and dramatically improving the bottom line and EPS. 3.) Intel can move into major mobility market share while maintaining reasonable margins and dramatically improving the bottom line and EPS. 4.) Intel has a dramatic roapmap for 2013 and we will be hearing a lot more details at CES in January and at the World Mobile Congress in February. 5.) Intel will be making major tablet and smartphone inroads in 2013 with LTE smartphones coming to the US early in the year. 6.) Intel's superior technology,fabrication, manufacturing and capacity will lead to some major industry-changing deals in 2013. 7.) Intel is preparing to take the lead in the power efficiency race in 2013 while continuing its significant lead in performance. 8.) Intel is going to have some major surprises and developments for us in 2013, particularly in the area of entertainment. "Intel’s relationship with Delivery Agent adds to the growing offerings of premium HD content from Intel Insider-enabled services, including Best Buy CinemaNow*, Hungama Digital Media*and WB* Shop." Delivery Agent is the leader in multi-channel commerce for the largest global media companies and an Intel Capital portfolio company. 9.) 2013 will be a watershed year for Intel in terms of traction for its mobility strategic plan. 10.) The fiscal cliff market adjustment represents a great opening to build or add to an Intel position.

Since then Intel’s consumer lines have included microscopes, video cameras, digital cameras, a digital music player, an ill-fated video-conferencing product called Pro-Share, TV chips, liquid crystal on silicon displays, the Viiv consumer chip initiative for handling DVDs, photos and video. All have failed. Moreover, a couple of Intel sallies into the ASIC business both failed quickly. Furthermore, Intel’s NOR flash memory operation was losing $300 million a quarter last year and Intel is still trying to get rid of it via the joint venture with STMicroelectronics called Numonyx.. And then there are Intel’s attempts to get into communications chip markets. At the turn of the millenium, 1999-2001, Intel spent some $10 billion acquiring telecommunications chip companies at the height of their valuations. But Intel’s attempt to make and market these chips ended ignominiously with the sale of the mobile chip operation to Marvell for $600 million. One can easily see why Intel wants to have another go at the mobile phone and consumer chip business. The PC business is commoditising, and the mobile telecoms and consumer businesses are the next biggest chip markets. It’s as simple as that.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356903181063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:33:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356903267101-77</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's issues</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356903181063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:33:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, after the electronics industry’s harsh experience with Intel’s de facto monopoly in PC processors, the industry has been very reluctant to accept Intel as a supplier of mobile phone or consumer chips. Industry analysts report that the fear of allowing another Wintel-style monopoly prevents Intel selling chips into other sectors. Even Intel’s association with a technology affects adversely that technology’s chances of getting accepted. A chip industry CEO said recently that the biggest brake on Wimax’s deployment is Intel’s championing of Wimax. It Intel’s involved, steer clear, seems to be the industry's message. So the downside of Intel’s success in having its architecture adopted by the IBM PC, and so becoming the worldwide PC processor standard, is that Intel’s behaviour in the PC sector has led to doors being shut to it in other sectors. And, maybe, there’s another downside. The skills required for managing a monopoly, don’t fit you for fighting in a competitive marketplace.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356903267101</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:34:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356903603617-78</Id><Title>QCOM/AAPL/SAMSUNG will start price war with ARM chips against Intel in 2013 , Intel Single digit stock Target will be met</Title><Msg>Intel Processor Monopoly is busted must compete in $30 SOC's in the future and SERVER processors come under attack in 2013 too......... and Management buying back stock with Billions in DEBT very bad for shareholders</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1356903603617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:40:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356904023911-79</Id><Topic><Title>What We Know Now: 2013 Will Be the Year of the Full-Blown ARM Fabrication Crisis</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356899711887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 15:35:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have learned so much. thanks !

ARM is getting more competition than expected while AMD still having no presence at all in this sector. Article found at SlashGear: Intel Redhookbay benchmarks surface, show dual-core Merrifield processor Brittany Hillen, Dec 29th 2012 This year, Intel launched its Medfield Atom processor in a big push to enter the smartphone market. The processor was lacking when compared to the competition, however, and a leaked roadmap image appeared soon after showing the processor’s successor: the dual-core Merrifield. Now a benchmark has surfaced of Intel’s “Redhookbay,” which shows it equipped with the new processor. Redhookbay is shown as running Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, with a 1280 x 720 resolution display and the multi-core Merrifield, which scored 31,612 on AnTuTu benchmark. The processor is between 1.6GHz and 2GHz. The reported GPU is a PowerVR SGX 544MP. Unlike the Medfield, Merrifield offers 4G LTE support. This coincides with a piece over at Digitimes claiming that Intel will announce a smartphone platform and Atom processors at the 2013 Mobile World Congress, which is taking place in Spain in February. The sources in the article state what we already know: that Intel’s Medfield tanked because it was under-powered compared to its competition. According to the unnamed source, Intel probably won’t release its own branded smartphones “because it does not have close relationships with mobile telecom carriers.” It is possible we’ll see Intel pair up with telecoms in India and China and other similar markets, however, to release enter-level handsets. Still, the company faces pretty stiff competition.</Msg><Username>rehsab33</Username><Timestamp>1356904352558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:52:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356904470690-83</Id><Topic><Title>What We Know Now: 2013 Will Be the Year of the Full-Blown ARM Fabrication Crisis</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356899711887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 15:35:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was at Verizon all day and everyone was asking for the 22 nm chips !

For the past year or so, Intel has also quietly been working on a top-secret set-top box that could not only be better than what Apple, Google, and even Microsoft offer today, but also kill the cable industry as we know it. This set-top box, said by industry insiders to be available to a limited beta of customers in March, will offer cable channels delivered “over the top” to televisions anywhere there is an Internet connection regardless of provider. (Microsoft Mediaroom, for example, requires AT&amp;T’s service, and Xbox has limited offerings for Comcast and FiOS customers). For the first time, consumers will be able to subscribe to content per channel, unlikebundled cable services, and if Intel has its way you may be able to subscribe per show. Intel’s set-top box will also have access to Intel’s already existing app marketplace for apps, casual games, and video on demand. Leveraging the speed of current broadband, and the vast shared resources of the cloud, Intel plans to give customers the ability to use “Cloud DVR”, a feature intended to allow users to watch any past TV show at any time, without the need to record it ahead of time, pause live tv, and rewind shows in progress. Intel had hoped that GoogleTV and AppleTV would spur demand for Intel chips, but that having failed they poached much of Microsoft’s Media Room team. Much of the direction of Mediaroom came from the leadership of Jim Baldwin, who is now VP of this Intel initiative. At Microsoft, Jim demonstrated that the technology to enable customers to watch TV over the internet using any device was feasible, but content licensing, the goals of ISP’s and bandwidth limitations previously stood in the way. “In creating Mediaroom, we brought together key emerging technologies to create the world’s most modern television system: better video compression, higher access network bandwidth, lower cost single-chip devices, cloud computing; and added to it some great software to make it all work together seamlessly with a great user experience. Our goal was to provide technology to operators that will continue to delight consumers as the world of internet-delivered content unfolds.” According to an Intel job posting, Jim joined Microsoft in 1997 as a part of the WebTV acquisition, and Jim has been a key architect of digital video technology for various products including the WebTV Plus, Echostar Dishplayer, DirecTV UltimateTV and Microsoft TV. Along with hiring the the right key players with the expertise needed to develop a revolutionary set-top box, Intel also has the technology to create a product unlike its competitors. Intel has been providing chips for set top boxes since the days of Akimbo, which had a similar vision as far back as 2005. Back then, though, no one had digital rights to content – and up until now, no one wanted to risk unbundling the channels. This is clearly the biggest barrier for Intel – but since Intel is used to betting billions on chip design, it has allocated a budget significantly larger than Apple or Google’s. While Silicon Valley measures investments in tens of millions, Hollywood often drops more than $100 million into a single movie. Intel came to the table knowing this, and so was able to negotiate the licensing agreements with Hollywood that other tech giants have never been able to. Intel has made it clear to Hollywood they are serious about this product and dedicated to its longevity, prepared to invest heavily in making it a success. In contrast, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have always viewed Hollywood as something of a hobby. (Steve Jobs even said as much of Apple TV). As Intel has approached Hollywood with much more dedication (and dollars), this is likely the single reason that Intel, more than any company before it, has the potential to really bring to consumers the things we have never seen in online content before, such as live sports, release schedules that match broadcast, and first episode through current libraries for video on demand. Intel is scheduled to hold a press event at CES, but consumers and media shouldn’t hold their breath to see or hear much information about this product. Industry insiders say a working demo is scheduled to be ready for CES, but likely only for limited demos.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356906689967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:31:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356906827064-91</Id><Topic><Title>aintezbeingreen</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356906584073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:29:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>aintezbeingreen = aintezbeingreen luvinitallwu - Ignore</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356906827064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:33:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356907000704-92</Id><Topic><Title>What We Know Now: 2013 Will Be the Year of the Full-Blown ARM Fabrication Crisis</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356899711887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 15:35:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What went down?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356907000704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:36:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356907166627-93</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM/AAPL/SAMSUNG will start price war with ARM chips against Intel in 2013 , Intel Single digit stock Target will be met</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1356903603617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:40:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>singhlion2001_Fudd singhlion2001 - Ignore Repeating prior stupdity.

The fall for previous shareholders is an opportunity for new investors. The opportunity comes from investors who are not paying attention to the long-term theme. The long-term theme is a company that took a few arrows recently, but is in great shape to exploit new markets. It's a huge mistake to discount the ability of Intel to adapt to and dominate new markets. New markets include increased use of smart devices — and I don't limit devices to smartphones. Expect everything we touch to become smart or smarter. Cars, homes, TVs, other appliances, and more will increasingly come together. Will everything, including the family pet, have an Intel chip by the end of 2013? Probably not, but Intel will pay you a fat yield of 4.4 percent while you wait. Not only is the dividend relatively safe, the payout ratio is low enough that investors can expect an increase as earnings grow. In the last 52 weeks, the shares are about even with a small gain of 1.8 percent. Intel has an average analyst target price of $23.14. Not everyone buys into an up and coming Intel in 2013. Short interest is over 4 percent even though it's expensive to hold a short position. Intel has reached bargain-level pricing and shorts who don't cover soon may wish they had. J.

Intel plans to include voice control as the part of Shark Bay Ultrabook recommended features. Touch screen is definitely a part the Ultrabook spec in 2013, as well as all day battery life (8+ hours). Intel also underlines that it wants to get fresh data for the whole weeks in connected standby and the baseline spec includes fast wake from S3 or S4 standby. Furthermore Intel expects that some of the top ultrabooks in priced over $800 to see responsive voice commands. This is going to be a combination of software and hardware and we are not sure if Intel plans to supply both. Shark Bay Ultrabook 2.0 recommended features also include innovative form factors including convertible models with full HD displays, standalone SSD, always connected WWAN, facial recognition, vPro for corporate and Microsoft Windows 8 connected stand by. Ultrabook definitely looks to be getting more features at the same money...

In fact, it looks like the company is working on its foundry project pretty hard already. Moreover, the company’s Custom Foundry division might have signed more contracts already than anyone could expect it to. In addition to Achronix, Netronome and Tabula, Intel may well have loads of unannounced or pending foundry customers. “I would be a foundry for strategic relationships and not to enable our competitors. […] We are running a small foundry business, we are building up our capabilities and do not want to compete directly with TSMC, that is not our business model. For the right types of products and not to enable my competitors, I would certainly consider [making chips for others]. There is a lot of stuff in the pipeline,” said Paul Otellini, chief executive officer of Intel, at Sanford Bernstein technology conference recently. Apparently, Intel Custom Foundry has much more customers than anyone would think. Moreover, at least some of those customers are already manufacturing their products at other contract makers of semiconductors.
