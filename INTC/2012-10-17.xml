Releasing a new product such as windows 8 doesn't mean computer sells will pick up. They sound stupid saying that it will. If I bought a computer today, it would only cost me $50.00 to upgrade to windows 8. The new "Pad" style of computer will keep taking away from computer companies bottom line. The whole samsung chip/Apple stuff made me short the stock before earnings. Losing money is terrible, and I'm sorry for those of you that traded on that headline. I believe most of you saying otherwise about this stock it's because you're stuck in major losses from it. There is no reason to buy this company with the results they are producing. Dell/HPQ the guys that pay them to put the chips in their computers; their profit warnings should of tipped some of you off to sell. This is all my own view point don't invest off of my information.</Msg><Username>pv.miller</Username><Timestamp>1350446446846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350446463642-2</Id><Topic><Title>Over 120,000,000 shares all selling at the same time tomorrow</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1350444196288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love buying INTC on the dips.

Cash flow yield is nonexistent in many and it will go negative (see Scamazon). In contrast, Intel's competitive position will only improve in a downturn that shakes out weaker players. It is why the BEST companies in the world have been holding cash, to deploy strategically when asset prices correct, rather than spending like drunken sailors at Amazon on value destroying, strategically misguided "invesments".

Anyone who sells tomorrow at any big gap down is an idiot selling under a forced situation totally unfree like a woman RAPED. Plain and simple. Reject Rape always. Never sell then. If you want to sell Intel wait to see a rally to 2sd even if it goes to 20 first (2sd will still be ultimately higher than the low tomorrow because the low is near if not already established). The stock is so oversold for months now. You will be selling a crashed stock that has proven the idiots that the earnings were better than they expected and will do the same next quarter during which we will have clear signs the situation is improving. So expect 25+ by the end of this year even if they try to scare you more here. And expect a massive market rally once Obama is re-elected and if congress or senate republicans lose some edge. A super tsunami of buying. Intel is always able to deliver even in the worse cases as it proved just now. And we are about to believe the #$%$ idiots that were fine with a 50c prediction here??? A company that adds 3 bil $ of cash every quarter or 2$ book value each year doesnt deserve to be year after year in lower levels regardless of the #$%$ earning projections of the same #$%$ that were nowhere to suggest a buy at 19-20 last year or here or to tell you to hedge over 28-29 this year. Of course they will also fail to tell you to buy here. Who the f@K cares if the stock goes to 19 if it can also go to 30 and its 50-50 now at this oversold point. Have any of you losers looked at a long term chart of intel to recognize a massive BUY. IT IS HERE. Idiots and weak cowards sell tomorrow. If you want exit sell at rallies or be the coward these punks want you to be.

Beat EPS estimates by 10 cents. That's 20% better than expected. So they guided slightly lower than Q4 expectations. Very slightly. How many times has Apple done that? Lower the bar so that the beat looks that much better. Is Intel sales not growing? From 2 years ago, current Q3 was better than 18% growth. That's an average of about 9% annual growth rate. My bet is that Intel will come in at least at high end of Q4 guidance, which is about $14.1 Billion in revenues. That's much better than the $13.78 Billion that was expected by ANALysts.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350458209105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 03:16:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350458614391-18</Id><Topic><Title>Over 120,000,000 shares all selling at the same time tomorrow</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1350444196288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a spamming &amp;$^@&amp;#</Msg><Username>zbgb952</Username><Timestamp>1350458614391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 03:23:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350458642865-19</Id><Title>Are tablets a success?</Title><Msg>That's a big fat NO! The iPad has been successful only with the lates unit sales being about 17 million. It's a new Apple product so the success should not come as a surprise and a reason to believe tablets are a logical replacement of the PC. How are tablets doing so far. Over two years after the introduction of tablets witht he iPad release by Apple, the number two seller of tablets is Samsung with only 2.3 million unit sales. The number six seller of PC units is Acer which sold in its most recent quarter over 6 million PC units. That's almost 3 times the number two tablet seller. Does not sound like the tablet form factor with ARM based processors has had much success other than the iPad. And the 17 million quarterly sales for Apple has not dropped sales in PCs. Since the iPad's introduction, quarterly PC unit sales have actually jumped by 4 million, from 85 million units in Q3 of 2010 to 89 million units in Q3 of 2012. No evidence of cannibalization there.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350458642865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 03:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350458937274-20</Id><Topic><Title>Regarding "Silvermont Details"</Title><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1350389676128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 08:14:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The game-changer happens at 14nm because Paul is going to ramp it in 2014 only one year after Silvermont, faster than Moore's Law.

Lava in India. ZTE in China and Europe. Lenovo in China. And Orange in Europe. It will be a major player in USA after it has 4G capabilities, which will happen by year's end to 1st quarter of 2013. In tablets, we already have 20 on the way with at least 6 OEMs. And if ultrabooks were not gaining traction, why would there be over 140 models to be released in the upcoming quarters. Over a dozen being convertibles between ultrathin laptops and tablets. Companies such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others must have come to the conclusion that ultrabooks are a better bet to compete against similar Apple products rather than tablets competing against the iPad. Why? Let's say a convertible ultrabook may cost about $1200 by lenovo with an Atom processor in the screen that detaches as a tablet and an iCore Intel Processor in the keyboard section. This will replace the need to buy a 13 inch MacBook Air for $1199 and a 32 GB iPad for $599. So you're getting a similar product as the Macbook Air with a powerful $600 tablet for free. Just one example of a possibility. Many possibilites will come in time.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350459566081</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 03:39:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350459940960-23</Id><Topic><Title>Intel beat estimates by 10 cents!</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350458209105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 03:16:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is obviously a ton of negative sentiment surrounding INTC right now. It has been very disappointing seeing the stock fall from the $29 level to basically $21 especially while the DOW has been chugging higher. At it's current valuation you would think that the company was losing money hand over fist versus making billions in profits. Everyone seems to have forgotten that the company is also sitting on a mountain of cash, has virtually no debt and pays out a very solid dividend. It isn't a sexy name at all so the Street is throwing out the stock with the bathwater. It will be interesting to see how far it falls today.

Are people dumping tablets and going back to PCs? ' For a start Intel has been given an abnormally low P/E based on the notion you are pumping that PCs are dying. Well PCs are not dying, they may have been static for a quarter but that is just the pause before Windows 8 and the OEMs having low inventory because of all the new form factors Intel is throwing at them, they want to see the winners first before committing to inventory building. Intel chips are going into tablets and phones far quicker and more quickly and effectively than ARM is going into PCs and notebooks. In fact there are no ARM notebooks or PCs, their best quad-cores cannot even beat the dual-core Atoms coming down in power to greet them in tablets nevermind the quick dual-core i3 chips found in the lowest notebooks. ARM PC penetration is a myth just like I have been saying for years, if they ever approach VIA's marketshare of about 1% that would be an achievement. INTC will be $50 within 5 years, its designs are too great and its P/E too falsely undervalued for that not to be the case eventually.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350463767483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 04:49:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350463878354-26</Id><Topic><Title>Romney wins Debate #2</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1350445556813</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In between your mama legs.</Msg><Username>jerrykit50</Username><Timestamp>1350463878354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 04:51:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350464601185-27</Id><Topic><Title>Tooofunnny, Marcopubio, Singhlion and NYK20h thinking they can affect a stock price...</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350427129178</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) revenue guidance is flat 2) profits are high and stable, GMs still will be higher than Apple's for a sense of perspective in your distorted world.

Round 3 is the elimination round. And by the way Obama never lost round 1. He only lost in the eyes of inept ignorants that think what defines a winner is not integrity and logically legitimate ideas but some actor made up #$%$ macho bully crap at the cost of the truth. Then again Americans "elected" Bush twice and loved Nixon too so what do you expect from them but to elect Obama and then take out congress allowing republicans to demolish the country to undermine his presidency in order to manipulate the ignorant masses a 3rd time in 12 years and complete their mission to turn US to a banana republic plutocracy. But then again Churchill was the one that said Americans will try everything else before finally doing the right thing, you know back in the day where actually being a conservative wasnt equal to being a traitor. If this country had what it takes to move forward it would remove congress from Republicans one more time and give Obama 2 years to pass what he wants and then after 2 years destroy Obama and democrats if he didnt take it it all in the right direction. This is what a civilized society that learns from its corrupt politicians history does to correct itself and punish them for politically undermining the country in order to improve their presidency chances. Only traitors do that and we shoot traitors in war time. This is war in case you do not get it yet. Its a war with the death spiral that must be avoided at all cost. Either we make it or a revolution with real violence will take place this decade against everything powerful and corrupt.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1350467937272</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 05:58:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350468132769-33</Id><Topic><Title>Ask Yourself These Questions??</Title><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1350423403974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:36:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it won't.

You haven't been around long enough to see Intel take down all the cheap low price low power contenders who tried that approach e.g. Transmeta, Via, AMD, Cyrix, ARM (first time around) etc. If people are buying a PC which is not mobile and fixed to mains electricity they will want the best performance. If they are buying notebooks all they want is a device that will last a day just like tablets and phones. Expensive high performance x86 processors will still meet these requirements while still maintaining a clear performance advantage over their rivals which will continue to justify their price. As to this 'collapse' in profits you keep bleating on about, I remember when Intel made $2bn net quarterly profit when there were no iPads or iPhones or Galaxies around. Now it it's making 50% more, so let's keep this in some historical perspective, Intel's profits and revenue are still on a historically upward high trend. Otellini was right, this is a transition period for both Windows and x86 processors going deep into low power mobile devices. In a few years time the superiority of Intel architecture will be clear for all to see against the best 32-bit ARM technology in all power envelopes and INTC's stock price will suitable readjust to its correct long term value which is over double what it is now..</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350473242903</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 07:27:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350473307118-46</Id><Topic><Title>14nm Ramp Up meant for Apple A7 chip?</Title><Username>imbluesclues</Username><Timestamp>1350471418789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 06:56:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL?

With these mega-cap stocks, so much of their float is held by institutions that have to unload millions-upon-millions of dollars worth, so they cannot sell all of that at once. They have to slowly unload those shares over time. With many funds slowly unloading their shares (hundreds of millions of shares over an extended period of time), that is just too much mass selling for enough "value investors" to come in to stabilize the price. So the "value investors" who are pondering buying the now-cheaper shares are also having to ask themselves if they want to be the one to "catch the falling knife", and if they do buy, how long are they willing to watch the downward trend continue before they throw in the towel as well? The downward pressure should be strong for a while until a firm support level shows. Therefore, do not buy INTC for quite some time.</Msg><Username>profitgrowthfirst</Username><Timestamp>1350477611405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:40:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350477629085-78</Id><Topic><Title>Over 120,000,000 shares all selling at the same time tomorrow</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1350444196288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>T is higher</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1350477629085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350477721666-79</Id><Topic><Title>Boomers not buying anymore PCs...sorry but it's game over dudes</Title><Username>trader.quick</Username><Timestamp>1350429677096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 19:21:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the problem is you are not the norm.

Not a chance especially when it will be faced with similar core counts but double the threads. The A9 to A15 is going from an OoO 2-wide to 3-wide processor while Atom will be taking the far more important performance step of going from in order to out of order which will be an instant all round 30%+ integer performance improvement e.g. like the jump from A8 to A9 which is a bigger jump than going from A9 to A15. They could also increase the issue width to 3 too, we shall see. I expect Atom will retain its javascript advantage while adding a lot more in other apps, both cpu and gpu.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350478857869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:00:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350478867439-94</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama: "Intel was founded by immigrants."</Title><Username>aviacionado</Username><Timestamp>1350440577863</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 22:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most truthful statement by Captain America?

What is their problem and why do they continuously attack the US economy and US manufacturing???] New-home construction in the U.S. surged in September to the highest level in four years, a sign the industry is on the road to recovery. Starts jumped 15 percent to an 872,000 annual rate last month, the most since July 2008 and exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The median estimate of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 770,000. An increase in building permits may mean the gains will be sustained. A pickup in sales stoked by record-low mortgage rates and population growth combined with dwindling supply indicates construction can continue strengthening, contributing more to economic growth. At the same time, the level of starts remains below the pre-recession peak, limiting how much the industry can boost the rate of expansion. “The housing market certainly has turned,” said Brian Jones, a senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York, whose forecast for 790,000 starts was among the highest. “But we still have a long way to go. The good thing is that construction will pull employment with it.” Stock-index futures extended earlier gains after the report. The contract on the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index maturing in December climbed 0.3 percent to 1,452.8 at 8:45 a.m. in New York. Treasury securities fell, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to 1.77 percent from 1.72 percent late yesterday. Survey Results Estimates in the Bloomberg survey for housing starts ranged from 735,000 to 800,000, and the prior month was revised up to 758,000 from a previously reported 750,000 pace. Over the past 12 months, work began on 34.8 percent more homes, the biggest year-over-year gain since April. Building permits, a proxy for future construction, jumped to an 894,000 annual rate, also exceeding the median forecast and the most since July 2008. They were projected to rise to 810,000, with a range of 780,000 to 850,000. The number of permits swelled by 45.1 percent since September 2011, the biggest annual jump since 1983. Construction of single-family houses climbed 11 percent from August to a 603,000 rate. Work on multifamily homes, such apartment buildings, increased 25.1 percent to an annual rate of 269,000. Three of four regions showed gain in starts last month, led by a 20.1 percent jump in the West.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350480833025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:33:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350480833792-115</Id><Topic><Title>Under $21 today.

Guidance was weak as expected, but INTC guided Dec-Q gross margins to 57%, well below our 62.5% estimate. Management indicated that it needs to drive down utilization to reduce inventory. This is our key concern against a weak macro backdrop and lowered expectations for new Ultrabooks. We look for a slow recovery, but lower gross margins and EPS in '13. INTC reported Q3 EPS of $0.58, vs. $0.65, above our $0.50 estimate, due to higher revenue.

TSM can't keep up with 28nm for all their clients and Dr. Chang has told them to find other vendors to help fill their need. TSM currently enjoys a PE=17 and a forward PE=14.3. Compare this with INTC who has state of the art processing and fabrication and has a PE=9 and a forward PE=10. If we followed suit, excluding all the R&amp;D savings etc. we would be trading at a comfortable $40.00/share. If this makes sense, I encourage you to contact investor relations and demand the board of directors address this issue immediately. NVDA has already gone public and said INTC should produce the Tegra3 for them.

AAPL's stock price struggles to go up and stay up even though AAPL is selling every product it can make. Meanwhile AMZN is basically a low margined , tremendously overvalued internet retailer, but the stock pops on nothing and struggles to go down.

Those agreements made it easier to move a company to those countries and ship the good back. Companies could expand where the cost of getting a manufactured product to the customer was lowest. Companies could not only take advantage of lower taxes but also lower wages and fewer regulations. The country with the the best combination of those three things will attract business. Oppressed people work cheaper. Countries will impose regulations as they see what the worst company will do to the environment. There is tangible value to the government supported infrastructure of roads, dams, .... There will be some changes made to Medicare and Social Security to address funding.

ARM does have a lead in low power today. That gap is closing fast and there should be no reason that I can think of that an x86 product can not match the performance and power profiles of ARM. In the conference call yesterday, Paul O. said that Intel was lowering the Haswell TDP from 17W to 10W. That is not a low power product but it indicates that Intel reduced the power consumption by 70% on a notebook/desktop product. I expect that a big part of that might apply to ATOM also.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350486486844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:08:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350486571621-183</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>terinavok57883</Username><Timestamp>1350478389422</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:53:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for this guys!</Msg><Username>bates_anne556</Username><Timestamp>1350486571621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:09:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350486958744-184</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>terinavok57883</Username><Timestamp>1350478389422</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:53:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great , i just subscribed!</Msg><Username>haynes_jeanette559</Username><Timestamp>1350486958744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:15:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350487328267-185</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Foundry?</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1350482715534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:05:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is an interesting thought.

We're a couple quarters away from seeing the next generation of mobile SoCs so anything can happen next round, but I can't stress enough that the x86 power myth has been busted at this point.

Karl Freund, vice president of marketing at Calxeda, told El Reg that the funding would be used, in part, to do a follow-on EnergyCore chip (really a system on chip, or SoC, since it includes integrated switching) based on 40-bit Cortex-A15 cores based on the ARMv7 specs from ARM Holdings. The kit is due around this time in 2013, with its first 64-bit EnergyCore due around a year later in 2014 or so. As it turns out, Calxeda's plans are considerably more ambitious than it was hinting last week. So much so that it might prompt in-state friend and foe Advanced Micro Devices to wonder why it didn't buy Calxeda instead of SeaMicro earlier this year. (There were unconfirmed rumors that AMD had in fact tried to do just that.) Calxeda has raised $103m in two rounds of venture funding from Austin Ventures, Vulcan Capital, ARM Holdings, Advanced Technology Investment Company (which owns the GlobalFoundries chip fab), Battery Ventures, Flybridge Capital Partners, and Highland Capital Partners. It used some of that money to seed its initial EnergyCore design and will use the rest to significantly expand its reach – if it all goes according to plan over the next several years. Calxeda is banking on the founders of the company – Barry Evans, who used to run Intel's low-power x86 and XScale ARM processor business; co-founder Larry Wikelius, who was at Opteron server maker Newisys; and co-founder David Borland, who was a chip designer at Marvell, Intel and AMD. The firm is hoping the trio can come up with clever cluster designs that scale across "warehouse-scale data centers," as Calxeda puts it. When it was set up in January 2008, Calxeda was known as Smooth-Stone – named for the stone used by David to kill Goliath – and its founders are taking a very long view and waiting as patiently as they can as they promote a software ecosystem around ARM-based servers and the integrated switching and management features that their chips offer. While 64-bit processing is something that all ARM server chip makers want and need, the issues they are trying to wrestle with are a lot larger than 32, 40, or 64 bits. The architecture of the Calxeda system on chip With the 32-bit EnergyCore ECX-1000 processor announced last November, the goal of the chip and distributed L2 switch was to get a complete system on a chip based on ARMv7 cores into the field and scale that interconnect, then called the EnergyCore Fabric, across a rack and spanning 4,096 nodes. The chip also included an on-chip management coprocessor to optimize and manage power use within each node and across a rack-level cluster. Freund tells El Reg as the big web properties took a look at what Calxeda and its server partners Hewlett-Packard and Boston had built, they wanted more. "They said to us that over 4,000 nodes in a cluster was interesting, but then they asked us if we could do 100,000 nodes on a cluster," says Freund. "And then they asked us if we could do a million." So with the coming generations of the EnergyCore chips, not only will Calxeda beef up the ARM cores on its processors, but it will bust that on-chip switching and management out of the rack and across "warehouse-scale" data centers – while rebranding the switching to Fleet Service Fabric Switch and the management engine to Fleet Services Engine. The future chips will also sport additional I/O controllers, potentially with integration to GPU coprocessors and other kinds of accelerators. Calxeda will be upgrading the current EnergyCore sockets with an upgraded chip based on the Cortex A15 design code-named "Midway," to give customers 40-bit extended memory and support for hardware-based virtualization. Generally speaking, the Midway chip is expected to deliver about 50 per cent more integer and 2X more floating point performance and support four times the memory (16GB per node and 4GB per thread) as the current ECX-1000 chip while sporting a new 2.0 release of the distributed L2 switch. Nothing comes for free, of course, so this Midway chip will deliver only the same or maybe slightly better performance per watt, according to Freund. And despite all the chatter about how 32-bit processors are not useful in the modern world, Calxeda continues to believe otherwise and says it has the customers to prove it. "With media streaming and media content services, you are pretty much just putting bits on a wire, and you don't need 64-bits for that," says Freund. "The EnergyCore ECX-1000 using the Cortex-A9 core is the right product for this. The Cortex-A15 doesn't replace the Cortex A9, which we think has a very long tail." Freund adds that the first-generation Calxeda chip would make a good storage controller, too, for clustered disk arrays. Aside from the core swap, the Midway chip will have the first generation of Fleet Services policy-based management and a set of APIs into the Fleet Services engine for fine-grained allocation and resource control that spans an entire rack. Midway will be available in 2013, perhaps around this time of the year. The company is not disclosing what process it is using to etch the chips or who the fab partner is that is doing the etching, but the current chips are made using 40 nanometer processes and are baked by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. It stands to reason that Calxeda will stick with TSMC and move on down to the 28 nanometer processes that it has been ramping for the past year and should have in better shape a year from now. About a year later comes the "Lago" SoC from Calxeda, and in case you are wondering, Calxeda is picking its code names from a map of Texas and using towns that have 1,000 people or less in their population. With Lago, Calxeda will move to the ARMv8 core, which has 64-bit processing and memory addressing and next-generation hardware virtualization circuits, among many other features. With this third generation SoC, Calxeda will add more cores, move to the 64-bit Neon floating point unit, offer faster single-thread performance, and add a significantly upgraded L2 switch interconnect that will be able to scale up to 100,000 nodes in a single cluster without having to add any external switches. The company is not providing any more specs on this interconnect, but says it will have much higher bandwidth (obviously) and much lower latency. This is a big deal, and it explains, more than anything else, why Intel has been buying up switching assets for the past year and getting paychecks to significant networking talent. Switching, not just network controller ports, is the next thing that is going to be integrated onto processors. The Lago chip will sport about twice the performance (presumably compared to the Midway chip, and presumably on integer work) and boosted floating point performance (by how much, Calxeda is not saying). Again, no word on what chip process or what fab will be used for Lago, but it could end up being a 28 nanometer chip from TSMC as well. EnergyCore clusters get bigger, chips get more powerful over time But that's not all. Calxeda has two more SoCs in the works as it plots its data center domination. With the future "Ratamosa" chip, Calxeda will be able to take on enterprise applications and high performance computing, and Microsoft might even have a Windows Server variant out by then. The company is not saying anything about timing on the Ratamosa chip, but it stands to reason that it will keep to a year cadence and we should see it around the end of 2015. And even further out, the fifth generation "Navarro" chip is in development, timed for the "enterprise server era," according to Calxeda, which is coded talk for when the Linux and possibly Windows operating systems and various hypervisors are fully mature on ARM processors. Although Calxeda did not confirm this, this would be the logical place to get a distributed L2 switch interconnect into the field that could handle the 1 million nodes that some customers are asking for. The ARM server race is afoot. ®</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1350492420434</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:47:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350492812213-209</Id><Title>CRAPTEL PINCHES OFF A LOAF....</Title><Msg>On Waldo's head!

I think earnings were decent and the fundamentals are still intact. Billions in profit, a ton of cash on the books, a fat dividend yield and the stock is badly oversold. I guess that's why it's only down about 3% so far today. Looks like value hunters are buying the fear and overreation.

Now they will just convert it now to 14nm. They will be incurring charges because of the production builds of Haswell. Intel reported third quarter revenue of $13.5 billion (down 5% year-over-year), operating income of $3.8 billion (down 20% compared to the year ago quarter), net income of $3.0 billion (14% lower than a year ago) and EPS of $0.58 (down 11% year-over-year). For the fourth quarter of 2012, the world's largest chipmaker expects revenue of $13.6 billion ± $500 million and gross margins of around 57%~58%. To respond to a weaker than expected demand environment, Intel has taken several actions. In particular, the chipmaker substantially cut wafer starts at its factories in late Q3 2012 and intends to maintain lower factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. Intel projects these factory adjustments to help bring down its total inventory levels by approximately $500 million. At the same time, Intel stressed that despite of lower demand for PCs, it will start initial volume manufacturing of its next-generation Haswell central processing units this quarter, which will cause an uptick of inventory levels. "We expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation micro architecture product code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013," said Stacy Smith, chief financial officer of Intel. At present Intel still does not specifically reveal when does the Haswell chips and products on their base are scheduled to hit the market. The company only claims that the first Haswell-based systems will be available in the first half of the year.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350512923960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350513235406-300</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is the next RIMM</Title><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1350510973251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 17:56:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You appear to be completely clueless about the entire thing dude.

I have no other aliases. 2. Are you in the NYC area? 3. Stop being a child - pointing out reality is not being a "coward". The reality for Intel is sad - revenues are declining (-7% Y/oY), margins are collapsing (57% expected in Q4 vs. 64% in Q3), the market is shrinking, and there are ZERO growth opportunities for the company. All the company's cash was wasted on dividends and expensive buybacks, so they can't even make a significant acquisition to save their business. Ultrabooks are failing miserably and Intel's mobile market-share is less than 0,2%. On top of everything, Windows 8 is ARM compatible and that means $25 ARM chips will be replacing $300 Intel CPUs and eroding the little that is left of this once high-flyer. Intel is fighting for its life and it doesn't look good right now. By the end of the decade, what's left of this company will probably be taken over for scrap.</Msg><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1350517144836</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350517304013-330</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P REITERATES HOLD RECOMMENDATION ON SHARES OF INTEL CORP</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1350481452303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:44:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even these estimates are too high.

This week, Microsoft invited a select group of tech writers for a closer look behind the curtain, and began taking pre-orders for the device that will be available as of October 26. As anxious as some are to get a hold of the new Windows RT tablet, though, there are a few good reasons businesses might think twice. At face value, a Windows-based device engineered by Microsoft would seem to be a slam dunk for businesses considering tablets. However, Windows RT is a different animal than Windows 8. It relies strictly on the Modern (formerly known as “Metro”) UI with its colorful tiles, and it can only use apps acquired from the Windows Store. The Surface RT has some serious caveats when it comes to business use. In both hardware and software, the Surface RT is a bit closer to rival tablet platforms like iOS and Android, and a bit less like the traditional Windows operating system. Still, it comes with Office apps pre-installed, and it could still be a viable mobile productivity tool for businesses. There are three serious caveats to consider, though. 1. Not for Commercial Use Paul Thurrott, a prominent expert on Windows, pointed out that the license for Office 2013 Home &amp; Student 2013 RT allows only for non-commercial use—just like the PC version. That means that even though the Surface RT tablet comes with the Office apps pre-installed, the tablet can’t actually be used for business productivity out of the box. Thurrott explains in a separate post that it isn’t entirely true that the Office 2013 Home &amp; Student 2013 RT apps can’t be used for business. Microsoft has clarified that customers simply need to buy the standard Office 2013 license, and that allows them to also legally use the Office RT apps for commercial use. That is a workaround, but basically means the Office RT apps that come pre-installed can only be used for business productivity if you also subscribe to Office 365, or invest additional money to buy the full PC version as well. 2. No Outlook Another problem with the Surface RT when it comes to business use is that the Microsoft Office tool that is probably the most widely used of the entire suite is absent from the RT apps—Outlook. Many companies rely on Microsoft Outlook for email, calendar, and contacts, and the integration with Microsoft Exchange helps IT admins manage it all. The Mail, People, and Calendar apps in Windows RT perform similar functions. These apps can integrate with Exchange using Exchange ActiveSync, but lack the consistent look and feel of Outlook that users are accustomed to, and fall short of delivering all of the capabilities users expect from Outlook. 3. Can’t Join a Domain Another issue that might deter some businesses is the fact that Windows RT can’t join a traditional Windows network domain. Granted, neither can iOS or Android tablets, so this isn’t exactly an Earth-shattering deal breaker as far as tablets go. There are two things to consider, though, when it comes to the ability of a business to manage its tablets. First, is to consider the options available. There are many mobile device management (MDM) platform options that can provide some control over iOS and Android, and Apple has made significant strides over the years to make iOS more manageable through Exchange ActiveSync. Windows RT probably has similar capabilities available through Exchange ActiveSync. The other option is to hold out for Windows 8 Pro tablets. Windows 8 Pro tablets have standard Intel or AMD processors like those in desktops and laptops, and they’re capable of running the full Windows 8 operating system. That means they can use all of the same software, and connect to a domain to be managed through Active Directory and Group Policy just like any other Windows 8 PC. The caveat here is that Windows 8 Pro tablets will most likely cost significantly more than the Surface RT, so you sort of get what you pay for. Overall, the Surface RT still seems like it has potential. But, businesses that are chomping at the bit to get their hands on one should be aware of these “limitations” before investing in the new tablet.</Msg><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1350530506547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:21:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350531409581-383</Id><Topic><Title>PC World says Windows RT (Arm Based chip) Surface Tablets suck for doing work on.</Title><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1350530506547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:21:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The issues highlighted here have nothing to do with WinRT being ARM based.
