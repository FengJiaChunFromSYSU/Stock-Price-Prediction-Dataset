Of the sites listed by Daniel, EDACafe comes close, although even EDACafe requires marketing professionals working for EDA vendors to identify their affiliation in the byline, something SemiWiki does not do. That SemiWiki is developing into a product in itself is an indication that a "Facebook" for EDA was needed, but says nothing about return on investment for the sponsors or the occasional vendor blog. SemiWiki has no editorial control on the pieces published, allows anyone to publish because doing so will increase the number of visitors, and its "dozen or so" bloggers are really three or four, two of whom are quite prolific: Daniel Nenni and Paul McLellan. But all this is not to say that SemiWiki is useless or devious. Some engineers will certainly find value in some of the pieces published, and Daniel is very open to explain to its "sponsors" that the goal is to increase visits, since the more eyes visit the more the probability that someone will purchase one of their products. And, after all, that is the promise upon which "blogging" is founded.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372566302828</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 00:25:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372566777053-2</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>With a new month starting next week and jobs reports and earnings season approaching, expect tapering talks to subside. The market should turn its attention to more fundamental data, which has been mixed lately. At this point, the market doesn't seem to have a good hold on the fundamental data. It was shown in the recent pullback followed by this week's triple-digit bounces. Technically, the picture is also mixed. The S&amp;P 500 is in an intermediate term downtrend started on May 21. But the long term trend started in October 2011 remains up. Stocks traded in the past two sessions as if the 50-day moving averages were a trigger point. After the S&amp;P 500 bumped into its 50-day moving average yesterday, the DJIA retreated at its 50-day moving average. We could see the same scenario play out again next week. However, should the two major indexes decisively break above their respective 50-day moving averages (currently 15041 for the DJIA and 1622 for the S&amp;P 500), expect buyers to step in to lift stocks higher.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1372566777053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 00:32:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372566782194-3</Id><Title>TSMC/GF/Samsung FinFet is a hoax</Title><Msg>It's based on 20nm design rules - marginal shrink compared to 20nm planar.\ Do not expect a response to this from semiwiki</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372566782194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 00:33:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372569194080-4</Id><Title>Daniel Nenni is TSMC's pimp</Title><Msg>Strategic Foundry Relationship expert and industry blogger Daniel Nenni has just published the hundredth entry in his Silicon Valley Blog.

The stock moved up $3.61 in spite of the anticipated weakness of both the economy and PC sales. But more importantly Intel laid the foundation for a much stronger second half of the year. Silvermont and Haswell announcements were met with broad approval - enough in fact to send the ARM stock price crashing by 14 dollars since its 52-week high in mid-May. We also know now that the roadmap and pipeline are going to be even stronger in the second half of the year with waves of improvements leading up to and through the release of 14nm Intel FinFET in early 2014. We know now that Intel is going to continue to grow tablet sales at a very strong rate and that dual boot is going to be a huge success. We know now that ARM continues to struggle with its fabrication with only small amounts of 28nm product available from anyone but TSMC. ARM will still be struggling with the transition to 28nm planar as Intel moves solidly to 14nm FinFET, giving Intel a massive advantage in the marketplace of 2 process nodes. ARM continues on its highly uncertain roadmap without customers being able to depend on when or if they will have access to 20nm production. ARM FinFET is literally years away And we know now that Intel is getting attention from the largest players in the business, like Samsung, with its fabrication and manufacturing prowess and superiority. The new CEO is in place and doing well. The next six months might even exceed the brilliance of the last six months...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372624628978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 16:37:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372628790751-32</Id><Topic><Title>What We Know Now</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372624628978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 16:37:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry INTC will give all $3.61 back in one day just like BBRY did</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372628790751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372630182511-33</Id><Title>ShillSpeak</Title><Msg>Shillspeak: Intel will go down.

Sue said the improved performance and power dynamics of new versions of Intel's Atom line of processors should help it increase its market share in the mobile market. As proof he cites the recent win with Samsung, which is using Intel's Clover Trail chip in a version of its Galaxy Tab 3, as IBD reported. RBC expects sales of Atom chips in the mobile category to jump to $3.7 billion in 2016, from just $380 million this year. Intel plans to ship a newer version of its Atom processor, the Silvermont, in late 2013, followed by Airmont in 2014. Sue thinks that Intel will gain in the market where Qualcomm and ARM Holdings have dominated.

The testing actually began in late March in the homes of more than 2,000 Intel employees in Northern California, Arizona, and Oregon -- new testers are being added every day. These employees are required to endure confidentiality training, and only allowed to use the set-top box in their homes with their families. Several testers have supposedly stepped forward, reporting that the product installed involves early trial hardware and an old version of the user interface design. The software itself will have many similarities to the final version including how users will navigate the system, but the hardware design will be completely different, meaning Intel will likely use the latest and greatest in technology at launch. "What people are using now is not the final product," one of the people told CNET. Another added that the trial content available on the current box is not representative of what Intel will finally release to retail -- a statement that covers possible leaks of the TV streaming service from here on out. Based on the sources, Intel is currently gathering information on order taking, usage habits, quality and stability of the service, and the performance of the back-end system. Intel is also evaluating the responsiveness of its "Audience Care" customer service system. Sources said feedback from the employees is incorporated into updates, thus the final product will be completely different than the alpha program. That said, it's an evolving product based on Intel's design, employee use and their response to features, bugs and more. By the end of the test program, the user interface should be somewhat similar to what Intel plans for the retail version slated to launch by the end of the year, they said.

AMD has made a net loss in its entire history of existence competing head on with Intel. The only time AMD made any profit is when Intel was looking the other way ( towards Itanium, if you remember.) Now they're teetering on bankruptcy every other quarter. Sold of their fabs. sold off their headquarters. Funny, same thing is just starting to happen to ARMH products now. Will ARMH products now find a home in teakettles and toasters? When do you plan to short AMD?</Msg><Username>butexcuseme</Username><Timestamp>1372639634057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 20:47:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372641495018-46</Id><Topic><Title>WOW Game systems will be sold out at Xmas, BIG winner for AMD, AMD up up and away</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372635231722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 19:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure you'll find a way to screw this up if your into AMD.
