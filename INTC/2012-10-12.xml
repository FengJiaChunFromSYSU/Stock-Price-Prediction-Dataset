The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 83.1, up from 78.3 the month before, and the highest since September 2007, the survey showed on Friday. It was well above the median forecast for a slight decline to 78 among economists polled by Reuters. The new buoyancy among consumers comes shortly after the U.S. unemployment rate tumbled to its lowest level in nearly four years in September as more people returned to the workforce and found jobs than economist had predicted. "We are getting some quite interesting signals from consumer sentiment and employment data - both (the) unemployment rate and initial claims - that there has been some quite significant improvement in the economy," said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350053335636</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:48:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350053499669-55</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's best subject was foreign policy</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350053318843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:48:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Obama campaign are a bunch of liar's.

BLATENT attempt to mislead by JoeJoe regarding taxing the rich</Title><Msg>BIDEN, when asked who would pay more taxes in Obama's second term: "People making a million dollars or more." THE FACTS: Obama's proposed tax increase reaches farther down the income ladder than millionaires. He wants to roll back Bush-era tax cuts for individuals making over $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. BIDEN: "We went out and rescued General Motors." THE FACTS: Actually, the auto bailout of General Motors and Chrysler began under President George W. Bush. The Obama administration continued and expanded it. ______________________________________________________ BIDEN: "Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there. We did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at the time we were told exactly — we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed their view." RYAN: "There were requests for more security." THE FACTS: Ryan is right, judging by testimony from Obama administration officials at the hearing a day earlier. ______________________________________________________ BIDEN: "What we did is, we saved $716 billion and put it back, applied it to Medicare." THE FACTS: Contrary to Biden's assertion, not all the money cut from Medicare is going back into the program in some other way. The administration is cutting $716 billion over 10 years in Medicare payments to providers and using some of the money to improve benefits under the program. But most of the money is being used to expand health care coverage outside of Medicare. _______________________________________________________ BIDEN: "Romney said 'No, let Detroit go bankrupt.'" THE FACTS: GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has gotten endless grief through the campaign for the headline put on his November 2008 opinion essay that he wrote for The New York Times. But his point was never that he wanted the auto industry to go down the tubes. Romney opposed using government money to bail out Chrysler and General Motors, instead favoring privately financed bankruptcy restructuring. His prescription seemed improbable. Automakers were hemorrhaging cash and the banking system was in crisis, so private money wasn't available. Without the government money, it's likely both companies would have gone out of business. Romney did propose government-guaranteed private loans for both companies after bankruptcy</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350054046817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350054338481-63</Id><Title>Obama has racked up more debt in 4 years than Bush did in 8...and Bush had 2 Wars!</Title><Msg>Liberal puke filth DESTROYING this country.

This gets aggravated by similar requirements on games and their different versions. There are a number of variables but you seemed to have decided to tackle the symptom rather than the cause. It is unlikely to be McAfee but I think you should remove McAfee if that is what you want to do. Other Variables that could affect you: which OS: MSFT XP, Vista, WIn7, Win8 beta; MAC, Linux 32-bit or 64-bit OS 32-bit or 64-bit browser which browser: IE (9, 8, 7, ....) Firefox, Chrome, Opera, .... what plugins do you have and 32-bit or 64-bit what games do you have installed and are you playing when the problem occurs what about HW? what CPU/chipset are you using? are you overclocking? what is the temperature of the CPU when it happens? how much memory? what disk drive? speed size, free space what graphics board and driver version? are you having any drive faults ? if you have a drive that is going bad, the system may hang when one of the many processes and services happen to access a bad block. bad memory on the graphic board</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350061442115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350061445676-107</Id><Title>Real clear politics - 4 Obama states now UP FOR GRABS!

So how did INTC completely miss the Mobile transition taking place with their enormous expenditures of R&amp;D?

Welch is clueless...] From Bloomberg: It isn’t only the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics that is issuing surprisingly good news about the U.S. economy these days. If former General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch’s charges of a political fix to manipulate economic data ahead of the presidential election are true, there must be a vast econometric conspiracy embracing auto dealers, real estate agents, the Federal Reserve and corporate America’s 96-year-old Conference Board. The economy is improving more than professional forecasters anticipated, particularly in data on employment and housing, according to the Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’ predictions. The index, based on gauges compiled by private businesses and trade groups in addition to government, confirms U.S. growth is generating jobs in the face of a global slowdown and looming federal spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff. “The economy is improving, and the labor market is getting better,” said Robert Brusca, president of Fact &amp; Opinion Economics and a former New York Fed economist. “These numbers are what they are, they’re not being slanted. On a scale of one to 10, the economy is at a fairly firm six and may be heading higher.” President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney are each trying to convince voters ahead of the Nov. 6 election that they are best equipped to spur growth and accelerate hiring. Nonpartisan forecasters who have developed models to predict the outcome of elections disagree on how the economy will shape the results this time. Rate Fell An Oct. 5 report from the BLS showed the jobless rate fell in September to 7.8 percent, the lowest since Obama took office in January 2009, from 8.1 percent in August. The rate was forecast to rise to 8.2 percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 88 economists. “Unbelievable jobs numbers. . . these Chicago guys will do anything. . . can’t debate so change numbers,” Welch wrote in a Twitter message immediately after the report. Obama’s campaign is based in Chicago. The BLS data also showed that employers added 114,000 workers to payrolls last month after a revised 142,000 gain in August. The September figure was in line with economists’ estimates for an increase of 115,000. Gallup’s daily tracking of likely voters conducted Oct. 4 through Oct. 10 shows Obama with 47 percent and Romney with 48 percent support. The tracking is a rolling average of seven days of surveys with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. Growing Number The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares indicators with analysts’ predictions, shows a growing number of those measures are exceeding expectations. The index climbed to minus 0.06 today from this year’s low of minus 0.42 at the end of July. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index shows a more pronounced improvement. It jumped to 49.4 today from this year’s low of minus 65.3 on July 19. A positive reading suggests the economic releases have on balance been better than the Bloomberg consensus. Among the indicators that have topped analysts’ forecasts: consumer confidence, car sales and purchases of existing homes. Sales of previously owned houses, reported by the National Association of Realtors, rose 7.8 percent in August to a two- year high. Cars sold at a 14.9 million annual rate in September, the fastest pace since 2008, according to Ward’s Automotive Group. ‘Doing Better’ “The economy is doing better than people think,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “Don’t count the consumer out yet.” Among the headwinds to growth, Rupkey said, are the European debt crisis, a slowdown in China and the so-called fiscal cliff, more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect early next year unless Congress acts to forestall them. Americans are hearing less negative news about the economy, according to a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press conducted Oct. 4-7. Of 1,006 adults surveyed, the share of people hearing mostly bad news fell to 28 percent this month from 35 percent in September. The percentage hearing mostly bad news about the labor market fell 10 points to 42 percent. Most of the interviews were conducted after the Oct. 5 jobs report. Better-than-forecast economic news, along with stock-market gains, helps explain recent increases in consumer confidence. Sentiment Index The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment jumped in October to the highest level since September 2007, before the last recession began, a report today showed. The index rose to 83.1 from 78.3 the prior month. The gauge was projected to fall to 78, according to the median forecast of 71 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index registered minus 38.5 in the week ended Oct. 7, close to the prior week’s reading of minus 36.9, which was the highest in three months. “Many of these other groups reporting the numbers aren’t necessarily in President Obama’s camp,” said Steve Jarding, a professor of public policy at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a former Democratic consultant. “There’s no collusion out there. The realtors, the car dealers, their numbers aren’t trumped up.” Welch, in a Wall Street Journal column this week, revisited his criticism of the jobs data. “The coming election is too important to be decided on a number,” Welch wrote. “Especially when that number seems so wrong.” Question Marks “If I could write that tweet again, I would have added a few question marks at the end” in order to “make it clear I was raising a question,” he wrote. Still, he added, the dip in unemployment is “downright implausible.” Since last September, the jobless rate has dropped 1.2 percentage points. The only election year in which unemployment fell more during the same period was Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re- election, according to the government’s records. Election forecasters’ economic models differ on this year’s outcome. Moody’s Analytics says its model shows Obama winning with 303 electoral votes, while Ray Fair of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, says the race is simply “too close to call.” Job Approval At Emory University in Atlanta, Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor, has developed a model based on economic growth during the April-to-June quarter and presidential job approval in the Gallup Poll for the last three days of June. His model forecasts a 67 percent probability that Obama will be re-elected and projects a popular-vote victory margin of 1.2 percentage points. Christopher Wlezien, a political science professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, said the direction of the economy is more important than any single number. “This isn’t just one little piece of news, it’s a perception over time,” said Wlezien, co-author of the book “The Timeline of Presidential Elections.” “This is a very close race,” he said. “We’re in a slightly good economy, so it’s a slight advantage for the president.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350067709848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:48:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350067895180-149</Id><Topic><Title>Where is the bottom? $18 or $19</Title><Username>patkc69</Username><Timestamp>1350067290132</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:41:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$20 maybe maybe $19....</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350067895180</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:51:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350068003830-150</Id><Topic><Title>Short volume jumped in the last hour..........</Title><Username>billionstack</Username><Timestamp>1350066179745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:22:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wall Street has never made sense, but I'm looking forward to earnings as well, but they will likely be BAD... we'll see...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350068003830</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:53:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350068521940-151</Id><Topic><Title>Short volume jumped in the last hour..........</Title><Username>billionstack</Username><Timestamp>1350066179745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:22:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doesn't matter if they are bad.

The problem with Intel's share price isn't going to be rectified by Mr. O talking up the company. It would probably hurt, because he'd lose his credibility with the financial community. Intel needs a vision and a business plan that excites people into investing, and they don't have that. We can argue all we want about whether or not 14nm process will save the company, but that isn't the vision investors want. Investors want to know why consumers and companies will demand Intel products in the future, and things are currently looking pretty dim in this regard, pointing to lower revenue growth and smaller margins. Until Paul has something visionary to say he should just be quiet. Of course, since he doesn't have anything visionary to say I happen to agree that he should be replaced. He and his staff have indeed failed in this important category. It is time for a change.</Msg><Username>firstofmany</Username><Timestamp>1350076005000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:06:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350076204497-193</Id><Topic><Title>Obama voters loved Biden last night</Title><Username>think5pm</Username><Timestamp>1350071794986</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:56:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Biden was a old bitter snarky fossil who is part of the corrupt system, of course they loved him lol</Msg><Username>thegoldude747</Username><Timestamp>1350076204497</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:10:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350076264510-194</Id><Topic><Title>Who cares if it goes to 18</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350070815768</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:40:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most people on message boards can't hold anything for 20 minutes let alone 20yrs pal lol</Msg><Username>thegoldude747</Username><Timestamp>1350076264510</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:11:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350076318720-195</Id><Title>Holding 600 2013, 2014 and 2015 $23-25 calls...</Title><Msg>I thank all of you who have sold for selling.

They make the best reliable and fastest products and will continue to compete. This industry has what we call cycles and Intel is on the down leg but it WILL recover with new designs next year.

According to the wire service, "the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 83.1, up from 78.3 the month before, and the highest since September 2007, the survey showed on Friday." The U.S. economy officially slid into recession in December 2007. It officially came out of that downturn in Spring 2009. Bloomberg News adds that "rising stock and property values along with falling joblessness may keep giving Americans a psychological boost, brightening the household-spending outlook during the year-end holidays. Improving confidence may play a role in next month's election as Republican challenger Mitt Romney tries to make a case for unseating President Barack Obama, a Democrat." The confidence survey follows other hopeful economic indicators in the past week: a sharp drop in jobless claims, and a dip in the nation's unemployment rate. [Wow, from 78.3 to 83.1.

The calendar still has a few big Windows 8-related events on it, though, so here's what you can look forward to over the next few weeks. October 12: Microsoft begins taking preorders for the standalone retail version of its new operating system, Windows 8 Pro. Preorders for full Windows 8 PCs also begin from Acer, Dell, HP, Sony, and other major system vendors. October 21: Windows Phone 8 devices available for preorder. You can put your name down for the Nokia Lumia 920, the HTC Windows Phone 8X, as well as the Windows RT-equipped Samsung Ativ Smart PC tablet, and the Asus Vivo Tab RT. October 25: Microsoft hosts its Windows 8 launch event in New York. With little left for Microsoft to announce about Windows 8, the tone of the day should be more coming-out party than news event. October 26: Windows 8 is officially available to consumers. Customers should begin receiving preordered units, Windows 8 upgrade and full OS downloads go live, and retail stores, including 30 Microsoft-run pop-up outlets, can finally take the wraps off of Windows 8 PCs. October 29: Launch event for Windows Phone 8. Microsoft kicks off its new mobile OS with a San Francisco launch event. In terms of exact availability, the wireless carriers have only specified "November" for the first batch of phones.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1350089744570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350091987137-222</Id><Topic><Title>21.46 AFTER HOURS</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1350087380478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:16:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a special place in hell for folks like you that celebrate others pain.

This might affect the Monday trading. China's exports quicken, easing growth fears DateOctober 13, 2012 - 1:40PM China's exports expanded at a faster pace for the second month and import growth resumed, adding to signs global demand is recovering after overseas shipments from Taiwan and South Korea beat estimates. Sales abroad increased 9.9 per cent in September from a year earlier, China's customs administration said today in Beijing. That compares with a 2.7 per cent gain in August and a 5.5 per cent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 35 economists. Imports gained 2.4 per cent, leaving a $US27.67 billion trade surplus. Today's data may reduce pressure on Premier Wen Jiabao to step up policy easing ahead of a transfer of power to a new generation of leaders that starts next month. The People's Bank of China has refrained from cutting interest rates since July, in contrast with its counterparts in South Korea, Brazil and Australia. “China's exports seem to have been supported by better sentiment abroad after the European Central Bank's decision on government bond purchases and the rollout of further easing in the U.S.,” Ding Shuang, a Hong Kong-based economist with Citigroup Inc., said before the release. “However, recession in the euro zone and the possible fiscal cliff in the U.S. will likely cap the upside in the months ahead.” Advertisement Ding, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund and China's central bank, said two more reductions in banks' reserve requirement ratio are likely over the rest of this year. He expects economic growth to pick up this quarter “with continued policy support.” Yuan strengthens Stocks in China have slumped about 14 per cent from this year's high on March 2 on concern the government isn't loosening monetary policy or introducing stimulus policies fast enough to reverse the economic slowdown. The yuan strengthened for a 10th straight week, touching the highest level in 19 years, on speculation the government will announce measures to revive growth. The increase in imports compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 2.4 per cent gain. Inbound shipments recorded the first non-holiday drop in August since 2009. September's trade surplus was higher than the $US20.5 billion median forecast in the survey and compared with a $US26.66 billion excess in August. Foreign trade expanded at a slower pace than last year in the first three quarters, according to today's report, putting at risk the government's 2012 target of 10 per cent growth. Exports through September rose 7.4 per cent while imports gained 4.8 per cent, leaving a trade surplus of $US148.3 billion. China's economy probably expanded 7.4 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. If confirmed on Oct. 18, that would be the least since 2009 and the seventh quarterly deceleration.
