Just to clarify though TSMC has Apple 20nm business it does not mean anything beyond 20nm - I think an ALTR scenario (stick with TSMC @ 20nm and than make the move to Intel @TriGate/FF) is not unlikely.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366344357908</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:05:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366345285770-2</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC call, 20nm production</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366339627712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 22:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too late for Apple.

TSMC placed orders at ASML for steppers, allocated fab space yadayada Tom Cook for sure is living in a pressure cooker Pacta sunt servanda (Latin for "agreements must be kept"[1]), is a brocard, a basic principle of civil law and of international law. In its most common sense, the principle refers to private contracts, stressing that contained clauses are law between the parties, and implies that nonfulfilment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact. In civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice — including the assumption of good faith — is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties. However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366345285770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:21:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366346136216-3</Id><Title>DRAM 1.H April remain strong</Title><Msg>electronicsfeedpunktcum/news/4125</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366346136216</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:35:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366346918619-4</Id><Title>The Death of Motley Fool is coming</Title><Msg>These paid hack shills are on life support.</Msg><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1366346918619</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366347045650-5</Id><Title>ARM's low end undercut by Andes core</Title><Msg>ARM's low end undercut by Andes core Rick Merritt 4/17/2013 12:01 PM EDT SAN JOSE, Calif. – Andes Technology takes microcontrollers to a new low with the launch of a soft core that can deliver up to 108 Dhrystone MIPS/milliwatt and fit into 0.04 mm2 in a 90-nm process. The Hummingbird N7 core uses about 30 percent less power at the same performance of an ARM Cortex M0. Two customers have already licensed the N7 for use in Bluetooth and touchscreen controllers. Separately, Andes (Hsinchu, Taiwan) is also shipping its high-end N13 cores, geared for dataplane networking systems running Linux. The low-end N7 delivers 1.19 to 1.45 DMIPS/MHz using a mix of 16- and 32-bit instructions. It has a two-stage pipeline, can be implemented in 12,000 to 30,000 gates and employs a prefetch buffer that acts as a small instruction cache.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366347045650</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:50:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366349347700-6</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC call, 20nm production</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366339627712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 22:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple will use TSMC 28nm for ARM Iphone chips for their low end phones.

Clearly, IDC and Gartner were off in their market forecast. I have worked with both entities and in general, they are a couple of reliable sources of information. Their forecast is based on statistical sampling. Surely they can't be out there to count every single p/c that gets shipped. Are they guilty of market manipulation by fudging the data? Perhaps. 2. In a down market of yesterday, it was rather difficult to understand how the INTC stock went up only to learn that the windows did okay based on MSFT's news release after the market close. 3. UBS, in their latest report, claim the short interest to be 8+% of float although yahoo's data doesn't correlate with those numbers given that the later number is lagging in time. In either case, while this can't be the determining factor in investing in a stock, nevertheless, it can't be ignored. 4. We move to the insiders part where there is a selling. And last, 5. Of course, the MMs must be factored in because today being Option Expiration date. In conclusion, as several people here have repeatedly pointed out, there is a need for a catalyst for the stock to move up.

INTC will close relative to the market simply because so much of its volume (40% to 50%) is generated by index and sector ETF. If the market is up/down by x%, INTC will close up/down by x% plus some small delta. I think that delta is now POSITIVE by a couple % of x.

Microsoft suckerpunched Intel with the decision to out a Windows version for ARM chipsets, and make Win 8 apps compatible with both ARM and x86 architecture going forward, but Chipzilla is striking back opening its silicon to some Android love in its turn. Intel is reportedly planning to power convertible tablet notebooks, running Android, and, just as we heard before, we might see the first one as soon as next month, the sources confirmed. This will be a variation of the innovative Lenovo Yoga design, but running Android, and sporting Intel inside. The Yoga screen half flips 360 degrees to touch the keyboard half and form a tablet, or can be used as a regular notebook with a physical keyboard. Other manufacturers have allegedly also responded to Intel's answer towards the Android tablet proliferation, and are prepping convertible notebooks with Google's mobile OS, and these include industry stalwarts like Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba, Acer and Asus. Check out the pics from our IdeaPad Yoga 11 hands-on below, now imagine this thing with Android, and hopefully cheaper. phonearenaDOTcom/news/Intel-responds-to-Microsofts-sucker-punch-to-power-convertible-Lenovo-Yoga-with-Android-next-month_id42123</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366382541646</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 10:42:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366384248785-37</Id><Title>Have you checked out XSNX</Title><Msg>XSNX looks like it is ready to pop.

Rivals Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc. were also said to be considering making an offer for the startup. If industry expectations are anything to go by, a potential acquisition of Omek Interactive could be characteristic of future activity in the sector. Indeed, expectations are that gesture recognition technology - specifically, touch-free gesture recognition - will likely begin to feature prominently, as the way consumers interact with devices continues to evolve. Janine Kutliroff, Omek's CEO, sees it thus: "Gesture recognition and control are transforming some of the most significant products in our society, from TVs, set-top boxes, game consoles and PCs to a huge variety of industrial devices. And the ability to understand and interpret the movement of human bodies in 3D has huge implications for the entertainment, medical, fitness and automotive industries, among others." Gesture recognition in consumer electronic devices is not new. Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s Wii for instance, which has motion sensing capabilities has been around since 2006. Microsoft Corp. followed eventually in 2010 with its Kinect for Xbox, a vision-based gesture recognition system. That market seems set to witness good growth, as use of the technology is increasingly adopted elsewhere. According to a report from industry researchers MarketsandMarkets, the broader touchless sensing and gesture recognition market is expected to reach $15 billion by 2018, versus approximately $2 billion in 2012, driven by increasing uptake in several sectors, including healthcare and consumer electronics.

The buying for the last mohth has been volatility trades. They did not know what way Intel was going (up or down). Since Tuesday's call, Intel has consistently performed stronger than the markets. The market is looking 6 months out which is Intel's big quarter. In 2011, GS and Nomura downgraded to a SELL and started their chorus of reiterations. I think that Intel will be a little stronger than the market for a week or so and then begin (unlike the last year) track the general market pretty closely. Of course, I am frequently wrong.

The results were within Intel's own guidance given a quarter ago. First-quarter revenue was down $100 million from the midpoint of guidance, gross margin was at the low end of guidance. Second-quarter guidance is marginally better than first quarter results, which was as expected. The first quarter could have been better if two major customers, Dell (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) weren't completely distracted from the PC business. Intel has maintained the last half of 2013 will begin a recovery with a 2% increase in revenue for the full year and gross margin recovery to 60% for the full year. Given that, the second half should be ~$29 billion and 63% gross margins. A couple of $14.5 billion quarters would be new records, so the Intel world isn't falling apart as some pundits are wont to declare. PC client units were down 6% vs. third party estimates of down 14%. Someday the third parties will surrender and simply wait for the quarterly reports in order to get the numbers right. Why announce gross errors only days before the earnings announcement?

I am normally skeptical of predictions by industry experts, but there seems to be some basis for Otellini to extend his tenure by another year or so...one main reason being that there are not any great replacements for him. Otellini has so many initiatives going - Haswell, Bay Trail, Merrifield, Intel Custom Foundry, and Intel TV being some of them - and I think he is the best guy to see them through. The only other person who can bring all these things to fruition could be Stacy Smith, CFO who has walked by Otellini's side that last couple of years.

So what are you talking about "no growth in 12 years"?</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366415720121</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 19:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366415871121-72</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is low-balling growth estimate</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1366415409484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 19:50:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another quote: "you really just need seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low single digit revenue growth."

That might change with the Taiwanese computer maker's Blade 13 Carbon laptop, which it claims is now the world's thinnest and lightest. Tipping the scale at 870g (1.9 pounds) and 10.7mm, the company says it undercuts NEC's 12.8mm Lavie X by a whopping 2mm, while nipping the 875g LaVie Z by 5g. There are still weighty specs crammed into the package, however: a Core i5 or i7 CPU, 1080p screen, 128GB or 256GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. If you're looking for that kind of unencumbered power, the Carbon will also lighten your pocketbook to the respectable tune of $1,350, while a dialed-back 1,600 x 900 fiberglass version -- still radically lean at 12.6mm and 1,195g (2.6 pounds) -- will run a grand or so. These models will arrive in Taiwan in June, with no sign that it'll come to relieve us overburdened laptop users stateside.

Can you put some perspective on that? It seems like you normally have new products in Q2, and you normally have strength in Q3. Is the current inventory level lean, or how should we view that inventory replenishment comment? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President I think inventory levels generally are lean everywhere we look. We saw an inventory burn in the broader pipeline in Q1. And our inventory levels are down more than I expected when I started the quarter, and down pretty significantly. So I think inventory levels are lean. And I also want to put it in perspective. You’re talking a minor difference. Being up 3% quarter on quarter is kind of well within Q1 the Q2 seasonality. I don’t think there’s any one big driver there. I think we’ll see people putting in place some Haswell based systems in anticipation of the second half selling season, just as they burned inventory on some of the older generation systems in the first quarter. [OEMs have reduced their inventory of older products and will be replenishing them with Haswell. This means Intel will incur lots of revenue from Haswell this quarter]</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1366418188957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 20:36:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366418896642-81</Id><Title>Most important take away from conference call</Title><Msg>Paul Otellini - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director We have a certain spec for ultrabooks, and that is the product that Stacy said is going to be centered at as low as $599 with some [diverse] SKUs to $499. If you look at touch-enabled Intel based notebooks that are ultrathin and light using non-core processors, those prices are going to be down to as low as $200 probably. Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President And I’d say the big change over the last 12 months there is that Bay Trail is going to be a great product in that segment of the market. We think it enables stunning performance relative to what the competition can bring. And it’s going to enable these price points.

INTC reported March quarter in-line with guidance, but better than feared, and guided June quarter essentially in-line with Street consensus, but again better than the reduction we and most of our peers forecasted. While structural questions were NOT answered last night, we would argue that INTC’s business model continues to be SIGNIFICANTLY more resilient than feared. Specifically: (1) in a cyclically depressed GM and seasonally weak revenue quarter with weaker-than-seasonal PC demand, INTC still managed to generate $4.3bn in CFO – annualized at $17.2bn – more than enough for CapEx + dividend assuming no improvements, (2) management continued to exercise operational flexibility by reducing CapEx by $1bn and (3) our analysis suggest that even in an environment where PCs decline 5% per year between 2012-2016, INTC can still grow EPS from $2.13 to $2.20 plus and generate $22bn in CFO and $9.5bn plus in FCF. While this perhaps does not make INTC a great long, our scenario analysis suggests the implosion in earnings power the Bears covet is also a low probability event. At 11.0x CY13 EPS, a 4.1% dividend yield, a downside scenario which is significantly better than feared and an all-time high short interest of 8.3% (as % of float) – we view shares extremely attractive especially as growth opportunities mount as INTC continues to stretch out its manufacturing lead relative to our “Last-Man-Standing-On-Moore’s-Law- Thesis.” Our 12-18 months TP is $28, or 13.3x (ex-cash) CY13 EPS.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366419162831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 20:52:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366419407568-83</Id><Topic><Title>Credit Suisse comments on Intel stock.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366419162831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 20:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't decide which is more pathetic.
