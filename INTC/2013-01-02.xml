I wonder if this can be done with an Intel chip somehow. I want to see if Apple keeps going up or what it does, if it has legs tomorrow then hopefully lifts tech and Intel. I just can't see Intel going much lower, I just started thinking about the custom chip thing a few hours ago...got me thinking....hmm.</Msg><Username>repklikint</Username><Timestamp>1357102894759</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 00:01:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357102944060-2</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Cantor = 1000 points down on DoW</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1357093711527</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 21:28:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot Cantor wanted to keep the vote from happening, and add 350 billion in spending cuts in the amended bill to send back to the senate.

They used to require you to pass a Constitution test. The 9 who voted for it were in the Senate..not the House. The House vote was 257-167 in favor of the bill. Eric Cantor got 167 fellow idiots to vote against it. BTW, in 8th grade they used to try to teach you to grow up and use the language skillfully, not use terms like "jerk wad". I bet I knew 1000x more about American history in 8th grade than you do now.

Clearly you know more than the laymen investor about Intel's technology. but most of the individual investors are exposed to online recommendations in financial websites.. The reason i like/use TipRanks is because i can relate to their vision which is to show how good are people that recommend others what to buy/sell without being held accountable for their influence. Me like many others lost money after following online investment tips. and its comfortable having an Add on that shows me who i can trust - especially now when its free. You can see some analysts have amazing statistics (when i saw Amazing i mean ~75% positive picks) and some are just terrible. Since they have a browser Add-On it is very convenient since they appear only when i read an article with an analyst name. its kind of a financial accountability engine. i got friends that work their (friends of friends), and i really like how they assist the individual not to get into traps. i think its needless to say that some analysts are biased and when they say "Buy" its because they want the stock to climb. From what i heard they will start supporting bloggs/message boards as well so you can see how your statistics and my statistics are.</Msg><Username>donnapinkwater</Username><Timestamp>1357111233082</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 02:20:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357111409354-6</Id><Topic><Title>A few words about yesterdays Outperform by Wells Fargo.</Title><Username>donnapinkwater</Username><Timestamp>1357051587088</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 09:46:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In order to see what he was worth i had to find an article he appeared in. and then his report opened.

Intel did the right thing on phi and hopefully will learn to get some traction on it. AAPL is a great candidate for using phi but volumes may be low. I don't blame the pricing self fulfilling prophesy. Honestly, now who cares if the co-processor is an extGPU or atoms or ARM, the latter being a missed opportunity..... others go fret. Darn I hate this pricing unless there is volume discount. I'll go with ARM or GPU.. anyone offering ARM? no they missed out... but INTC pricing is an opportunity for others.

Here's what's in the cards for Intel: 1) Intel may be Cisco's foundry. Investment bank Piper Jaffray says deal could be worth $1 billion a year for Intel 2) Intel may be do foundry for Apple's arm-based chips currently in the iPhones. In exchange, Apple will use Intel's upcoming Atom SoC in the next versions of the iPad. RBC Capital analyst says the two companies are in negotiations and the deal could be worth $2 billion a year for Intel. 3) Intel and Apple are also rumored to be working on Apple's next product - the iWatch. The iWatch is a bluetooth device and sports a 1.5 inch screen. 4) Intel's redesigned Atom architecture SoC (Merrifield) will be introduced at this year's Mobile World Congress in February. There's been leaked performance benchmark that shows Merrifield scoring an incredible 31,612 on the AnTuTu benchmark. This performance is 2x as fast as any current arm-based phones in the market today. It also easily beats A15 arm-base Samsung Exynos 5250 dual-core which is rumored to only score 14,185 in the Antutu benchmark. Here are the links to the leaked benchmarks: slashgearDOTcom/intel-redhookbay-benchmarks-surface-show-dual-core-merrifield-processor-29262496/ antutuDOTcom/view.shtml?id=2718 5) At this year's CES, Intel will unveil it's plan to create a "'virtual cable operator,' which would offer U.S. TV channels nationwide over the Internet in a bundle similar to subscriptions sold by cable- and satellite-TV operators". Intel will also unveil a set-top box as part of this plan. This TV service will allow customers to view a TV channel's programs up to a month old without the use of a DVR since the programs will be stored in the cloud. If the plan is successful, Intel can, in the future, incorporate the set-top box into it's chipset so that any device (smartphones, tablets, PCs), with Intel inside, will be able to view live TV. 6) 7" tablet by Asus coming. Leaked reports of a label with FCC filed. google Red Ridge 7) Rumors are floating around that Motorola X phone has Intel inside.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357146021287</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:00:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357146248492-39</Id><Topic><Title>Great news !</Title><Username>webereddie696</Username><Timestamp>1357062184364</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 12:43:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>usefull info</Msg><Username>amberslynn</Username><Timestamp>1357146248492</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:04:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357146429725-40</Id><Topic><Title>Better sell before earnings, your getting your chance today</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357143840599</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 11:24:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still going to test 19.23 wait and see, INTC has big problems.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357146429725</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:07:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357146623084-41</Id><Title>Intel Soon to be Making Apple's ARM Chips</Title><Msg>Look for price to be in 30's before long</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1357146623084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:10:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357147200201-42</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Soon to be Making Apple's ARM Chips</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1357146623084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:10:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple has agreed with TSMC to initiate trial production of its A6X processor during the first quarter, Taiwan-based Commercial Times is reporting, according to the AFP.

The move, which has been speculated by media in the recent months, is said to reduce Apple’s reliance on South Korean-based Samsung, who has been responsible for many of Apple’s chips in recent years. The folks in Cupertino introduced the A6X chip in the fourth-generation iPad in October, and it is expected to go into TSMC’s hands, rather than Samsung’s, during the first quarter of this year for trial production. For those unfamiliar, TSMC is the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. The trial that will be underway during the first quarter will presumably be in-place to see if the company can keep with Apple’s high demand that must be appeased with devices in stock. Past the powerful A6X chip, Apple has been rumored to make the switch to TSMC’s 20nm process for quad-core processors over the next couple of years in the iPad, “iTV” (Apple TV?), and MacBook, while iPhone’s will remain with duo-core chips. Can the move away from Samsung really be shocking? Apple and Samsung have been under historic patent litigation for the better part of the year worldwide. In a U.S. ruling in August, a judge ruled Samsung will be forced to pay over $1 billion in damages to Apple for infringing patents held for its iOS devices. Apple is presumed to be moving away from Samsung, dubbing the company as an “enemy”. Reports from the fall indicated that while Apple chose Samsung to manufacture the A6 chip, it did not collaborate with Samsung on the overall design of the chip found in the sixth-generation iPhone.</Msg><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1357154430666</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:20:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357154955564-54</Id><Title>Where'd all the "Intel to 30 becuz we gettin Apple business" PUMPERS go?</Title><Msg>AMDROADKILL AMDMONKEY JERRY BLOWN WALLISWEAVER BACBACKER You just HOMEGAMED</Msg><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1357154955564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:29:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357155157891-55</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH - new 52-week high !!!!</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357143894077</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 11:24:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357155157891</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:32:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357155211485-56</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC to make Apple's chips - Wally, Jerry, amdmonkey, bacbaker, etc.....SILENCED</Title><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1357154430666</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:20:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>research note from Citigroup analyst J.T.

At least, Topeka Capital analyst Brian White thinks so. White writes in a research report this morning that “checks are pointing to more choices on the way with the next iPhone,” including expanded color options and more screen sizes. “By providing customers with greater choices with the same high quality performance of the iPhone, we believe Apple has the potential to further expand its market share in the rapidly expanding smartphone world,” he writes. White thinks the next iPhone – expected to be called the iPhone 5S – will launch in the May/June timeframe. On the issue of more colors, he thinks the iPhone will follow the path Apple set with the iPod Touch, which you can now buy in pink, yellow, blue, white and silver, and black and slate. The iPod nano, he notes, is now offered in pink, yellow, blue, green, purple, silver and slate. “Also, the iPod family participates in the ‘red’ campaign with red-colored iPods,” he notes. Basically, he thinks the addition of more colors to the iPod touch lineup was a testing ground for adding color to the next generation iPhone; he expects the next version to come in as many as eight colors. Down the road, he also expects the iPad to be offered in multiple colors. More intriguing is the prospect for phones in additional sizes. “Our checks are also indicating that the next iPhone will offer customers more choice in terms of screen size,” he writes. “Although Apple offers a 4-inch screen on the iPhone 5 and a 3.5-inch screen on the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, the company has never offered multiple screen sizes for a single model. We believe this is about to change with the next iPhone offering different screen sizes that we believe will allow Apple to better bifurcate the market and expand its reach. This eventually opens up the possibility for a lower-priced iPhone (i.e., iPhone mini) with a smaller screen size that could allow Apple to further penetrate markets such as China and open up opportunities in India. At the same time, Apple could unveil a larger screen size compared to the recently updated 4-inch screen on the iPhone 5. Clearly, there are many smartphone models that are now larger than 4 inches and even some bigger than five inches on the market.” [As I said before, there is a very good chance that Apple will create a high-end iPhone with a larger screen. With Samsung's Galaxy SIII (4.8" screen) and Galaxy Note II (5.5" screen), both selling extremely well, Apple needs to create a larger version to compete with them. As well, there is common consensus that Android is the more powerful OS; Apple needs to update it's OS to make it more customizable for the power users. If Apple comes out with a larger screen iPhone running a more powerful OS (but still compatible with current iOS apps) then they can definitely gain customers who might otherwise opt for the Samsungs. With the recent leak of Intel's Merrifield benchmark, I would not bet against an Intel-inside high-end iPhone]</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357182232321</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 22:03:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357182646728-109</Id><Topic><Title>Did Anyone Notice</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357165112338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 17:18:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At at P/E of around 75, ARM needs to return 20% revenue and profit increases for the next five years at least and even that will only bring it down to around 30.

Good chance Apple could end up with a 20nm lemon - ASML made a new all time high - LRCX (one of the leader in double patterning up 7%) - "ARM chip analysts" are completely clueless when it comes to economics - Hans Mosemann is aprime example Many of the so-called fast-followers, such as Broadcom, Freescale, Marvell and LSI, are still on the fence. At a recent event, for example, a Marvell representative questioned the feasibility of the 20nm planar node, saying the technology has a “negative ROI.” Previously, foundries offered several different process derivatives at a given leading-edge node. But at 20nm, GlobalFoundries, Samsung and TSMC will offer only one leading-edge process, thereby providing customers with fewer choices. The 20nm planar node also brings some new and challenging technologies to the mix, such as double patterning and the introduction of a third layer of local interconnects called the middle-of-the-line. At 20nm planar, there is a performance boost over 28nm, but the transistor speeds slow down as operating voltage is reduced. IC makers that moved from 40nm to 28nm have experienced a 35% average increase in speed and a 40% power reduction, said Jack Sun, vice president of R&amp;D and chief technology officer at TSMC. In comparison, IC vendors that will move from 28nm to 20nm planar are expected to see a 15% increase in speed and 20% less power, Sun said.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357188045062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 23:40:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357188814214-127</Id><Title>Intel Making Apple's ARM Chips Will Leave Samsung Behind</Title><Msg>Intel is already running at 22nm and moving to 14nm, while TSMC, the largest alternative, is now at 28nm and moving to 20nm. Apple could therefore skip a generation from the 32nm used in the iPhone 5 and iPad 4, going straight to 14nm, and use the process shrink for better performance and better battery life and be a generation ahead of competitors. Even if Apple takes a more conservative approach, it can move all its ARM chip production to Intel's already proven 22nm process while rivals deal with any teething troubles in the ramp up of equivalents. So it makes sense for Apple to move to Intel and once again increase the performance gap between iPhone/ iPad and the Android phones and tablets. If the usual 2 years for a chip generation holds, iPhones made now with chips from Intel's 14nm line will still be competitive in 2015 when Samsung moves to that process. So then Apple will be able to market its cheaper 2 year old iPhones to the mid range as being as up-to-date as the best Samsung phones.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357188814214</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 23:53:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357189100646-128</Id><Topic><Title>20nm planar node - “negative ROI.” ?</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357188045062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 23:40:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Has TSMC demoed any prototype 20nm chips yet?
