The ThinkPad X1 Carbon will go on sale later this month, the Chinese computer maker said. Lenovo Group acquired the ThinkPad brand with IBM Corp.'s personal computer unit in 2005. Lenovo passed Dell Inc. last year to become the second-largest PC manufacturer after Hewlett-Packard Co. The latest ThinkPad has third-generation wireless connectivity and other features inspired by tablets and smartphones, said Dilip Bhatia, vice president of the ThinkPad business unit. He said that was in response to demands by customers who want a tablet's convenience but need a notebook's wider range of functions. "They want faster. They want thinner," Bhatia said. Dilip Bhatia, vice president of the ThinkPad business unit Lenovo shaved the 14-inch (35.5 centimeter) laptop computer's weight to three pounds (1.3 kilograms) from the 3.7 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of last year's model, Bhatia. He said it would have up to eight hours of battery life and the startup time was reduced by as much as half to under 20 seconds. The ThinkPad unit launched the first tablet version of its computer last year. Despite tablets' growing popularity, Bhatia said there will still be strong demand for notebooks to perform more complex functions in business, education and government. Forecasts call for global notebook sales to reach 230 million this year, versus 110 million for tablets. "The clamshell format is going to be around for a long time," Bhatia said. "We see a multi-device environment." Lenovo took the unusual step of unveiling the new computer in China because of the fast growth of its market and the local popularity of ThinkPads, said Bhatia. The computer's chief developer, Arimasa Naitoh, vice president of ThinkPad research and development, said he has met a Chinese collector who owns 100 ThinkPads.

Well I like the part where two bad guys tag team against some nimrod and stomp him to the ground. laughing the whole time, they turn the poor guy into mush. Well recently Harry reed asked Mitt about the taxes. In fact, Harry said that Mitt had 10 years where he paid NO taxes. Hit one--tag Nancy Pelosi and she comes in with a kick to Mitt's little nuggers and I am sure we will hear him crying like a little wooosey soon. Nancy Pelosi: 'It Is A Fact' That Somebody Told Harry Reid About Romney Not Paying Taxes FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fired back at Republicans accusing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) of lying about a Bain Capital investor telling him that Mitt Romney hadn't paid taxes in 10 years. They don’t know what they're talking about, Pelosi says. "Harry Reid made a statement that is true. Somebody told him. It is a fact," Pelosi told The Huffington Post in a Sunday interview. "Whether he did or not can easily be disposed of: Mitt Romney can release his tax returns and show whether he paid taxes." Both Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus came out swinging against Reid on Sunday over his claims about Romney potentially not paying taxes. Asked to respond to Priebus calling Reid "a dirty liar" over the situation, Pelosi initially responded, "Who?" She went on to say that Priebus doesn't know what he's talking about since he wasn't part of Reid's conversations. "Well he doesn't know that," Pelosi said. "Harry Reid is a person who is, as we know, A, is a fighter, B, he wouldn't say this unless it was true that somebody told him that." The California Democrat said she doesn’t relish watching Romney squirm over his tax returns because she's more interested in focusing on the fact that his tax plan is "so harmful to the middle class." Still, she said, the two issues are connected. "The salience of what Harry Reid is saying is related" to the contents of Romney's tax plan, Pelosi said. "Here's a guy who wants you to pay more when I think, 'I' meaning Harry Reid, somebody told me he hasn't even paid his taxes. But he wants you to pay more to underwrite tax cuts for the wealthy. ... It's like a double doozy." Ultimately, she said, it's up to the American people to decide if it matters to them that Romney releases his tax returns -- a standard practice for presidential candidates -- or whether they feel it's none of their business. "They'll make a judgment," Pelosi said. "I think it's a loser issue for him. But I'm not doing his campaign."</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1344263980000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344264065000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Do you like TV wrestling?

This thing will stick like glue unless you have proof to show Harry is a liar. I think you are the liar mitt. you have a long record of being a compulsive liar. The quotation "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." comes from Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, scene II, where it is spoken by Queen Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. The phrase has come to mean that one can "insist so passionately about something not being true that people suspect the opposite of what one is saying."[1] The phrase is often misquoted as "Methinks the lady doth protest too much."[2] and is commonly used in the second person as "Methinks thou dost protest too much." Furthermore, the above meaning is based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word "protest" as it was used in Shakespeare's day, as the "protest" of the lady is not a protest in the modern sense of the word, but an affirmation or avowal.[3] The phrase's actual meaning implies the increasing likelihood of suppressed feelings for the contrary of that which is being argued. I.e., the more passionate and fervent the argument, the greater likelihood the cause is a suppression of belief for the contrary argument, and the subsequent confirmation that it is the (actual) truer statement. The phrase is used frequently today. For example, a 2000 episode of the television program Moesha was titled "He Doth Protest Too Much". An unaired episode of the television program Out of Practice was titled "The Lady Doth Protest Too Much". Andrew Klavan wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times in 2006 called "Clinton Doth Protest Too Much."[4] Alanis Morissette wrote a song named "Doth I Protest Too Much", for her album So-Called Chaos.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1344270149000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 12:22:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344270551000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Romney twerps doth protest too much.</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1344270149000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 12:22:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did not have sex with that woman for example.

I see no interest in tablets at the moment because it is not a real necessity. Whereas the laptop form factor is still a must. I don't see a very different form factor such as a tablet replacing the physical and in many cases the performance aspects of a laptop that are necessary to do important tasks. By the way, do you or anybody else have any insight as to when Motorola will launch an Intel based smartphone? I'm still waiting to buy one for myself. Hopefully, someone else announces smartphones here in the United States that will have Intel inside, to put some pressure on Motorola to get their Intel based devices to market, soon. I would love to own one. Tried the iPhone and was not that crazy about the performance.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1344274268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344278356000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation (INTC)</Title><Username>angleasda518189</Username><Timestamp>1344090421000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:27:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this article.</Msg><Username>lezlieojs27908</Username><Timestamp>1344278356000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 14:39:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344278812000-36</Id><Title>TO MY FRIENDS</Title><Msg>FOR MY FRIENDS</Msg><Username>bilng_sinte</Username><Timestamp>1344278812000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 14:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344280031000-37</Id><Title>My Favorite Thing</Title><Msg>When wallis alias "paul_ottelini" posts messages to wallis.

I view that segment primarily as an entertainment device much like a small TV that you carry around but also provides access to the Internet and some low-level gaming. Works very well for kids all the time - and for adults when they are in a relaxed mode yet want to be browsing/watching YouTube/communicating via Skype etc. - all activities that don't require extensive keyboard input. Though you can have a couple of laptops and a couple of tablets for everyone at home to have access to a device all the time, hybrid/convertible laptops would do wonders especially when you're traveling and don't want to carry all the devices. Depending on the age of family members, I see every family moving towards some combination of hybrid laptops and tablets.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344280227000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:10:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344280356000-39</Id><Title>FHF in Progress</Title><Msg>shoukld be unch by 4pm</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1344280356000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:12:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344281513000-40</Id><Topic><Title>My Favorite Thing</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1344280031000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:07:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really?</Msg><Username>bilng_sinte</Username><Timestamp>1344281513000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:31:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344282232000-41</Id><Title>Insmell losing ground with a P/E of 11</Title><Msg>&amp; 3.4% Div what the hell</Msg><Username>fmsg35</Username><Timestamp>1344282232000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344283208000-42</Id><Topic><Title>SP500:1400 =OVERBOUGHT</Title><Username>sushibn</Username><Timestamp>1344282030000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:40:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which leg of yours is down?</Msg><Username>boiled_n_oil</Username><Timestamp>1344283208000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 16:00:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344283359000-43</Id><Title>Stupid CNBC says Olympians shouldn't pay taxes on cash winnings!</Title><Msg>The country is broke and these people will make millions in edorsements which will make what we buy cost more.

Given its combination of affordability, portability and long battery life it's also possibly one of the best laptops for students so far. Although it uses a low-voltage 2nd Gen Intel Core i3 and a combination of 320GB mechanical hard disk drive and 20GB solid state drive (rather than an SSD-only storage system like most expensive Ultrabooks), it's capable of running productivity applications comfortably. Staff from Notebook Hunter and APC magazine have tested this model extensively and have found that it can easily handle most common computing tasks and provides excellent battery life to boot, in the 4-5 hour range. At only 1.4kg the all-metal Aspire S3 definitely feels light and solid, and even stylish. It also has a good set of ports, including two USB 2.0 and a HDMI port. In short, while it's not as powerful as some Ultrabook alternatives the Acer S3 is now great value for under $600 if you're looking for a really affordable but super-portable laptop with reasonable performance and excellent battery life. http://apcmag.com/notebookhunter/deals/acer-s3-391-first-ultrabook-under-600.htm</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344302455000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 21:20:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344308390000-57</Id><Topic><Title>SP500:1400 =OVERBOUGHT</Title><Username>sushibn</Username><Timestamp>1344282030000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:40:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your butthole is overbought.</Msg><Username>ccv3r1fy</Username><Timestamp>1344308390000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 22:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
