Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is seeing the threat presented by ARM Holdings plc (LON:ARM) in the PC market fading fast. This is according to tech analyst Richard Windsor who has described ARM's foray into the PC market as something of a disaster: "Thanks to the blunder that is Windows RT (Windows 8 on ARM), ARM has made no real impact in the PC space and the outlook for it to do so is fading fast. In addition, Intel Corp continues to catch ARM in the mobile sector, "Intel is far from standing still and the more time that goes by the closer Intel gets and the less that the gap matters," says Windsor. INTEL MITIGATING THE GREATEST THREAT IT HAS EVER FACED Windsor goes on to say that Intel's latest chip core aimed at the mobile space, called Silvermont, is a major step forward for INTC: "I have already seen Intel powered smartphones that are sleek looking, competitive on specification and price and can go a full day on a single charge. "For me, this turns the tables. "For years, I have been concerned that Intel stood to lose share in its core markets of PCs and servers, but now I am starting to think the opposite. "As handheld devices need to be increasingly powerful, there is scope for Intel to even take market share from ARM as it is at last beginning to compete on a level playing field. "Intel is not expensive and seems to be showing results in mitigating the greatest threat that it has ever faced." Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) technicals INTEL CORPORATION TECHNICALS Looking at the Intel Corp share price we note analysts at Trading Central are bullish on the stock: "As long as 21.7 is support, we are bullish with next up targets at 24.65, 25.4 and even 26.9." Trading Central are of the opinion that the immediate trend remains up and the momentum is strong.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368508748306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 01:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368511059655-4</Id><Topic><Title>Intel sees the threat of ARM fading fast in the rearview mirror.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368508748306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 01:19:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel doesn't face a threat from ARM. The mobile chip market is small compared to the huge PC chip market. Intel faces a threat from consumers choosing not to buy PCs and therefore net expenditure per person on computing resources going down a lot. Intel has always counted on that to grow and now for the first time it's started shrinking. This has thrown off its projections and brought into question its huge capital outlay for the future when growth in "cash cow" sectors is not a given.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1368511059655</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 01:57:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368511104977-5</Id><Title>Intel Haswell models ready to ship</Title><Msg>A torrent of announcements is expected at Taipei's Computex fair next month and the first designs are ready and shipping. The first Haswell-based notebooks have already shipped and they are expected to arrive in retail channels by the end of the month, which means we shouldn’t see many paper launches at Computex. It’s not just Intel’s skin on the line, either. Microsoft is already taking a lot of flak over lackluster Windows 8 sales, Nvidia is hoping to grow its discrete GPU market share on Haswell notebooks, Seagate and Western Digital have both rolled out Ultrabook friendly 5mm hard drives and hybrid drives and the list goes on. With so much at stake, plenty of big players have a vested interest in helping Intel’s Haswell push, which offers some hope of good news for consumers as it should translate into better value for money.

[True. But ARM does face a threat from Intel. Intel tablet sales are doubling each quarter and Intel smartphones are getting traction. Intel only needs moderate growth to move up whereas ARM needs huge growth just to stay where it's at. ARM's fabrication is fading to black while Intel's moves ahead like a steamroller. Haswell in three weeks and Intel's 14nm FinFET volume production at the end of the year. ARM has nothing to match either one. Not hard to see where this ends.

That processor, along with a crush of new systems, is slated for rollout on June 3 at Computex in Taiwan. But NEC is talking specs already in Japan. In addition to the Haswell chip (about which NEC provided little additional data), the LaVie L will sport a 15.6-inch IPS touch screen (1,920x1,080 resolution), 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive with a 32GB solid-state drive cache, Windows 8, and Microsoft Office Home and Business. The higher-end model is expected to be priced in Japan around 200,000 yen (a little less than $2,000) at retail in Japan. Intel's Haswell announcement on June 3 is expected to bring a flood of desktop, laptop, convertible, detachable, and tablet announcements.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368521935607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 04:58:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368522188732-10</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein has gone to a new low.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368503727911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 23:55:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bernstein raised some interesting questions but of course they reached totally wrong conclusions from it.

Everybody knows the silicon transistor only has some limited time left but other materials are being looked at like graphene. You can also do other things to increase transistor density before then like 3-D chip structure stacking and 3-D die structures like cubes where one of the faces is empty and on the motherboard and where the electricity is fed in to the other active 4 or 5 sides. Beyond transistors everybody has to look for an atomic switching mechanism involving electrons and/or light to replicate what transistors do i.e. having an on/off state. Intel along with IBM is in the vanguard of such research. Whenever Moore's law ends for silicon transistors Intel will be there for the next step in computing technology, will the foundry FABs though ?</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368522188732</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 05:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368523503556-11</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein has gone to a new low.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368503727911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 23:55:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One caution would be that their words are being copy/pasted and strung together by Ray Tiernan. Tieman may be the author of the TECH TRADER DAILY but he has demonstrated the ability to string together clips to get the wrong answer. The Linley Gwenap article was very nice and will (or should) make a much bigger impact. Those who talk Intel ASP, profit margin and revenues should read this article and factor in the extra foundry costs into the QCOM, NVDA, .... products that Intel (with their real 22nm TriGate process .... no 14nm) builds. everyone is extrapolating historical numbers forward to estimate QCOM costs. The Linley article should be of interest to those companies who want a REAL edge in pricing and margins going forward (Apple vs Samsung). The Intel foundry margins will likely be more than TSMC since the Intel final wafer costs are less.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368523503556</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 05:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368523799568-12</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein has gone to a new low.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368503727911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 23:55:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"(with their real 22nm TriGate process .... no 14nm) " after re-reading, I think my "no 14nm" might be misinterpreted.

RT was never going to be a success as the ARM camp would envision. It was, and still is probably seen as a huge success by Microsoft because their primary objective was not to help ARM take over the world,... it was to light a fire under Intel's butt. One can argue whether or not Microsoft's approach had an impact on Intel's behavior, (I think not), but either way they got what they were after. A hardware platform to extend the reach of their x86 SW empire. Back to your original thought,... it will be far grander than the RT experience because not only has ARM been crushed on their way into the PC/enterprise space,... but with all the advances being made by Intel there will be no safe haven for ARM where Intel is not competing aggressively.

It makes perfect sense, running Bay Trail. The overall fudd from ARM fans is that there is a lot of competition out there, and Intel will have a hard time standing out . The competition out there is between other ARM SoCs. Intel will be the first real competition ARM has. The iPad Pro with an Intel Bay Trail processor can run OS/X. Tell me that's not appealing? Apple will love it because it will bridge their huge iPad market to their much smaller OS/X market and hopefully open the door to computer sales. Of the many, many options out there from ARM, some with arguably better specs than an Atom quad core, which one can do this in non-emulation mode? That's why if you're betting against Intel, sooner or later time will run out on you.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1368544195849</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:09:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368544419115-72</Id><Topic><Title>Game of Thrones: ARM-Slayer</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368543134774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 10:52:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And are you willing to "put money on it" that these new will beat Airmont "in all known benchmarks (except Javacript)."?

Even if CPU growth is slowing it provides the necessary volume for Intel. There are finally articles popping up that question TSMC's capabilities Top Five Design and Manufacturing Challenges at 20nm Is Moore’s Law slowing down? “The answer is that it is not for the memory and processor IDMs, but definitely for the foundries,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc. “The alarming thing about it is that the ability of foundries to convert their process development and tool investments into revenues has been steadily declining since 130nm. The importance of 130nm is that’s when process and design began to be recoupled. The result was the rise of DFM, which didn’t exist before then.”... ”What’s more scary about the chart is that the decline is predictable, forming a steady downward trend,” said Hutcheson. ”Meanwhile, the fabless companies at the leading edge, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm are visibly concerned about their foundries’ ability to keep up with Moore’s Law. To stay in the game they need a steady decline in cost-per-transistor. If anything, this chart certainly puts into question the common wisdom that the fabless-foundry model is impenetrable.”</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1368547994422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:13:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368548062610-89</Id><Title>This stock is so very pathetic</Title><Msg>Comp up 26 points, nearly every solid tech company is in the green and this turd is underperforming...

If Apple jump over to x86 they'll need to provide a dynamic translator (which will kill performance) or do some funky business in the store to provide the correct binary to the correct device (the most likely solution).

The problem in American is that the rich like the poor being stupid. 5% of the people have 80% of the money and assets. They like having it all and they do not care when the poor go nuts. Now if you happen to be a lucky one born to a rich family or you were lucky and born with an IQ of 140 or higher and are relatively good looking, you do not have to worry about money. It falls your way when ever you want it where ever you are. That is just the way it is. I was born with both and I have always been lazy and yet I graduated from a great University with honors. I have always gotten jobs easily and women too. Not until I have gotten older have I understood how random things are. My wife is hot and NO, she did not go with me for the money. She is not stupid. She went for looks and money--HAAA HAAA. But to be fair, I chose her because she was so so sexy and smart too. We think we work hard but wait a minute? Do I work in the fields? NO Do I kiss rump for a manager at a company? NO We own and operate our own businesses and like you clowns here, we make huge money in the stock market doing nothing. Life is good but it sure sucks for the masses. Both Republican rich and Democratic rich agree about that. The difference is that the Dems want to throw them a twig now and then but the GOP want to push them down even lower. My advice to any young person is to be a doctor, a good lawyer, or start your own business. Screw working for a company. They cannot pay you enough to make it worth being their lapdogs. Some of the managers at a place like Intel are so so stupid and yet you have to lick their rumps.

The 50% IPC increase in Saltwell does tally with the 40-50% of the A15 over the A9. All said and done even if Silvermont and the A15 have similar performance numbers at the same clock I would still expect Silvermont to be able to maintain a higher clock (and/or in turbo).

Google gives up on the Xphone! The Google XPhone is no longer in development at Mountain View, which has abandoned this project forward to Motorola. It would be the first smartphone developed since the acquisition of Motorola Mobility. So many rumors have circulated about this mobile that would change the face of the industry. The high-tech enthusiasts were waiting for the powerful new camera _a ceramic design_ that this mobile "had to offer" ... Motorola will take care of the development of this new Smartphone while Google would prefer to focus on the 5th generation Nexus model. Therefore the Google XPhone does not exist anymore, and will appear under the name Motorola XT1058. Sun Chang Xu, a renowned Chinese analyst gives his version of events. She explains that Google wanted to abandon the project due to lack of technology and innovation. The Mountain View company is no longer interested in the development unlike Motorola, which would take over the design. And the only way to confirm this news is to wait for the Google I/O, that starts tomorrow to see if the XPhone will be absent.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368564665815</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368564977284-166</Id><Title>Don't care...

Though first announced by new kid on the block type vendors, the major announcements for datacenter server powerhouses HP and Dell have taken microservers from the category of technically interesting to potential useful tool in the datacenter hardware scheme. A report in EE Times this week disclosed that Samsung was working on ARM SOC implementations for release in 2014. Samsung is a licensee of the ARM v8 64-bit specification so that means we are likely to see these chips appear as 64-bit designs, as opposed to all of the current ARM SoC implementations that major vendors are using or announced, which are all still based on the 32-bit ARM design. 64-bit Arm-based SoC implementations are where the future of datacenter microservers lies. In the case of HP and Dell, they are sourcing their ARM SoC solutions from other parties. In the case of Samsung, they are the gold-standard for ARM processors; especially those in smartphones, where they produce almost all of the CPUs found in the world’s bestselling smartphone lines (Apple, and not coincidentally, Samsung). Their Exynos multi-core CPUs are the cores of the most powerful smartphones on the market and their announcement this week of the next generation of those chips claims that they will have a performance increased over the current models and a 30% reduction in power consumption.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1368569196706</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:06:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368571979511-175</Id><Title>Weak hands will ride this down to 19</Title><Msg>There is better money to be made elsewhere.

In a report, Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap has said "Moore's Mountain" will sort out the men from the boys and favour Intel in the long run. Gwennap said that Moore's Law is not running out of steam, but the increasing cost of producing smaller and smaller transistors faces some companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing with huge bills. Gwennap uses a case study of the fairly routine shrink from 40nm LP to 28nm LP, TSMC and other foundries rolled out high-k metal-gate (HKMG) technology, which reduced leakage power. The HKMG process is more expensive than the standard 28nm version, but both have the same transistor density. At 20nm, HKMG becomes mandatory, because otherwise the leakage of the tiny gates would be overwhelming. Double patterning is also needed at this node, adding more cost. FinFETs, another technology to reduce power, compound the cost problem. TSMC is adding FinFETs to its 20nm process and calling it 16nm FF, but the transistor density remains unchanged, Gwennap wrote. While other foundries have a similar plan for their first-generation FinFETs, wafer cost will more than double between 28nm LP and 16nm FF, but the transistor density will only double. This means that the cost per transistor will increase during this transition. What we have seen in the past is that wafer costs have risen gradually while transistor counts have doubled every two years. These trends have slashed the cost per transistor over the past 40 years, leading to chips integrating hundreds of millions of transistors but selling for less than $10. Gwennap thinks that Nvidia, Broadcom, and Qualcomm can pass along the higher costs of more expensive transistors, while those selling into markets for cheaper devices may not be able to afford the most expensive process technology.

Gwennap wrote that Intel seems immune to the troubles that the foundries are facing. It has been shipping PC and server processors built in its 22nm FinFET process since last year and plans to begin production using its 14nm FinFET process by the end of this year. Thanks to the huge amount of cash Intel has chucked at process development, it can move from node to node, outpacing TSMC and others. Of course, this is assuming that there is a continued demand for ever shrinking chips. Gwennap and Chipzilla could become unstuck if the industry said "we don't want smaller chips and are happy with these slightly cheaper bigger ones, thanks very much". So far they have not said that, but it is possible that a pain threshold will be reached where manufacturers can't be bothered writing more cheques for shrinks that do not give them a noticeable benefit.

Samsung, TSMC, GF and UMC combined capex is projected $20 billion just in 2013 and due to FinFet they expect double digit growth in 2014 (see room for growth for semiconductor equipment , Samsung capex which also includes memory is projected at $12.9 billion). Intel capex at $12 billion including $2 billion for 450mm. Intel is now setting the bar - one thing about capex is that they need to spend in relatively large chuncks - there could be over supply within the ARM foundry camp and there will be fierce competition among the ARM foundries (TSMC said majority of 2013 capex goes into 28nm!) . Pretty soon the AZ fab will go online. I believe the new CEO will utilize Intels "older" fabs to grow non ARM foundry business - the ARM foundries might face competition where they never expected it.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1368574306166</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 19:31:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368574745075-185</Id><Title>Marcopubio, LOL</Title><Msg>I lost so much money on FB By marcopubio.Jun 4, 2012 12:00 AM.Permalink I'm going to kill the wife before she gets a chance to see our brokerage statement.

I hope there is no double ordering. "Please, sir, I want some more." Chipset players queuing up for TSMC production capacity Cage Chao, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES [Tuesday 14 May 2013] International and domestic chipset vendors have begun to queue up at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in order to secure production capacity for 40nm, 28nm and more advanced processes, according to industry sources. Order visibility of TSMC's 28nm and 40nm processes has extended to the end of the third quarter of 2013, and some clients have begun to book space for the additional capacity of advanced process nodes to be added by TSMC in the third quarter, the sources revealed. While some international chipset vendors have recently placed followed-up orders for those they placed in the prior quarter, some Taiwan-based IC design houses have increased their orders for wafer starts by 30-50% sequentially in the second quarter, the sources revealed. Backed up by the influx of new orders, TSMC is expected to see its revenues climb month by month in the second and third quarters, the sources commented.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1368587401837</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 23:10:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368588031579-222</Id><Title>SHORTS BEWARE</Title><Msg>Not only could there be a possible design win coming from Google I/o event starting tomorrow, but shorts have to deal with several events that could lead to big deals.

Bay Trail tablets and hybrid products in 7" form factors running full Windows 8 will invade the market at $200 price point. In addition other tablets produced on fully depreciated 32nm process will be sold as well. My guess, these tablets will sell under $200. Finally Merrifield SoC for smartphones come into the market. For sure Merrifield with xmm 7160 baseband will target the US market. Watch for major phone deals coming up.

Here's the single most important piece of information: At 90nm there were 19 ARM foundries. At 65/55nm there were 16. At 45/40 there were 12. At 32/28nm there were 8. At 16/14nm there will be three. That number could drop to one (Samsung). Regardless the trend is incontrovertible. The fabless model is broken. There is no other reason for a decline from 19 to 3 foundries. And why are the number of ARM fabs dropping like a rock? Money pure and simple. The fabless model doesn't provide nearly enough money for CapEx or R&amp;D. The ARM foundries have therefore tried to get by with "just good enough." And it has resulted in disaster with no access to FinFET (insufficient R&amp;D spending) and insufficient manufacturing capacity (insufficient CapEx availability). And a drop in the number of ARM foundries that if you extend the trend line drops to zero. And here's your proof: 93 fabless Series A Semiconductor Fundings in 2000, 42 in 2004, 16 in 2006, 16 in 2007, and 3 in 2012. Funding for foundries has dropped like a rock and the number of foundries has dropped in a corresponding manner. No money. No fabs. Not rocket science.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368589252225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 23:40:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368589343394-229</Id><Title>ARM is Toast: 16 Reasons (Part II)</Title><Msg>Here are the results or perhaps the symptoms of the breaking of the ARM fabless model: 1.) Fewer fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368589343394</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 23:42:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368589439179-230</Id><Title>ARM is Toast: 16 Reasons (Part III)</Title><Msg>11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. It means a extra cost of 50-100M USD per year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368589439179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 23:43:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368589541134-231</Id><Title>ARM is Toast: 16 Reasons (Part IV)</Title><Msg>Conclusion The fabless fabrication model has been in decline for years. Now the absence of adequate R&amp;D spending has shown up to finish it off. No FinFET, no state-of-the-art technology, no roadmap beyond 20nm, no future. Along with insufficient manufacturing capacity. Does anyone really think that something will happen to increase the number of foundries up from three rather than down to one? Nothing in the trends, dynamics or funding suggests that anything other than a continuation of the trend is possible. Pull the curtains. Cue the lights.
