Intel value priced the extra chipset functions. Intel does not compete on price. Since the mobile CPU and mobile chipset supported 802.11b automatically, there was no need for any extra stand alone 802.11b chips. Intel probably increased the mobile chipset price by more than Intersil charged for their 802.11b part. There were just many, many fewer dedicated 802.11b sockets for Intersil and Broadcom to sell into. Intel is similarly integrating SoC functions AND MORE into their products. Reverse engineer? Not unless Intel is begging for a patent lawsuit from the patent owners. With all the mobile market patent lawsuits, royalty and licensing fees .... Intel will be very careful to avoid infringement. I DO agree with your basic assessment about Intel cramming functions in the package. That is why Intel has spent the last several years accumulating clean title to the mobile patents they now have.

Written by Mike James Friday, 19 April 2013 13:00 What is Intel up to? It has just released a set of really good HLML5 tools, potentially the best yet, that allows you to create apps that are platform independent. This raises more questions that it answers. Why is an "Intel Inside" sticker on HTML5 so important? If you are creating or thinking of creating a Web app using JavaScript then you need to know about what Intel is up to. Its latest offering makes it possible, and in fact easy, to create a web app that will work on mobile and desktop devices and then package it for all of the app stores you want to support. If this is as good as it seems to be, it is a winning tool and a way to really make apps that are write once and run everywhere. Intel took the opportunity of launching its revamped developer offering for HTML5 apps at the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing in April. The aim is very high as you can tell from the title of a recent blog post - "One Code Base to Rule Them All". You might think that this is a null claim as HTML5 is standardized, but this is to miss the point that an HTML app running on different platforms has a very different runtime environment. The APIs available in a desktop browser aren't the same as those in an Android Phone and there are even differences between a Chrome and a Firefox packaged app.</Msg><Username>agermangymnast</Username><Timestamp>1366489121162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 16:18:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366497638646-11</Id><Title>Where are the shorts?</Title><Msg>I notice there are long stretches where there are absolutely no short posters.

"We work very closely with them and we're constantly looking down the road at what we can be doing relative to future products. I'd go as far as to say Apple helps shape our roadmap," Kilroy said. "Apple -- they push us hard," he said. "There are certain customers that would be interesting to us and certain customers that wouldn't," Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told journalists after an investor event in London on Thursday. He said Intel would be happy to produce chip cores based on its own architecture for other companies but that allowing rival architectures to be manufactured in its plants would be a tough decision. "If Apple or Sony came to us and said 'I want to do a product that involves your IA (Intel architecture) core and put some of my IP around it', I wouldn't blink. That would be fantastic business for us." "Then you get into the middle ground of 'I don't want it to be a IA core, I want it to be my own custom-designed core,' and then you are only getting the manufacturing margin, (and) that would be a much more in-depth discussion and analysis."</Msg><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1366516346558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 23:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
