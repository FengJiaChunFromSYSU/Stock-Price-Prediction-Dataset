And just over the last 2 weeks, this same publication had an article on Apple possibly coming out with a Hybrid Mac-iPad device - a laptop with a detachable screen. ARM can do Tablets and Smartphones now....but can they compete with Bay Trail Tablets and Merrifield Smartphones. More importantly, can they even have an entre into the 2-for-1 convertibles and detachables form factor? I think not. ================================== The New Ultrabook Convertible and Detachable Category Gives Consumers a 2 for 1 Computer Deal The main keynote delivered at IDF Beijing 2013 last week titled "Reinventing the Intel Computing Experience" was delivered by Kirk Skaugen, Senior VP, General Manager PC Client Group. Early into Skaugen's keynote he made the observation that at the end of the day "we're all both consumption and creation people. On one hand, we consume news on our phones and tablets every day. But we're also creation people. So there's room for a new and exciting category that we're calling the Ultrabook Convertible and Detachable. Simply put it's a 2 for 1 computing device that's the best of a PC with a full quad core experience and a fantastic tablet." If there was one message that Intel hammered home at IDF Beijing, it was definitely that the coming wave of Ultrabook Convertible products arriving this summer will deliver the very best 2 for 1 computer deal and experience that the industry has to offer. The multiple slides presented during Skaugen's keynote and throughout IDF prove this out.

The key question is will they announce the deal tomorrow. A billion dollar added revenue with 50%+ margins would be good for guidance! ===================== Cisco has to fab chips at an Intel foundry Analysis: It isn't a choice as much as a requirement Apr 15, 2013 by Charlie Demerjian Cisco is going to make chips with Intel as a foundry for one simple reason, they have to. Why they have to do so is a simple question with an equally simple answer if you have the background to understand it. In the foundry space there are five main players, TSMC, Global Foundries, Samsung, IBM, and now Intel. From there you get to a bunch of second tier players that we will ignore for the time being. It is unlikely that a company with Cisco’s technical needs could find their fab needs met by the B-squad of the process world. Most companies that want to fab with Intel need bleeding edge process tech anyway and are willing to pay to get it. If you had to rank these five vendors on a process quality basis it would go Intel then other with not much to choose from between the others. Each new process brings a new set of stumbles, and over time they average out to rough parity. Sometimes one is way ahead, sometimes one stumbles, but none of these are consistently ahead of the other four. semiaccurateDOTcom/2013/04/15/cisco-has-to-fab-chips-at-an-intel-foundry/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366039331324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:22:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366039389526-62</Id><Topic><Title>This stock is going to the MOON!</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1363965968442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very bad news tomorrow morning</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1366039389526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:23:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366040701821-63</Id><Topic><Title>This stock is going to the MOON!</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1363965968442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow INTC goes below $20.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1366040701821</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366041666613-64</Id><Topic><Title>This stock is going to the MOON!</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1363965968442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Highly unlikely, unless there is some unexpected bad news released.

Within that, around US$4.5 billion came from an increase in smartphone/tablet revenues. If our analysis is correct in that smartphone units continue to grow but semi content starts to decrease, from 2013 to 2015, we estimate that smartphone/tablet related revenues only grow by US$3 billion. Within the incremental US$3 billion, we assume around half of it comes from TSMC’s share gain with Apple. This means for the other handset/tablet makers, total revenues only grow by US$1.5 billion over the next two years, despite an incremental 570 million units, mainly because content per device goes down [...] Looking ahead, at 20nm, several of the world’s leading customers have complained that the performance increase relative to the previous node is not as big as in previous nodes, and the cost increase is more. This makes 20nm economically unattractive. We therefore think 20nm could be a node that ramps more slowly than 28nm. We also do not see this problem going away. While TSMC is accelerating 16nm development to entice customers to move ahead, our concern is that the risk/reward is becoming more skewed towards the negative.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366044922885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 12:55:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366045453788-71</Id><Title>Pathetic Wallisweaver tries to outpost you</Title><Msg>Remember when he used to 1-star posts he hated into oblivion?

Back to intel I think the guidance will be a so-so by that I mean no commitments as such to raise the bar too high for the next incoming CEO Wally Woofer.

If this is true, it will allow such advances as vastly improved system-to-system interconnects in the data center. The 100Gb/sec module was demoed in a video during Intel CTO Justin Rattner’s keynote presentation at the Beijing Intel Developer Forum on Thursday. All modulators, detectors, waveguides, circuitry, and the aforementioned laser will be incorporated in garden-variety silicon instead of the hand-built, gallium arsenide based photonics modules such as are presently available, which are expensive. Since integrated silicon photonics modules could be fabbed using existing equipment and tested using a hybrid of conventional and Intel-developed techniques, such speedy modules could be created much more cheaply, and therefore eventually work their way into far more devices and systems. Sun Microsystems cofounder and current Arista Networks chairman and chief development officer Andy Bechtolsheim stated in a discussion with Rattner, that the major obstacle of a 100Gb/sec Ethernet is that it lacks practicality till the price of the optics are slashed down substantially to a reasonable sum. However, he went on to add that due to the technology of silicon photonics modules such as those Intel demonstrated on Thursday, the 100Gb/sec will be extremely viable for the networking industry. The current 100Gb/sec throughput is nowhere near the top end of silicon photonics capabilities, as Rattner said at the Open Compute Conference. When asked about the scalability, he replied that Intel is trying for terabit-per-second throughput. marketnewscallDOTcom/intel-corporation-nasdaqintc-shows-demo-video-of-cheap-100gbsec-silicon-photonics-chip/121002/</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366072220414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 20:30:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366074130396-126</Id><Topic><Title>well, I am nervous about tomorrow.</Title><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1366066952627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 19:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$1 divy?

Ivy Bridge-E is on schedule to launch in Q3 2013, using the same LGA 2011 socket, existing X79 chipset as well as four channel DDR3 1866 support. There have been some rumours that Intel even considered cancelling this chipset in favour of speeding up the launch of Haswell-E, the next generation high end enthusiast chip, but so far that hasn’t been announced to partners. Haswell-E has support for upcoming DDR4 memory as well four channel memory, promising much more bandwidth compared to the previous generation. It comes with up to 12 or 16 cores and should deliver tons of computing power. Looking at the server side of things, four channel DDR4 memory and 12 to 16 cores will make a great chip for high end servers and sitting at 130W. It won't save a lot of trees in the Amazon, but it will offer a lot of compute power. At current schedule Haswell-E should show up in later part of 2014, in case Intel doesn’t change its mind and speed up the introduction of this new enthusiast core.
