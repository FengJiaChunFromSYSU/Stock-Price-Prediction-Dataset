And most kids go to school and quickly find out what they can do on a tablet is extremely limited. It's Apple that is really behind now. They don't even have touch on their laptops. Google has moved past them.Maybe you've seen the Apple stock price lately. It confirms that few are impressed with Apple's innovation. Everyone is either moving up on them or moving past them. And if they don't strike a deal with Intel for fabrication it's going to get worse. Intel will soon be able to scale the Windows OS from desktops to smartphones. Apple's not even close to doing this. Intel has dual boot for the best of all worlds. I could go on and on.

Haswell makes new ultrabooks, convertibles and hybrids more attractive as a category due to its vastly improved battery life and integral graphics. Integral graphics helps cost reduce these products making them more affordable. Core architecture already dominated high-end tablets. Haswell continues this but greatly increases the attractiveness of the high-end tablet for the same power efficiency and graphics for the same benefit Haswell gives to ultrabooks. Intel's Next Unit of Computing (NUC) devices used for mini-servers, development machines, and small form factor appliances will also benefit from Haswell's power efficiency making these 4 inch square-sized computers the darling of product designers and software developers. Of course, everything above can run Windows and Linux.

With the potential development site in north Hillsboro under a legal cloud, they introduced a bill this week that could expedite the project by blocking land-use challenges. But lawmakers said they hope that courts will clear the 330-acre property by the end of this month, obviating the need for "emergency" legislation. "Project Azalea" is the code name for an unnamed industrial employer considering sites in Hillsboro and upstate New York -- and possibly elsewhere -- according to Oregon economic development officials. Word of the project leaked out late last year with details indicating that it's a computer chip factory, known as a fab. But specifics remain elusive -- especially the identity of the company behind the project. Only a handful of corporations build fabs on that scale.</Msg><Username>luv2_bike</Username><Timestamp>1365349843287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 11:50:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365350287817-25</Id><Topic><Title>Oregon is a finalist for a massive electronics factory</Title><Username>luv2_bike</Username><Timestamp>1365349629255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 11:47:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good for the US economy &amp; Oregon of course and particularly good news for INTC</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1365350287817</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 11:58:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365351532451-26</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>veatch.robert</Username><Timestamp>1365351532451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 12:18:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365351789073-27</Id><Topic><Title>Walbert Weiner loves stocks that are in downtrends !!</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365348233725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 11:23:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think he helps push them down.

This can turn into big news. Some comments I found: There have been many research projects that have looked at combining Atom and "big cores" e.g. Ivy Bridge and Haswell as well as ARM processors to handle low-level OS functions and some applications while the bigger cores are sleeping. In fact, I think Dell had a laptop that had both "ARM &amp; Intel Inside" to do roughly the same thing. The A15 is a hot, complex chip that's not particularly performant for the power nor does it yield particularly well. That A7 companion chip and the entire Big.Little concept is a tacit admission of that regrettable reality. ------------------------ I'll ask around but I can tell you that many of the A15 licensees are greatly disappointed with its perf/watt and associated manufacturability issues. ----------------------- a Dual core A15 @ 2GHz in our lab is consuming 4W. Mind you, this is just the CPU Cores. When we add the Graphics, Video and IOs, you are looking at around 6-7W. ARM is in big trouble. This big.Little is just a hog-wash.

At the same time nearly 25 percent is dedicated to production at 0.2-micron or greater geometries. The global wafer fab capacity across all manufacturers and geometries in 200-mm wafer equivalents was 14.5 million wafers per month (see figure 1). The market research firm has ranked manufacturing companies by their installed capacity in four categories. At the leading edge (below 40nm) Samsung leads followed by Intel, Toshiba/SanDisk, SK Hynix and Micron (see figure 2). The ranking reflects the significance of memory to production volumes, but not necessarily revenues. IC Insights has divided global installed capacity, as of the end of 2012, into six categories based on the minimum geometry of the processes used in wafer fabrication. About 27 percent of global wafer capacity was for devices having geometries smaller than 40nm (see figure 1). Such devices include high-density DRAM, which are typically built using 30nm- to 20nm-class process technologies; high-density flash memory devices that are based on 20nm- to 10nm-class processes; and high-performance microprocessors and advanced ASIC/ASSP/FPGA devices based on 32/28nm or 22nm technologies. About 22 percent of global capacity is dedicated to "maure" process nodes at 90nm, 0.13-micron, and 0.18-micron. A variety of processes base on these nodes are offered by foundries including TSMC, UMC, GlobalFoundries, SMIC, and TowerJazz. Although the leading-edge of chip manufacturing has, up until now, been moving in line with Moore's law the business has a long tail and large quantities of standard analog and general-purpose logic are manufactured with well-established process technologies having larger than 0.4-micron feature sizes. In addition, high-voltage power semiconductors require large-geometry process technologies. Click on image to enlarge. Figure 1: Worldwide chip manufacturing capacity by geometry as of December 2012.

With many of ARM's licensees preparing to make a big splash in the server market, the firm claimed its architecture is the only one that scales from smartphones all the way up to servers. Lakshmi Mandyam, ARM director of Server Systems and Ecosystems told The INQUIRER that the ability to stick with one chip vendor and run the same operating system throughout its product stack is something "people find very interesting". ARM expects most of its servers to end up powering open source software stacks, which strongly suggests Linux as the underlying operating system, especially since FreeBSD's ARM port is seemingly in a state of flux. According to Mandyam, companies are increasingly interested in concentrating on a single processor and software stack, saying that vertical integration - the term given to keeping everything in-house - is once again becoming fashionable. Mandyam said, "In the industry there is a trend back towards vertical integration where if you look [back] 20 years [they] did their own ASIC, they did everything themselves and then after that it migrated to outsourced [then] to merchant silicon, but I think people are seeing a benefit for integrating again." Mandyam used Chinese consumer and enterprise IT vendor Huawei as an example of how ARM chips are deployed from its smartphones through to its network infrastructure equipment. She said, "Huawei uses the ARM architecture for handsets, set-top boxes, routers, base stations and they have talked publicly about their server intentions." According to Mandyam, ARM is the only vendor that can allow companies such as Huawei to stick to one architecture from smartphones to servers. "Definitely [customers] see the advantages of standardising across one architecture from low to high and ARM's the only architecture that can scale down to the low, and allow people to do integration. The integration curve is the other curve ARM can go down and the other guys can't." However Mandyam said the advantages of ARM weren't limited to just being able to deploy a single vendor's chips but also include the ability to deploy Linux throughout the product range. She said firms are working with Linaro's Enterprise Working Group in order to have some influence on the direction of enterprise Linux deployment because they see it as a key component to a cost-effective server. Mandyam said, "If you look at who is participating in Linaro's enterprise group, you have end users like Facebook that are participating as well, because they see the value of getting involved early and it really shortens the time to market. If you think about the Linux kernel, it's all standardised - based on the ARM architecture. Everyone, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel at different times, you have everyone cooperating." Despite Linaro's Enterprise Working Group containing many firms that compete against each other for business, Mandyam claims that Linux still allows them to "maintain differentiation" that is needed to get a competitive advantage. The combination of ARM's architecture scaling from embedded devices to servers combined with a similar capability for Linux could be the combination that allows firms to cut costs and ultimately increase profits. µ</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365379709878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365379861864-77</Id><Topic><Title>ARM says its chips and Linux will sweep the industry</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365379709878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>aladiesright and singhlion2001 are the same person...so obvious...Just get lost you pr*ck!</Msg><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365379861864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:11:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365381444652-78</Id><Topic><Title>A15 is a power hog</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365379049411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 19:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All this is nice to know but all I give a #$%$ about is about making money and I hope INTC goes to $5 a share and watch me back up the truck.....the financials tell the tell, they have a mountain of cash and doing buy backs of shares, the only problem I see is Warren Buffett in that why did he sell?</Msg><Username>gotburned26</Username><Timestamp>1365381444652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:37:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365383475584-79</Id><Topic><Title>A15 is a power hog</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365379049411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 19:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM Servers - UDX1 Ultra low power and high server density for hyperscale computing Power and cooling are the biggest facility challenges for most data centers. For typical cloud computing, web 2.0 and big data applications that are based on scale-out architectures high server densities and low power consumption are crucial to achieving low TCO. Based on Calxeda’s EnergyCore SoCs the UDX1 offers a ultra low power envelope of 5W per server and a server density of up to 48 servers in a 2U form factor. Workloads that up to this point required racks of conventional systems can now be handled by a group of servers in a single physical unit. The UDX1 features a modular architecture. A single module contains four server SoCs with four cores per SoC. The UDX1 can accommodate up to 12 modules. Calxeda’s SoC architecture integrates the entire system logic on a single die: ARM9 quad core processors including the Neon SIMD engine, L2 cache, BMC, SATA disk drive and memory controllers. Moreover each server features an on-chip 10 Gb Ethernet switch fabric that can scale out to up to 4,096 servers without the need for any additional external switches. The ultra low power envelope of the UDX1 is achieved through a separate, dedicated processor on each EnergyCore™ SoC that monitors and controls energy consumption in real-time. For both single-node and cluster-wide management, the embedded management engine is responsible for: Automated power management for 12 power domains per SoC Cluster-aware fabric management for power and routing optimizations Remote systems management interfaces The UDX1 ships with Canonical's Ubuntu or Redhat Fedora pre-installed on every server.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365383475584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 21:11:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365384586487-80</Id><Topic><Title>A15 is a power hog</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1365379049411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 19:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel Delivers the World's First 6-Watt Server-Class Processor Several Equipment Makers Building Microservers, Storage and Networking Systems Based on 64-bit Intel® Atom™ Processor S1200 Product Family NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel® Atom™ processor S1200 server system on-chip hits lower-power levels, and includes key features such as error code correction, 64-bit support, and virtualization technologies required for use inside data centers.

[Actually we don't believe you. All of the shill posts sound the same and are constructed the same. All lack content. All focus on character assassination instead of any discussion of the company, its technology or performance. There is therefore strong evidence (backed up by the message histories) that perhaps a hundred IDs are the work of the Dana Blankenhorn group and that yours is just one of them. You could disprove this by demonstrating a unique posting style that involves something other than consistent name calling and other than an adolescent level of maturity.

Vendors aren't looking for a one operating system environment, they are looking for a standardized hardware architecture to satisfy their customers needs in whatever environment the customer has. The best way for vendors to achieve goal that is for that architecture to be x86 that runs whatever OS the customer might want.
