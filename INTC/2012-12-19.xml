There first release was Nehelam CPU. They released an update of the Oracle database server products with Westmere that integrated the Intel IPP libraries and its hand tuned Westmere encryption/decryption routines. The Sandybridge CPU will be great for them since the Sandybridge runs much cooler, quieter (less cooling) and faster. I think Oracle even broke out the Exa* product lines in a separate result line on their earnings release.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1355894886790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 00:28:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355894983267-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's stock repurchase history</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355863334356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From my further research: As of the end of last quarter (3rd): - Intel has a share count of 4.98 billion. - Still has $6.3 billion from their stock purchase plan. If we add the $6 billion raised from the recent bond sale, we now have a total of $12.3 billion which can be used for stock repurchase If we estimate that Intel uses the $12.3 to repurchase shares at a VERY conservative average price of $24.60 for total repurchase of 500 million shares....the share count falls to 4.48 billion...that is roughly a 10% reduction. Future earnings will get a 10% boost in return. For example net income that would have had a quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share would become $0.72 with the share reduction. Or yearly earnings of $2.60 would become $2.86....significant indeed!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355894983267</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 00:29:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355896021286-4</Id><Topic><Title>Intel tablets keep getting delayed, why?</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1355888090326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:34:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is exactly right! In fact, if you listen to Paul Otellini at the recent Bernstein Conference, he said that by end of next year, there won't be any selling laptops that won't have touch! and also, from what he can tell, the PC "weakness" in recent years have been due to the weakness in the global macro environment. The weakness was further exacerbated in the last couple of quarters due to the timing of Windows 8 release.

Microsoft is going to be pushed back into playing its prior role of being an OS or software provider. If it continues to persist in the hardware space, it is going to lose all its OEMs who provide the most competitive pricing and products for its OS. Microsoft cannot be Apple, because it has never the been the integrated company that Apple has been from Day 1. Unfortunately, management can make crucial mistakes like this and carry on for a while as if everything is hunky-dory. What does this do for Intel? It gives Intel a stronger hand in dealing with Microsoft - unless Microsoft wants to design its own chips and manufacture them in a foundry. If they want to do this, they are just 10 years behind Apple! Intel wants to be the port-of-choice for all OS. They have a strong record and an unbeatable process lead. The OS guys will fall in line eventually. And any remaining ARM SoC vendor can keep Intel in line (if they can). ===================== With Surface tanking, Microsoft digs faster Clueless management masterclass, OEMs not laughing Microsoft just doesn’t know when to stop doing itself severe damage, and it’s latest desperate move is no exception. If you thought it’s ‘valued partners’ were incensed before, just wait until you see how happy they are now. The latest move is one again around that unloved child of Redmond that has seen abysmal sales. No not Windows 8, the other unloved child of Redmond, the Surface tablet. You might recall the highs and lows of Surface, and the soap opera it has become. This week, Microsoft has admitted their strategy is broken, Surface is failing, and so they backpedalled hard. Unfortunately, it was right over the feet of all the hardware partners that they had run over earlier, the ones they barely kept from outright rebellion a few months ago. ...... So the hard numbers started trickling out. Sales blew. Initial tablet sales, not including Surface, according to no less than NPD were sub-1% of first month Windows 8 machine sales, something akin to an unmitigated disaster. ....... Then word came from Taiwan that despite ‘selling out’, Microsoft had cut their Q4 parts order in half. It was only then that the company admitted the four million units were actually the entire Q4 order that they were hoping to sell. But didn’t. Even in spite of most of the competition dropping their, err, competitive product lines in their entirety. No word on returns, or actual sales, not shipments to dealers as some suspect. Surface couldn’t meet half of expected demand in spite of Windows 8, Christmas, and fanboi fervor. It is DOA. ...... And so Surface failed, and Microsoft reacted, and broke their promises to the entire OEM base. Now you can buy a Surface at Best Buy, others will soon follow. That sub-1% non-Surface tablet sales number may be the high water mark. See Microsoft. See Microsoft panic. See Microsoft have no clue. See Microsoft management flail. See Microsoft react. See Microsoft kick the other leg out from under their OEM partners. See problem? Microsoft sure doesn’t.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355922769286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:12:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355922804579-10</Id><Topic><Title>Found The Answer!</Title><Username>annieclift649</Username><Timestamp>1312212778000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-08-01 11:32:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its a Must See Chart Pattern</Msg><Username>lawrencejoshep</Username><Timestamp>1355922804579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:13:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355923674827-11</Id><Title>Looks like it's going to be a short fry today... finally above $21 in the pre-market</Title><Msg>See ya at the TOP!</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1355923674827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:27:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355923693279-12</Id><Topic><Title>Surface RT Tanks, Microsoft has few friends left if any</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355922769286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For the entire article, check out SemiAccurate.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355923693279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:28:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355924278474-13</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's stock repurchase history</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355863334356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Retire is the key word here</Msg><Username>grizzly534</Username><Timestamp>1355924278474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:37:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355924326024-14</Id><Topic><Title>Surface RT Tanks, Microsoft has few friends left if any</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355922769286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you spell B-a-l-l-m-e-r ?</Msg><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1355924326024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:38:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355925386767-15</Id><Topic><Title>Surface RT Tanks, Microsoft has few friends left if any</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355922769286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SemiAccurate is not reliable to begin with, see D.A.N for example. lol just the same it might be true to RT once the Surface Pro tablet is in the picture all is changed and Microsoft will have a huge share of the market, more then ipads, give it time.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1355925386767</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:56:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355925948347-16</Id><Topic><Title>*** HUGE rally *** No Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>patkc69</Username><Timestamp>1355887006157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:16:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>futures are all GREEN</Msg><Username>patkc69</Username><Timestamp>1355925948347</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:05:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355926496984-17</Id><Topic><Title>Surface RT Tanks, Microsoft has few friends left if any</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355922769286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

But i may switch to a Lumia when my contract is up, although by then some other devices may be out. Anecdotal, my father-in-law came for the holidays from Belarus.

Another anecdote: the Apple store was not too busy, relatively speaking, at 8:00 p.m. for the xmas season. Neither was 5th Avenue in general or the xmas tree at Rock. I am speaking comparatively. Even 2008-2009 seemed more crowded, per my wife, who used to work retail on 5th in midtown.

There are orders in place to buy 7,000 contracts with 18,000 already traded. The bid is set to 9 cents. When Intel rises too much above the $21 strike plus the 9 cent bid, the option market maker will sell the put and take a positions to neutralize the risk. Part of that is to short Intel. The large put buyer is capping Intel's up movement right now. There is also some similar Jan $22.50 call option activity. The option trading has the intel price in a narrow channel for awhile.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1355935764833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:49:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355935956551-37</Id><Topic><Title>Can We Close Above $21?</Title><Username>dilo133</Username><Timestamp>1355864183854</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:56:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plowed thru resistance at 21 with heavy volumn.Follow the volumn to 26 by April</Msg><Username>dilo133</Username><Timestamp>1355935956551</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:52:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355936562893-38</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like it's going to be a short fry today... finally above $21 in the pre-market</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1355923674827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:27:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC is in "overbought" status now.

"Overbought" is what Intel is doing to the stock. The RSI is at 62 which is below the traditional 70 level used for "overbought" status. That has less to do with today's INTC trading behavior (IMO) than the option trading. It looks like someone is buying 25,000 Dec $21 put contracts (downside insurance) and at the same time buying Jan $22.50 call options for upside potiential.

He wants to skim a few pennies guaranteed off each trade. So if someone is buying 25,000 put options, he will take the other side (short) if a seller cannot be matched. He will only take that position if he can hedge it. If he sells the 25,000 puts, then he would construct a synthetic position to balance his short put position. He would want construct a LONG put equivalent. He would use #6 below and he would buy calls and short stock. Synthetic Positions - Basics There are 6 basic synthetic positions relating to combinations of put options, call options and their underlying stock in accordance to the synthetic triangle: 1. Synthetic Long Stock = Long Call + Short Put 2. Synthetic Short Stock = Short Call + Long Put 3. Synthetic Long Call = Long Stock + Long Put 4. Synthetic Short Call = Short Stock + Short Put 5. Synthetic Short Put = Short Call + Long Stock 6. Synthetic Long Put = Long Call + Short Stock In order for the synthetic triangle relationship to work, all options used together must be of the same expiration, strike and represent the same amount of shares used in combination.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1355942269041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:37:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355942482051-55</Id><Topic><Title>52 wk Hi $38+ now it is under a nickle</Title><Username>in_spite_of_it_all</Username><Timestamp>1355576360138</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 07:59:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raginbull website/MGM message #282</Msg><Username>karnut2000</Username><Timestamp>1355942482051</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:41:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355942748877-56</Id><Title>Billy Ray</Title><Msg>My Dad is upstairs.

SlashGear reported Wednesday that testing inside Microsoft's quality assurance lab is holding up the arrival of Intel Atom Z2760-based tablets, including the Dell Latitude 10. Originally scheduled to ship in mid-December, early Latitude 10 buyers are being told their 10-inch Windows 8 tablet won't ship until the new year, with Dell's website now estimating a ship date of January 22, 2013. Worse yet, Dell customer service are notifying would-be buyers that the tablet has not even officially launched yet, despite the company accepting preorders since November. Waiting for approval The delay is also affecting HP, who is now showing a January 9 ship date for its ENVY x2 11t-g000 convertible tablet with a twisting touchscreen, also previously expected in November. Sources claim Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs are responsible for the holdup, with Intel unable to get approval for the Clover Trail processors used on the Atom Z2760. The issue is reportedly related to device drivers used with the Clover Trail processors, which have caused stability headaches for Intel. Without approval, the Windows 8 tablets in question cannot be legally sold as part of Microsoft's licensing terms for its OEM partners.</Msg><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355945155877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 14:25:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355945649943-68</Id><Title>Apple will prolly move to TSMC 20nm processes in late 2013</Title><Msg>However, it will take time, because chip foundry relationships are “sticky,” writes Newman: On the process technology, the difference between Samsung and TSMC is quite stark at the 32/28nm node with Samsung using a Gate-First technology and TSMC using a Gate-Last technology.

Why is Intel wasting so much time on Mobile when it will do basically NOTHING for them????? This is some serious stuff. Intel: ‘Stay the Course’ and Fix the PC, Says Microdesign Research By Tiernan Ray In an interesting article published Monday by the venerable chip magazine Microprocessor Report, editor Linley Gwennap opines that Intel (INTC) cannot subsist on revenue from sales of its computer chips for smartphones and tablets as a means of offsetting declines in the PC market. (Subscription required to read Microprocessor Report articles.) Disputing the common argument that tablet computers are cannibalizing PC sales, Gwennap argues the main issue for Intel has been that the normal upgrade cycle of PCs in developed markets has collapsed as the rate of improvement of processor development has slowed: The problems of the PC market goes beyond tablets: this will be the third of the past four years that PC growth is less than 4%. A broader problem is that over the past few years, performance growth has slowed to a crawl. For example, Intel’s fastest Core i7 desktop processor went from a 2.93GHz quad core in 2009 to 3.5GHz quad core in 2012. Note that the company moved from 45nm to 32nm to 22nm in this time period. The laptop speedup was slightly better, going from 2.13GHz to 3.0GHz. Even counting a modest boost for the new Sandy Bridge CPU, performance is increasing at just 10% per year for desktops and 16% for laptops, a far cry from the good old days of 60% annual performance increases. As a result, PC users have little incentive to upgrade their systems. Mobile chip revenue, which is dominated by partners of ARM Holdings (ARMH), would be a nice addition to Intel’s business, but it can’t possibly make up for lost laptop and desktop revenue for Intel, he contends: The problem is the mobile-processor market is too small to matter. PC processors will generate $31 billion in 2012, but mobile application processors will total $6.2 billion. Worse yet, excluding in-house processors that Apple and Samsung design for themselves, the merchant opportunity for Intel in mobile processors is only $1.5 billion. If Intel gained 100% of that market, it would make up for only a 5% drop in PC-processor sales.</Msg><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355951167531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:06:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355951182391-91</Id><Topic><Title>Mobile a complete waste of time and money for Intel</Title><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355951167531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:06:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One answer is the server computer market, of course, which benefits from the proliferation of mobile, connected devices: With server processors selling for hundreds of dollars and 90% gross margins, the company could be generating more profit in this fashion than the mobile-processor vendors do. The server market comprises more than $10 billion in revenue and is growing rapidly; it is likely to be the biggest growth driver for Intel over the next several years. But Gwennap urges the next CEO at Intel, whoever replaces Paul Otellini when he steps down in May, to “stay the course” and make the PC more desirable, and more successful: Intel has the knowledge and the resources to make PCs more competitive. It can’t do the job alone, but it knows how to work with Microsoft, PC vendors, and other ecosystem players. Having redefined the PC form factor, the next step is to rework the PC’s functions to include performance-hungry capabilities such as voice/gesture recognition and intelligent agents in ways that benefit end users. The new CEO needs to stay the course and not be distracted by the mirage of huge mobile revenue. The PC market is too large to be backfilled by mobile chips; Intel must find a way to maintain this market at a profitable level. Ultrabooks are a first step, but more aggressive innovation is necessary. The new CEO will be successful if, in five years, PC revenue is stable and server revenue has grown. Mobile will just be icing on the retirement cake. Intel shares today are up 24 cents, or 1%, at $21.20.</Msg><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355951182391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:06:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355951243911-92</Id><Title>Chump Street Prepares to Blow Another Intel Quartly Earnings Call</Title><Msg>Chump Street Prepares to Blow Another Intel Quarterly Earnings Call Let's revisit last quarter. Chump Street projected an $8 billion revenue miss by Intel and trimmed 9 bucks off the stock price using a combination of money, leverage, media manipulation and perhaps even collusion. What happened? There wasn't any revenue miss. But the emperors on the Street are so used to parading around without clothes they just continued as if nothing had happened and as if Intel really had posted up an $8 billion revenue miss. Well, what do you expect from people who don't know a nanometer from a yardstick? With last quarter's blown call still not adjusted out (only 8 bucks to go),I can't wait to see Chump Street double down on stupidity again. How moronic can Chump Street get? One only has to look at the current totally and completely absurd valuation of ARM to know. More Kool-Aid! More Kool-Aid! James Covello and the rest of the Chump Street analysts continue to channel Homer Simpson. Wait, I'm sorry. That's an insult to Homer. [Note to SEC: If you aren't investigating Intel stock manipulation then you must have run out of jail cells...] Now where was I? Oh, yeah - get ready for the belly-laugh. Chump Street will weigh in soon and I'm sure their little backbone-free minions on this board will use the usual array of user IDs to spread the word...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355951243911</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:07:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355951292234-93</Id><Topic><Title>Maria Bartaromo is married to a Billionaire</Title><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1355948615898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Besides she now looks like a Mama Maria with a Big Can.

"Moving to Engineered Systems, it was another strong exit quarter with over 70% sequential growth in unit bookings. We sold more than 700 Engineered Systems this quarter, great excellent wins at China Mobile, Facebook, Samsung, Time Warner Cable; and great Exalogic wins at Chevron, Vodafone and Wal-Mart. We had a very nice excellent win at Wespac in Australia. I mention this because they're moving off DB2 on the mainframe along EMC storage to Oracle and Exadata and Exalogic at very significant savings.

In an effort to attract users, the company is using HSPA+ in 1900 MHz, as well as offering unlimited data to users. The first shipment of nano SIMs arrived over the October 6, 2012 weekend.[103] 42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands by region, based on what historically has been made available. In Europe, that means 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany only T-Mobile network with LTE 1.8 GHz band will be supported and will not work in the whole country.[104][105] Some countries in Europe—including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer iPhone 5 LTE connectivity to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[19] Unlike the iPhone 4S, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5 with regard to frequency and technology use. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. One version also works on CDMA networks, such as Sprint and Verizon. Another has LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the forced conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), and so LTE is only usable on AT&amp;T.

I ran out of REPLY buttons below. It makes sense for Oracle to use their captive SPARC CPU to accelerate their server software. I think Fujitsu has announced that they are adding Oracle accelerator instructions to SPARC too. On their 30m tpmC SPARC cluster that sits on top of the results, towering above the 2nd highest result of IBM Power system. That SPARC cluster seems to have 27 x 4 CPU SPARC node and 97 x 2 CPU Xeon X5670 Westmere 2.93GHz CPU that Intel lists for $1,440. I suspect that Oracle gets a price break. The seond place result from IBM has a similar number of Xeon EP sever CPU. Oracle knows how to use Xeon to sqeeze top results. $1.01 per tpmC for the top system. That is about 2x the lowest price performance result. Oracle will sell about the same number of Xeon. They will sell more SPARC but at the expense of Itanium.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1355975801789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:56:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355976619879-132</Id><Title>Institutions won't dump Dividend stocks if rates are raised.
