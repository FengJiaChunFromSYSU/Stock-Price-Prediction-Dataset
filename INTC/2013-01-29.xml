Has been CIO and CFO for many years at Intel - so he knows the company inside-out and probably has good relationship with most of the senior management. Last but not least, he has had a public face by being on financial conference calls over the last 3 or 4 years and has acquitted himself fairly well. IMO, Mike Bell, due to his techie background and a lack of operational experience is unlikely to be considered for the CEO/COO slots. But it would be interesting if Mike Bell is elevated to a position to work closely with the new CEO due to Intel's increased focus on mobile.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359471436902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:57:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359471678815-37</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 tablets won't dent the BYOD revolution</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359431752104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Full Windows 8 tablet acceptance in the enterprise has never been in question.

The companies are OK with saving IT costs by letting employees bring and use their own devices. However, they need to protect their data. Most companies have an extensive Microsoft Active Directory structure (AD) in-place to enforce access rights to sensitive resources. (I've found that even Apple shops use Microsoft's AD for this purpose.) Unless the employee's device can authenticate to AD, the company will not let it access any sensitive resource (like files.) This ability comes native with any "Pro" version of Windows and Macs (those devices with Intel Chips). Most ARM based devices do not have the ability to authenticate to AD. Even the new WindowsRT lacks this capability. As such, they are basically dead-on-arrival as a BYOD device. They will be able to web surf, but little more in most companies.</Msg><Username>dddogget</Username><Timestamp>1359482326224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 12:58:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483139527-56</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 tablets won't dent the BYOD revolution</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359431752104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, The point of your post was to question the success of Windows 8 tablets as a BYOD device in the enterprise. Well, consumers can buy Windows 8 tablets just as they can buy Android tablets or iPads, the difference is that the Windows 8 BYOD can be supported with more enterprise functionality Out-Of-The-Box since it's 100 compatible with the infrastructure and software enterprises will already have. But this raises another point. It is more likely enterprises will also purchase W8 Tablets for its employees for the same reason.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1359483139527</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:12:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483503050-57</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>probably not since he cheated. would you want her now?</Msg><Username>chevymalibu1966</Username><Timestamp>1359483503050</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:18:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483538319-58</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure and you get to rub one off even more as women with kids don't do it hardly ever.</Msg><Username>chevymalibu1966</Username><Timestamp>1359483538319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:18:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483538364-59</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure and you get to rub one off even more as women with kids don't do it hardly ever.</Msg><Username>chevymalibu1966</Username><Timestamp>1359483538364</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:18:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483656738-60</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>true. marry a woman who's 25 and you're 45, then in 10 years, your pecker won't be like oak anymore.

Tom Dean, who runs that company, was on bass for Lucy Nuff. The Schleunes brothers were in the band, with Mark Schleunes on guitar and vocals, and Kurt Schleunes on drums. Tina Osinski was briefly in the band in the early days. The main singers were Cynthia Taylor (who among others has also sung with Charming Hostess) and Denise Fraga. The third soprano's name escapes me, as does the keyboard player Dan's surname. Anyway this band got pretty tight but I guess we got tired of playing gigs like the the redneck bar TR's in Concord for $30 apiece (if we were lucky), then humping gear at 3am. It could perhaps have become a great wedding band but in the end I think we only played one wedding gig. This tiny picture shows our farewell gig at the Starry Plough in Berkeley.

Well, this has made you far more wary on how you spend your money, and you avoid tablets like the plague. What if I told you that there is salvation on the horizon? This is where the GammaTech Durabook TA10 tablet comes in, where it is touted to be the latest rugged tablet which was specially designed and engineered for demanding applications such as those found in the utility industry. The GammaTech Durabook TA10 will occupy the high-end side of things where tablets are concerned, and it boasts of a 10.4” display with a high performance CPU, carry an ultra-high brightness LCD display, and runs on an Intel Ivy Bridge processor. Jen Chen, GammaTech president, said, “We are delighted to be able to introduce our new Durabook TA10 rugged tablet at DistribuTECH, the utility industry’s leading smart-grid conference and exposition. This new tablet makes perfect sense for utility workers out in the field with its ultra-high screen brightness for easy viewing. Its ruggedness and durability stand up to virtually any harsh environment. Its mobility factor is enhanced with Bluetooth and Intel WiFi wireless connectivity as well as an optional internal GPS function.” Expect the 10.4” XGA TFT LCD display with LED backlight to work well under any lighting conditions, where the resistive multi-touch panel with tempered glass will be ideal for the viewing of drawings, files, and web pages. A couple of six-cell battery packs offer longer battery life on the move, and just to make sure you have an easy time with in-the-field identification and tracking purposes, the Durabook TA10 will feature an optional UHF RFID reader and Barcode scanner. Other optional accessories include a handle, hand strap, and docking station. I wonder how the executives over at Panasonic are feeling with their Toughbook receiving some, well, tough competition with the $2,300 GammaTech Durabook TA10 rugged tablet.</Msg><Username>smokinghotblitch</Username><Timestamp>1359498280992</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:24:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359499048208-98</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so far...and close to that 45 + 10 and it is as hard aas a rock ;) no drugs either :)</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1359499048208</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:37:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359499266054-99</Id><Title>Did you see Box Maker SANMINA today ?</Title><Msg>SANM THoughts ?
