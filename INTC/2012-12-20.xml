With last quarter's blown call still not adjusted out (only 8 bucks to go),I can't wait to see Chump Street double down on stupidity again. How moronic can Chump Street get?

My belief than was INTC was beaten down like the rest of the market and i saw a chance to invest in a company that i knew would turn around! Granted, INTC has had issues and is making strides to once again grow. In the meantime, i have been rewarded. My original purchase was 500@10.25 via the DRIP. Since than i continue to purchase shrs once a month by sending in $100. The stock has been rising ever since and my intial investment has more than doubled in 3 yrs! My goal is to continue sending in $100.00 for the next 15 years. I`m certain i`ll be rewarded in the end. The point is there aren`t many co`s like INTC where an INVESTOR can feel confident enough to believe their investment and hard earned money is safe! INTC is one of those co`s....</Msg><Username>insurancefla1</Username><Timestamp>1356002998021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 06:29:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356005022817-8</Id><Topic><Title>"people who don't know a nanometer from a yardstick..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355986874821</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 02:01:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you have your english tea yet?</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1356005022817</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 07:03:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356005869701-9</Id><Topic><Title>HURRY, Short this before...</Title><Username>melodiecorado873</Username><Timestamp>1308932443000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-06-24 12:20:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its a Must See Chart Pattern</Msg><Username>oscarsmith6388</Username><Timestamp>1356005869701</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 07:17:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356006524161-10</Id><Topic><Title>Institutions won't dump Dividend stocks if rates are raised.

How do analysts know Margins will collapse? Intel smartphone chips as energy-efficient as competitors', report concludes By Steve Johnson December 18, 2012 1:43 PM GMT SANTA CLARA -- In a milestone that is expected to help Intel's (INTC) push into the smartphone and tablet markets, the Silicon Valley tech giant finally has made its brainy microchips as energy-efficient as those from companies using a design by Britain-based ARM Holdings, which now dominate the mobile market, according to a new report. That's important for Santa Clara-based Intel, which for years got the cold shoulder from phone and tablet makers because its power-hungry chips shortened the battery life of mobile devices. With its new chips, Intel could find its way into a few more of those gadgets, the study by Bernstein Research analysts said Monday. But they cautioned that the development doesn't mean the world's biggest chipmaker is headed for a huge boost in revenue. Bernstein noted that the ARM camp has such a commanding lead in phones and tablets that Intel probably won't make much of a dent in those markets for a couple of years -- even with its energy-efficient chips. Moreover, Bernstein determined that the performance of ARM-based chips has increased enough to be suitable for low-end notebooks, which could begin to challenge Intel's dominance in the personal computer market. Both chip types "are very close in terms of power efficiency and processing power," the report concluded. As a result, it said, "the competitive fight between the ARM and Intel camps will therefore heat up meaningfully as early as 2013, with likely damages on both sides and no winner." For its study, Bernstein compared Intel's chip in a Motorola RAZR phone and a RAZR phone with an ARM chip. It also compared both chips in similar tablets outfitted with the Windows 8 operating system. "In smartphones, Intel is competitive in terms of power efficiency," the analysts concluded, and the company "poses a credible threat to ARM's dominance" in tablets. But it also said ARM's chips have become more powerful, making them "a very compelling choice" for consumers looking for low-end notebooks. "Overall, there is no stand-out difference in power efficiency or performance between the two camps," the report said, adding that it all points to "more direct competition" between Intel and the ARM chipmakers. Nathan Brookwood, of the market consulting firm Insight 64, agreed that Intel will have trouble making headway in mobile devices. Besides its late start in those markets, he noted, the dominant smartphone suppliers -- Samsung and Apple (AAPL) -- prefer to make their own chips. In addition, he said, other mobile-device makers like ARM chips because it's often easier to mix and match certain features with them than with the kind Intel sells. Another problem for Intel is that ARM chips tend to be cheaper, so the Santa Clara company may need to cut its prices -- and its profit -- to compete, according to a note Raymond James analysts sent their clients. They said Intel's gross margins -- money left over from revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold -- has been 62 percent to 65 percent in recent years. But as Intel ramps up its competition with ARM chipmakers, the analysts warned, "mid 50 percent gross margins are an increasing reality."</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356020140069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:15:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356020345243-39</Id><Title>How much WAND OR YOU GETTING PAID FLUKING CORRUPT BSTD!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Cancer on you POS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>fairwarning50</Username><Timestamp>1356020345243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:19:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356020448982-40</Id><Title>WANG SHOULD GET HIS DANG CUT OFF &amp; HE WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS OUTRIGHT CORRUPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>fairwarning50</Username><Timestamp>1356020448982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:20:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356020533091-41</Id><Title>THE DAY IS COOMING ANALYSTS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>fairwarning50</Username><Timestamp>1356020533091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:22:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356021196938-42</Id><Topic><Title>Surely Intel would not go full steam into Mobile if they knew margins would collapse?</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356020140069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:15:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know about collapse, but they will be lower due to competition to an extent they have never faced.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356021196938</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 11:33:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356021430978-43</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is certainly not looking very good.

Intel has finally competitive chips in the pipeline and now the anals changing their story and demanding similar margins for Intel's SoC while they don't mind TSMC lower margins because of potential Apple business - the "market" is distorted. If the market is that retarded focusing only on margins in Intel's case than there is not much one can do.

The article from ZDNet below (Windows 8 'Clover Trail' tablets delayed until 2013) includes both these pieces of information within a few paragraphs. The same information has been repeated ad nauseam by a ton of these so-called "tech journalists". Am I completely missing something? Or did all these journalists fail Logic 101 !! ================== Windows 8 'Clover Trail' tablets delayed until 2013 The holiday season is usually a great time for PC OEMs, and this one should be doubly so given that it comes hot on the heels of a new Windows release. But a fumble with driver certification means that Santa won't be leaving many Windows 8 "Atom" tablets under the tree. It seems that Dell and HP have both pushed back the launch of Windows 8 tablets running Intel's new power-efficient Atom Z2760 "Clover Trail" processor until January. According to InformationWeek, Dell's Latitude 10 and HP's Envy x2 convertible are affected. A search of online retails suggests that the only Atom Z2760-powered tablet you can buy right now is the Acer W510, which also appears to be in short supply. The Atom Z2760 is a 1.8GHz dual-core x86 CPU built using Intel's 32-nanometer high-k process. The primary feature that it brings to the table is better battery life. The problem appears to be down not to the hardware but to drivers. Back in early October it was reported that Intel had yet to deliver power management software for its "Clover Trail" processors to Microsoft for approval. This, according to sources, would likely delay the release of hardware, and according to supply chain sources, it is this delay in getting Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certification for the drivers -- required before the hardware can go on sale -- which is behind this latest delay.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1356031279373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 14:21:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356031336388-63</Id><Title>Sorry about all the duplicates</Title><Msg>These Yahoo boards are really FUBAR at the moment.

According to InformationWeek, Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), and other vendors are pushing back the launch of the new tablet lineup due to issues with the new chipset. Dubbed "Clover Trail," Intel's Atom Z2760 chip was supposed to improve Surface performance and battery life enough to put it on par with Apple's (Nasdaq: AAPL) venerable iPad. OEMs have not faired well with efforts to bring products to market. For example, Dell previously advertised that its Latitude 10 tablet would ship on December 12th, but now expects a shipment date around January 22nd. H-P, ASUStek, and Lenovo are also experiencing delays in launching tablets. Out of the top five global PC vendors, only Acer is able to release the Clover Trail-based tablet in its W510-1666 model. With Windows 8, its all about live tiles. That's where Intel's Clover Trail was expected to excel, with something called Connected Standby. Connected Standby allows that tablet to have a smartphone-like standby mode by staying up-to-date with email, news, weather, and more. Shares of Microsoft are rebounding today following a modest dip Wednesday. The stock is up 0.4 percent on the session.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356034053975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 15:07:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356034240089-68</Id><Title>When WW and His Aliases GO AWAY this Board Gets Very Quiet</Title><Msg>Maybe Wally's pc was repossessed?

If not, he's a hypocrite................what a #$%$ joke.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1356059547618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 22:12:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356059754285-105</Id><Title>I AM BUYING !))K ON PUTS FIRST THING CRASH YOU MOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>WALL ST IS FINISHED NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>fairwarning50</Username><Timestamp>1356059754285</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 22:15:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356059858358-106</Id><Title>OH NO DOW futures down over 200, S&amp;P futures down 23 and dropping, NAS Futures down over 41</Title><Msg>SAY OH NO DOWN WE GO</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1356059858358</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 22:17:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356060083856-107</Id><Topic><Title>Bravo, John Boehner!</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1356059547618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 22:12:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EU, Japan, India, and other stock markets are frothy.

A fresh review of a Windows 8 Acer tablet by chip site Anandtech shows it beating ARM-based devices pretty consistently on central processor unit performance benchmarks but not on graphics. The site also noted a "bug" that has delayed the release of some Intel-based tablets. "The [Intel] Atom architecture is still faster than every single ARM based [processor] core on the market today with the exception of the Cortex A15," -- ARM's newest chip design -- wrote Anandtech today when it posted a review of the Acer W510 today. Intel's Atom z2760 "Clover Trail" system-on-a-chip is just starting to appear in products like HP's Envy x2 and Samsung's Ativ 500T -- both are tablets that can run the full version of Windows 8 and can convert into a laptop via a keyboard dock. Those systems compete with tablets that run the RT version of Windows 8 on top of ARM processors from Nvidia. "It doesn't really matter where you turn, the CPU side of Clover Trail is clearly ahead of anything we've seen thus far in the Windows RT camp...clearly better than Surface," Anandtech said. It's not all good news, though. Clover Trail's graphics processing unit (GPU) is out-classed by most of the competition, including the iPad. "Compared to what's shipping in the latest iPads however, Clover Trail is horribly under-specced...based on what I've seen thus far it looks like the GPU here is a bit slower than what you get in a [Nvidia] Tegra 3," Anandtech said. And a lot slower than the GPU in the iPad 3 and 4 and even less powerful than the iPad Mini's GPU. Battery life is good, however, and able to keep up with an RT device. Related stories Intel-based Windows 8 tablets see spotty availability And like Microsoft Surface and other Windows RT tablets, desktop mode is nothing to write home about. "[User interface] performance can be sluggish in desktop mode," Anandtech said, referring to the Windows 8 mode that resembles the traditional Windows 7 desktop. And about that "bug" that has delayed shipment of some Intel-based Windows 8 tablets? "Contrary to popular belief, driver problems aren't what kept the first Atom Windows 8 tablets out of the market at launch. A bug (not related to power management) caught several months ago caused schedules to slip by about a month and a half." Anandtech continues: "Depending on whose design the OEM followed (Intel's or their own), the implementation of the fix could come quickly or would take a bit longer." Shipments of tablets such as Lenovo's ThinkPad Tablet 2 and Dell's Latitude 10 have been delayed until January. An Intel representative acknowledged delays with the Clover Trail chip when contacted today by CNET but did not specify a reason for them.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356061061747</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 22:37:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356061371148-110</Id><Title>Clovertrail beats ARM, but GPU is horrible and a "bug" has caused delay</Title><Msg>Intel-based Windows 8 tablet beats Surface, but 'bug' cited Tablets based on Intel's new power-efficient Atom chip are faster than ARM rivals on central processing unit benchmarks, according to chip site Anandtech -- which also cites a "bug" that delayed shipment of systems. by Brooke Crothers December 20, 2012 3:41 PM PST Acer Iconia W510.
