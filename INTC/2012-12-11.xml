As process nodes shrink and more components move on-die, the characteristics of each new node have become particularly important. 22nm isn’t a new node for Intel; it debuted the technology last year with Ivy Bridge, but SoCs are more complex than CPU designs and create their own set of challenges. Like its 22nm Ivy Bridge CPUs, the upcoming 22nm SoCs rely on Intel’s Tri-Gate implementation of FinFET technology. According to Intel engineer Mark Bohr, the 3D transistor structure is the principle reason why the company’s 22nm technology is as strong as it is. Other evidence backs up this point. Earlier this year, we brought you news that Nvidia was deeply concerned about manufacturing economics and the relative strength of TSMC’s sub-28nm planar roadmap. Morris Chang, TSMC’s CEO, has since admitted that such concerns are valid, given that performance and power are only expected to increase by 20-25% as compared to 28nm. Intel, in contrast, is predicting record gains. The company claims that its 28nm SoC “employs high speed logic transistors, low standby power transistors, and high-voltage tolerant transistors in a single SoC chip to support a wide range of products, including premium smart phones, tablets, netbooks, embedded systems, wireless communications, and ASIC products.” The company reports enormous improvements in leakage currents and Intel plans to take full advantage of the improved performance. You’ve probably seen the image above trotted out when Intel talks about process node improvements. In this case, it’s the length of the line that’s more improvement than its rightward shifts. The diagram shows leakage current dropping more quickly than clock speed. At 65nm, Intel’s transistor performance and minimum leakage levels dropped off more quickly, while minimum leakage was much higher. Here’s 65nm, 32nm, and individual data sets for SRAM cells across multiple process nodes. At 65nm and a maximum input voltage of 1V, Intel’s SRAMs had a narrow operating range. 800MHz was the maximum effective frequency at that voltage — below 0.8v, the chip stopped working at any frequency. At 32nm (Medfield, Clover Trail), the company’s processors have considerable more latitude. 22nm pushes the envelope still further. The challenge for both TSMC and GlobalFoundries is going to be how to match the performance of Intel’s 22nm technology with their own 28nm products. 20nm looks like it won’t be able to do so, which is why both companies are emphasizing their plans to move to 16nm/14nm ahead of schedule. There’s some variation on which node comes next; both GlobalFoundries and Intel are talking up 14nm; TSMC is implying a quick jump to 16nm. I don’t want to say too much on how the three companies’ future processes might compare; tech papers at IEDM may shed more light on the particulars of each solution. What’s clear is that both GF and TSMC are going to try to accelerate FinFET development. GF’s tech papers imply that the company will deploy a hybrid 22nm-14nm process to make the jump more quickly. Will it work? Unknown. TSMC and GlobalFoundries both have excellent engineers, but FinFET is a difficult technology to deploy. Ramping it up more quickly than expected while simultaneously bringing up a new process may be more difficult than either company anticipates. Given the advantages Intel claims for the technology, it might’ve made more sense to ramp FinFET on an established node. One of the most significant demonstrations of what Intel thinks it’s getting out of 22nm FinFET is the company’s decision to revise Atom for an out-of-order architecture. Intel has resisted the call to overhaul the in-order CPU; the current core at the heart of Medfield and Clover Trail offers nearly identical performance to the design that debuted in 2008. 22nm Atom should close the gap with existing ARM CPUs and give Intel a substantial advantage. Overall, the situation looks like Intel holds the cards until GF and TSMC manage to revise their roadmaps for the sub-20nm market.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355210631471</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 02:23:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355211303540-5</Id><Title>Charlie Demerjian - Intel talks about 22nm SoC transistors</Title><Msg>[No usual Intel Bashing in this article] Low power, high voltage, and passive 22nm structures. Dec 10, 2012 by Charlie Demerjian One of the questions that has been bothering process geeks for months now is how Intel is doing Vt control in fin structures. While it is obvious they can do it, 22nm chips are out in volume, the particulars and limits were still an open question. Luckily, Intel today put out a paper at EIDM on that topic, and it laid out most of what we didn’t know. The authors went in to detail on how Intel differentiates between high power, low power, and high performance transistor, plus a little detail was given on passive devices, memory, and analog structures. In short, if there were lingering questions about the edges of what is possible, they are mostly gone now. The big concern that SemiAccurate had was that Vt control would be problematic on a FinFET. Ion implant is extremely tough with high aspect ratio structures, and the obvious method of the past, changing contacted gate area by making the fin taller, is a non-starter. Why? If you make transistors at an uneven height, it makes the next few layers a bit tricky, usually fatally so. The other way to increase contacted area, making the gate longer, eats die area, removes the additional benefits of going vertical. While added length works, it has a high cost, and somewhat defeats the purpose of using the third dimension. The numbers that matter In the end, there was no magic, Intel did the obvious and made the transistors different lengths. There are two things to note in the table above, gate pitch and gate length. Compare and contrast that to the Vt and it becomes pretty clear that length is the overriding factor for Vt control in Intel 22nm transistors. Pitch also varies quite a bit, but you need to make structures thicker if you run more energy through them, and pitch is where it plays out. Take a look at the electron micrographs below for a look at the transistors themselves. Through gate on the left, side view middle, and top view on the right There are two things of interest here, first is the length difference between the high and low voltage transistors. Notice that the high voltage transistor is longer than two discrete low voltage parts and the interconnect between them. Higher voltage comes at a fairly steep price, and vertical transistors don’t help much here, they might even add some cost. The other thing is much more subtle, but you can see it in the cross section on the left, there is an extra layer between the channel and the gate. This layer supports higher power, it is a ‘hybrid’ dielectric that adds silicon dioxide to the normal High-K gate material. With this Intel can scale the voltages to 5v and beyond. This should be enough, most modern I/O doesn’t come close to 5v, at least for anything connected to the CPU. Metal layer table and pictures From there, the interconnects also bring some new twists. On Intel’s 22nm process, you can use between 8 and 11 dielectric layers, Low-K or UltraLow-K, mix and match. The ULK layer is Carbon Doped Oxide (CDO), the Low-K material is not specified. Intel uses self-aligned vias, sacrificial hard masks, and and double patterning on M1. The rest of the layers all are single patterned. What is chosen, and how many are actually used depends on the process, CPU or SoC, and the exact project. Intel doesn’t stop there, to make a chip you need passive components, memory, and possibly a bit of analog here and there too.

This could be due to how the investing public perceives a great technology company such as Intel being run by a non engineer. Paul O. graduated as an economic major. Whereas, Craig Barrett, who ran Intel from 1997 to 2005, had an engineering related degree. This could just be the general overall perception of many large investors as a whole towards a technology company being better run by a CEO that's more in tune to the needs of a technology company to grow better overall than other non technology companies. Paul Otellini did a great job in moving Intel to a very powerful position, but now it may be time to have an engineer as CEO once again to increase the positive sentiment towards the stock itself. Looking back at Craig Barrett's term, the stock hit a high of $75.83 during August of 2000. After that, the stock traded above $30 a share in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. But no matter how well Intel did as a company, the stock has never traded above $30 a share under Otellini. I wonder if Intel's board members are considering this fact when they decide to choose the next CEO.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355224098861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 06:08:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355224566898-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel stock price under CEO Ottelini.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355224098861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 06:08:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stacy Smith could be a great leader for Intel, but he does not hold an engineering degree.

Stacy Smith, Tom Kilroy, and Dadi Perlmutter. Out of the three, the best for the stock and the company's direction towards mobility would have to be Dadi Perlmutter. He currently lead the mobility group and holds an Electrical Engineering degree. The market could like that choice enough to allow higher PE valuations that could help the stock rise much faster than growth expectations alone. Plus, the guy was very vocal about the stock price trading under $25 during their 2011 investor meeting, expressing his view that Intel's growth and advancements in technology deserved a much higher stock price. We need a CEO that is a cheerleader of its stock. With the latest move of acquiring debt to buyback more stock strengthens this belief that the board members are tired of seeing the stock go nowhere and are willing to take all necessary steps to support the stock price rising to new 52 week highs and eventually, new all time highs. I think Ottelini himself senses this and is willing to step down to allow a more aggressive buying sentiment towards the stock.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355225816789</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 06:36:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355231411222-11</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Flumuxed and your hector/cornole/amd/monkey aliases...</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355200255972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 23:30:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor loser can't think of ONE good reason Obama's running the country or anything good that he's done.

The process is geared for a much wider array of designs than that of IBM, he added. Bohr said Intel’s 22-nm FinFET process is cost effective, contradicting report it is 30 to 40 percent more expensive than TSMC’s 28-nm planar process. The addition of FinFET adds only 3 percent to the cost of the process. Its use of 80-nm minimum feature sizes can be made with a single pass of 193-nm lithography tools, making it cost effective. Projections from an IMEC keynote that 14-nm wafers will be 90 percent more expensive than 28-nm parts due to the lack of EUV lithography are inaccurate, Bohr asserted. The cost increase for 14-nm wafers at Intel “is nowhere near that,” he said. “Cost per wafer has always gone up marginally each generation, somewhat more so in recent generations, but that’s more than offset by increases in transistor density so that the cost per transistor continues to go down at 14 nm,” Bohr said. Separately, Bohr said Intel does have a growing foundry business that may include some higher volume applications than its current announced customers like FPGA startup Achronix. However, “we don’t intend to be in the general-purpose foundry business…[and] I don’t think the [foundry] volumes ever will be huge” for Intel, he said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1355237860221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 09:57:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355237904166-18</Id><Topic><Title>When AAPL goes away what and who is INTC going to sell to?</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355237622786</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 09:53:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the best bash you can come up with?

And I expect "Avoton" to be in the 3 to 4 watts range. That should completely bury the aspirations of any ARM-based server companies before they even manage to get their products out. Extending and paraphrasing Otellini from a recent financial conference: There are several overhangs on Intel stock * S1200 &amp; Avoton - will make the ARM-server threat overhang go away * Dual-core Medfield - will make Intel's non-presence in Tablet space overhang go away * Z2000 Atom for mass-market smartphone - will increase Intel's volumes in smartphones * Z2780 Atom with LTE for high-end smartphone - will provide standout Intel high-end offering * New Silvermont architecture - will run circles around ARM and reduce ARM's sales in all low-power markets - Embedded, IVI, mobile devices, etc. Assuming it plays out this way, Intel is on the way to becoming a $40-50 stock by Q3/Q4 2013. The key question is - can Intel execute? Can they pull in some of these timelines and devastate ARM? I think they can. Worst case if there are some delays, Intel can still get into the $30 range if it delivers most of the above.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355240876586</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 10:47:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355240878902-57</Id><Topic><Title>Intel stock price under CEO Ottelini.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355224098861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 06:08:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>stock price is nice but earnings are what matters.

I like being long Intel as it goes toward 40 in 2013.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1355241516515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 10:58:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355241607947-65</Id><Topic><Title>Here come the sellers</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355240768622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 10:46:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sellers have already sold, like you at $19.37.

Intel launches microserver chips, gets nod from Facebook Reuters – 8 minutes ago.. . By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel launched a data-center chip using low-power technology found in smartphones, stepping up competition in the nascent microserver market and winning a nod from Facebook. The Atom chip rolled out on Tuesday uses much less electricity than Intel's previous processors for servers and comes as Intel's rivals also eye the low-power server niche. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money, and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. But Internet giants like Facebook, Amazon.Com and Google have been experimenting with ways to use low-power chips to make their data centers more efficient. At an Intel event launching the Atom chips, a Facebook infrastructure executive said the social network has found that low-power chips excel at processing the 4.5 billion updates, likes, posts and comments its 1 billion active users add to the site every day. "We do face unprecedented scale at Facebook, and that's one of the reasons we're so highly motivated to figure out the most efficient way to scale infrastructure efficiently and support all the people using Facebook," said Frank Frankovsky, Facebook's VP of hardware design and supply chain. He did not say whether Facebook expects to buy Intel's new chips. Frankovsky said "wimpy" low-power chips in some cases can do the same work as Intel's "brawny" Xeon chips while consuming half or a third as much power. "How much useful work can you get done per watt per dollar? That's the only metric that matters," Frankovsky said. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. In October, ARM unveiled new chip designs aimed at microservers. ARM believes servers using low-power chips based on its designs could account for a fifth of data centers by 2020. Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel's data center business, declined to say how large Intel believes the microserver market could become. She said the Atom chips have been chosen for over 20 upcoming products focused on microservers, storage and communications.</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1355257319744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:21:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355257489264-136</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy_Nuff aka Toooofunnny ABSENT on an upday</Title><Username>beer_bladder_lucy</Username><Timestamp>1355257035968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:17:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, coinmaker 77 = too funny and nuff the #$%$.</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1355257489264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:24:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355258140432-137</Id><Title>How is Intel stock price going to grow ?????????</Title><Msg>Let's take Bernsteins comments today.

ARM's entry points have been in the embedded space, then mobile, and possibly microservers. Embedded is not a rapid growth area relative to mobile and microservers. But Intel has to overcome the ARM challenge in the mobile and microserver spaces. In the mobile space, ARM has established a huge lead. With Medfield, Clover Trail+, Intel is working hard on winning some share. It has to speed up the transition to 22nm and 14nm SoCs to steadily increase its share in this segment. In the microserver space, Intel has partially plugged the entry point for ARM by introducing S1200 today. They need to move fast to get Avoton out. Intel has the advantage of software compatibility and has to move fast to get substantially all of this market. This can cut off the air supply for ARM-based servers. As Intel steadily increases its market share in mobile, the volumes for ARM will go down reducing its revenue streams and curtailing its capability to invest in R&amp;D, capex, etc. And Intel will be able to breathe a sigh of relief. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it is still an arduous game which will stretch out for another 12 to 18 months. This is how I see the scenario playing out...</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355268371677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 18:26:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355270755877-160</Id><Topic><Title>How is Intel stock price going to grow ?????????</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1355258140432</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:35:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you did some reading lately you might be asking a very different question HOW CAN INTC NOT GROW? ++++++++ Your posts continue to be worthless.
