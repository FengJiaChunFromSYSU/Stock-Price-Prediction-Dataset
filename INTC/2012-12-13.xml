This time they are really playing with fire. Intel's $6 Billion debt offerring to buy back stock should not be taken lightly by negative analysts and shorts. Stock will continue to have huge buying pressure in the coming months. If $5 Billion is used, that is over 230 million shares. I'm guessing Intel will be placing the buying pressure on the market at about 10 million shares a day for a couple of months at least. That could place anywhere from 25 cents to 50 cents positive move on stock price as buys are being made by Intel. Some days the analyst manipulation may work to subside some of the buying pressure, but it will get old and not work anymore. So if we get about 20 days out of the next 40 days working for us in the positive, we could get a bump of $5 to $10. Of course after $25 some profit taking pressure may create some resistance. But up to $25, the stock's resistance points will be taken down easily with Intel's aggressive buyback actions. Like I said, shorts and those two idiots from Goldman and Nomura are playing with fire as Intel stock will continue to be on a hot streak.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355377943641</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 00:52:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355394167210-3</Id><Topic><Title>Another reason ARM is a lost cause for non-vertical integrated companies like QCOM</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355367751737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:02:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QCOM does not sell ARM chips.

They have now found it extremely useful for closing short positions when many shars are needed and a way to establish large positoins at the bottom.Since many mutual funds haven't updated their bylaws, they continue to fall prey to this manipulation and the little guy pays.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1355405947641</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 08:39:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355408033970-13</Id><Title>Can Intel Longs petition the SEC to have James Covello looked at?</Title><Msg>?????

Half Intel volume is from them. If Intel were to drop by 33%, it would mean that the market was down 33% too. If the DJI drops from $13,200 by 33% to $8,800, then Intel will have a good chance of hitting $14. With the introduction of Haswell in Apr2013 and SoC starting Jan 7th, 2013, Intel will likely be stronger than the market so $14 is very unlikely. $40 is not likely either until Intel makes significant head way into the mobile or expanding markets. Intel probably has a valuation of somewhere near $30.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1355408917069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 09:28:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355409794132-16</Id><Topic><Title>Can Intel Longs petition the SEC to have James Covello looked at?</Title><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355408033970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 09:13:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can call for an investigation if you have evidence of a criminal act or serious violation of SEC rules and regulations.

James Jau, vice president of Quanta's cloud computing business unit, said the new S900-X31A microserver is expected to drive growth of his company's server shipments. "It is a new product line and is expected to spur new applications," he said at a news conference to launch Intel's Atom S1200 processor family and its customers' server products. Quanta shipped over 1 million units of computer servers last year, Jau said but declined to disclose the company's server shipment targets for 2012 and 2013. Intel said its 6-watt Atom S1200 processors can help companies achieve high reliability and cost effectiveness for data storage.

While my complaint may not lead to anything, it will cause the SEC to look at one specific incident where the naked short went from 50,000 to 10,000,000 for two days. It will focus attention on a possible abuse and when they are looking at the naked shorts, might see something else.

This is of course becuase anybody who buys AMD cannot produce x86 processors because it is an exclusive deal between Intel and AMD.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355415180362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:13:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355415230898-32</Id><Topic><Title>You should view this profile INTC</Title><Username>donaldwalker326</Username><Timestamp>1355332721129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 12:18:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>important report</Msg><Username>scottjohn411</Username><Timestamp>1355415230898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:13:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355415624139-33</Id><Topic><Title>Being short Intel NOW is comical stupid.

The hardware design is very similar, but heavier, thicker, and with a “real” processor that requires a fan. Yes, those are drawbacks, but they come with a very, very powerful advantage: the Surface Pro will run real Windows 8. This means (hopefully) none of the buggy Windows RT problems, and perhaps more importantly, a full stable of applications. See, the Surface RT only runs Metro (whatever) apps, of which there are woefully few. I didn’t even get to the point of testing the very few that I found – forget it, because the built-in stuff is so incredibly bad. The lack of apps wasn’t a problem for me – I explained why I preordered a Surface RT – but the quality of the built-in apps was. The whole point of the Surface RT was supposed to be a tablet that’s ready for work. It’s not.

By Mark Knapp | More Articles December 13, 2012 Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) computers have just received a power boost with new Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Ivy Bridge processors and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics processors, further enhancing the already fast and elegant computing environment. But, before the dust can even begin to settle on the new-processor-wielding computers, word of a new set of high-power processors has gotten out. A recently leaked document details a new lineup of Intel chips under the name “Haswell” that will be the immediate successors to the current Ivy Bridge chips. The chips will feature higher base frequencies, more threads, increased cache, and a host of other features that all equate to faster, more powerful desktops and mobile computers. And from the sound of it, Apple could be first in line to receive these processors after their expected release mid-2013. Our 20-page proprietary analysis of Apple’s stock is ready. Click here to get your Cheat Sheet report now. If Apple gets the chips, they are most likely to appear in the iMac all-in-one computers, which use the standard electrical power chips featuring the higher processor speeds than the mobile counterparts. While there is no set date for the release of the chips, or their integration into Apple computers, the future does look powerful.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355421878865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:04:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355421883068-50</Id><Topic><Title>If you buy longterm here........things Lucy's and waldgrow's won't tell you</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355419670201</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:27:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You played the dividend card!

Foundry alone would add $2 billion/yr to revenue. If Apple decides to go with Intel's chips for their iPhone and iPad, we are looking at an additional $5 billion/year. Forget Goldman sucks et al #$%$ about it killing margins; that's pure #$%$. The additional revenue will drive up EPS which is what will drive up the stock price. If deal goes thru, we are looking at $1.00 EPS/quarter or $4/year! 2) CSCO foundry deal....roughly $1-$2billion/yr in revenue 3) Bay Trail SoC (22nm) for smart phones (and small tablets) make early entry in 2013. The Bay Trail SoC would be quad core and will blow away the competition. 4) Smart phones design wins with Motorola and other phone makers for U.S. market. This will surely happen in 2013, only question is how many phones and whether they will have Bay Trail inside or only the z2580. 5) Android tablets and Chromebook design wins. We know Intel will make Windows 8 tablets, but if they can also get some Android tablets into the market, Intel will be more diversified. 6) Hardware manufacturers bombard market with sexy new convertibles and detachables PCs. Imagine a Lenovo Yoga or a Dell XPS 12 convertible as thin and light as the Acer Aspire 7. Or Detachables PCs that have the tablet half as thin as the iPad. Those are the kind of products we need in the market. I think we will see these soon when hardware makers get their hands on the 7W Ivy Bridge parts and upcoming ULV Haswell parts. And with the 22nm SoC process, they should be able to produce tablets as thin as iPads. 7) PC refresh picks up steam. With AMD most likely exiting x86 market, Intel will have market to itself! Stacy Smith believes there will be a pent-up refresh coming. There are people out there still using 5-year-old laptops with windows XP. When windows 8 becomes more mainstream (what's the alternative?) and more thin sexy convertibles and detachables come into the market, corporations and consumers alike will be making the upgrade...especially with the fact that Windows 8 is a touch-based OS.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355453829553</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 21:57:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355457082469-113</Id><Topic><Title>What can cause INTC stock to SKYROCKET!!!</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355453829553</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 21:57:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Answer to #7 ...</Msg><Username>livingsez</Username><Timestamp>1355457082469</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 22:51:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355457163030-114</Id><Title>Credit Suisse rebuttal to ridiculous Goldman Sachs comments.</Title><Msg>Moore’s Law – smaller, faster and cheaper – has been the cornerstone of Tech economics for 40 years. It is our view that technical, financial and scale issues are driving towards a “last-man-standing” advantage for INTC relative to Moore’s Law and that INTC will leverage that advantage not only in its core business but increasingly as a specialized foundry. Intel Foundry Services (IFS) already has three customers albeit small and private – Achronix (PLDs), Tabula (PLDs) and Netronome (Network processors) – with several more thought to be in development (AAPL, CSCO, ALTR and XLNX). To date IFS has remained mostly a niche effort, but we would argue that as INTC’s manufacturing lead continues to widen at 14nm and especially at 450mm, IFS will become a more meaningful driver of top and bottom line performance. Investors worry about the impact to corporate profitability from foundry business, especially relative to an INTC and AAPL relationship. On the surface, INTC’s MPU ASPs of $120 versus the AAPL ASP of $20-$25, INTC’s corporate GM of 60-65% versus TSMC’s at 45-50% and INTC’s cost/wafer of $10,500-$11,500 versus leading edge wafers at TSMC at $5,000-$5,500 (incl. back-end) would all suggest that any entry into foundry would be margin dilutive with little bottom line impact – WE DISAGREE. Our analysis today looks at the impact of a foundry relationship between INTC and AAPL (on ARM) and concludes that the profitability profile is much better than the consensus view. In fact, our analysis suggests if INTC were to support 100% of AAPL’s demand at 14nm the company could generate $5.8bn in revenue, 47% GMs (below core of 60-65%), 35% OpMs (above core of 28-32%), $0.28 of EPS with an ROI of 20-25% (in-line with core of 20-25%). Credit Suisse continues to recommend a buy on INTC stock with a $32 target price.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1355457163030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 22:52:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355458586111-115</Id><Title>Intel talks about 22nm SoC transistors</Title><Msg>One of the questions that has been bothering process geeks for months now is how Intel is doing Vt control in fin structures. While it is obvious they can do it, 22nm chips are out in volume, the particulars and limits were still an open question. Luckily, Intel today put out a paper at EIDM on that topic, and it laid out most of what we didn’t know. The authors went in to detail on how Intel differentiates between high power, low power, and high performance transistor, plus a little detail was given on passive devices, memory, and analog structures. In short, if there were lingering questions about the edges of what is possible, they are mostly gone now. The big concern that SemiAccurate had was that Vt control would be problematic on a FinFET. Ion implant is extremely tough with high aspect ratio structures, and the obvious method of the past, changing contacted gate area by making the fin taller, is a non-starter. Why? If you make transistors at an uneven height, it makes the next few layers a bit tricky, usually fatally so. The other way to increase contacted area, making the gate longer, eats die area, removes the additional benefits of going vertical. While added length works, it has a high cost, and somewhat defeats the purpose of using the third dimension. Intel 22nm table Intel talks about 22nm SoC transistors The numbers that matter In the end, there was no magic, Intel did the obvious and made the transistors different lengths. There are two things to note in the table above, gate pitch and gate length. Compare and contrast that to the Vt and it becomes pretty clear that length is the overriding factor for Vt control in Intel 22nm transistors. Pitch also varies quite a bit, but you need to make structures thicker if you run more energy through them, and pitch is where it plays out. Take a look at the electron micrographs below for a look at the transistors themselves. Intel transistor pics Intel talks about 22nm SoC transistors Through gate on the left, side view middle, and top view on the right There are two things of interest here, first is the length difference between the high and low voltage transistors. Notice that the high voltage transistor is longer than two discrete low voltage parts and the interconnect between them. Higher voltage comes at a fairly steep price, and vertical transistors don’t help much here, they might even add some cost. The other thing is much more subtle, but you can see it in the cross section on the left, there is an extra layer between the channel and the gate. This layer supports higher power, it is a ‘hybrid’ dielectric that adds silicon dioxide to the normal High-K gate material. With this Intel can scale the voltages to 5v and beyond. This should be enough, most modern I/O doesn’t come close to 5v, at least for anything connected to the CPU. Intel metal layers Intel talks about 22nm SoC transistors Metal layer table and pictures From there, the interconnects also bring some new twists. On Intel’s 22nm process, you can use between 8 and 11 dielectric layers, Low-K or UltraLow-K, mix and match. The ULK layer is Carbon Doped Oxide (CDO), the Low-K material is not specified. Intel uses self-aligned vias, sacrificial hard masks, and and double patterning on M1. The rest of the layers all are single patterned. What is chosen, and how many are actually used depends on the process, CPU or SoC, and the exact project. Intel doesn’t stop there, to make a chip you need passive components, memory, and possibly a bit of analog here and there too.
