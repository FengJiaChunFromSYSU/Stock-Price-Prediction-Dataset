By Jessica Leber on January 28, 2013 Intel came to rule the PC market by making the world’s most advanced chips, beating competitors down the curve of Moore’s Law and producing higher-performing processors at a lower unit cost. But today’s smartphones and tablets don’t necessarily require cutting-edge computing performance, and investors are worried that Intel’s long-winning strategy won’t translate to profits as these devices cut into PC sales. Indeed, in the mobile market, Intel remains far behind its competitors On an earnings call last week, CEO Paul Otellini found himself reassuring analysts that Intel’s “leading-edge” fabs are still its “single greatest asset,” enough to justify $13 billion in 2013 capital spending to maintain this edge. A big test of that will occur over the next two years, as Intel intends to finally lay claim to the world’s most advanced mobile processors. These will be manufactured with transistor features as tiny as 22 nanometers, which Intel plans to introduce this year, before it pivots relatively quickly to selling mobile chips made with a 14-nanometer process in 2014 (see “Intel Bets on Fabs, Again”). Intel has sold mobile chips for some time, but the first Intel-powered smartphones and tablets only shipped in 2012. More power-efficient ARM-based designs sold by companies like Qualcomm and fabricated in foundries like TMSC and Samsung have comprised the smartphone chip market so far. Otellini is right that Intel will pull ahead with its 22-, 14-, and, eventually, 10-nanometer technology, and that this edge may be its best hope for convincing device makers to buy its newest mobile processors—along with new, more efficient chip designs. “The problem for Intel is that they don’t get anywhere by being Intel. They are the new kid on the block now. Just being equal doesn’t do much; they have to be better,” says Linley Gwennap, principal analyst for the Linley Group. Crucially, these chips will also be designed to help solve the biggest problem that delayed Intel from entering the mobile market—designed initially with plugged-in PCs in mind, its chips have sucked too much battery life from devices. Intel has designed new chips that offer improvements. Today, Intel’s 32-nanometer “Atom” smartphone chip architecture, now found inside a total of seven devices sold in 20 countries, is already “equal or better than the best ARM designs,” Otellini claimed last week. Going forward, combined with a smaller architecture that packs more transistors onto a chip, Intel can make higher-performing chips that can also consume less power, Gwennap says. Such advantages could appeal particularly to device makers looking to make smartphones that act more like tablets, or tablets that act more like powerful notebooks, says Len Jelinek, chief semiconductor manufacturing analyst at the firm IHS iSuppli. As Otellini noted last week, the lines between form factors are blurring. Still, there will be large barriers that Intel’s advanced manufacturing technology cannot solve as it tries to sell to more device makers. “It doesn’t matter how good your transistors are, you still have to create products that are meeting market needs,” Gwennap says. It will be a challenge, for example, for Intel to design the right combinations of features and specifications on its chips, integrating everything from Wi-Fi and cellular capability to graphics and GPS features. In the last few years, Intel has acquired a number of companies to help with this effort, but has not proven it can incorporate them smoothly. Intel must also combat the perception that ARM is the default mobile chip designer. Device makers, working on rapid product cycles, could view it as risky to switch to Intel until its mobile technology is more proven, says Jelinek. And finally, Intel faces risks as it plans how much expensive manufacturing capacity to build. Mobile chips are smaller, so it will be harder to keep the fabs busy even with a lot of orders. These questions are all crucial for Intel’s business, because PC sales are slumping. Intel gave a nod to these seismic shifts yesterday by announcing a slow ramp down of its desktop motherboard business so it can focus on lightweight ultrabooks, tablets, and phones (see “Requiem for a Motherboard.”) The company is making some progress. Today, for example, some of the seven smartphone designs that come with Intel inside include models from ZTE and Lenovo, two of China’s top smartphone sellers. Its Clover Trail chips can now be found in 10 tablets, too. Jelinek anticipates that Intel will be “part of the wireless revolution” moving forward. “It is the next generation of technology that Intel is really good at providing. It has just taken them a long time to get there.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359389022629</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:03:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359389707271-21</Id><Title>Guess what time it is?</Title><Msg>INTC buying time</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359389707271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:15:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359390727588-22</Id><Topic><Title>Guess what time it is?</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359389707271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:15:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IT'S WALLY DOODY TIME!</Msg><Username>wallydoody</Username><Timestamp>1359390727588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:32:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359391446732-23</Id><Topic><Title>NO SMALL WONDER</Title><Username>foreverdonquijote</Username><Timestamp>1359300055250</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:20:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just purchased another 500 to capture this coming dividend....now I own 2,000 shs.

January 28, 2013, 10:14 Intel Announces ‘Yolo’ Low-Cost Smartphone For Africa – All You Need To Know Intel and Safaricom have announced Africa’s first Intel-powered smartphone, a handset named Yolo that is aimed at first-time smartphone buyers in Kenya. The Yolo smartphone is based on an Intel design and packs Intel’s core technology. It sports a 3.5-inch display, a 5-megapixel camera, and HSPA+ modem support. The device is available from Safaricom, an Intel partner and a major mobile network operator in Kenya. According to Intel, the smartphone’s target audience is “cost-conscious…first-time buyers.” “We’re redefining what cost-conscious Kenyans can expect from a smartphone, said Peter Arina, General Manager of Safaricom’s Consumer Business Unit. “The Intel-based Yolo smartphone strikes a unique balance between price and performance – we consider it to be a real breakthrough. It’s great news that Kenya will be the launch country in Africa for smartphones with Intel Inside and we expect a great reception from our customers.” “We are delighted to partner with Safaricom in bringing the first smartphone with Intel Inside to Kenyan consumers,” added Aysegul Ildeniz, Regional Director for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa Region. “The new handset extends the benefits of Intel technology to more smartphone users around the world and we believe that Kenyan consumers will welcome the increased functionality and overall value of the device. We look forward to our continued cooperation with Safaricom.” The Yolo smartphone will cost Kshs. 10,999 (about $126), and it will also pack 500MB of free data. The 5-megapixel camera allegedly sports “advanced imaging capabilities,” including a burst mode capable of producing seven pictures per second. Meanwhile, the video mode can shoot 1080p videos. The handset will initially be available countrywide in Safaricom stores, but a wider release across other African countries is also in the cards. The Yolo smartphone also packs an Intel Atom Z2420 processor under the hood, as well as Intel’s Hyper Threading Technology that can reach processing speeds of up to 1.2GHz. According to Intel, the handset will also support FM radio and it will sport a slot for expandable memory. Moreover, Yolo is also equipped with Intel’s XMM 6265 modem for global roaming.

The first is that the Apple "A" chips are designed by Apple with a core processor design from ARM Holdings. This processor, from Intel's viewpoint, is a competitive product and as such is not something that they would normally want to manufacture. Intel feels that their x86 based Atom core is a better solution for mobile applications and view making ARM based chips for Apple as undermining that position. The second is the deep cooperation with Google/Motorola with the purpose of enhancing the Android operating system to work with Atom processors, in order for Google to build products that are directly competitive with the Apple smartphones and tablets.</Msg><Username>fvelezdevilla</Username><Timestamp>1359404743846</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:25:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359405061285-56</Id><Title>Chart Breakout for Semi Index</Title><Msg>There is a good chart showing the breakout of the SOX index in the article "Why I Like Intel And Other Stocks In The Semiconductor SOX Index" at Seeking Alpha (Mon 2:19PM EST) in the headlines for Intel Lets see if this link posts http://seekingalpha.com/article/1138191</Msg><Username>chambersoverpaid</Username><Timestamp>1359405061285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:31:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359405128162-57</Id><Topic><Title>Chart Breakout for Semi Index</Title><Username>chambersoverpaid</Username><Timestamp>1359405061285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:31:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice chart.

If covered calls are written, the HOLDER of the calls who bought the calls can exercise them anythime they want, up to and including exiration day. If the covered calls are exercised before the stock goes exdividend then the person exercising the options early wil get the shares and the dividend. He willl lose the shares at the strike price and not get the dividend. Many people think that they can write a call option and depend on a share price drop at exdividend. They don't realize that their is the possiblity of the call holder exercising early. An early exercise is quite common for Intel options. It is not a big deal even if the shares are exercised early as long as the call writer understands shares are (depending on strike and month) likely to be called.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359412354288</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:32:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359412621362-69</Id><Topic><Title>-------------INTC DOWNGRADED..

And on fabrication: "Intel is producing over half of their output on a 22nm Trigate process node with very good yield. The next best in class is producing at 28/32nm planar node and struggling with yield. The difference in chip size due these different processes is much more dramatic that the 32 to 22nm numbers would suggest. Because of the arithmetic square relationship, assuming the same number of transistors the 22nm chip has the potential to be less than half the size (area) of the 32nm chip. Therefore, the 22nm wafer, with virtually the same production cost, can produce over 100% more chips. The manufacturing cost of the 22nm chip will be about 50% less than the equal 32nm chip. Intel is moving to 14nm node beginning this year. Those chips will be one fourth the size of the 32nm chip and one fourth the cost. These much smaller chips are also faster and consume less power."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359418313445</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:11:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359418438585-79</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Russ Fischer SA article a must read</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1359403191870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:59:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How is it that analysts can look at the economics on fabrication and not understand that the chip war is over???

The latest leading edge technology at TSMC is 28nm. TSMC has had a great deal of trouble getting the 28nm (and the preceding 40nm) processes into volume production with high yield. TSMC is about 1 1/2 nodes behind Intel. As such, their customers, such as QCOM and NVDA will also be 1 1/2 nodes behind with their products, thus putting TSMC customers at a large disadvantage to Intel. TSMC is trying desperately to catch up with Intel, but listening to their earnings conference call today, it seems that a TSMC 20nm process will not be in volume production until 2015. Since the TSMC 20nm process is a planar process vs. Intel's Trigate process, there is a high possibility that the TSMC 20nm process will have worse performance on speed and power than their 28nm process, and that is if it works at all. There was no mention about the expected TSMC 16nm finfet process, but if 20nm takes until 2015, 16nm finfet will be 2017, if ever. By contrast, Intel will be ramping 14 nm Trigate later in 2013. And 10nm will begin early production in 2014-15, putting Intel 3-4 years ahead of TSMC. The danger for TSMC being this far behind Intel is that if Intel secures enough leading edge business, if Intel's products are preferred over QCOM and NVDA, over time the market for foundry work at TSMC may diminish to the point that the cost to build TSMC advanced technology foundries might not be justified by the available business. This means that, while TSMC will not fail, they will be stuck at the 28nm node while Intel moves on to 15, 10, and 7 nm. That would not bode well for TSMC customers such as Qualcomm and Nvidia. An IC at 7nm would be 12% of the size of a 22nm IC with the same number of transistors. Without raising prices, Intel could generate extremely high margins on the new processes. Intel could make multi-billion transistor ICs that could sell for a few dollars at 90% gross margin."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359418803572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:20:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359420605537-81</Id><Title>Intel says no LTE integration until 2014</Title><Msg>LONDON – Intel Corp. is making progress with its development of LTE modems but does not expect to have an integrated LTE modem and application processor until 2014, according to CEO Paul Otellini. When asked specifically about integration of LTE modem circuitry with a mobile application processor such as the Atom during an analysts' conference call held to discuss Intel's fourth quarter 2012 financial results, Otellini said: "In terms of integrated solutions, you'll see higher levels of integration from us next year." During the call, Otellini said Intel was shipping a data-only mode LTE modem IC to customers and that a data-and-voice multimode modem would ship during the course of 2013. He added that he expects the first mobile phones with Intel supplied LTE capability to have launched early in 2014 at about the time of the Mobile World Congress. The lack of an integrated baseband modem and processor for mobile applications puts Intel some way behind Qualcomm Inc. (San Diego), which already offers integrated LTE capability in its Snapdragon line of application processors. Other companies with chips that integrate the application processor with the baseband modem include Renesas Mobile with its MP6530 and ST-Ericsson NV with its NovaThor L8580 ModAp chip implemented in 28-nm fully-depleted silicon on insulator process technology. Intel's wireless capabilities are largely derived from the company’s acquisition of the wireless business unit of Infineon Technologies AG (Munich, Germany) completed in January 2013. Otellini said the former Infineon team is making good progress in LTE: "We believe we have a very competitive solution. The Infineon team is known for not necessarily being first to market, but being really good at engineering a very solid solution and being cost effective and cost competitive and I think that they are doing a very good job with respect to this product." He added that Intel has many of the technologies for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS location detection and near field communications in house and would offer levels of integration that make sense at the right time.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359420605537</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:50:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359420820340-82</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is paying you 4.26 % annually to wait for the stock go higher, Better than cash, CD's and bonds</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359138268213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:24:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know where you get your information, but the stock has been in the 20 - 30 range for the last 10 years.</Msg><Username>johncanb</Username><Timestamp>1359420820340</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:53:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359421593255-83</Id><Topic><Title>Only a complete idiots would be short Intel now.</Title><Username>amdsuckks</Username><Timestamp>1359402520789</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:48:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That tick tock you hear is ahead of the several explosions to come this year which will blow up all things blocking this Intel stock in its run-up to all time highs.

Several chip providers are chasing the emerging market for low power blade servers for the cloud, an area where ARM thinks its licensees can displace the incumbent Intel. Qualcomm has joined Marvell, pioneering start-up Calxeda and others in planning a system-on-chip for servers and is advertising posts for specialists for this project. According to EETimes, Qualcomm's job advertisements, for at least three software engineers, reveal its server ambitions. They say the engineers will work on "architecture/design and system prototypes of Qualcomm's new ARMv8-based server SoC ASICs for the power optimized server market. The ads also say: "Primary responsibilities include specification, development, porting, integration and shake-out of server platform management software and firmware on prototypes utilizing Qualcomm's new SoC." The nascent ARM-based server movement is expected to get a major boost from the ARMv8 architecture, the first generation to support 64-bit instruction sets and so level with Intel's x86 in the high end segment. A rush of commercial products is expected in 2014 once v8 has been fully commercialized. However, some early movers like Calxeda and Marvell are already shipping 32-bit server SoCs, though these are mainly to steal a march on rivals and attract customer interest, rather than mass sales. Cloud giants like Microsoft are already testing prototype ARM-based platforms (Microsoft has carried out projects with Calxeda) and Dell, HP and Mitac have all worked on 32-bit prototype platforms. Among the other chip firms known to be working on ARM server SoCs are AMD, Applied Micro, Cavium, Nvidia and Samsung, and Huawei advertised for ARM server engineers last year too, though these may be for boxes rather than silicon. Texas Instruments has also announced server SoCs, but is targeting them mainly at specialized companion servers or embedded platforms rather than taking on Intel in the data center. The companies known to be preparing ARM server chips generally aim to start shipping 64-bit SoCs in 2014. Calxeda and Marvell are shipping 32-bit SoCs for servers today with limited traction, mainly in prototyping systems for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Taiwan's Mitac. A server move by Qualcomm would be another step away from the firm's previous strategy of sticking to mobile devices - just a few years ago, it said it wanted to concentrate on what it did well, but with its core smartphone sector facing price competition and eventual stagnation, it must seek new bases just as the ARM platform is - in tablets, 'post-PC' products, the internet of things, home networking, and in future servers and wireless infrastructure, especially small cells</Msg><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1359422744370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:25:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359422867833-88</Id><Title>Any ideas on why the high volume occurred today &amp; last Friday?</Title><Msg>Most occurred after hours,</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Georgia Dome spokesman Jason Kirksey said James Lewis McCoy of Villa Rica was arrested Tuesday by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority Police Department. Information on McCoy's charges was not immediately available. Kirksey said the stabbing might have been over an argument about food during a tailgate party outside the Georgia Dome on Sunday. Some initial reports indicated it came from a dispute between football fans. But Kirksey said neither McCoy nor the person stabbed attended the game.

He was caught lying through his teeth a year or two ago and is just a shell of a man.</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1359426685072</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 21:31:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359428427166-95</Id><Title>Russia powers Supercomputer with Intel Xeon Phi</Title><Msg>Monday, January 28, 2013 "Russia Adopts Intel's Xeon-Phi Supercomputer" Russia may not be allowing the U.S. to adopt its babies anymore, but it is allowing its fledgling supercomputer facilities to adopt Intel's Xeon Phi.

Most other tablet makers have seen such a low demand for their tablets that they had to sell them at less than cost. So what data do we have so far? Since the tablet first came out to be this gotta have product by Apple, in the last 9 quarters, Apple has sold a total of 117 million units. That's 2 years and 1 quarter worth of sales. Oh the devastation this has caused the PC! Such a devastation that PC unit sales have only been in the neighborhood of about 775 million units. What? PC unit sales for the past 2 years at least since the iPad has been in full production have been 6 times the tablet sales? Wait a minute! The tablet or iPad in particular is a very new item, like the iPod was. So it makes sense that it sees such a large growth. But the final numbers still show a very mature PC still sells in a much higher quantity that the tablet. We will see how the tablet stacks up against an all in one ultrabook that can be used as a tablet thanks to the power and efficiency that are both afforded thanks to Intel based products. Evidence shows that hybrid ultrabooks seem to be in high demand. In the meantime, iPad sales grew from 45 million units in 2011 to 65 million units in 2012. While PC unit sales stayed the same which is about 352 million units. Now the most bullish tablet analysts that are trumpetting the success of tablets over PCs claim that tablet sales will grow from 182 million units in 2013 to 230 million units in 2014. While PC sales drop down to 338 million units in 2013 but not sure where they will be at 2014. The clarity of how they count a tablet over a PC seems to be blurred since Intel's ultrabook hybrids could be both. The bottom line is that a total of 530 million tablet/hybrid/laptop/desktop units are expected to be sold in 2013 and 570 million tablet/hybrid/laptop/desktop units are expected to be sold in 2014. Obviously this is great for Intel since Intel has at least 20 tablet wins already and growing showing that they have the whole market for computing devices covered. The smartphone market will only be icing on the cake for Intel.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1359430533790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:35:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359431576452-99</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcom building ARM Servers might be a problemo for Intel</Title><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1359422744370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:25:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3 engineers taking on Intel....interesting....LOL</Msg><Username>vinebills</Username><Timestamp>1359431576452</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:52:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359431752104-100</Id><Title>Why Windows 8 tablets won't dent the BYOD revolution</Title><Msg>People have been bringing their own devices to work and support for them has been built into enterprise systems for a few years now. At this point, the entry of Windows 8 tablets into the frey will not dent the market much because all the major productivity apps are already supported for the other platforms -- iOS and Android. The compatibility factor, which is what Windows 8 tablets bring to the table, is therefore not as significant. The often touted success of Windows 8 tablets in the enterprise is therefore in question.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359431752104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432261012-101</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both of you have solid points but I have a solution to the problem. Stay single until you are in your early 40s and then marry a woman who is 25 or 26 and have kids with her. She could still look quite good until her mid 40s if she was hot to begin with. It works. I would rather screw my dog then try and do it with Hillary. And I am a LIB! But she is one smart nasty old bag and likely would make a good President. Bill gave the speech that helped put Obama ahead when the race was tough against Romney. Obama will back Hillary because he owes them now. Biden is close to the Pres but The Clinton gang delivered the election. Hillary? If she is in good health, she is unbeatable unless the GOP run a woman against her. AND--the conservatives in the GOP will not go for that.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey7</Username><Timestamp>1359432261012</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:04:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432669939-102</Id><Topic><Title>I bet Bill has not screwed Hillary for a decade or more.</Title><Username>hothectors</Username><Timestamp>1359422199397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The kids make it more than worth it if you make a nice family.</Msg><Username>amdroadkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1359432669939</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:11:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432672513-103</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 tablets won't dent the BYOD revolution</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359431752104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you understand that Intel has ported their chips to andriod</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1359432672513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:11:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432932490-104</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 tablets won't dent the BYOD revolution</Title><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359431752104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If hordes of people start using Intel powered Android devices, Intel will sell a lot of chips.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359432932490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:15:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359434467331-105</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcom building ARM Servers might be a problemo for Intel</Title><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1359422744370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:25:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>extremetechDOTcom/extreme/146850-facebook-arm-x86-and-the-future-of-the-data-center</Msg><Username>optermoron</Username><Timestamp>1359434467331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:41:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
