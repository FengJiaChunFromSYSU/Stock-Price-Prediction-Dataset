When Intel and Microsoft design Windows 8 and the slew of device form factors that support it, they only focus on making a capability available to their customer. How the customer will use that capability or whether they'll use it is left to the customer. The new way of designing devices takes several more steps to get closer to the customer and understand what the customer will actually use and build only that much rather than the Swiss Army knife approach that Intel and Microsoft continue to follow. The times are changing and customers are becoming more educated as to the design choices that were made in producing the devices that they use. This is effecting their buying decisions as is evident from the transition to the simpler but more user friendly tablets and smartphones that are the new crop of devices.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1361347547636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 03:05:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361360584995-8</Id><Title>INTC - Important Update!</Title><Msg>Simply put I sought to show this link with everybody under the sun.

Once a voter is issued an absentee ballot, her vote at the polls is done on a provisional ballot. It is not counted until the absentee ballots are all processed. That process is fairly common and is a case that is easily handled. The "attempting to vote twice" charges in this case is just theater. It will be investigated and dropped. The group of absentee ballots that were received as a group may or may not be OK. The elections commission will examine and figure out. The only real issue of this article is that the elections commision received three absentee ballots with similar handwriting. That will likely be investigated and be found OK. Melowese is a long time activist and is not dumb. If she commited voter fraud, she should and will be prosecuted. If she is prosecuted, I am pretty sure that it will be the first case of "Democratic voter fraud" that has been found since the elections. Please keep us informed on this.

Chinese search giant Baidu is using Marvell’s chips in a cloud storage application. tweet this Chinese search engine giant Baidu is using ARM-based servers from Marvell making it the first company to depend on servers using the cell-phone chip in a production environment. Baidu is using the new ARM servers in its cloud storage application named Baidu Pan. ARM, which licenses its IP to a variety of chip makers, had stated its intentions to enter the data center market back in 2010, as worries about energy efficiency increased and the needs of webscale computing customers changed. While less powerful than their Intel counterparts, a cluster of lower-power ARM chips is more power efficient on a performance per watt basis and some workloads don’t even need the performance characteristics of a big Intel core. The combination of these two trends has led to a plethora of vendors from big names like Marvell and AMD to startups such as Calxeda to license ARM’s cores with an eye toward making servers. Holding ARM back so far has been the delay in building out 64-bit capable cores (they are expected later this year) as well as a lack of enterprise software running on the ARM platform. But given the economics of these so-called wimpy cores and the limits of using ARM cores in the enterprise server market today, the use of ARM-based servers in the storage arena is not surprising. Storage usage scenarios are perfect in many ways because they don’t need a lot of raw performance, nor do they require 64-bit capable cores. Thus, Baidu using ARM for storage makes sense. It’s also an area where Calxeda expects to see its first production deployments sometime this year, according to a conversation I had with Karl Freund, the VP of marketing of Calxeda last December. As for the Baidu deployment, it’s using the quad-core Armada CPU, Marvell’s storage controller, and a 10Gb Ethernet switch all integrated on a single system on a chip. Marvell’s release says the chip firm customized the ARM servers specifically for Baidu’s cloud storage requirements, taking the concept of server customization common in webscale deployments to the chip level. Marvell says the platform is designed to increase the amount of storage for conventional 2U chassis up to 96 TB, and to lower the total cost of ownership by 25 percent, compared with previous x86-based server solutions. The end result should cut Baidu’s power in its data center by half according to the release.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361373833085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:23:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361373875450-30</Id><Topic><Title>Bet Alexander doesn't have any problem with those Braniac Liberal voters that...</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361372457196</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:00:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6,882 of your Earth years.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361373875450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:24:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361373944342-31</Id><Topic><Title>CAN'T HOLD 21!</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1361372693275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:04:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where do you think below is</Msg><Username>mzm821</Username><Timestamp>1361373944342</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:25:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361374055347-32</Id><Title>WALLIS FINGERED HIS SISTER......</Title><Msg>as the reason for his insecurity issues.

But is that possible? by Bogdan Petrovan on Feb 20, 2013 with 9 Comments If the rumors of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S4 haven’t confused you yet, there’s a good chance that will happen as we draw near its supposed March 14 launch. The latest batch of fodder for the rumor mill originates from a Korean site that claims the Galaxy S4 will be powered by a Qualcomm chip, instead of Samsung’s in-house Exynos chip. Some background – traditionally, Samsung equipped phones in the Galaxy S line with its own Exynos processors. However, in certain markets the Korean giant released variants powered by chips from rivals Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. Last year, for instance, the North American and Japanese Galaxy S3 models were powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chips, while versions sold in non-LTE markets came with the quad-core Exynos 4412 processor. If a report from the Korean site Digital Times is accurate, 2013 will be the first year when Samsung will not release an Exynos-powered Galaxy S. Why is that? According to DT, Samsung was forced to scrap the plans of using an Exynos 5 Octa chip in the Galaxy S4 due to issues with excessive heat generation and power consumption. Essentially, Samsung’s engineers weren’t able to tame the powerful octo-core processor enough to make it usable in a consumer device. Is this rumor realistic? Very importantly, Digital Times says Samsung will release the Galaxy S4 in a single version for all markets, LTE and non-LTE. Made possible by the integrated LTE modems on Snapdragon chips, such a strategy would make sense from a logistic and marketing point of view. The Korean site does not cite its sources, and even if it did, this report shouldn’t be treated as more than a rumor, at least for now. However, there are some clues that indicate there is at least one version of the Galaxy S4 in the pipeline that is powered by Qualcomm silicon. On the flip side, I find it hard to believe that Samsung would not use its own chip for its highest profile product, one that is expected to sell a record-smashing 100 million units. Moreover, it has been rumored that Apple (Samsung’s main silicon client) is taking its business to TSMC. Losing both Apple and the Galaxy S4 would be a major blow for Samsung’s fledgling processor business. But this is speculation on my side, especially since any change in the relationship with Apple would be negotiated months or even years in advance. Finally, if the Exynos 5 Octa is not yet ready for primetime, why not use an Exynos 5 Dual chip? Is Qualcomm so far ahead of the game with its Snapdragon 600 processor? It’s hard to offer a clear answer for now, but we’ll keep you posted as we learn more.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361374794802</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:39:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361375206344-37</Id><Title>Yahoo's Censoring Is Destroying This Board</Title><Msg>Apparently Yahoo doesn't mind if posters barrage the board with numerous irrelevant political issues, even though they have nothing to do with Intel, but many posts about Intel that are well written with factual data, not abusive in any way and no copyright infringement, simply disappear from the board.

Clips can be extracted and used to support an arguement. The unsurprising finding of the article was that the poor give a far larger % of their income than to the weathy. I wish they had chosen a different city than Sioux Falls. Sioux Falls, SD is the headquarters city where all of the bank credit card companies are located. They are located in Sioux Falls because of the Federal law which says that they can charge card interest rate based on the location of their headquarters. Lots of high income people in the area. Macy's in SF (probably Union Square) has a high percentage of tourist visitors. Walmart in Sioux Falls is frequented by Sioux Falls residents. From the Stossel's special: But while the rich do give more in overall dollars, according to the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, people at the lower end of the income scale give almost 30 percent more of their income. Many researchers told us lower income people give more because they think they are more likely to need charity or know someone who needs charity. Laurie Tanner is one of those people. She says, "I remember a time when honestly, I couldn't afford a gallon of milk for my son. And I had a good friend that stepped in and helped me, and I've never forgotten that."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361376584659</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:09:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361376796250-46</Id><Topic><Title>INTC getting crushed today - will $20 hold?</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1361376577546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:09:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All you need is a v,a.g,i.n.a &amp; you could hold your own sewing circle.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1361376796250</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:13:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361377177696-47</Id><Topic><Title>INTC getting crushed today - will $20 hold?</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1361376577546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:09:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How much snow did you guys get in the second storm?</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1361377177696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:19:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361377703130-48</Id><Title>Intc like watching paint dry</Title><Msg>always has been -</Msg><Username>mzm821</Username><Timestamp>1361377703130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:28:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361377885588-49</Id><Topic><Title>Selfish and rude, the Liberal way</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361374096588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:28:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alexander always has this long, drawn out boring reply that only a techy with no sense of humor would write.

Buying 2014 leaps is also a good idea. In fact one could buy a ton of the 2014 call leaps here provided they also bought march 20 puts just in case to hedge a crash risk.The puts are so cheap that its worth it as insurance as they will triple or more in value if we go there while the calls lose 30-40%of their value providing some security. Intel has been flat for over 30 days now. Time to move and its oversold near term but not in a meaningful way so it may indeed go lower. However it is undervalued and somewhat oversold near term on a very tight range and its a low volatility situation that makes long calls a cheap idea. So even buying april20s here is a decent entry and add later if it goes down.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1361383201893</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:00:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361383805979-86</Id><Topic><Title>Here comes $19 again TIC TOC are you ready for the drop</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1361382540689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:49:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down, down ,down back to $19</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1361383805979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:10:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361386273604-87</Id><Topic><Title>Selfish and rude, the Liberal way</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1361374096588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:28:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple processors: designed differently but here to stay Don Scansen, Paul Boldt 2/20/2013 1:33 AM EST Pretty good reading - though some indicators seem to point towards TSMC ...

However the company is putting its massive hoard of cash to catch up. The company is trying to change its product line so that its processors can be used in smartphones and tablets which require much more emphasis on power saving than on processor power. I think it's only a matter of time that Intel carves a huge market share in tablets and smartphones. Also I think that the death of PC story is exaggerated. PC makers are striking back through tablet PC hybrids. Intel with its deep relationship with giants like Lenovo, HP should get design wins in their newer products.</Msg><Username>proritualjohnnie</Username><Timestamp>1361388864420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:34:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361389376879-93</Id><Topic><Title>I Would Call Intel A Turd, But Manure has Value.

That’s a milestone for both companies, and a surprising sidelight could play into the story–worries about dependence on non-U.S. manufacturers. The Silicon Valley startup in 2010 turned to Intel, which opted to break from long-standing practice and use its sophisticated factories and manufacturing processes to serve customers beyond Intel’s own chip-design groups. Achronix became one of two publicly announced users of the new Intel foundry business, as such services are called. Intel believes it can make smaller and more sophisticated transistors than other foundries. Achronix, which makes a variety of programmable chips that use lots of transistors, says its bet on Intel has paid off as advertised. The chips, which include models with a whopping six billion transistors, consume half the power of competing chips and cost about half as much, Achronix says. It is shipping sample quantities to customers now and, when extended testing is completed, will be shipping them in volume in the third quarter, says Robert Blake, the company’s president and chief executive officer. Most foundry factories are in Taiwan or other parts of Asia. Achronix is quick to point out that the entire process of making its chips is handled in the United States. An Intel factory in Oregon fabricates the Achronix chips on silicon wafers. They are then shipped to facilities Arizona for packaging. Though U.S. makers of computers and other devices have long relied on foreign suppliers, government agencies and companies that sell to them often express a preference for hardware produced domestically. Achronix expects many of chips will be used to companies that make gear used in applications like high-performance computing, networking, security and encryption. In those kinds of products, government officials want to make sure where key components are made–and that they don’t include secret “back doors” or other features that could be exploited by foreign intelligence agencies. Such concerns may be fueled further by a growing number of reports about cyber attacks on U.S. institutions that some experts link to Asia and Europe. Asked if the idea of domestic manufacturing is resonating with hardware makers, Achronix Chairman John Lofton Holt “absolutely.” Blake added: “It comes up quite often with customers. They would like to source devices that are manufactured in the U.S. and they’ve never had that choice before.” Not that Achronix, or Intel, are likely to exclusively use that selling point. Rival Globalfoundries has new manufacturing facilities near Albany, N.Y., that it has cited as a key selling point. Besides Achronix, Intel has identified another programmable-chip startup, Tabula, as a customer of its foundry services. It also says it has other customers who choose not to be identified yet. The chip giant is frequently asked–and declines to talk about–about rumors that it might one day serve larger customers, such as Apple. It has only made clear that it won’t serve companies that include its direct customers. If Intel ever does want to serve high-volume customers, Achronix believes that it could. “They’ve become a real foundry,” says Holt.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361394138856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:02:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361394376711-111</Id><Topic><Title>First ARM-based servers in production support Baidu’s cloud storage</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361373833085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But it doesn't appear that large web companies are contemplating a wholesale switch to microservers, which will limit the size of the opportunity for ARM.

It's a specific function within a data center. There does seem to be a change in focus/language from the ARM camp: ---- Calxeda, the Austin, Texas-based startup that is building out highly dense, low power ARM-based servers has a new market in the storage world. During a visit last week to the company’s headquarters, company executives shared that in addition to web hosting and big data applications it sees a near-term opportunity in the storage world and that is has fielded more than 20 requests for proposals for systems using ARM-based processors. Karl Freund, the VP of marketing for Calxeda, says the company has shipped about 3,000 nodes and 130 systems although none are deployed in production environments yet. He expects the first production deployments to occur at the end of the second quarter of 2013. But most of the conversation was about how ARM-based systems could be used today in the storage market. Not just for cold storage such as Amazon’s Glacier or Facebook’s photo storage effort, but even for the big storage systems for scale out storage and enterprise class storage appliances. Named customers who are evaluating the systems include Scale.io, Gluster and Inktank, the storage startup backed by Mark Shuttleworth of Ubuntu fame that is commercializing Ceph. There are more, notes Freund, (pictured) who says that when Calxeda servers make it into production environments, they will likely be deployed first in a storage capacity, as storage customers don’t care if the chips are 64-bit compatible. For now, ARM-based systems are stuck only able to address less memory because ARM only has a 32-bit capable core design. Next year ARM will have a 64-bit capable design and systems will be built around them in 2014 (maybe even late 2013). Calxeda plans its 64-bit capable SoC for 2014. But Calxeda isn’t waiting and in storage, it’s also not focusing on power consumption — the initial draw for ARM-based servers in the scale out data center. For the storage world, where spinning hard drives tends to suck huge quantities of electricity, adding a low-power has a negligable affect on the consumption of an overall system. However, Calxeda boasts that popping in more of its systems on a chip (SoC) are both cheaper and make for faster information transfer and retrieval. Its tests show roughly a 4X improvement in IOPs for a rack of Calxeda SoCs versus x86-based systems. Adding Calexeda’s SoCs also cuts complexity because the entire system of processing and networking components are integrated on the SoC, and the terabit-plus fabric between cores also offers more network capacity between cores in a system –the so-called east-west networking traffic. As the market for scale out computing, storage and networking changes the demands made on IT equipment, Calxeda and others are seeing an opportunity that may have begun in servers and the cloud computing environment, but certainly isn’t stopping there. No wonder Intel is trying to catch up with chips of its own. So far, it’s recently announced new Atom-based chips haven’t made the cut for most customers I’ve spoken with (the lack of integration of the entworking and processing hardware is a problem), but in 2014 it will have a new, integrated SoC as well. Then, the competition will really get interesting.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361400267587</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 17:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361400900564-117</Id><Topic><Title>First ARM-based servers in production support Baidu’s cloud storage</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361373833085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shame the 'World' is wasting its money developing on an inferior technology, failure is guaranteed ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361400900564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 17:55:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361401313022-118</Id><Title>Exynos 5 Octa is a 6W chip</Title><Msg>and that is just the A15s, add another 4W for the gpu. anandtechDOTcom/show/6768/samsung-details-exynos-5-octa-architecture-power-at-isscc-13</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361401313022</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:01:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361401487176-119</Id><Title>Market takes a dive as it fears losing its QE drug</Title><Msg>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-index-futures-signal-more-103747239.html</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361401487176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:04:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361402282714-120</Id><Topic><Title>Exynos 5 Octa is a 6W chip</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361401313022</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:01:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a meaningless rating for a big.LITTLE configuration.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1361402282714</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:18:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361402360469-121</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think INTC is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>reconventioninez</Username><Timestamp>1361375367241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:49:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am from Chicago.

However, just prior to the announcement I received some information pointing to a move away from the ARM Cortex A9 used in the A5. Given Apple's reliance on fully licensed ARM cores in the past, the expected performance gains and unpublishable information that started all of this I concluded Apple's A6 SoC likely featured two ARM Cortex A15 cores. It turns out I was wrong. But pleasantly surprised. The A6 is the first Apple SoC to use its own ARMv7 based processor design. The CPU core(s) aren't based on a vanilla A9 or A15 design from ARM IP, but instead are something of Apple's own creation. So this is the first Apple core we’ve seen done with custom digital layout. In fact, with the exception of Intel CPUs, it’s one of the first custom laid out digital cores we’ve seen in years! This must have taken a large team of layout engineers quite a long time. The obvious question is, why? This is a more expensive and time-consuming method of layout. However it usually results in a faster maximum clock rate, and sometimes results in higher density. Certainly one possibility is that Apple could not meet timing on a automatically laid out block, and chose to go with a custom laid out block. Was this a decision at the architecture stage, or did timing fail late in the design cycle and a SWAT team of layout engineers brought in to save the day? We’ll probably never know, but it is fascinating, and also 2X faster (according to the below image)</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361404600008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:56:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361404818429-131</Id><Topic><Title>First ARM-based servers in production support Baidu’s cloud storage</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361373833085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yeah, those that bought INTC sure wish they bought ARMH instead...ARMH is at a 52-week high.

And a drop in the number of ARM foundries that if you extend the trend line drops to zero. And here's your proof: 93 fabless Series A Semiconductor Fundings in 2000, 42 in 2004, 16 in 2006, 16 in 2007, and 3 in 2012. Funding for foundries has dropped like a rock and the number of foundries has dropped in a corresponding manner. No money. No fabs. Not rocket science.
