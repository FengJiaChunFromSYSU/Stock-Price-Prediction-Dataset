As an example, many SOHO NAS boxes are now ARM based and these boxes are mini servers (file, web etc). LAMP is a huge (Linux, Apache, Mysql, Perl/PHP/Python) set of software and if this lot works on a SoC then the battle is halfway won.

Apple, Intel in talks for chip deal -- report The companies have reportedly been in discussions for the past year, but so far, haven't come to an agreement. by Don Reisinger | March 7, 2013 7:02 AM PST Apple's A6X processor. (Credit: James Martin/CNET) Intel might be trying to line up Apple's chip production, according to a new report. The companies over the past year have been in talks for Apple to move its mobile chip production from Samsung to Intel, Reuters is reporting today, citing people who have knowledge of their discussions. So far, however, Intel and Apple have been unable to reach an accord. That Apple and Intel have talked boosts a claim made last week to Reuters by Intel custom foundry vice president and general manager Sunit Rikhi that his company is ramping up to take on a major mobile customer. Rikhi declined, however, to say that the customer could be Apple. Reuters' report comes a couple of months after RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said that Apple and Intel might be imagining a new partnership in which Intel would build the iPhone maker's ARM-based smartphone chips in exchange for it using Intel's X86 processors in its next-generation iPad. Apple has relied on Samsung for years to build its mobile processors. However, as that company's mobile efforts continue to pressure Apple's, the iPhone maker is looking for alternatives. In addition to Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, among other chip makers, have reportedly been considered by Apple. CNET has contacted both Intel and Apple for comment on the Reuters report.

Citing a person familiar with one of the tech giants, Reuters reported that executives have over the past year discussed a possible partnership in which Intel's foundries would be used to manufacture Apple-designed chips. A deal has not yet been reached, the source said. This is not the first time rumors of an Apple-Intel partnership have cropped up. A report from May 2011 suggested that Intel showed interest in building Apple's A4 and A5 SoCs, though no action was taken and the idea was apparently shelved as the so-called Ultrabook initiative gained momentum. Intel is supposedly looking to shift its strategy as PC sales continue to slump as mobile devices, led by tablets like Apple's iPad, continue to gobble up marketshare. The firm has been looking to expand its foundry business, most recently agreeing to fabricate silicon based on technology from chip maker Altera. While an agreement to start production of ARM SoCs would likely undercut adoption of Intel's own Atom mobile processor, the move might be necessary to keep pace with a quickly changing market. The report also speculates that Intel's replacement for CEO Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May, may further diversify the company's contract operations in a bid to keep manufacturing facilities working at full capacity. As for Apple, a move to Intel is easier to imagine, as the Mac lineup already runs on x86 processors. It has also been rumored that the company wants to distance itself from current A-series SoC manufacturer Samsung, with which it is ensnarled in a worldwide patent struggle.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1362669481161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 10:18:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362670750319-50</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor: Intel to build A-Series chips</Title><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1362669481161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 10:18:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not going to happen.

When Apple looks inside one of Intel's newest fab factories they only wish they could get "inside". There is no way Intel will manufacture ARM based designed chips. The first criteria that Intel states as a requirement for taking on a fabless client is that they are not a "competitor" and will not be taking market share. If Apple wants to use Intel fab facilities, then it will have be using X86 and like the MacBook use an Intel designed chip. The next obvious step is for Apple to get all of their MacBooks to be "touch" enabled and then to start running all of their iOS compatible devices on the same X86. The main contention is PRICE, pure and simple dollars and cents. Apple is so accustomed to dictating price/cost to every one of their suppliers that they are having a hard time getting Intel to concede the their low ball price structure. The ARM designed chips inside the iPhone and iPad are cheap. Intel demands a higher and more fair price and Apple is unable to bring themselves to pay for these costs. After all, how do you account for the $138 BILLION cash hoard they have amassed over the last few years? Foxcon can only charge what Apple says they will pay. Ever wonder why they have Foxcon employees jumping off the roof of their factories when forced to put in 12 hours shifts and living like sardines inside 12 story dormitories? Apple is all about profit at the expense of others hard work and investment. This is why the fabless model is broken and Apple is no different than any other of those companies that don't put up the amount of R&amp;D and capex expenditures like Intel. Yes, Apple will be putting a $Billion or so into their new "Space Station" campus headquarters. Yet, they will still be on the "outside" looking "inside" Intel.</Msg><Username>san_warzone</Username><Timestamp>1362672680005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:11:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362673179826-54</Id><Title>AAPL/INTC deal harder than peace in the Middle East</Title><Msg>Too many egos, too many agendas, too many moving parts.

My view exactly. But, I believe that with the recent crash in their stock price, Apple and Tim Cook would be more willing to deal. There has been a lot of pressure from hedge funds for Apple to do something about distributing more dividends, do buybacks, and get the stock price back up - and investors will continue breathing down Tim Cook's neck till he does some strategic moves. With Samsung becoming more of a competitor, and TSMC being fairly shaky in terms of sub 28nm processes, Tim will have no choice but to do a deal with Intel. And if that calls for swapping ARMH core for an x86, he may just have to work towards that transition. Frankly, with Intel having a clear roadmap up to 5nm, it is not at all a bad transition for Apple.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1362674056980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:34:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362674298910-57</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Inside...Apple Outside</Title><Username>san_warzone</Username><Timestamp>1362672680005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:11:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The ARM designed chips inside the iPhone and iPad are cheap."

It's not a question of "if" Intel would ever make an ARM processor, they already do. Though Apple may not be out front in new innovation introduction they still seem to have excellent follow through. Windows 8 was the first step of Microsoft to offer one operating system that ran from PC's to smartphones. It was flawed by having it come out on two different platforms. Apple will probably not make the same mistakes. They've made no secret that their OS and iOS platforms will eventually merge. They just need to start taking the steps to make this happen. The smartphone is currently a lighter version of a PC. Eventually it will be a PC. The hardware is heading that direction. In the short term yes there are the issues of doing business with Samsung who is starting to beat Apple at the very market it developed. Long range there is the vision of having smartphone that are actual PC's entrenched deeper in people's everyday life. Perhaps the future innovation for Apple really isn't about the next big idea but instead enhancing prior innovations to fit even more seamlessly into our lifestyle.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1362678402542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 12:46:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362678596817-76</Id><Title>Intel and Apple rumored to be discussing iPhone processor manufacturing deal</Title><Msg>A Reuters report has suggested Intel and Apple are in discussions for the chip manufacturer to take over production of Apple’s A series mobile processors, a move which would see Intel increase its burgeoning contract manufacturing business, and Apple lessen its reliance on Samsung.

That sounds good to me - Apple can recoupe design cost longterm there will be 450mm manufacturing - one needs to think ahead (Intel probably already in process for selecting tool of choice for 10nm) 14nm &amp; 450mm wafer manufacturing Apple or any other customer is not only paying for the part - they are paying for Intels roadmap which allows them to plan well ahead.

Texas Instruments Raises Low End of Sales, Profit Forecasts By Ian King - Mar 7, 2013 3:26 PM PT Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), the largest maker of analog chips, raised the lower end of its forecasts for first-quarter sales and profit, as customers increase orders ahead of a projected rebound in electronics demand. Earnings will be 28 cents to 32 cents a share on sales of $2.8 billion to $2.91 billion, the Dallas-based company said today in a statement. On Jan. 22, Texas Instruments said profit would be 24 cents to 32 cents on revenue of $2.69 billion to $2.91 billion, and analysts on average had predicted 29 cents and $2.81 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Texas Instruments has thousands of customers across the electronics industry, from radar-equipment suppliers to microwave-oven makers, meaning its earnings are one of the broadest proxies for the health of the chip market. After running down inventories last year, some companies have resumed buying parts to ensure they aren’t caught short when demand returns, said Tore Svanberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. “Order rates are still improving, from obviously a low level,” said Svanberg, who recommends buying the shares. “The industrial market and especially automotive is showing some strength. We’re still very early in the process.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362702130002</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 19:22:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362703701802-129</Id><Topic><Title>As I predicted, we will test $23.02 short-term</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1362668176867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 09:56:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could you be kind enough to explain your model?

While Microsoft seems to have a talent for stumbling their way to success at least they have a vision to unify their platforms with a single OS kernel from smartphone to server. With Intel's broad processor lineup they also have the means to execute on that strategy. Already there is a company that offers full Windows 8 on a cellphone that fits into a telephone handset docking station and enables the handset to become the person's PC with full W8 when the person is at their desk. This is an extremely useful glimpse what the future holds for desktop and application portability and together Intel and Microsoft have the inside track. Apple has no path because of the bifurcated processor strategy. Legacy MAC OS apps aren't going to be ported to ARM ISA any more than legacy Windows apps have been ported to ARM. It's the same reason Windows RT is dead or dying. If Apple intends to have a meaningful place in the future they need to have a single instruction set across all their platforms. There is no absolutely no doubt Intel is capable of delivering processors to serve all of Apple's products, but more importantly, there is no evidence at all to believe that ARM can.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1362704276454</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 19:57:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362706358305-131</Id><Topic><Title>Its a NO BRAINER folks.

It's so dumb that these analysts and media keep pounding table about Apple's foundry business going to Intel (or Intel should be begging for that business) but that idea, at best, is stupid and counter-productive for Intel. Why would any company like Intel would want to manufacture and improve the efficiency of it's competitor's chips by providing their enviable foundry platform? why??? I don't think they want prove that ARM chips can run better by throwing their foundry tech. prowess. It's in the best interest of Apple to switch away from BIG.LITTLE new kid on block on to more proven, more portable, more superior vendor who could match power efficiency of ARM even with their superior/PC processors. Apple should stop thinking about 'I-wanna-be-Intel' idea. It's just not their business. They good at consumer experience. Steve was smart when he switched to Intel from IBM just for those same reasons.</Msg><Username>imbluesclues</Username><Timestamp>1362706358305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 20:32:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362706412252-132</Id><Topic><Title>Its a NO BRAINER folks.

Don't get your hopes up that an x86-based iPhone is on the way. A possible allegiance between Intel and Apple only means that the chip maker simply wants to manufacture chips for other companies to make up for revenue lost in a declining PC market. Last week Intel said that it will open up its manufacturing plants to fellow chipmaker Altera, the first in Intel's foundry business. That's big news considering Intel has spent decades hoarding its prized manufacturing technology to itself. But given that the PC market is declining and Intel's fabrication plants are operating at less than full capacity, it was only a matter of time before Intel decided to open those plants to other companies. "Altera's FPGAs using Intel 14-nm technology will enable customers to design with the most advanced, highest-performing FPGAs in the industry," said John Daane, president, CEO and chairman of Altera. "In addition, Altera gains a tremendous competitive advantage at the high end in that we are the only major FPGA company with access to this technology." Now there's talk that Apple plans to be the next customer. An unnamed source close to both companies told Reuters that top Intel and Apple executives have discussed a possible relationship over the past year. So far no actual agreement has been made. "If you can have a strategic relationship where you're making chips for one of the largest mobile players, you should definitely consider that. And for Apple, that gets them a big advantage," said Pat Becker Jr., of Becker Capital Management. His firm owned about $39 million worth of Intel shares at the end of last year. Reuters reports that Intel's plan to become a foundry business includes heavy capital spending while it continues to struggle in both the desktop and mobile markets. Intel has yet to find enough new demand to fill future fabrication plans, and it will likely become highly vulnerable to economic swings</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362713581539</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 22:33:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362713602880-141</Id><Topic><Title>BTW, thanks to the paid-shill intel_dividend,agtt and all his other aliases for alerting me to buy facebook</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1362711654288</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 22:00:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you make sure to alert all the people that you told FB was going to 100 that you bailed at 27?
