For a data center hosting 300,000 servers each with two 1+ TB/s interfaces, the required network bandwidth (without oversubscription) is several hundred terabits/s. To provide a reference, Cisco’s CRS-3 series router, which in many service provider networks is one of the most scalable specialized network components, delivers a maximum throughput of 322 Tb/s. Our point is that there is demand for an intra-datacenter switch type product that will deliver a performance at step function higher than anything on the market today. We expect that a solution able to scale to meet this type of demand will include a variety of new technologies that will either be announced or come to market in 2013 and, possibly, 2014. These technologies are likely to include: 10G and 40G packet switches (already used), optical switches built to offload large data flows from packet-based switches, and technology that directly interconnects silicon-to-fiber connectivity enabled through silicon photonic technology.</Msg><Username>dachmeister4u</Username><Timestamp>1363967763037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:56:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363967956498-42</Id><Topic><Title>What The?????</Title><Username>pcrandallfinance</Username><Timestamp>1363966657925</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:37:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you believe you can talk a stock down?

Skaugen, Intel’s vice president of PC Client Group, was speaking at the recent Intel Solutions Summit 2013 in Los Angeles, when he made these comments, according to a ZDNet report today. He suggested the drop off in interest in the “full-sized” slates would not be gentle or gradual but the market share of such devices would “rapidly erode” this year Attacked from two sides The popularity of smaller tablets in the 7 to 8-inch diagonal screen size range was one of the first developments to put the brakes on full sized tablet market growth. Where a smaller version of a tablet is available buyers have voted with their feet (wallets). The trend has been that these smaller tablets are dominating, where both sizes have concurrently been available. In the case of the Apple iPad, the 8-inch iPad mini has pulled ahead, even though the full size one had such a commanding lead. The smaller sized, lighter tablets are more “handy” for carrying around, being held with one hand while operated with the other and crucially also significantly cheaper. Poised to squeeze the 10-inch tablet market from the other direction are a slew of hybrid laptops with detachable displays or other tablet conversion facilities according to Skaugen. All Haswell Ultrabooks will be required to have touchscreen functionality. Skaugen predicted that many smaller 11-inch region variants would have detachable screens while 13-inch or larger varieties would prefer “flip” designs. Also with these new designs reaching the market later this year Windows 8 will perhaps start to be taken more seriously, the Modern UI side of things will become much more useful to many new PC owners.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363971716868</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363972279251-55</Id><Topic><Title>Updated Geekbench Leader board: ARM's A15 knocked of the Top; Intel's SoC fastest clocked.</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363938276947</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 03:44:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Come on Wallis, put your balls on the line, what will Clovertrail+ score?:)" [You do a half-azzzed comparison to older hardware, get called on it, and now you want to talk smack.

Sign up now Intel aims to deliver more targeted packages of TV and internet content at different price points through its upcoming TV set-top box BY AGAM SHAH | NEW YORK | FRIDAY, 22 MARCH, 2013 inShare Intel aims to deliver more targeted packages of TV and internet content at different price points through its upcoming TV set-top box, which will better address user needs than bundles offered by cable TV and satellite companies. Later this year, Intel will release a set-top box that will deliver live TV and on-demand content through a customized Web user interface. The set-top box could replace cable TV boxes, Apple TV or Roku boxes, and will also deliver TV and internet content to tablets and smartphones. The TV box, which is yet unnamed, is being tested in the homes of some Intel employees on the US West Coast, said Eric Free, vice president and general manager of content and services for Intel Media, during a speech at the Next TV Summit in New York on Thursday. Consumers have different viewing needs, and cable and satellite companies load packages to include channels that customers may not want. Intel will offer a wider range of packages of targeted content, Free said. "We think we can deliver a better user experience" and better packaging, Free said. Intel is partnering with online and broadcast companies to deliver content through its box. Intel is open to the idea of working with cable companies, though the company has not made any related announcements. "We think there's an opportunity to bundle in a smart way," Free said. The company announced the TV box just a month ago, and has not revealed packages or pricing. But Intel does not want to try to "outprice or underprice" existing services, Free said. In a question and answer session after his speech, Free acknowledged that there could be an opportunity to drive content bundles that could be inexpensive compared to packages available now, though Free said that wasn't the goal. There is an audience who can't afford cable TV, but the set-top box is targeted more at younger audiences who want convenient access to live TV, on-demand TV and internet content in a single box, Free said. The box will bring social media, gaming and other online activities to the living room TV watching experience. "We are more interested in solving problems for the younger audiences who are deeply dissatisfied with what they are getting," Free said. Intel has an early advantage as products like Roku and Apple TV either don't offer live TV or offer it in a limited fashion, and satellite and cable boxes are not yet designed to handle online content. The TV box is being made by Intel's Media Group, which was founded in late 2011. The chip maker faces challenges as it moves into a market in which device makers, TV companies, content providers and cable and satellite companies are jostling for control of TV sets. Intel has rarely released products directly to consumers, and that has raised questions about whether the TV box will succeed. But Intel has moved fast in making the device, and Free said the time is ripe for delivery of TV content over the Internet. Content compression techniques are improving, and the internet download speed will quadruple by 2015, Free said. Citing a Cisco study, Free said that in the future more than half of the internet bandwidth will be taken up by video streams</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363972571575</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363972718640-59</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks ;)</Msg><Username>amber.hollis</Username><Timestamp>1363972718640</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:18:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363972725000-60</Id><Topic><Title>ARM's new CEO: You'll get no 'glorious new strategy' from me Past performance no guarantee of future success, though</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363972376685</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:12:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>irrelevant....

By David Manners on March 21, 2013 10:17 AM | 6 Comments | No TrackBacks Intel should take an ARM licence, ARM's founding CEO Sir Robin Saxby, told the GSA Entrepreneurship Conference at the British Museum yesterday. "As an ARM shareholder, I recommend Intel to take an ARM licence and stop messing about," said Saxby. Intel has been trying, without much success, to get into mobile devices with its x86 architecture which dominates the PC industry. Saxby recalled that when ARM was launched with little money and a team of 12 IC designers plus Saxby, that the only way he could create a business was to build partnerships. "We had to turn our enemies into friends," said Saxby, "the only enemy we haven't turned into a friend is Intel." Hence Saxby's recommendation that Intel should take out an ARM licence and start building mobile chips around ARM cores. The x86 architecture was designed for computers which plug into the mains. Power usage didn't matter. High performance was the only thing that did matter to Intel and, for years, Intel scaled its transistors, and designed its microprocessors, primarily for performance. Having a monopoly over PC microprocessor architecture made Intel think it could also gain a monopoly in mobile device microprocessor architecture, but ARM's architecture is already the dominant architecture in mobile. If Intel made mobile SOCs based on ARM's architecture, Intel would start winning significant mobile design-ins at OEMs.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363973682205</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363973802511-65</Id><Topic><Title>ARM's new CEO: You'll get no 'glorious new strategy' from me Past performance no guarantee of future success, though</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363972376685</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:12:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"irrelevant....

This will be great fun if Intel is able to get it going...] Employees of Intel Corporation will be the first users who will be able to test the new service of the company as the semiconductor giant has prepared for a rollout that is scheduled to take place later this year. The Vice President and General Manager for Content and Services at Intel Media, Eric Free has stated to CNET today that the company is conducting closed trials of the product with the employees of the company in three markets of West Coast. There were no other details provided by him but he predicted that the year 2013 will be the breakout year for over-the-top video services. According to Free, there have been a lot of fits and starts when it comes to bringing pay TV to the internet, but this year, things will seriously take shape. According to Free, there are three main reasons why over-the-top video will flourish this year. The behavior of the consumers are changing, with a lot of people not paying for TV and technology has made television based on the internet possible. In addition to that, companies have now become more comfortable with the internet because now they know as to where the business is actually going. But the most important reason why Intel believes that television services based on the internet will prove to be big this year is because they are about to launch their own product in the latter part of this year. Intel however has not provided any specific details regarding what it is going to offer or what its pricing is going to be like. But the company has mentioned that it will provide services as well as hardware to the customers directly. The employees of Intel will test the service as the company prepares for a broader rollout.

As Intel has said repeatedly lowering the cost of cable TV service to consumers is NOT the goal. Could there one day, possibly, maybe be a way Intel could deliver cheaper bundles than cable TV already delivers? Only if the cable companies see it in their interests to voluntarily undermine their own business model and that doesn't look too likely. According to this article, Intel is not distributing its box in partnership with any cable operator and that's a big problem. Intel's Web TV relies on the consumers cable Internet access (for the majority of the US population) and the amount of data traffic allowed in one's monthly charge is finite. Watching too many Netflix movies can already force a consumer over their monthly data allowance. Watching Live TV multiple hours a day could put a consumer over their data allowance in the first week. Intel customers had better budget overage fees on their Internet service bill. Increasingly the comments coming out of Intel Media Group seem to be saying they've already written off most adults and will be aiming this to "younger audiences" interested in gaming and social media. Well few teenagers are buying homes and making choices about what cable TV service to buy.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1363976169907</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:16:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363977413115-74</Id><Title>Re Micron</Title><Msg>for some reason not able to respond to specific message: they don't see building of inventories and PC DRAM supply/demand is healthy relative to PC demand IOW it's now adjusted to (weak) PC demand. DRAM content growth per box slowed down and was another reason for over capacity. PC demand is fair but it's not falling off the cliff - I noticed the (UBS?) analyst tried to get confirmation from Micron that PC demand is very weak. (the weasel tried to get confirmation from Micron for his most recent Intel call) Now everybody knows by now that PC demand is not great but maybe not as bad as some analysts claim. A 20% increase in contract pricing is pretty radical - I believe they are negotiated every 2 weeks (last updated 3/15) - so there is increasing unit demand and chance PC market is bottoming out The memory business has become very, very complex - 20 years ago there was probably a perfect correlation with PC demand but this has changed. President Yeah. I'd like to just reinforce the point I touched on a little earlier, which is a mobile DRAM part is not necessarily perishable to a PC DRAM part and vice versa. So as we look at the overall market, both mobile DRAM and PC DRAM are pretty healthy right now. But having said that, as you think about the market conditions, even though the PC unit growth is not -- has been projected to be low single digit to flat year-over-year, it's in pretty good balance right now. The PC market is not oversupplied as we sit here today in March. And so and the mobile market is pretty hot. But we're watching that balance because as manufacturers we have to call it right to keep the balance in good favor and that's what I think helping us both in the PC space. It’s not that end user demand for PCs are up, it's just the economics of supply and demand are providing a pretty favorable business for us in PC.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363977413115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:36:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363977415829-75</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.

Glen Yeung - Citigroup Can I just clarify a point, because when I hear your forecast -- not forecast but your statements about ASPs for the quarter in DRAM. Is it right to say that what's really happening is as you take on more Inotera wafers, it actually impacts the ASP increase because of mix but it actually is still contributing solidly to the profitability. Mark Durcan - Chief Executive Officer and Director Yeah, I think that’s right. There's really two things driving the cumulative impact on ASPs for us. One is the relative [lag] contract spot and the other is the change in our mix that has occurred with the addition of the Inotera increment. Now over time obviously we’ll start moving more of that capacity into value-added segments. But the initial slug of capacity came in the PC area. Glen Yeung - Citigroup That’s an important point. Second thing Mark, actually just to clarify, you made a statement about channel inventory being very lean. I just wanted to clarify, when you look into distributors, you don’t feel like those guys are trying to build inventory as they sometimes do when pricing is rising and related to that, are you also on allocation for NAND? You suggested you were selling DRAM. Mark Durcan - Chief Executive Officer and Director The answer to the first question is we don’t think that the distributors are in a good inventory position at this point relative to six, 12 months ago. We think it’s a pretty lean there as well. Quite honestly there is just not that much capacity available for those channels for them to take that position. As it relates to the NAND piece of the equation, there are certainly pockets of NAND that are in tight constraint as well. A lot of that is driven by the production mismatch sometimes what the requirements are on higher density SSDs. So we’re seeing real tough pockets on the [limits] of available supply for some of the SSD categories. Glen Yeung - Citigroup Just one last quick question. Thinking about the pull that you’re seeing for DRAM from now a variety of end markets, not just normal PC, I wonder if you could rank the end markets now in terms of what areas are pulling DRAM at the greatest or fastest growth rate be it server, networking, mobile or PC. Mark Durcan - Chief Executive Officer and Director So what we’re seeing in terms of overall raw capacity, it would be -- mobile certainly would be at the top of that list. PCs are probably second when you factor in tablets and it depends where you put tablets in the overall ranking. Server is actually pretty significant. You’ve got single digit growth, but pretty significant server DRAM content growth and that’s becoming more and more of a growth category in terms of bit consumption. And of course you’ve got the automotive and networking as you go down that list. Glen Yeung - Citigroup Is it fair to say that PC demand, ex tablets, is not so good right now? Mark Durcan - Chief Executive Officer and Director Yeah, but in balance remember now it’s kind of a science as you just highlighted. When you’re a manufacturer of DRAM you’ve got to make those calls on production based on where those products are going. You can’t just take a mobile bit and make it available a PC guy or vice versa in a given production period. So the unit growth in PC might not be super high, but the balance of PC bits and PC demand is pretty healthy right now.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363978331131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363978493339-80</Id><Topic><Title>CITI Analyst in conversation with MU</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363978331131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:52:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr Yeung probably didn't want to hear this....

Wow, sounds so terrible for Intel. BTW, it is well known that GeekBench on Windows 8 cripples performance of all X86 processors, so we will need to see Geekbench run on the Z2580 on Android before we count the dual core Atom out. ---- Geekbench has single threaded as well as a multithreaded component to the final score. Unless you break out the scores you can't really compare a quad to the dual threaded Atom (only other dual cores). Even if a CPU scaled perfectly a doubling of threads doesn't result in a doubling of the geekbench score. Clovertrail+ has the same CPU core as Medfield so you would expect the same single threaded performance given the same software workload (including the OS). One interesting aspect of Clovertrail+ is how long it will be able to sustain the high clock before being throttled back. With that extra core and much more powerful GPU die it may struggle with the thermals.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363983137397</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:12:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363983355934-100</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for giving out this article for free.</Msg><Username>nalenebenita</Username><Timestamp>1363983355934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:15:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363983438124-101</Id><Title>LI yui_3_8_1_1_1363986981907_613</Title><Msg>trying to reply to posts, but keep getting the above instead of a reply window...

However, following the broadband service reforms that took place over a year ago the FCC changed that long standing policy due to the recognition that usage and cost to deliver are related. The cable companies specifically pointed to rapidly growing amount of data used by Netflix customers. The outcome is that the FCC killed mandatory unlimited service and gave wireline service providers and wireless ISP's approval to charge consumers for the amount of data they use. To be sure, most cable operators so far have been generous with their allocation but it is not unlimited and Netflix users are often among those that find themselves with overage fees at the end of the month. Today cable operators now decide how much data is suitable to deliver within the fixed monthly price, and with modest regulatory oversight they can change this when they like. Running a live TV streaming service is far outside the parameters cable companies envisioned. And that would still be true even if Intel's box uses the newer H.265 compression codec. I hope you're not a member of Intel's Media Group assuming fixed-price unlimited service was still the national policy because this could be a serious oops moment.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1363985472951</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363986151440-105</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this article.</Msg><Username>kvarjohnnie</Username><Timestamp>1363986151440</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:02:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363986909718-106</Id><Topic><Title>Intel hopes to trump cable TV packages with new set-top box</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1363972571575</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 13:16:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I should add that the playing field is even more distorted than described in the previous post. Not only can cable operators charge the consumer more for data when the consumers uses an over-the-top service like Intel Web TV, but if the cable companies makes an identical device and delivers the same service they don't have to charge the consumer for the same amount of data used. In short, cable operators can control how successful over the top operators can be and if they want to offer the identical service they have a built-in pricing advantage. To be sure cable operators have a sweet deal with regulators.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1363986909718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:15:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363988435204-107</Id><Title>Is there any A15 bigLITTLE in volume production?</Title><Msg>that is used in smart phones Supposedly A15 big.LITTLE targets 28nm Renesas is trying to sell its mobile division - nobody seems to be interested. "Renesas Mobile Introduces Ground-Breaking Quad Core ARM Cortex-A15/Cortex-A7 CPU-based Communication Processor with Integrated LTE Cat-4 Modem Delivering low-power and high performance for fully immersive browsing, gaming and rich multimedia experiences using ARM® big.LITTLE™ technology for smartphones and superphones" Japanese chipset manufacturer Renesas looks increasingly likely to sell its loss-making mobile phone chip business, acquired from Nokia in 2010 for $200 million. “Overseas is our main focus,” president Tetsuya Tsurumaru told reporters in Tokyo yesterday, notes Reuters, without identifying the firms his company was speaking to. A sale in Japan remained a possibility, he added, but declined to discuss whether any talks about a domestic deal were underway. Only last week the company said it will decide in fiscal 2013 whether to sell the troubled mobile business. Renesas, the world’s largest maker of microcontroller chips used in cars, has been in the red ever since buying the mobile unit and was forced to seek a $1.8 billion government-led bailout last year. The mobile chip division is part of its wholly owned subsidiary Renesas Mobile. The world’s leading maker of microcontroller chips used in cars will receive its state financing by the end of September, at which point it will be two-thirds owned by the taxpayer-funded Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ). Reuters notes that Renesas had been expected to join an all-Japanese merger of Panasonic’s and Fujitsu’s LSI chip units, which make microchips used in TVs, digital cameras and other consumer electronic products. It is believed that those talks are ongoing.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363988435204</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:40:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363988527647-108</Id><Topic><Title>Re Micron</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363977413115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:36:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and who was that analyst that said she had called around and found PC was falling off the cliff so she downgraded INTC to target $18....

I haven't had time to go through the Micron numbers but it seems to me that based on my quick glance of the Micron numbers, hardware sales may not be quite as bad as the drive by analysts have painted. Of particular interest to me is NAND sales now, NAND can go in a variety of products but it goes into SSD products. Intel has a partnership with Micron in NAND production and virtually unmentioned by the analysts and media is the fact that INTC has a very good budding SSD market. Eventually it is anticipated that SSD's will replace hard drives in the future and SSD sales are rocketing. Now I am not sure what impact this will have on Intels's numbers but I can guess that it will be very positive.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1363990974662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 18:22:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363993560720-111</Id><Title>Asraf: Can you pitch the Micron numbers on SA to refute "PC is dead" ?</Title><Msg>That would make a great SA</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363993560720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363993948801-112</Id><Topic><Title>Asraf: Can you pitch the Micron numbers on SA to refute "PC is dead" ?</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363993560720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:06:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why should anyone help you?

Intel's silicon-level Haswell technology will result in "the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel history," according to a recent statement from Intel CEO Paul Otellni. But Windows Blue -- which is expected to deliver a variety of improvements beyond Haswell devices -- will contribute to the system's overall power efficiency too. Microsoft is building a "power model" that can adapt to a range of mobile computers with different "performance output," according to the source. Basically that means Blue on mainstream Intel chips will be able to act more like a smartphone or tablet OS. That technology will come from both Microsoft and Intel, according to the source. "You'll be able to buy an ultrabook that's as wickedly fast as you can imagine, faster than an Ivy Bridge PC. But with longer battery life," the source said. Ivy Bridge, Intel's current mainstream offering, will be superseded by Haswell. "It will sleep longer [and] when you open the lid, your mail's going to already be in sync. So, you'll get the best of all of those worlds. And that's work that's coming in [Windows] Blue," the source said. Some "flavors" of Haswell will come with an improved "standby" technology, which means essentially that when a device sleeps, it will stay connected to e-mail, social-networking sites, and the Internet in general, keeping the device up to date. In this respect, Haswell will trump Ivy Bridge. In short, Haswell will get power-saving technology that's used in Intel's power-efficient -- though lower-performance -- "Clover Trail" Atom line of processors.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364010418828</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:46:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
