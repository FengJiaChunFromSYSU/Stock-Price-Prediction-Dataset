Worldwide shipments of those microprocessors dropped around 9 percent during the third quarter from the same quarter last year, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. It was the second worst quarter for that segment of the processor market since the first quarter of 2001. Intel's market share was 83.3 percent in the third quarter, growing from 80.6 percent in the same quarter the previous quarter. AMD's market share was 16.1 percent, falling from 18.8 percent. Via Technology, which largely makes chips for low-cost PCs. had a 0.6 percent market share. An uncertain economic environment and slowdown in PC demand hurt x86 microprocessor shipments, McCarron said. Key computer makers backed off buying PC parts, with overall chip shipments declining for Intel and AMD. "AMD took more of the hit than Intel did. They both experienced declines," McCarron said. "AMD was simply hit by what OEMs saw in the markets... and hitting the brakes." Mobile chip shipments reduced by a mid-single digit percentage range for AMD and Intel, according to the research. Intel's gains on AMD mostly came in desktops, where volume shipments of new Core processors based on the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture and aggressive pricing may have helped it. Intel launched the first Ivy Bridge chips for desktops in April, and followed with Core processors for laptops. The PC market is in decline with more people buying tablets like the iPad for computing. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipments in the third quarter dropped by 8.6 percent compared to the same quarter a year earlier. A new category of light laptops called ultrabooks did not provide a spark to PC shipments during the third quarter, and analysts have said the PC sector could get a boost from Microsoft's latest Windows 8 OS, which became available late last month. The third quarter is traditionally strong due to the back-to-school PC purchases. But x86 chip shipments fell by 4 percent compared to the second quarter this year, McCarron said. AMD is strong in the desktop market, but launched its latest PC chips code-named Trinity just as the PC market started going into a decline, McCarron said. AMD was just phasing out its Llano chips, which are more than a year old and considered a failure, and sales of Trinity chips have not ramped up completely. The upcoming quarters look difficult for AMD and Intel with the PC market in a slump. "The key is how the macroeconomic situation is, which is not looking good for the next couple of quarters," McCarron said. The recovery of the chip market also depends on PC buying trends, which may not improve in the coming quarter. "Hopefully things will improve next year," McCarron said. The slumping PC market also hurt Intel's and AMD's earnings, with overall and PC chip revenue dropping for both companies in the most recent fiscal quarter. The chip makers are facing an increasing threat from the likes of Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm and Nvidia, whose ARM-based chips go into smartphones and tablets. Mercury Research's study did not include ARM in the numbers as the processors are not considered PC chips.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352298813402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 09:33:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352298911468-42</Id><Topic><Title>hahahah teabaggers can you say landslide?</Title><Username>maestro1up</Username><Timestamp>1352298302365</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 09:25:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>par for the course, idiots vote for the same old socialist agenda and the market tanks also, par for the course, those who bght intc pre-dividend get a dividend and a lower stock price.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352298911468</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 09:35:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352299597578-43</Id><Title>EE Times: Death of the PC</Title><Msg>Windows Surface marks the beginning of the end of the PC-era, as users shift from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones. Many mature Mac users have already migrated to the iPad, following the legions of teenage users who already use their smartphone or tablet as their primary computer. Microsoft, however, has driven the last nail in the coffin of PCs by providing Windows users with a clear migration path to tablet computing. To be sure the transition will take at least a decade, but Microsoft's Surface--and the legions of lookalikes who are licensing Windows 8 for tablets--have accelerated the end of the PC era. Now the pent-up jealousy that Windows users have felt for Apple's iOS and Google's Android can be easily alleviated by switching to Surface.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352299597578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 09:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352299962782-44</Id><Topic><Title>INTC down 8 cents in the pre-market, is this a sign of things to come...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1352293969072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down to 21.18 this morning,,, WOW... if it hits $21, I might try to scrape up some money to buy more...

There’s very little change in Congress and the Senate (which) means that things are the same,” Gartman said. Gartman had predicted a decisive win for Republican Mitt Romney earlier this week believing Romney could win “quite handily.” He had noted a number of historical parallels which pointed to a likely Romney win, claiming the polls were “badly out of touch.” Polls had in recent days shown a small but clear lead for Obama. He did however have a strong caveat to his prediction claiming he could be “terribly wrong.” “History proves that Democrat presidents are better for stock prices than Republican presidents and I suspect that the bull market that’s been intact since March 2009 will continue to move higher as the monetary authorities expand reserves in the system,” he said. He conceded that the economy was making strides forward under Obama’s presidency. “The economy is doing better and in a year’s time we could even see GDP (growth) of 2.5 to 3 percent. That is supportive of the stock market and one could be bullish on shares,” Gartman added.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1352303338309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:48:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352303531418-76</Id><Topic><Title>INTC down 8 cents in the pre-market, is this a sign of things to come...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1352293969072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 08:12:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the chump is you. and no recession has been factored into the markets, a mere 5-7 percent off the highs, unlike the commodities called chips only fools buy as "investments"</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352303531418</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:52:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352303558289-77</Id><Title>Chump Street Cockroaches, Shills, Shorts and other assorted #$%$</Title><Msg>Will use the election just as an excuse to beat the stock down even lower, pricing in another miss that won't happen.

In the presidential debate last Tuesday on Long Island, and through much of this campaign season, Mitt Romney has been raising a similar question. He said last week that middle-class incomes have declined since President Obama took office, while gasoline prices have risen. And much as Mr. Reagan did several decades ago, Mr. Romney suggested that Americans are worse off today than they were four years earlier. By some objective measures, we are worse off — although that is at least partly because a severe recession was well under way and the economy was shrinking when Mr. Obama first walked into the White House as president. Based primarily on the grim fundamental economic data, several forecasting models have been showing for months that Mr. Obama faced a very difficult road to re-election. Yet for the most part, he has been holding his own in the polls and the prediction markets. At the moment, he is widely considered to have an advantage in the all-important Electoral College. But why? Elections, of course, are not decided on economics alone. “Campaigns matter, at least a little,” said Thomas M. Holbrook, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. “The issues and the candidates matter, at least a little.” Yet to the extent that the economy determines the election’s outcome, it’s possible that the stock market holds part of the explanation for Mr. Obama’s outsize electoral strength. Through Friday, since Mr. Obama’s inauguration — his first 1,368 days in office — the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 67.9 percent. That’s an extremely strong performance — the fifth best for an equivalent period among all American presidents since 1900.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1352304139130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:02:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352305359838-83</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D., Marsavian, etc. thoughts ???</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1352302738614</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:38:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is much variation depending on what the pre-VM application loading on the machines was and how much memory the apps needed and what OS they ran on. A machine reduction of 5:1 or 10:1 is not going to be common. It may even attract some programs to the machines that were running on desk system. Virtualization is when you install a VM manager at the lowest level and that VM software then provides a "virtual machine" environment to an OS so that OS can then support applications on top of that OS. The VM can then run a copy of Win7 or Linux or any OS on top of the VM in 32-bit or 64-bit modes. The VM software adds extra compute cycle overhead to the system. Multiple copies of the OS and/or OS data and likely different applications will stress the HW more. The HW cannot be used at 100% load very long without customer complaining about throughput or response times. Some random thoughts: They will likely end up buying larger machines with more power compute. EP and EX systems = higher CPU price, margin. They will have to pay for the extra VM environment cycle overhead. If they had lightly loaded machines, it makes sense for them to do this. VM would seem to encourage a homogeonous compute environement so all the "x86" could run. If I have a lab of Intel VM machines, there won't be any reason for an ARM system unless someone wants to specifically run ARM apps. Companies have been doing this for years. Oracle sells access to their products via cloud and they are (I think) using VM sessions to protect customer data but make most efficient use of space, power and equipment. I think it is one natural configuration. People have been using time shared systems for 50 years. Intel is driving performance up so much that this becomes a more desireable configuration. That is why Intel charges $2000 for these CPU rather than $200. I doubt that a customer would collapse 10:1 with "like" systems. If they did, they were wrong in the original purchases by buying too much machine.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1352305359838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:22:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352305569293-84</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D., Marsavian, etc. thoughts ???</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1352302738614</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:38:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Virtualization is not a new phenomenon and actually costs performance for the middleware software to handle it.

Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University and chairman of Roubini Global Economics, has reportedly said that the stock market will be in for a major shock in November of this year. Roubini reportedly feels that the alarming economic downturn will cause “the global financial system to implode,” according to a source close to a Wall Street executive. What is most shocking is the Edgar Cayce, known as the “sleeping prophet” predicted back in 1940 that there would be major stock market crash in November of 2012. For forty-three years of his adult life, Edgar Cayce demonstrated an uncanny ability to predict the future. Roubini reportedly has been a longtime follower of Cayce and agrees with him that the stock market will crash in November. Cayce predicted that the crash would not just be in the U.S. – all major markets in the world will crash. Edgar Cayce reportedly predicted that the crash in November will begin 10 years of further economic downturn throughout the world and then… the next fifty years will be the most prosperous and happiest of any time in the history of mankind. So, if we can just make it through the next 10 years, we’ll be good. Many on Wall Street aren’t buying the predictions of Roubini and Cayce, but there are a lot of money managers already putting in sell orders for early November. What will you do? Do you believe Dr. Doom and The Sleeping Prophet?"</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1352306262690</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:37:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352306386393-92</Id><Topic><Title>can we get under 21 today?</Title><Username>marrohead</Username><Timestamp>1352302317069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:31:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We did...

The year 1970 was the crucial turning point, because foreign arbitrage of the U.S. dollar caused governmental gold coverage of the paper dollar to decline from 55% to 22%. That, in the view of neoclassical economics and the Austrian School, represented the point where holders of the U.S. dollar lost faith in the U.S. government's ability to cut its budget and trade deficits. By 1971, the money supply had increased by 10%.[1] In the first six months of 1971, $22 billion in assets left the U.S.[2] In May 1971, inflation-wary West Germany was the first member country to unilaterally leave the Bretton Woods system — unwilling to devalue the Deutsche Mark in order to prop up the dollar.[1] In the following three months, West Germany's move strengthened its economy. Simultaneously, the dollar dropped 7.5% against the Deutsche Mark.[1] Due to the excess printed dollars, and the negative U.S. trade balance, other nations began demanding fulfillment of America's "promise to pay" – that is, the redemption of their dollars for gold. Switzerland redeemed $50 million of paper for gold in July.[1] France, in particular, repeatedly made aggressive demands, and acquired $191 million in gold, further depleting the gold reserves of the U.S.[1] On August 5, 1971, Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar, in an effort to protect the dollar against "foreign price-gougers."[1] Still, on August 9, 1971, as the dollar dropped in value against European currencies, Switzerland unilaterally withdrew the Swiss franc from the Bretton Woods system.[1]</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1352308460282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:14:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352308646511-107</Id><Topic><Title>Wars cost money</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1352308460282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:14:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar" which is why China pegs their currency to the dollar... currency manipulation on both ends...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352308646511</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:17:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352308899924-108</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander D., Marsavian, etc. thoughts ???</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1352302738614</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:38:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>was it a good time to buy INTC at 21.00 on it's way to 12.00?

Asked about Intel’s future, ARM Chief Executive Warren East noted that Intel is a company that has successfully navigated a number of big changes during the 60-year history of the chip industry. So those that write the company off are probably making a mistake, East said. “I think it’s a little bit early to call that sort of thing for Intel,” East said, kicking off the Open Mobile Summit in San Francisco. “Intel has successfully in that time reinvented themselves from a memory maker into a microprocessor company.” Nonetheless, ARM and the legion of companies that make chips using ARM’s designs certainly have their sites set on Intel’s key markets. Once relegated to low-end devices, ARM-based chips now dominate the smartphone market and, with the release of Windows RT, now are competing in the PC market as well. ARM last week announced a new line of 64-bit chips aimed at bringing a threefold increase in performance for roughly the same amount of power consumption. The company is also working to bring its chips into another power-sensitive area: the data center. Technology, East notes, already consumes 10 percent of the world’s electricity, highlighting the need for more power-efficient chips. He likened it to the auto industry where miles-per-gallon has replaced horsepower as the key benchmark. “That is an essential part of the equation,” East said. East said that he sees continued tough competition, whether it is his firm and other chip players or on the device front, between Apple, Google, Samsung and others.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352312420783</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:20:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352312460311-128</Id><Title>still see support at $19 a 5 year low reset.......</Title><Msg>tech is in a recession</Msg><Username>febru3012</Username><Timestamp>1352312460311</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:21:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352312521447-129</Id><Topic><Title>Fellow Conservatives</Title><Username>counter_insurgency_buff</Username><Timestamp>1352311624066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:07:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Moran"</Msg><Username>poor_bastard_2009</Username><Timestamp>1352312521447</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:22:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352312539677-130</Id><Title>Buyback has started</Title><Msg>says Intel Chief !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352312539677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:22:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352312828646-131</Id><Topic><Title>Buyback has started</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352312539677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:22:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These #$%$ mainpulators.

Ziff Davis Enterprise Inc. All Rights Reserved. 0 Samsung has revealed its portfolio of PCs that are optimised for Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system, which includes mobile PCs and all-in-one (AIO) product lines. In addition, Samsung also offers a range of applications across devices, including Samsung Quick Starter, and applications for the S Pen styles, such #$%$ Note and S Memo. Product Offerings The Series 5 Ultra Touch is Samsung’s first Ultrabook with a 10-finger multi touch-screen. Inside sits a third-generation Intel Core i3 or i5 processor, 500GB hard drive, 1.3-megapixel camera and 4G double data rate (DDR) memory. Other features include premium multimedia capabilities, a high-definition screen, a USB 3.0 port, a three-in-one card reader and Bluetooth 4.0 technology. The Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T is engineered for mobile users and allows them to switch between a traditional clamshell notebook PC and tablet PC, while the ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T, designed for on-the-go professionals with an Intel Core i5 processor, can also switch between a clamshell and tablet form factor. The ATIV devices are preloaded with S Pen optimised apps such #$%$ Note, S Memo and S Cloud. With 1,024 levels of sensitivity, the S Pen is designed for intuitive content creation, and offers features, including handwriting-to-text conversion and varying thickness when drawing or writing, depending on the pressure applied. For desktops, Samsung gave consumers a look at the Series 5 all-in-one (AIO), was designed to serve as a “kitchen PC,” with a keyboard and mouse that fit between the legs of the base to open up counter space and a slightly smaller screen size. The AIO will sport an Intel Core i3 processor and HD graphics, Bluetooth 4.0 technology, HD audio, and a 21.5-inch high-definition 10-point multitouch display. The Series 7 AIO recognizes hand gestures in addition to the 10-finger touch capability and sports a 23.6-inch or 27-inch HD display. The latest Samsung PCs also feature exclusive applications, and all of the products have the ability to interact with other Samsung devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and TVs, through Samsung AllShare Play, which integrates the PC into users’ home or office ecosystems. Users can share content between their AIO and other Samsung devices on the same network, such as showcasing photos from their phone to the larger AIO display or share a document drafted on the desktops with their tablet and continue editing when mobile. The PCs also feature SW Update for the latest software and drivers. Included within SW Update is Samsung’s Quick Starter feature, which adds a toolbar and start button to the Windows 8 interface, which provides users with a choice of interface and offers a familiar navigation scheme. In addition, SW Update includes AllShare Play for convergence across devices. Home Convergence “Samsung has seen extraordinary growth in the mobile PC category over the past few years, and we’re now taking our success to the next level by connecting the PC to other devices in the home or office through our convergence technology, Samsung AllSharePlay,” Mike Abary, the company’s senior vice president of consumer IT product marketing, said in a statement.” The launch of Windows 8 provides an inflection point in the evolution of the PC. Samsung has always focused on pushing the boundaries of design to create truly remarkable products that consumers and businesses want. We’re confident that we will continue to lead the future with our thoughtful, powerful approach to the computing experience.”</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1352319822483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:23:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352320837752-156</Id><Title>Cover Trail beats iPads in browsing battery life</Title><Msg>10+ hours browsing battery life imagesDOTanandtechDOTcom/graphs/graph6434/51427.png Article coming soon.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1352320837752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:40:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352320990089-157</Id><Topic><Title>In six months those who bought Intel today will look just fine</Title><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1352317516579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:45:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there isn't supposed to be a March in case you all forgot.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352320990089</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:43:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352321147613-158</Id><Topic><Title>In six months those who bought Intel today will look just fine</Title><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1352317516579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:45:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your the man with all you're pumping, Wallis!
