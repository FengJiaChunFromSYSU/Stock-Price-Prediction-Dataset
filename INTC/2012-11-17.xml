PC WORLD "Development efforts around the Phi chips were originally announced in 2010. At the time, the processor was seen as a continued development of a chip called Larrabee, which was to be Intel's first graphics processor but was later scrapped. The Phi chips were "not designed to be graphics processors," Curley said. The chip is good for visualization and graphics applications, but it is not designed for high-level APIs (application programming interfaces) usually used to design graphics applications like games, Curley said. Some Phi design elements were also drawn from an experimental 48-core chip for cloud computing and an 80-core chip for high-performance computing. Phi is Intel's way to keep up with Moore's Law, which forecasts a doubling of the number of transistors in chips, and therefore a doubling of chip performance, approximately every two years. But balancing performance with power consumption has been a challenge, and programmers are expected to write code that scales across multicore chips. Intel is providing software tools so applications can be written or recompiled for the Phi chips. Curley said it is easy to recompile existing x86 code so that high-performance applications can take full advantage of the multicore chips. The Phi chips could also work alongside ARM CPUs in a computing environment, but it would require massive investment from a server maker to build such a system, Curley said. "There's nothing in the engineering design that precludes it," Curley said. However, he noted that current Phi implementations will be on servers with x86 CPUs."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353178305334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 13:51:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353179404972-52</Id><Topic><Title>Think ARM has enough research money to do a 48 core smartphone?</Title><Username>divorceanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353177380118</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 13:36:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Phi chips could also work alongside ARM CPUs in a computing environment, but it would require massive investment from a server maker to build such a system. _________ "Massive Investment" to work on ARM..........chuckles.</Msg><Username>divorceanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353179404972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 14:10:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353181925709-53</Id><Topic><Title>Getanid61, divorced and bitter?</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353176141129</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 13:15:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why waste your time on that fool?

MSFT has never quite understood the reason for its great success, it was chosen over Macs and other PCs not because it is a great innovator or leader but because it brought the greatest amount of freedom for 3rd party software on its o/s. Once it starts deluding itself it some sort of great technology leader or tries being a control freak like Apple it gets into trouble.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353202001943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 20:26:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353202811372-67</Id><Topic><Title>Marsavian kicks getanid61's teeth in, part 3</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1353200333083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:58:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When do you think it will finally become obvious, even to the analysts?

But there are only a few here who get that it's more than just about the fabs...

On this board, it's mainly just one poster with multiple ids... In fact, you marked one of his ids for extinction as I recall...

There is one seller with 8 of them. Expidited deliver before 11/23. A number are advertised on Amazon without ship conditions. NEWEGG shows them but out of stock. I have used that to point out shortage of 20nm parts built by TSMC in the past. The DELL Latitude 10 is being advertised on the Dell site with an estimated deliver date of Dec. 12th. The QCOM Snapdragon version is estimated delivery date of Dec 13th.

Some retailers are saying November 20. The Lenovo ThinkPad2 is $650 without keyboard and weighs 1.3 pounds. It has a 10.1" screen, WiFi, and cellular.

Touch on a laptop would be tipping it over and touch on a desktop would be a longer reach than the mouse. But the tablets that dock to a laptop keyboard are not a very rigid dock (according to reviewers). And a tablet docking to a desktop would be the main computer but who wants to walk out the door with the main computer ? A tablet is best simply as an accessory carry or tavel computer. Someone who needs a keyboard should just buy a laptop. My favorite laptop is the Samsung 13.3" Series 9 at 2.6 pounds weight. Amazon has it with Win 7 at $1200 or with Win 8 at $1300. But I like a tablet with both WiFi and ethernet because I might be able to plug in at a hotel and who knows about WiFi security ? One reviewer said that the ATIV 500T was not great performace (except when running RT apps) but that Photoshop worked okay.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1353208888076</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 22:21:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353209353631-76</Id><Topic><Title>Is Clover trail still supposed to come out 90 days after Surface RT?</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1353201018823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 20:10:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I forgot to mention the tablets that swing the screen around and snap it into place over the keyboard to go into tablet mode.
