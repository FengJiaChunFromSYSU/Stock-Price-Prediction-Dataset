With consistent discussions as well as some attractive subsidies, it has earned the trust of some first-tier brand vendors and is expected to attract more in the future. Intel has planned two platforms for the smartphone market, the low-power Lexington-based Atom processor, designed specifically for the entry-level segment and the Clover Trail+ processor, targeting the performance and mainstream segments. The Lexington-based processors have already landed orders from players such as Acer, Lava International and Safaricom, for their new smartphones. Lenovo will also launch 1-2 new smartphone models later in 2013 and will first release the K900 in April with a 5.5-inch Full HD display, a dual-core Atom Z2580 (Clover Trail+) processor and the latest Android operating system.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361547539823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:38:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361547736140-42</Id><Title>You are under my spell not to buy INTC shares today</Title><Msg>You are going to sleep and when you awake you will be very scare and will not buy INTC shares today.</Msg><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1361547736140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:42:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361547845703-43</Id><Topic><Title>The Sound of One Hand Clapping</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361546685086</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:24:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With all due respects Mr. W, can't you be right at least once?

[In other words they still are having trouble ramping 28nm and don't have enough capacity...] TSMC has seen chip demand for smartphones and tablets stay brisk since the first quarter of 2013, as its clients prepare for the introduction of new products at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show, followed by their official launches later in the quarter, the sources indicated. TSMC chairman and CEO Morris Chang remarked at the company's most-recent investors conference that the foundry is close to achieving 100% foundry market share in 28nm technology. [More bad news for ARM fabrication as only one source of 28nm illustrates how bad the crisis actually is...] TSMC will continue to significantly ramp up its production of 28nm chips in 2013 with wafer starts to triple those of 2012, according to Chang. [Yeah, they will need to ramp 28nm as that is where ARM fabrication will be stuck for years and years and years...] TSMC expects its consolidated sales to register another sequential decrease, but only slightly, in the first quarter of 2013. [Things are really, really great but, um, here's another sequential decrease in sales. Go figure...] [Yet more evidence that the ARM Bubble continues its descent into the land of sharp objects.

For analog designers, he (Bohr) asserted, an important transistor metric is trans-conductance by power out (GM x Rout). Bohr said that while this value had been steadily degrading over the past few generations, it had shot up again in 22-nm trigate SoCs, making it easier for analog circuit designers to use than Intelâs previous three generations of planar technology.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361551076799</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:37:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361551297379-65</Id><Topic><Title>Intel acquires appMobi for HTML5 developer tools</Title><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361548653907</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Access to the HTML5 tools has moved to softwareDOTintelDOTTcom/html5</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361551297379</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:41:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361551371234-66</Id><Topic><Title>Google unveils new Chromebook Pixel.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1361543370943</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:29:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is the point of this gadget?

Proliferation of devices and management endpoints. Calxeda is building functionality into its server processors for simplified management of thousands of devices. Going with the EnergyCore line could allow businesses to increase servers four-fold and still reduce management complexity. Risk. Even though ARM has a mature processor architecture and HP are veterans in this field, this is still an early product.

I wonder if it will work on Wall Street...] An eye-implanted chip from Retina Implant has restored patients' ability to discern light during its latest trial, according to German researchers. The device works in a similar fashion to the newly FDA-approved Argus II retinal prosthesis to return limited vision in patients with photoreceptor cell diseases like retinitis pigmentosa. Unlike that system, however, light is picked up via 1,500 pixels on a retinal implant instead of an eyeglass-mounted camera. The signal is boosted by a coil implanted in skin behind the ear and sent back to so-called bipolar cells still active on the retina, which in turn send an image to the brain through regular neural circuits. A small battery mounted behind the ear -- the only external sign of the device -- contains controls for brightness and contrast. The recent trial let 8 out of 9 patients see in varying degrees, with three in the study even able to read letters and see the faces of family members. Given that the Argus II finally crossed the FDA's bionic eye barrier, hopefully we won't have to wait nearly as long for research like this to become a product.

Bay Trail is a mobile Atom system chip, suitable for inclusion in mobile phones, due to be announced in 2013 and made using Intel's 22-nm FinFET manufacturing process. Steve Smith, director of tablet platform development at Intel said the Dialog PMIC would help deliver energy-efficient Atom-based tablets to market. The DA6021 is included on the Bay Trail reference design board that is provided for software development, test and measurement as well as on a "form-factor" enclosed reference design that demonstrates tablet computer functionality, Dialog (Kirchheim-unter-Teck, Germany) said. "The performance and energy-efficiency gains that we expect Intel's next-generation processor will bring to tablets are complemented perfectly by the system-level power management capabilities of our PMIC, which has been designed to operate with both the processor and its peripherals," said Jalal Bagherli, CEO of Dialog, in a statement.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361559295468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:54:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361560314775-109</Id><Topic><Title>Intel chooses Dialog PMIC for 'Bay Trail' processor</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361559295468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:54:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that ic contains an ARM core ;)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361560314775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:11:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361560656400-110</Id><Topic><Title>Fantastic Update for INTC . **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>foust185</Username><Timestamp>1361540867625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:47:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>craziness</Msg><Username>leelombard331</Username><Timestamp>1361560656400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:17:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361560832427-111</Id><Topic><Title>Intel chooses Dialog PMIC for 'Bay Trail' processor</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361559295468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:54:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that ic contains an ARM core ;) So what's the big deal?</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361560832427</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:20:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361560936709-112</Id><Topic><Title>Meg of HP... full-steam ahead for ARM servers</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361553106221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:11:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The author of the Infoweek article referenced by getanid61 missed the HPQ followup statement in June 2012 that HP would use ATOM instead of ARM. HPQ could, of course, change their mind again and ship an ARM based system. News HP's first 'Project Moonshot' server due next quarter HP claims the server consumes up to 89 percent less energy than a traditional x86 server By James Niccolai February 21, 2013 08:22 PM ET IDG News Service - Hewlett-Packard's first low-power server for hyperscale computing environments, developed under a project it calls Moonshot, will go on sale next quarter, CEO Meg Whitman said on Thursday. Project Moonshot is an effort to build low-power servers based on alternatives to Intel's Xeon processors for use in mega data centers like those operated by Facebook and Google. HP announced the project in 2011, and the first server platform it talked about, known as Redstone, was to be based on an ARM-type processor from Calxeda. HP switched gears last year, however, and showed another Project Moonshot server design dubbed Gemini, the first version of which was to be based on an Intel Atom processor. It could be that Atom server that HP plans to release next quarter, though Whitman didn't say and an HP spokesman declined to comment. The server would be a bit behind schedule, since an HP executive originally said Gemini would be out late last year. "We expect this to truly revolutionize the economics of the data center with an entirely new category of server that consumes up to 89 percent less energy, 94 percent less space and 63 percent less cost than a traditional x86 server environment," Whitman said on HP's earnings call Thursday. It's HP's attempt to capitalize on a growing market for very low-power servers used by companies delivering online services on a large scale. Other players include Dell, which was quick to jump on the market, and AMD, which bought low-power server vendor SeaMicro and plans to license its technology to other computer makers. The servers aren't designed to run traditional enterprise applications, however. They're intended for programs written specially for such environments, including Web applications and big data software such as Hadoop. Gemini gets its power savings from a new Intel Atom chip known as Centerton, which Intel has said consumes 6 watts of power, far less than its Xeon chips. Calxeda isn't necessarily out in the cold, however: HP said Gemini uses a "processor cartridge" that will allow it to use other processor types in the future.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361560936709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:22:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361561667785-113</Id><Title>Can someone explain Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</Title><Msg>Why do they deserve the same market cap as INTC when all of there metrics are have of INTC?</Msg><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361561667785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:34:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361561764927-114</Id><Topic><Title>Intel chooses Dialog PMIC for 'Bay Trail' processor</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361559295468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:54:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no big deal at all.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is in the process of buying appMobiâs HTML5 developer tools, according to ReadWrite. However, the company wonât be acquiring appMobi itself. Whatâs left of appMobi will turn its attention to the cloud. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has been forging partnerships like the one with McAfee announced earlier this year. This new partnership with appMobi could create an important connection for Intel. Intel gains control of appMobilâs HTML5 tools, and then appMobi will be able to focus on offering back-end support for mobile applications which use HTML5. The terms of the deal between Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and appMobi have not been released; however, part the payment does seem to be in the form of a partnership between Intel and appMobi. The tools Intel has acquired will continue to be connected to appMobiâs cloud services. Intel has also hired some of appMobiâs staff to help it maintain the tools. More than 150,000 developers use the companyâs HTML5 developer tools, and the announcement about Intelâs acquisition of the tools was revealed to those developers via a letter. AppMobi explains that the HTML5 tools which Intel has now acquired include: several of the companyâs frameworks, including the controversial jqMobi framework, which is designed to connect mobile app developers with a mobile-ready version of JQuery. Other tools that are part of the deal are the XDK IDE, GameDev XDK, PhoneGap XDK and jqUI developer frameworks. The directCanvas HTML5 acceleration tool and the Mobius web browser are also included. Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are trading mostly flat on the NASDAQ this morning in spite of the news about the acquisition.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1361565853718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 15:44:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361566255313-131</Id><Topic><Title>Even Turds like Intel Float up to the top before they get flushed!</Title><Username>pcrandallfinance</Username><Timestamp>1361555233714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:47:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pentomic is obviously not a shareholder or he would share the cynicism of most of the people who frequent this board...

A key component in making that happen is mobile.</Msg><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361568227326</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 16:23:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361568246487-139</Id><Topic><Title>Even Turds like Intel Float up to the top before they get flushed!</Title><Username>pcrandallfinance</Username><Timestamp>1361555233714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:47:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pcrandalfinance_DanaLucyFudd - Ignore</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361568246487</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 16:24:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361568352861-140</Id><Title>I Pity the Fools</Title><Msg>I pity the fools that fell for the shill monkey jumping today and sold.

The ARM camp will NOT be competitive because none of them can design a decent processor without any serious flaws between the lot of them. It's pretty pathetic that out of all the 32nm phone processors only Intel can design one that can actually use all its cores as intended without breaking a 2W power budget. Clovertrail+ is only going to embarrass Apple A6, ARM A7-A9-A15 and Qualcomm's S4 in any serious performance test done over any length of time. What do you think the brand new 22nn OoO Merrifield will do too when that is unleashed ?

It is almost a certainty that the set-top box will have a WiDi receiver. This will allow any WiDi enabled device (computer, tablet or smartphone) to wirelessly transmit 1080p video and HD sound to the TV. This will not only allow you to watch any web video or movie on your tv, but it has the potential to be MUCH more than this. Just like Apple's airplay, this can allow the tablet/phone (or future WiDi products) to be a 'controller' for game playing. With already a huge user base for PC games, Intel can take PC gaming to the next level...into the living room and challenge xbox, ps4 etc. BTW, the set-top box also has a camera..so much talk about the negative aspect of this, but how about the positive? With the camera, you can video chat with your friends and family during holidays in HD quality. This technology has been talked about for so long and has not materialized. But with the camera and WiDi, this will be a reality. One more thing to note ...Intel has made it a requirement that all future ultrabook have WiDi enabled. As for the Web TV itself, i'm very excited because it comes with many firsts: - first real live TV service over the internet - first to enable cloud based DVR - first to offer TV anytime, anywhere To me, there's a good chance Intel's web tv service will succeed. The approached this the right way. Rather a trying to get content providers to do what they want, they did what the content provider wanted which is basically to maximize provide. Intel knew it was too early for a la carte, the industry wasn't ready for it. So they approached it as a 'quality play' not a 'value play'. One last point, does anyone know if this web tv service will include a movie rental offering like Netflix? If so, that would be amazing!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1361575496389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 18:24:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361576296570-162</Id><Topic><Title>Motley Fool's only line: PC is dead</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1361571416694</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 17:16:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They have actually used this line for quite some time as a hook to get people to sign up.

InfoWorld â Reliable storage is a key building block for any enterprise application infrastructure. Traditionally, this translates into some type of network-attached storage (NAS) or storage area network (SAN). With Windows Storage Server 2012, you get both NAS (CIFS/SMB) and SAN (iSCSI), along with the ability to leverage new SMB 3.0 features to bring seamless fail-over to Hyper-V and SQL Server workloads. With the Windows Storage Server 2012-based HP StoreEasy 5530, you get all that plus outrageous performance. HP has stuffed a lot of hardware into this package. The StoreEasy 5530 consists of two HP ProLiant BL460c G7 blade servers, each equipped with two Intel E5620 Xeon processors and 48GB of memory. The Intel E5620 is a four-core processor capable of two threads per core. That gives you 16 threads in each blade server for handling all the file processing you can throw at it. It's also more than enough CPU and memory to support a few Hyper-V virtual machines, should you so choose. The only downside here is the limitation of running a maximum of two Hyper-V VMs that comes with Windows Storage Server 2012. However, you could remove that restriction by upgrading the OS to a full version of Windows Server 2012 Datacenter, which allows you to run as many Windows VMs as you like. [ Also on InfoWorld: 7 ways Windows Server 2012 pays for itself | Windows Server 2012: All the coolest features | Stay atop key Microsoft technologies in our Technology: Microsoft newsletter. ] Two storage options offer either large-form-factor (LFF) or small-form-factor (SFF) hard drives. The LFF option typically delivers more storage per drive at a lower cost, while the SFF drives offer higher performance but less total storage capacity. Each server blade comes with two 300GB 10K SFF drives, which are typically configured as a RAID 1 array for redundancy purposes. These are used primarily for boot and local storage.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361589314718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 22:15:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361589776333-176</Id><Title>Leading innovator of baseband solutions selects Intel</Title><Msg>Intel Selected by Octasic and 3 Chip and Big Data Stocks on the Move By Leah Powell | More Articles February 21, 2013 Octasic Inc., a leading innovator of baseband and media processing solutions, announced today that it chose the Intel Atom processor for its newest Small Cell solutions.

This big boy is not only free of Chrome OSâ restrictions, but also larger and snappier than that. Granted, the extra heft is not going to be considered an upside by everyone and the 15.6-inch touchscreen on the Chronos is far poorer than the one sported by the Pixel (Full HD nevertheless), but we still think the Win 8 laptop is the smarter choice. Especially that itâs on sale at the moment at BB, going for $1,199 ($100 bucks off the list price). That buys you an Intel Core i7 processor clocked at 2.4 GHz, an AMD Radeon HD 8870M dedicated graphics card, 8 GB of RAM and an HDD with 1 full TB of storage. The only important feature missing is the optical drive thatâs traditionally found on 15-inchers, but thatâs where Sammy had to sacrifice in order to keep this fellowâs weight down to 2.35 kg and thickness to 21 mm.

Review these 16 reasons why ARM's fabrication is in trouble and you will see that (ARM's declining) economics plays a part in almost all of them, which means not only that Intel will take over, but Intel will take over at a profit superior to what ARM has managed to date: 1.) Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. It means a extra cost of 50-100M USD per year</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361593743455</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 23:29:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361595113053-181</Id><Title>New movie on the PBS site about the history of Silicon Valley</Title><Msg>It starts with how William Shockley essentially created Silicon Valley.</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1361595113053</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 23:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361595262887-182</Id><Topic><Title>Can someone explain Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</Title><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361561667785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:34:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I see... then a million (ARM) companies are fooling themselves... you set them right now..." [Yep, that's right. Here's why: Ultimately it's all about the money. Here's the single most important piece of information: At 90nm there were 19 ARM foundries. At 65/55nm there were 16. At 45/40 there were 12. At 32/28nm there were 8. At 16/14nm there will be three. That number could drop to one (Samsung). Regardless the trend is incontrovertible. The fabless model is broken. There is no other reason for a decline from 19 to 3 foundries. And why are the number of ARM fabs dropping like a rock? Money pure and simple. The fabless model doesn't provide nearly enough money for CapEx or R&amp;D. The ARM foundries have therefore tried to get by with "just good enough." And it has resulted in disaster with no access to FinFET (insufficient R&amp;D spending) and insufficient manufacturing capacity (insufficient CapEx availability). And a drop in the number of ARM foundries that if you extend the trend line drops to zero. And here's your proof: 93 fabless Series A Semiconductor Fundings in 2000, 42 in 2004, 16 in 2006, 16 in 2007, and 3 in 2012. Funding for foundries has dropped like a rock and the number of foundries has dropped in a corresponding manner. No money. No fabs. Not rocket science. Conclusion The fabless fabrication model has been in decline for years. Now the absence of adequate R&amp;D spending has shown up to finish it off. No FinFET, no state-of-the-art technology, no roadmap beyond 20nm, no future. Along with insufficient manufacturing capacity. Does anyone really think that something will happen to increase the number of foundries up from three rather than down to one? Nothing in the trends, dynamics or funding suggests that anything other than a continuation of the trend is possible. Pull the curtains. Que the lights.
