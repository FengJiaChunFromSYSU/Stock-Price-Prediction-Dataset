Their innovation days ended before Steve Jobs died. Now they are just another loud mouth corporation that believes that they are large enough to set trends in the market, not follow them. They see that they are the perfect combination of a home grown set of OS's with abundant hardware and fashionable designs. I don't expect them to fall in line with the hardware trends of the industry.

Wall Street had smuggly declared that since TI was operating in a weaker economy it must be suffering from poor orders. However it seems that TI didn't get the memo. It announced that profit will be 38 cents to 42 cents a share on revenue of $3.27 billion to $3.41 billion. Analysts on average had predicted earnings of 38 cents on sales of $3.34 billion in the current period. Sales rise about now because manufacturers are ramping up production for year-end holiday shoppers. While demand remains below normal, the report indicated that Texas Instruments is holding its own even as some regions recover slowly from an economic slump. The chipmaker said revenue and profit were boosted by a $60 million insurance benefit from last year’s earthquake in Japan, as well as cost cuts.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347457349729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:42:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347457629872-19</Id><Title>Intel aims intelligent systems at heart of embedded</Title><Msg>From: EETimes: Trying to stake a deeper claim in the embedded space, Intel has rolled out a framework for management and security middleware at its annual Intel Developer Forum here. The software uses a mixture of Intel’s PC management software with code from its acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River. The x86 giant announced the Intel Intelligent Systems Framework, a broad technical specification for embedded systems covering everything from network appliances to gateways and end devices such as security cameras. It also released software reference designs that implement new platforms based on the spec from its McAfee and Wind River subsidiaries. The spec requires use of an Intel processor and Ethernet controller as well as Wind River’s Linux and McAfee’s Embedded Control technology. Other pieces of the architecture include Intel’s PC virtualization, trusted execution and management software and McAfee’s Deep Command and ePolicy Orchestrator. The software does not replace existing communications transports such as IPv6 or Zigbee. Rather, it seeks to create a new layer of middleware above them. “Our first goal is to drive interoperability in connectivity, security and manageability,” said Ton Steenman, general manager of Intel’s Intelligent Systems Group which claims sales of more than $2 billion x86 products into embedded systems growing at a compound rate of faster than 20 percent. “Our customers are struggling with embedded systems because none of them talk to each other--managability is inconsistent and cannot be handled from one console, security is spotty at best and comms in general is very proprietary,” Steenman said. The initiative essentially opens up a new front against embedded processor companies such as ARM, increasingly Intel's closest rival. With the framework, Intel is driving hooks to its processors deeper into embedded software at a time when ARM is encroaching on Intel's server and notebook franchises. Intel's embedded reference designs for the new framework will span its Atom, Core and Xeon lines including support for its Ethernet and Wi-Fi chip sets.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347457629872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:47:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347457968496-20</Id><Topic><Title>Intel aims intelligent systems at heart of embedded</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347457629872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:47:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down in up market...AGAIN!</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1347457968496</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347458108174-21</Id><Topic><Title>big growth forecast</Title><Username>yelyacs</Username><Timestamp>1347452898279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:28:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the only one proven to be clueless is Waldo.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1347458108174</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347458574265-22</Id><Topic><Title>big growth forecast</Title><Username>yelyacs</Username><Timestamp>1347452898279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:28:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the only one proven to be clueless is Waldo. _____________________ Not true.

However, sources close to Intel have confirmed that the Broadwell chip has been taped out and that it works. It was actually done a few months ago and it was Intel’s decision not to show it at the IDF keynote, but from what we know chip is able to run Windows and could be a good glimpse into the company's future future. Most of the competition still has to get to 22nm and Intel is getting ready for the 2nd generation 22nm archutecture, better known as Broadwell. In the current schedule Haswell comes in 2013, from what we know from our sources it is expected in Q2 2013 and Broadwell should follow a year after, 2014. At this time Intel doesn’t seem to be facing any major issues in shrinking the Haswell architecture from 22nm to 14nm Broadwell, but it also doesn’t really have a solid roadmap for the transition to 10nm. Intel’s 10nm chips are expected in 2016 but this schedule might easily slip as 10nm might be a tricky transition. It is definitely too early to talk much more about it, but we are puzzled. Why didn't Intel run a 14nm Broadwell demo to rub it in the competition's face? We are almost certain that the chip might be behind some NDA doors and that Intel will show more to its key customers who need to know.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347469355641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347469362933-39</Id><Topic><Title>A bunch of people crying for the death of the PC...What a bunch</Title><Username>dc10050</Username><Timestamp>1347466322744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:12:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A PC can be upgraded, mobile basically has to be replaced every time.

Going into Tuesday's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, some analysts were saying the semiconductor giant needed to outline a path for sustained growth, as its dominance of the slowing PC market hasn't clearly translated to footholds in the expanding mobile space. Dadi Perlmutter, executive VP and GM of Intel Architecture Group, aimed bigger than any single market, however, during the opening keynote address--he said Intel's vision is about touching all of humanity. To illustrate this wide-reaching ambition, Perlmutter made the first public presentation of the Intel's forthcoming Haswell processor family, which he said would help Intel redefine tablets and hybrid PCs, starting next year. He also demonstrated several forthcoming products and technologies, including gesture-tracking tools and voice-based features that will soon be deployed in Ultrabooks. Perlmutter revealed that the new Haswell processor architecture should offer substantial energy savings relative to Intel's current-generation Ivy Bridge chips. To illustrate, he ran a graphics demonstration using the Unigine engine that pitted an Ivy Bridge CPU against the upcoming revision. When the chips were compared with Haswell running at just below 8 watts and Ivy Bridge running roughly twice as hot, performance was equal, with both systems struggling somewhat to smoothly display the 1980 x 1020-pixel animation. When each processor was run at full power, however, Haswell was noticeably better, handling the challenging graphics without a hitch. The new Core offerings' clock speeds were not discussed, but Perlmutter suggested battery life could double--which, based on current Ultrabooks, could mean 15-20 hours of use. At least two Haswell varieties will be available to OEMs: a model that draws 10 watts, intended primarily for tablets, and one that draws 15 watts, which is a slight reduction from the 17 watts at which Ivy League processors run. These energy-efficient upgrades, which should also allow machines to more quickly awaken from sleep modes, could allow x86 machines to approach ARM-based devices' battery boasts while retaining the brute computing force to use more demanding applications. Perlmutter mentioned that system-on-a-chip architectures and more power-conscious engineering have enabled form factors that open devices up to new user experiences and new applications. He emphasized not only the slim design of Ultrabooks--currently represented by around 70 models, with dozens more to arrive once Windows 8 ships--but also, as some manufacturers have recently demonstrated, laptops that use detachable screens or hinges to transform into tablets. The mobility that these devices facilitate has changed how people do their jobs, and Perlmutter said Haswell should allow OEMs to produce "enterprise-ready" tablets and applications, one of which was illustrated by an interface that allows doctors to not only access patient records but even videos of procedures, which he modeled with ultrasound footage. While elaborating on user experience, Perlmutter remarked that "touch is just the beginning." One demonstration included Nuance's Dragon Assistant responding to voice commands for shopping results, music selections, and Twitter posts. The software, which will soon be available on current generation systems, responded appropriately to somewhat ambiguous commands and, according to Perlmutter, will be able to effectively handle thick accents within the next year. Gesture-based controls, which were demonstrated using a device bullet by SoftKinetics and Creative, are also slated to feature more prominently in upcoming products. Intriguing as these new capabilities are, Perlmutter indicated that a focus that ends on touch and voice is too myopic, as Intel's technologies are spreading into the "Internet of things" and facilitating "perceptual computing." A Coke vending machine that uses an Ivy Bridge i7 processor was hauled onstage to illustrate the former concept. The soda dispenser relies on a touchscreen interface and includes a camera and Wi-Fi for any consumer who wants to turn a beverage purchase into a social media experience. The camera also offers data-mining opportunities, as a company could derive statistics about which demographics are purchasing given products in given areas. "Perceptual computing," meanwhile, could "give computers humanlike senses," according to Perlmutter. This initiative, which strives to bring interactive interfaces to a new gamut of devices, looks to the future and factors into the "humanity" goals with which Perlmutter opened and closed his talk. To facilitate its development, Intel is initiating a contest that will award the most promising developer with $1 million in prizes and promotions. The company will also offer a perceptual computing software development kit in Q4.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347485116904</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:25:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347485201289-62</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Showcases New Chips, Big Vision</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347485116904</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:25:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile the shills with no vision were active again today.

Intel researchers think they have cracked the 10nm manufacturing problem, paving the way for advanced chips which consume very little power. The chip company's Ivy Bridge and Haswell chips are due to be built onto its 22nm tri-gate process. After that, the company will move to 14nm and is expecting to start making chips with that process in late-2013 or early 2014. On Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum, the company revealed that it thinks if knows how to build to 10nm as well. Intel is exploring a spread of technologies for manufacturing new chips. Image: Jack Clark The process a chip is made to dictates the density with which transistors can be packed together and the efficiency with which they use power, so new manufacturing methods at finer detail levels allow for better chips. "The 14nm technology is in full development mode now and on track for full production readiness at the end of next year," Mark Bohr, director of process architecture and integration for Intel's technology manufacturing group, said. "Right now I'm spending my time personally on 10nm pathfinding and it looks like we have a solution there." The 10nm solution may rely on a number of experimental technologies (pictured) potentially based around photonics, graphene, materials synthesis, dense memory, nanowires, extreme ultra violet lithography (EUV) and updated tri-gate transistors, Bohr said. When it comes to how the 10nm chips will be manufactured, Intel has an immersion lithography method that works, though it would prefer to use EUV. "I'd like to have EUV for 10, but I can't bet that it would be ready in time," Bohr said, hinting at the difficulties in using this method. EUV has much higher costs than immersion lithography. Intel's research group are also exploring technologies for 7nm and 5nm solutions, though these are a very long way off as 10nm is not expected to go into production qualification until 2015. Bohr capped off his talk by noting that Intel, unlike chip rivals AMD and ARM, owns and operates its manufacturing facilities. "Yes, [process development] requires huge investments, but it also provides huge economic advantages," he said. ARM licenses its chips and they are predominantly made in foundries operated by Samsung, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and GlobalFoundries. AMD uses GlobalFoundries. Intel has a three year lead over these companies in terms of process, and with the news on Wednesday it looks like it could maintain that far into the future.

The market, in all of its predictable glory, rewarded the stock by taking it down by an additional 3.6% to close the week. The company cited weakening PC demand as a major cause for the reduction, giving expanding credence to critics who believe the era of the PC is ending. Despite this collection of apparent negatives, now is the time to begin acquiring Intel shares on weakness. The Numbers Game As a fellow foolish commentator points out, the announcement is classic Intel. The company has a long history of waiting until a few weeks before its earnings announcement – the next one is scheduled for October 16 – and then lowering guidance. When actual earnings results are then reported in line with the original expectations, the company can declare the figures “an earnings beat” and watch shares rise by much more than the lowered guidance cost them. This is a classic game of Wall Street expectation management, and one at which Intel excels. Keeping the above probability in mind, revenues of $13.2 billion would represent a 7% decline from the same quarter a year ago. Were this to occur, it would be a negative for the company, but not an irrecoverable fall. The company is in a state of transition, and a lag, while costly, should not eliminate Intel from your consideration. PCs Are Not Dead Yet As everyone prepares for the launch of Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 5 on September 12th, rumors have begun to circulate that the next generation of iMac is set to be released later this fall. While the news is not the front page stuff that the iPhone thrives on, it is important to remember that PCs are still in use. Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors are expected to be included in the new iMacs, which should help Intel going into the holidays. Beyond Apple When Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Motorola Mobility division announced the release of its new line of Razr smartphones, most of the chip-based focus was on the Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ: QCOM) 4G LTE chip that would be used in the U.S. models. Qualcomm is currently squarely in the lead in the 4G LTE space and is the featured choice in most of the new U.S. devices being debuted. What is easily overlooked is the strategic alliance entered into by Intel and Motorola early this year. The expectation is that while Qualcomm will dominate in the U.S., Intel chips are likely to be included in many of the smartphones being sold throughout the rest of the world. The relationship between Intel and Google should help Intel to dive more deeply into the mobile market. The global divide begs the question of when Intel is likely to get into the 4G LTE market and give Qualcomm some serious competition. The company is already well into development of their own LTE chip, which is expected to be rolled out in 2013. As hype seeks other stocks and a lull descends on Intel shares, they are primed to offer investors an attractive entry point. If you are looking for a quick pop, Intel is not the name. Over the long-term, Intel is gathering steam and remains a great and relevant company. A Response From the PC “Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” the PC would like us all to know. Depending on how you differentiate between a tablet and a PC, the likelihood that the PC will disappear is zero. If we consider the current cadre of tablets available – ranging from the iPad to the Google Nexus 7 and so on – the one unifying feature is that they are consumption devices. They allow us to watch movies, read books and shop all from the comfort of our couches – you can even operate your TV with an app for your tablet. Yet when it is time to get some work done, we all make our way to our desktop or notebook – to our PCs – to engage in productive activity. If we use this as the differentiator, the PC is not dying so much as it is transitioning. In conjunction with the release of Windows 8 by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) later this year, the major PC makers are designing tablet-like devices that will include near-full notebook PC functionality. These devices, most of which will include Intel chips, will change the form not the function of the PC. Remember, PC stands for “personal computer,” not “big, clunky device that cannot include a slick touch screen.” Talking about the death of the PC in these terms is like suggesting that because fewer people read newspapers, the news and news organizations are doomed. Simplicity In the simplest terms, Intel is a quality company with an excellent management team. The current lull should be seen as a buying opportunity, not a reason for panic. While the next few weeks may be rocky, over the long-term, Intel remains a must-have core holding.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1347489944346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 18:45:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347490183202-67</Id><Title>Shorts will cover or get crushed as Earnings approach</Title><Msg>As a fellow foolish commentator points out, the announcement is classic Intel.

The chip giant is currently ramping its 22nm process with third-generation Core chips known as Ivy Bridge that were first released in late 2011. Comfortably ensconced in the high-volume stage of 22nm production, Bohr said defect density in Intel's 22nm silicon have improved considerably and yields are now matching the previous 32nm generation of products. Bohr, speaking at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, said the so-called "3D" tri-gate transistor structure (pictured) Intel introduced with Ivy Bridge would be extended to the 14nm process in 2013 and possibly remain feasible for 10nm products that would arrive in the 2015 timeframe. The immersion lithography Intel currently uses to fabricate 22nm chips is also likely to remain in use for a couple more generations. Bohr said a next-generation technology called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography would be preferable for the 10nm node, but it probably wouldn't be cost-effective at that point. View SlideshowSee all (15) slides Beyond 10nm, Intel has pegged 7nm and 5nm transistors as the next stops on the Moore's Law-driven path to ever-smaller circuitry packed more densely onto computer chips every 18 months or so. The rule of thumb for the semiconductor industry, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who articulated it 47 years ago, also points to increasing cost efficiencies in silicon fabrication. For example, the transistors in Intel's 22nm chips cost about $0.01 to make but by the time the 5nm process ramps up, transistors will cost just a tenth as much. Of course, those tiny transistors may not actually be made of silicon at that point, according to Bohr. The Intel fellow was hesitant to spill too many details about the "exotic" approaches he said Intel's most far-reaching researchers are now experimenting with to achieve process technologies beyond 10nm, but did mention that the carbon allotrope graphene was a material being considered for future transistors. If the whats and hows of getting to 7nm and beyond aren't fully resolved, Bohr still expressed full confidence that Intel wouldn't experience any major hiccups in extended Moore's Law for another decade. "Intel's technology pipeline is full with research extending out 10 years and down to the 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm nodes. It looks like we have a a solution for 10nm and I'm confident we will have solutions for 7nm and 5nm," he said. Meanwhile, Intel is now classifying its process technology advances for two different sorts of end products in its portfolio. On the one hand, there are the performance-maximized chips like Ivy Bridge that are aimed at powerful clients and servers, and on the other there are the low-power System-on-a-Chip designs built for mobile devices and embedded systems. As Intel goes forward with its process "ticks," or shrinks, these two broad product categories will each be manufactured with the latest process, sharing some important features, like the current tri-gate technology, but differing in an emphasis on performance versus leakage. So, for example, the next generation of Atom SoCs built for devices like smartphones and tablets will have lower leakage logic transistors with denser upper level interconnects than next-gen Core chips, to sacrifice a bit of performance for more efficient energy use. Bohr further said that Intel's chip designers actually have four basic choices to pick from on the company's process technology menu to play towards different parts of what he called the "performance-leakage vector." Those options, loosely, are high performance, standard performance, low power, and ultra low power. Designers can also design different regions on single chips to possess transistors with different performance-to-leakage ratios. What does it mean for consumers? Aside from positioning itself to extend x86 dominance in PCs for some time to come, Intel has fine-tuned its ability to create chips that meet a much wider range of computational and power-draw demands while pushing forward in the shrinking of transistors every couple of years for even more power-performance benefits. Everybody knows that Intel is great at making the chips that power big honking desktop PCs and servers. But next-gen chips due out next year like the 22nm Silvermont SoC and a 10-watt Haswell-class Core CPU point to a company that may just start delivering on some of those Intel smartphones and tablets we've been hearing were on their way for the past few years.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347507983045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:46:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347508113389-95</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Sees Path to 5nm Processors by the end of the Decade</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347507983045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:46:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM promises to match this performance by 2030...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347508113389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347508282758-96</Id><Title>IDF: Western Digital Shows off 5mm Ultrabook 500GB Hybrid Drives</Title><Msg>At Intel's IDF 2012, today, we sat down and met with Bob Griswold from Western Digital. Bob showed us Western Digital's latest developments by ways of hard drives. Western Digital is cooperating very closely with Microsoft and Intel to develop new drives for Ultrabooks. These drives are specifically designed for Intel Ultrabook designs because they are only 5mm thick. What being 5mm thick enables, is the ability to fit into practically any ultrathin notebook or Ultrabook and at the same time deliver 500GB of storage. Most Ultrabooks nowadays ship with 128GB of 256GB SSDs, this enables users to utilize significantly more storage without having to sacrifice storage. This thickness is accomplished due to the fact that the 500GB drive is a single platter drive and uses a new connector, SFF-8038. Western Digital will be working with OEMs and ODMs to work on developing the connector standard further and to determine whether or not the connector will be a direct connect into the motherboard or a ribbon cable. In addition to that, the Hybrid drive version of these drives will be the Black Edition. The Blue Edition is the 500GB hard drive that does not have any NAND flash and is just a 5mm drive. These drives will be shipping in varying NAND capacities ranging from 8GB to 32GB depending on the placement of the Ultrabook. Obviously, a 32GB NAND based hybrid Black Edition drive will cost more than one with 8GB, as such, those lower NAND drives will be targeted towards cheaper notebooks and Ultrabooks. We have asked Western Digital regarding which NAND had been used in the hybrid drives, and they did not have an answer for us, however, they did say that their have their own proprietary software drivers that will enable wear leveling as needed. Overall, we're excited to see a new NAND based product from Western Digital, and we're hopeful that it will deliver a quality experience for consumers while also promising more storage space on Ultrabook and ultra thin notebook designs.
