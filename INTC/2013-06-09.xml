"I fully understand why short-sellers are skeptical of Intel, but I don't believe they're seeing the big picture. Intel's decline in PC's will be slow and gradual, and it remains a source of consistent cash flow in the meantime. In addition, Intel is in line to be the prime beneficiary of the big data center evolution, with its next-generation processing chips being used by big name storage companies. Intel has also begun to edge its way into the tablet microprocessing market with a lion's share of the Windows OS tablets and just last week with the announcement that its microprocessors were found in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3." I will add some details to that. Intel's data center group is poised to show growth in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% annually. It would have to be much closer to the 20% amount if smartphone and tablet growth expectations come to be true. The more features that get added to mobile products the more necessary it will be to add to the server base. As for the PC group. Intel has given us some data points in previuos investor meetings where they have seen affordability rates increase in emergin markets for PC products. And as these new customers come into the PC world, they will most likely choose a full computing product such as desktops and laptops rather than limited function entertainment products such as tablets. They will certainly go for the best bang for the buck. So at any time, Intel could actually see nice growth numbers in their PC group revenues. And the design wins such as the Samsung Galaxy 3 will be a whole new revenue stream for Intel. The tablet wins that Intel gets will not cannibalize their own laptop and desktop revenues. They will most likely cannibalize the iPads and other tablets that decide not to use the cutting edge processors from Intel.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370754079520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 01:01:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370754485669-3</Id><Title>WWDC next week with INTC in mind</Title><Msg>Intel could be on a much faster track if Apple decides to have some state of the art processing power in their new Macbooks.

They repeat themselves endlessly, saying the same thing over and over and over again - hoping to occasionally be right. But they've been wrong since November and given Intel's roadmap, technology and manufacturing, there is no reason to doubt that they will continue their losing streak. 2.) They love the content-free post: Their opinion (always the sky is falling or is going to fall) without any support, logic, facts or analysis. It appears to be all that they are capable of. 3.) They never document their positions but this doesn't stop them from finding fault with those who might. If the market clearly demonstrates them to be wrong (like for the last six months), then they either go silent or cherry pick the past to find a comparison that covers their trail. 4.) They have failed to note in advance almost every significant market move but are masters of "I told you so" after the fact. But mostly they just repeat themselves endlessly. Things like "warning coming". We've heard this almost every day for the last six months while the stock has moved up by over 5 bucks. Just say no to the senile shill set. They prolly don't remember what they had for breakfast...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370754844180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 01:14:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370756911292-6</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts End the Week with the Mother of All Fudd Fades</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370717982960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 14:59:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like INTC after the WWDC new macbook announcement.

Since the *sharp* run-up in INTC in the past 6 months (perhaps a little running ahead of its earning), perhaps it's a good time to downgrade INTC. Instead, analysts should be judged based on earning growth since the last rating change. That way their ratings will be less speculative, less volatile, and more reflective of the reality of the operations of the companies (instead of reflective of the sentiments of the market).</Msg><Username>ljack360</Username><Timestamp>1370786634906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 10:03:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370787020161-11</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Share Price Could Double</Title><Username>ljack360</Username><Timestamp>1370785799073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 09:49:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>delusional.

Otellini must have realized years ago that Intel had missed an opportunity in mobile. It takes time to develop new chip designs, fabricate and test them. Intel has developing these new chips for years. So I think things have changed...for the better. And this will become apparent over the next several years as Intel takes market share. The company won't screw up again, innovation is the name of the game in the chip business, and microprocessors are going to be everywhere you're going to be.

This would seem to suggest a direct response to analysts’ claims that a new Retina MacBook pro range is on the way, for which a release date will be announced during Apple’s conference. In terms of what to expect, much of the spotlight falls on the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro which has long been the favorite of the bunch – also the model that seems to have disappeared from a number of major online retailers. Along with its bigger-brothers, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro for the 2013 model year will apparently narrow the gap between the Pro range and the MacBook Air lineup, by arriving with a slimmer, sleeker and lighter overall design than ever before. The use of Intel’s Haswell chips should also allow for significantly greater overall performance, while extending battery life by up to eight hours. There’s also talk of a non-Retina option being offered among the new range this year, which could see a lower entry-level price and even more impressive battery life.

If true, that's a nice slip-up from Best Buy giving us a heads-up. A 2012 patent filing by Apple hinted at iTunes one day working with Siri. Perhaps now is that time for this to emerge. If iTunes will supposedly be working with Dragon Assistant this fall for new Ultrabooks, is it really that much of a stretch to think that Apple will include this in their next wave of new features for OS X on Monday or as an update this fall?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370812024534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 17:07:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370812057325-63</Id><Topic><Title>Computex was a turning point for Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370741455738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, this sounds good for both Apple and Intel...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370812057325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 17:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370812405831-64</Id><Topic><Title>Computex was a turning point for Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370741455738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still more from the Apple Article: Panasonic's Hot Swappable Ultrabook Battery Skaugen's next segment rounded up a few Ultrabook's coming to market later this year with some interesting new common features and some exclusive to specific OEMs. For instance, they highlighted Panasonic's forthcoming hot swappable battery that could boost Ultrabook battery life from 13 to 26 hours.

Everyone should just go read the article. A lot there. One Flick to Share Content on Mobile Devices with Samsung TVs Apple has a technology called AirPlay and it works fine in conjunction with a receiver called Apple TV. At Computex, Skaugen illustrated how Intel worked with Samsung to build Wireless Display WiDi right into their next generation of smart HDTVs. Intel's old WiDi methodology worked very much like Apple's in that you needed a receiver attached to a TV in order to get the content from your mobile device to your HDTV display. Intel's next generation WiDi in conjunction with Samsung (initially) will allow the user using a next generation 2-in-1 Ultrabook to simply make a flicking gesture on the display to shoot your content over to a Samsung HDTV. Eliminating the need for a standalone receiver will make this feature a more simpler and popular one going forward. Will Apple work with TV makers to get AirPlay to do the same? I'd like to think so, but I highly doubt it being that these OEMs fear Apple moving into their space. Then again, there are a few hundred million future iPhone and iPad users that these TV companies could cater to, so you never know. For now, it was a smart evolutionary move on Intel's part that will be appreciated by many over time as more HDTV OEMs sign on to the project. Skaugen announced that LG, Toshiba on others were on track to add this technology to their televisions in the future while Samsung's will debut theirs this holiday season.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370812541697</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 17:15:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370812704183-66</Id><Topic><Title>Computex was a turning point for Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370741455738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And still yet more: Breakthrough: New Integrated 3D Depth Cameras Coming to Intel Computers in 2H 2014 A major announcement was made at Computex regarding next-generation cameras for computers. Wide-eyed Skaugen proudly announced it this way: "This may be something that we write about for many years to come. Very quietly, in the secret rooms at Intel, we've been investing in camera technologies. And this is what we believe will be the world's first 3D Depth camera integration. And our commitment along with multiple OEM partners is to put this into notebooks, Ultrabooks and all-in-ones by the second half of 2014." He later added that tablets would be able to implement the new camera as well. Dell and Lenovo will be the first two OEMs to bring this to market with full software bundles in 2H 2014. This could be a nice advancement for computing in the coming years so as to allow for in-air gesturing and advanced gaming. Back in March 2013 Patently Apple posted a report about Apple's 2011 patent application for an advanced 3D camera. In our report's opening summary we stated that Apple had invented a killer 3D imaging camera that would apply to both still photography and video. The new cameras in development would utilize new depth-detection sensors such as LIDAR, RADAR and Laser that will create stereo disparity maps in creating 3D imagery. There's no doubt that this could be a race as to who gets this feature to market first, so may the best team win. Challenges are healthy for the market at large and we as consumers ultimately win. Could iSight 3D be in the works? Only time will tell.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370812704183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 17:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370812924484-67</Id><Topic><Title>Computex was a turning point for Intel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370741455738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conclusion: For now, I believe that Intel has the right product to bring some zest back to the PC. I'm one of the greatest fans of this new device segment ever since I covered an Apple patent showing their initial interest in this form factor all the way back to 2008 before Intel ever started banging their 2-in-1 Ultrabook drum. And for the record, Apple has recently revisited their visions for such a 2-in-1 design. Time will tell if this new notebook-tablet hybrid is a category that Apple will be late to the party with, but for now Intel is going to ramp up their marketing machine for this new category going forward and with Windows and Android behind it, it's bound to make waves in the mobile space over the coming years whether Apple sees its value or not.

"They" pushed it down from $29 by shorting 1 mill shares per day during last summer. With fewer shares outstanding (buy back) and a 4.5% short interest, "they" will have to probably short more than 1 mil shares per day to get it back down. There are only 2 companies that have a larger short position than Intel's current 233,212,213 shares. That is Sirus at 380,333,602 shares and Frontier Communications at 236,670,581. Intel is very close to being #2. Intel's 233m share short interest is an all time high for Intel. There are several events over the summer than could disturb the back to $20 argument. One every several weeks. Major ones that I can think of are Apple WWDC next week. Earnings July 20th Dividend announcement during first week in Aug. New Haswell SKU's sprinkled during the summer along with new products. Likely introductions next q3/q4 are Bay Trail + LTE and customer endorsement. Don't worry too much.

[Yes, there are many more possibilities that could send the stock to $30 rather than back to $20 in that the Intel roadmap and product pipeline are so full. The Samsung event is just one. And let no one forget that we are just six months away from 14nm FinFET production. This in and of itself should boost the stock past $30. The integrated LTE chip is another. The list is as long as Shaq's arm...] [As far as the prior drop from $29+ to $19, Intel was in a lull at the that time due to the development curves. Intel is now well past the lull and is ramping out those conditions with amazing speed as Haswell, Clover Trail+, Bay Trail and others come to market. There is no similar lull at this time for shorts to play off of. They would need an issue and they don't have one. Meanwhile there are a lot of fabrication and manufacturing issues on the ARM side of things. Intel is getting almost all of the positive press and that's likely to continue for some time. I don't see the macro or the micro factors favoring any significant push to the downside. Only a massive market correction could save the short's cookies over the rest of 2013.

Already all their mantras, "X86 not efficient as ARM, PC is dead, intel is cannibalising" these arguments are ripped to shreds. Problem is that these analyst have for a long time been pumping ARM, TSMC, GF as the new growth contenders. What has thrown a huge wrench into their machine, is that intel has delivered on its promises, where none of the others are even in the ball park, yet at the plate. Future seems to be moving to a situation of "In with the OLD, out with the NEW", Good, old intel has won the power efficiency, performance, process, and bring to market race. This is bringing huge growth potential to intel with respect to volume and revenue. intel already stated guidance of high single digit growth in revenues, I doubt it will have a significant decrease in margins. Simply the people who will be buying cost effective ATOM processors wont be concerned about the extra $30 for the CPU, because power/performance/flexibility/ and availability benefits far outweigh the cost savings and development cost associated with maintaining the ARM path. Apple, should they maintain their ego and maintain their ARM SOC will be left with products dead in arrival, like WinRT.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1370827040967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 21:17:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370827877081-78</Id><Title>Intel Signs Licensing Deal with SoftKinetic for iisu Middleware</Title><Msg>During Computex in Taipei, SoftKinetic said that it has signed an agreement with Intel to license out its iisu middleware for close-range hand and finger tracking capabilities to the nation's top chip maker. This middleware will be included in Intel's Perceptual Computing Software Development Kit (SDK) which brings "new experiences" to Intel-based Ultrabooks, notebooks, AIO desktops and tablets. "Under the new agreement, Intel-based platforms can now offer these capabilities and enable thousands of applications to be developed using the SDK," SoftKinetic said. "The depth capabilities of the SDK work with the CREATIVE Interactive Gesture Camera that has been enabled with the SDK and that uses SoftKinetic DepthSense 3D time-of-flight sensor technology." The news follows a brief tease during Intel's Computex keynote, as the company revealed the new Creative Senz3D Peripheral Camera. It allows users to use voice commands and manipulate objects on the screen with short-range gestures, and is capable of filtering out all objects in the background.

MSI’s GT70 was first to launch, but the powerful combination of Haswell and NVIDIA’s new 700M series of mobile GPUs is proliferating quickly, allowing thinner and lighter machines to debut at reasonable prices. Rather than regurgitate each announcement, I waited a few days and have compiled 6 recently unveiled gaming laptops that stand out based on a few factors: price, aesthetics, and/or unique features. Lenovo IdeaPad Y410p You’d be forgiven for not associating Lenovo with gaming; I didn’t until the alluring red accents of their IdeaPad Y500 keyboard caught my attention, with a reduced pricetag to match. MAINGEAR Pulse 14 The real clincher for me has always been MAINGEAR’s paint jobs, which elevate their laptops (and desktops) to great visual heights. If you’re a fan of the Glasurit paint found on expensive supercars, you’ll be pleased to know that MAINGEAR hand-paints the same stuff on this laptop. Razer Blade On paper, the new Razer Blade is the hero device representing what’s possible with the perfect union of Haswell and NVIDIA’s new 700M series of GPUs. Yes, it’s thinner than a dime — but it’s also thinner than a MacBook Air, despite packing the hardware necessary for serious gaming. Gigabyte P35K Ultrablade Razer isn’t the only company gunning for ultrathin gaming notebooks. Gigabyte recently announced their “Ultrablade,” a machine only 5mm thicker than the new Blade at 21mm, and boasting a 15.6″ full HD display.
