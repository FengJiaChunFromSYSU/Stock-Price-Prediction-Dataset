The first commercial handsets sporting Atom are decidedly midmarket (the Lava Xolo and the Orange San Diego), and now the firm is touting RF solutions for sub-$100 3G handsets. The latest product in the Smarti range, which Intel acquired with Infineon's wireless arm, integrates an HSPA RF transceiver with power amplifiers on a single 65nm die, and does not require a separate power management component. The Smarti UE2p will reduce the cost of adding 3G to a basic handset, says Intel, and could even be squeezed into modules for machine-to-machine connectivity. The chip will "simplify the product development and supply chain logistics with the reduction in component count and system complexity," according to Stefan Wolff, VP of the Intel Architecture Group. "This will allow our customers to introduce lower cost 3G handsets and support the transition of the M2M market segment toward 3G-based connected devices." Such launches indicate the importance of the Infineon purchase, often overshadowed by the work on mobile Atom. Intel is not yet offering fully integrated SoCs like Qualcomm's, but enhancement of the Smarti range, as well as ultra-low power Atom iterations, will pave the way to this - and will be essential for mass market phones and even low cost tablets. http://www.rethink-wireless.com/2012/07/30/intel-targets-low-cost-3g-handsets.htm</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1343739986000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343740719000-7</Id><Title>Demand for Intel processors remains strong.</Title><Msg>Latest processor price list update proves this point once again. http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/INTC/1676228748x0x586838/93FD9F7A-F52F-4DCC-9498-F9D055E08830/Copy_of_July_29_12_Recommended_Customer_Price_List.pdf Not one of their processors so a price cut.

I are saysing the "completely revised" refers to the component design compared with early products. If that is what you are saying, I agree. If you are saying that the B0 part is a completely revised A0 part, then I would disagree. I think your 64-core theory has merit.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343754007000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:00:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343754418000-34</Id><Title>REDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</Title><Msg>same old, same old.</Msg><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1343754418000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:06:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>28</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343755408000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Xeon Phi (B0 Stepping)</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343742710000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:51:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your hatred of Intel is hilarious.

The option market maker is caught in the middle. He has to price the put and call options for before and after the ex-dividend cutoff Thursday. The call has more value before and the put has more value after dividend is paid. Look for high probability of $26 option strike plus/minus dividend until Friday. A 40 to 60 cent trading range.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343759395000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 14:29:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343773355000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone but obumer</Title><Username>liberalsrindenial22</Username><Timestamp>1343772986000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agreed</Msg><Username>johnnyindiancorn</Username><Timestamp>1343773355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:22:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343776348000-42</Id><Topic><Title>My Dog could create more jobs</Title><Username>liberalsrindenial22</Username><Timestamp>1343774022000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:33:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignorant fool can't even spell 'Reagan', LOL!</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343776348000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 19:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343776532000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Bush/Clinton unEmployment 5.5-5.7</Title><Username>liberalsrindenial22</Username><Timestamp>1343773758000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:29:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since you are sooo smart, why don't you show us seperate unemployment rates for Clinton and Bush instead of conflating the two to make Bush look better?
