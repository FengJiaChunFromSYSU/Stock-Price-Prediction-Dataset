I thought that they also had some poison pill mechansim but I could not find any. A 66% premium for Intel ($40) would seem in the range. I have thought about the reverse where Intel buys QCOM but market valuations are not in Intel favor other than a cash offer. They probably would not issue shares as 10x PE.

I.E. they would be stuck buying from a competitor no matter what, be it Samsung or QCOM. Don't know when someone will make an offer, but know that INTC has too much going for it and at a 10x PE and the S&amp;P at 14x PE someone will take advantage of this disparity.

The Ychart over a 10 year period does not support your statement. Intel profits dropping fast? No. The chart on Intel Annual Report page 1 says you are wrong. Intel profits are double what they were 5 years ago ($1.10 per share). You will have to clarify what you mean about profits. Intel will cut the dividend next year? No. The payout is even less today than their 30% target payout. Intel profits would have to drop by over 50% over an extended period of time for it to be cut.

Now is the time for Intel. Andy grove is talking to Bryant.</Title><Msg>He is old and without the power to work 18 hour days any more but he is saying what is needed. But his words are the holy words at Intel still. "A corporation is a living organism; it has to continue to shed its skin. Methods have to change. Focus has to change. Values have to change. The sum total of those changes is transformation.[" Grove's office was an 8-ft by 9-ft cubicle like the other employees, as he disliked separate "mahogany-paneled corner offices." He states, "I've been living in cubicles since 1978 — and it hasn't hurt a whole lot."[6] Preferring this egalitarian atmosphere, he thereby made his work area accessible to anyone who walked by. There were no reserved parking spaces, and Grove parked wherever there was a space.[7] This atmosphere at work was partly a reflection of his personal life. Some who have known him, such as venture capitalist Arthur Rock, have stated that "he has no airs." Grove has lived modestly without expensive cars or an airplane.[7] BUT now my words. Intel is at the edge of the cliff now working on the 5 years plans. It obviously screwed up massively in several areas while stuffing its face on its X86 cash cow in sales to PCs, Notebooks, and servers. It has missed several years of massive Phone growth and it has not been able, until this year, to get into phones in a serious way. Share investors have LOST all faith in Intel and are in a ," I will believe it when I see it mode" when it comes to Intel plans. Utter disaster it continues to be as a stock. Another warning this quarter has hit some of the best Hedge funds with a blow to the temple, because they were betting on Intel. So from about 2000 to 2012, this stock has been a waste of time and effort and know words will change this few. After all, the net profits have not grown to 7 and 8 billion per quarter where they need to be in this modern phone time. Apple and Samsung are not using Intel CPUs in the phones or in the tablets. Intel must release chips that not only compete with Arm based chips but instead Intel must make phone chips which entirely destroy Arm based chips in both battery life and in performance. Then and only then will Apple and then Samsung feel compelled to stop putting 15 dollar junk chips into their high priced phones and tablets (Ipad). Of course--if the Intel based phones to ship by Motorola and the other smaller Phone sellers start to rapidly eat away at market share of Apple and Samsung in phones, it will not matter too much whether Apple or Samsung use the Intel chips. Likely this is the jist of what is going on now in negotiations between Intel and Apple and Samsung. Apple talks the talk and it after all is the big dog along with samsung. But Intel smiles and tells them, we will destroy you if you do not make the deal with us soon. Intel, if the road-map holds, will be shipping 14 nm chips in volume in 2015 early. If it is truly 2 to 3 years ahead of everyone in this shrink, then Apple and Samsung will have to pay for these Intel chips or be ripped apart by 10 other Phone makers who WILL use Intel CPUs in Phones and tablets soon. Watch Motorola this 4th quarter and its sales of Intel powered phones. If Motorola starts to eat rapidly into sales in the UK of Apple phones and Samsung phones, the release of Motorola Intel phones in early 2013 in America will be devastating to the two giants should they find themselves without Intel CPUs still late 2013. Me? I will wait to see what happens in the next few months, and if Intel succeeds on its roadmap, I will be looking for Intel to rise from the dead as a stock and go past 40 early 2013. Once the phones start selling with Intel in volume, it will be too late for the easy money because Intel share price will be over 60 by then and going much higher. Good luck.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1347124203923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 13:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347124331585-32</Id><Title>Some Q's for serious board members:</Title><Msg>What fraction of INTC earnings and revenues are: (1) PC's (2) Servers (3) Other and what are the largest components of "other"?

The idea that there is going to be a permanent downturn in the processor market is totally and completely absurd. So, whoever has the best technology will win. That's Intel as they are moving into total control of the fabrication space. Intel will continue in its historical way (steady progress over a five year period) to take a majority share of the mobility (tablet and smartphone) business. Those who are doing any serious arm-flapping over the current dip in the chip market are just plain silly. It doesn't take a genius to see where everything is going. The Cloud isn't going away, Big Data isn't going away, mobility isn't going away, the Internet of Things (IoT) isn't going away, video isn't going away, and connectivity isn't going away. They are all going to continue to ramp. Processors will extend into all phases of society. Intel, by building huge capacity at the cutting edge, is doing exactly the right thing. 2013 will be a watershed year as Intel passes ARM in power consumption efficiency. In the meantime Intel shareholders and investors need to ramp up the pressure on Wall Street's biggest firms to end the campaign to suppress Intel's stock price and P/E ratio. It's dysfunctional, unethical and perhaps illegal behavior and it needs to stop. Buy the dip and send the letters...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347128563764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 14:22:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347128801748-36</Id><Title>The lower Intel goes, the higher the dividend paid</Title><Msg>Good time to acumulate.

I think you are right. The 81 cents profit from a call assignment is not there if the assignment does not take place. That moves my effective price up by 1/2 of the 81 cents. thanks, good catch I buy shares of Intel @ $24.19. I then sell a Jan 2013 $25 CALL option to allow someone to buy the shares from me at $25 for $0.96. They pay me $.96 for the right to buy the shares from me at $25. I also sell a Jan 2013 $25 PUT option and I agree to buy shares from them at $25 for $1.96. They pay me $1.96 for the right to make me buy the shares from them at $25. I get two dividends on the shares (22.5 and 22.5 = 45 cents). On Jan 18th, 2013, the $.45 dividends are in my pocket. the $.96 call option premium is in my pocket the $1.96 put option premium is in my pocket. That is $.45 + $.96 + $1.96 = $3.37 or $3.37/$24.19 = 13.9% If the shares are CALL away at $25, I earn another $.81. If the shares are PUT to me, then I have twice the shares with a cost basis of: ($24.19 + $25.00)/2 = $24.595 .... and I have the $3.37 still in my pocket for the $24.19 shares. Above $25, I will keep the $3.37 and get $.81 profit from the sale. Below $25, I will keep the $3.37 and get to buy shares at $25.00. Below $25, my average share cost will be ($24.19+$25.00)/2 = $24.595 If I spread the $3.37 across the shares, that means that my $24.595 average price would effectively be reduce by half the $3.37. $24.595 - ($3.37)/2 = $22.91 I usually roll the puts out by buying back the near expiring option and selling one serveral months out. With Intel, you can still roll out and get a 20 cent per month credit several dollar into the money. You then don't have to have the shares assigned to you.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1347142905553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 18:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347146396717-51</Id><Topic><Title>Wally in the Woodwork</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1316637403000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-09-21 16:36:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he(wallis) said he'd have to cut back here if he got married. ------------ wallis is married to his mouse.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347146396717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 19:19:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>34</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347148793971-52</Id><Topic><Title>Intel just warned.</Title><Username>water_skipper</Username><Timestamp>1347133342355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 15:42:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'd post a link but I don't want to be flagged as a spammer." *** I see.
