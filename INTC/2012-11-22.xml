This means in an big/little environment it'll be doing most of the work only to spin up it's big brother now and again so the ARM ecosystem can be behind on node yet still maintain a decent power/performance curve. If this works, I do expect Intel to follow with Atom/Core hybrids at some point.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1353575088630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 04:04:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353575400654-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC let QCOM &amp; ARMH</Title><Username>joesmoe_y2k</Username><Timestamp>1353555153405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 22:32:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2006 Intel sold it's Xscale processor business to marvell.

Zoom In an article posted by InfoWorld, the company's chief technology officer for the Tesla product line, Steve Scott, was quoted saying, "Tegra is going to become GPU computing capable in the not-so-distant future. Sometime this decade we are also going to start bringing integrated CPUs and GPUs together in the Tesla line". 'Sometime this decade' is not exactly clear, but we would take a guess that Nvidia is shooting for a release prior to 2015. Scott was referring to ARMv8 processors, recently announced as Cortex-A53 and A-57 models and a 2014 released date. However, Nvidia was not mentioned by ARM in a row of current ARMv8 licensees, which include AMD, Broadcom, Calxeda, HiSilicon, Samsung and STMicroelectronics. However, the emerging microserver market is an opportunity for a natural evolution of Nvidia's business. Combining Tesla with ARMv8 cores will allow the company to compete in a segment that will be crowded with industry heavyweights such as Samsung, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments - and Intel on the x86 side. Nvidia will also compete with its arch rival AMD in a new market. The InfoWorld article pointed to Nvidia's Project Denver, which will be based on using the ARMv8 architecture in Nvidia products. According to ARM, the Cortex-A57 processor will be able to provide up to three times the performance of its current flagship, the 32-bit Cortex-A15 design.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353597595774</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:19:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353599022680-16</Id><Topic><Title>I'm already laughing at the clowns who will be paying $22+ soon for INTC</Title><Username>crap_in_my_lulus</Username><Timestamp>1353540872664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:34:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm laughing at myself for paying 22 for INTC.</Msg><Username>dolphinamica1</Username><Timestamp>1353599022680</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:43:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353599448510-17</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC let QCOM &amp; ARMH</Title><Username>joesmoe_y2k</Username><Timestamp>1353555153405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 22:32:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was not a wildly profitable business and is hardly now for Marvell who only made $68m last quarter.

Ltd. and to acquire its U.K. subsidiary ZiiLabs Ltd., formerly known as 3DLabs Ltd. The move by Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) is said to be part of efforts to de-emphasize the use of PowerVR graphics cores licensed from Imagination Technologies Group plc (Kings Langley, England) in future Atom processors. The deal includes $20 million to Creative Technology Ltd. (Singapore) for the licensing of technologies including ZiiLabs graphics processing unit (GPU) technology and $30 million for the acquisition of the U.K. based design team. This design team is engaged in, primarily on behalf of ZiiLabs Inc. Ltd., the development of ZMS chips for Creative. Creative acquired 3DLabs Inc. in 2002 for about $170 million, at the time the company was a Nasdaq-listed developer of graphics chips for workstations but with much of its engineering base still in the U.K.. In February 2012 Creative began sampling the 100-core ZMS-40 media processor aimed at Android platforms with high graphical and multimedia processing requirements (see ZiiLabs samples 100-core HEVC chip). "Moving forward, it will be more cost effective for Creative to outsource to third-party contract chip-layout houses on future advanced chips for its products, while at the same time allowing Creative to focus on its core strength - the designing and marketing of more innovative and exciting products for our customers," said Sim Wong Hoo, CEO of Creative Technology, in a statement. "We will be engaging in discussions to further monetize this valuable collection of 100-plus patents," Sim Wong Hoo added. Under the terms of the deal ZiiLabs Inc. Ltd. will remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative and will retain ownership of the StemCell media processor patents and will continue to supply ZMS chips. Intel and Creative have been collaborating on an advanced motion-sensing camera and are in discussions on technology for media-rich tablet products, Creative said. The Creative transaction is expected to close before the end of 2012. Interestingly 3DLabs licensed its entire patent portfolio to Intel in 1999 for about $7.5 million</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353603496621</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 11:58:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353603525580-29</Id><Title>Consumer Confidence now at a 5 year high....</Title><Msg>and Black Friday retail sales will be tremendous.

Although portable devices are not necessarily replacing the PC, they are outselling the PC. All of these devices have a graphics processor (GPU) integrated in the device’s system on a chip (SoC) application processor. The application processors are made by a dozen-plus semiconductor suppliers (Broadcom, Apple, Intel, Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, ST-Ericsson, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Qualcomm, Samsung, etc.). All of those companies fall into one of two categories: vertically integrated or IP buyers. Nvidia and Qualcomm are the vertically integrated companies with their own GPU designs; all of the other companies buy GPU IP from one of four IP suppliers (ARM, DMP, Imagination Technologies, or Vivante). The exceptions to this tidy categorization are Samsung, which has an internal GPU design and buys IP from ARM and Imagination Technologies, and Broadcom, which has an internal design GPU and buys IP from ARM. The leading high-volume suppliers of application processors (i.e., SoCs) are Apple, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, and Samsung. ARM supplies GPU IP for some of Samsung’s mobile phones, while Imagination Technologies’ GPU IP is used in Apple, Texas Instruments, and some of Samsung’s mobile phones and tablets. The upcoming SoC suppliers with impressive design wins to their credit are Intel (Imagination Technologies’ GPU) and Nvidia (proprietary GPU). Other SoC suppliers that buy GPU IP are Freescale, Huawei, MediaTek, Rockchip, and Wonder Media/VIA. These companies have participated in the feature phone market, and some of them have recently entered the smartphone and tablet segment. One area that is fueling the growth of portable SoCs is the exploding tablet market in China, which is contributing significantly to the astounding growth that ARM and Vivante are experiencing. As a result of this tablet surge in China, dramatic changes are expected during the next 12 months. Apple will introduce a 7-inch tablet, Microsoft will bring out its Surface tablet, and Texas Instruments will continue to supply Amazon (even though the company is pulling back from the smartphone market as Nokia loses market share). The market for SoCs with GPUs grew 91.3% from the first half of 2011, with market shifts occurring as shown in Table 1 below.

Our comprehensive—and growing—series of low-power, high-performance, silicon-efficient GPU cores ensure cutting-edge graphics quality previously only available on PC platforms. The recent trend in graphics hardware has been to replace fixed functionality with programmability in areas that have grown exceedingly complex, such as vertex processing and fragment processing. The OpenGL® Shading Language was designed to allow application programmers to express the processing that occurs at those programmable points of the OpenGL pipeline. Independently compilable units written in this language are called shaders. A program is a set of shaders that are compiled and linked together. Vivante’s GPU technology is architected from the ground up to deliver a high-precision, true unified shader implementation that maximizes graphics performance and quality per milliwatt of system power consumption. Robust application support Access to high-performance shaders without programming limitations is the key to lowering application development costs and developer support costs. Vivante’s high-performance true unified shader architecture delivers best-in-class programmability: ➢Khronos conformant support for OpenGL ES 2.0/1.1, OpenGL 3.0/2.1 and OpenVG 1.1 ➢Microsoft certified DirectX 11 feature level 9_3 ➢General purpose (GPGPU) computing ➢Up to 180 billion floating point operations per second (GFLOPS) in the multicore versions of GC series GPUs ➢ Full support for the OpenGL Shading Language without Appendix A exceptions ➢ High precision pipeline with support for long instructions ➢ Dynamic branching in the pixel shader and non-constant varying indexing Smaller, cooler, faster Vivante is the die size leader, offering the smallest OpenGL ES 2.0-compliant silicon footprint on the market. Fitting next-generation technology in the previous generation footprint, we enable full OpenGL ES 2.0 and 1.1 support in the same area as previous generation OpenGL ES 1.1-only GPU cores. Vivante also offers the lowest power consumption (GFLOPS per milliwatt) GPU available today: ➢ Ultra low-power microarchitecture ➢ Frequency scaling ➢ Software-controllable power states Because of our patented algorithms for reducing memory bandwidth and optimizing full-scene quality, Vivante GPUs also use less memory and processing power. Features like full-scene anti-aliasing, unified vertex and pixel shading, and rich texture mapping generate the highest quality graphics: ➢ Unified shader: 128 threads per shader unit, programmable aspect architecture ➢ Low-power techniques: extensive clock gating, flexible allocation of resources in the shader unit ➢ Patented anti-aliasing algorithm ➢ High-dynamic range textures Scalability Vivante’s shader uses a highly programmable multi-threaded architecture for scalability. Our modular software architecture supports multiple GPU cores with a single driver infrastructure. Easy to integrate With support for free-running AXI and AHB interfaces, customers can easily integrate our cores into their systems. Vivante’s licensees quickly and consistently reach target frequency and optimal final silicon area using provided reference implementation packages for Cadence and Synopsys design tool environments.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353606185904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:43:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353606387555-36</Id><Topic><Title>Intel buys U.K. graphics chip team</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353603496621</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 11:58:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asked the same question, Mike Bryant replies: "Unlike in small systems where it is key, in big systems, which smartphones most definitely are nowadays, the instruction set used is far less relevant with only 10% to 15% of power dealing with it. So even if ARM waved magic dust on their instruction set, which isn't perfect anyway, they can only optimise 10% to 15% of the power used. More power goes in moving data around the chip, and most goes to moving data on and off the chip to memory and peripherals." "ARM programs can actually use a few percent more codespace than Intel but let's say they are the same," adds Bryant, "next of course the data either processor has to be moved around - be it pictures, voice data, HTML or just the call set-up protocol, is identical for each processor. Finally the video data has to be transferred onto the display and for all the hype ARM's Mali is about the same as GPUs from Intel or Nvidia, though there are slightly more efficient solutions from Imagination Technologies or Qualcomm's Adreno." "So for a pure ARM system against a pure Intel system, 85% of the power usage is independent of the processor instruction set and dependent purely on the process technology," concludes Bryant. And that's why TSMC/Apple are pushing to 20nm and it won't be cheap</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353606387555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:46:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353606742968-37</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC let QCOM &amp; ARMH</Title><Username>joesmoe_y2k</Username><Timestamp>1353555153405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 22:32:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is about Intel not MRVL..

They already do that with the Intel reference design that Bell got done. The trouble with going flat out to design the best tablet or phone is that you might #$%$ off the OEMs you are trying to sell your raw chips to if you are becoming a flagship device competitor to them too. Look at all the OEM WinRT designs that were dropped because of MSFT's Surface ! This whole mobile situation is a delicate one to navigate and I think the only thing wrong with Intel's current path with Atom is that it is a couple of years late. If Medfield and Clovertrail had come out in 2010 with the rest of Intel's 32nm products we wouldn't be having this discussion as Intel would already be a big player in mobile using its own chips. It will get there anyway but it will take time. Luckily it has both a fabrication lead so it can go 2014 - 22nm, 2015 - 14nm, 2016 - 10nm. By 2016 Core and Atom will both be on 10nm and be making all the ARM chips look very puny in all markets.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353624257388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 17:44:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353624588190-59</Id><Title>Intel and Apple can dominate by common strategy</Title><Msg>[$$] Sleuthing the Apple Stock Selloffat The Wall Street Journal(Thu 5:28PM EST)</Msg><Username>for_the_idiots</Username><Timestamp>1353624588190</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 17:49:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353625045138-60</Id><Topic><Title>If Paul O.'s departure is so amicable then why...</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1353622174692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 17:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why are your posts so shallow?

The A57 design will be at the same level of SpecINT performance as the original Athlon64 Opteron, how many of those is AMD still selling successfully these day ? ARM fabrication then is heading for a hybrid 20nm process on which 14nm/16nm FinFET transitors will be placed. This will not be competitive with Intel's fully 10nm process. One more thing, AMD is heading to $1 or even lower as having the same Piledriver products for another year is a recipe for even more marketshare loss when Haswell is unleashed next year.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353635014950</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 20:43:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353636071993-64</Id><Title>Media Propaganda</Title><Msg>Okay, so you guys realize the whole "Intel has no mobile strategy" is propaganda, right?

At 32 nm with Medfield, that failed. Unless they do something drastically better with Silvermont and by that I mean their improvement needs to be far better than ARMs own improvement going into the next generation, Silvermont is going to fail too. I would go so far as to say even if they are drastically, better, they'll fail because of higher price, absence of customization and the commitment of the big two to their in-house chips. Therefore in the long run, contrary to Intel's touted fabrication advantage, they are expected to fail -- it's a failed strategy. A more successful strategy would have been not to sell XScale in 2006 and bet the farm of low-power IA.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1353637947903</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 21:32:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353638156495-69</Id><Topic><Title>Media Propaganda</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1353636071993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 21:01:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Enlighten me as to which commercially available tablet or smartphone has Intel inside it TODAY in the US.

Sorry, but things really do change.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1353642678390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 22:51:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353642842647-79</Id><Topic><Title>Media Propaganda</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1353636071993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 21:01:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow your mind is closed to how change occurs.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1353642842647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 22:54:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353643012108-80</Id><Topic><Title>Media Propaganda</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1353636071993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 21:01:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are no smartphones available in the US today that I am aware of but there are several Windows 8 Intel tablets available. A quick check on NEWEGG shows there are 8 Intel-based tablets. There are several Ultrabooks too. CES 2013 is 7 weeks away.

LOL, everybody as ARM has been the only vendor who has really bothered until now with phone chips. You make it sound as if ARM has had competition up until now lol. It does now and in 4 years the competitive landscape will look a lot different. Once Intel decides to enter a market full force it relentlessly grinds down its competition with its design/process combination. 'The worlds best selling tablets all ARMH based. Surprised ? Sorry, but things really do change.' What change, when were tablets not ARMH based. I think you are high on pump juice and not thinking straight about historical facts lol.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353643412277</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 23:03:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353643424758-82</Id><Title>Intel will hit 15 in 6 months</Title><Msg>pretty much everyone agrees the Atom sucks and is the AMD of low power chips.

Same time last year Intel was claiming that they had the mobile chip all figured out. We were told to expect the market flooded with. Intel inside phones and tablets. Haven't seen that happen. I for one will not be holding my breath for a Intel inside mobile product to dethrone an ARM powered mobile device. At the same time I do not see ARM making any inroads into the server market. Intel has failed miserably when it comes to mobile phones and tablets. They should just stick to high margin products like desktops/ laptops and servers</Msg><Username>m00nsh1ner</Username><Timestamp>1353644793827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 23:26:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353644798551-87</Id><Topic><Title>Media Propaganda</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1353636071993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 21:01:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a bunch ???? toooo funny lol</Msg><Username>luvinitallwu</Username><Timestamp>1353644798551</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 23:26:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353645214601-88</Id><Topic><Title>Intel will hit 15 in 6 months</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1353643424758</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 23:03:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well that seals it, I bow down to the rumor of what 'most phone guys' said whoever or wherever they are and whatever they said.
