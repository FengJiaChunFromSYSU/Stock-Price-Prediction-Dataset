The Acer W510 weighs around 500 grams tablet and it can play very popular DivX HD content without necessity to transcode, which many pirates will find attractive.

Hold the #$%$ on Wall Street accountable. Wall Street needs a major shift back to working for its money instead of using leverage, misdirection, smoke and mirrors to defraud the average investor. Their huge interest in high speed trading indicates that ethics or fair play are never considerations in their approach to profits.

At this event, Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) newly acquired subsidiary, Motorola, announced the newest member of the Motorola smartphone family; the ‘Motorola RAZR i’. As very near identical variant to Motorola’s recently released ‘RAZR m’ smartphone, the ‘RAZR i’ the latest Android smartphone set to be released in select markets in Europe and Latin America. The phone itself is not what is important though. What are inside this particular smartphone and stamped on the casing are what make this smartphone important. For stamped on the casing is the familiar phrase for laptop owners, “Intel Inside.” And what is inside is an Intel latest Atom processor for smartphones/tablets. The phone announcement is a much bigger deal for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) than it is for Googlerola (as the kids are calling it; Google-Motorola). For Googlerola, this is just another very good phone in a family of very good phones, which will all quickly be forgotten once Googlerola announces their next very good phone in a month or two. For Intel however, this is another step down the path to prove that they can compete in an area dominated by NVIDIA, Qualcomm and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH). For years, ARM-architecture processors have dominated the smartphone and tablet space, with nearly every major release featuring ARM’s intellectual property. ARM’s processor designs have the favorable reputation of far greater power efficiency compared to Intel’s past smartphone processor offerings, which developed the terrible reputation of being battery-drainer beasts. The Motorola RAZR i features the Atom Z2480 processor. The 2.0 GHz single-core processor is reportedly the first smartphone processor to be able to reach that 2.0 GHz clock-speed barrier. Intel boasts that their single-core Intel Atom processor is 40% more powerful than the dual-core Apple A5 (ARM-based) processor found in the iPhone 4S. The Atom processor also gives all of that power with a long-lasting battery life. The Motorola RAZR i is said to have the same battery life as its less powerful RAZR m Qualcomm Snapdragon cousin; about 20-hours of what Motorola commonly refers to as 'mixed-use'. If this battery life estimate holds true, it will certainly go a long way to finally dispel Intel’s reputation of power-hungry smartphone processors. The Motorola RAZR i is not the first smartphone to feature Intel’s fourth generation (Medfield) Atom processors. There have also been the Lava XOLO smartphone in India, the MegaFon SP-A20i smartphone in Russia, the Lenovo K800 in China and the Orange San Diego in France and the United Kingdom. While not the first, the premier Motorola RAZR line of phones is certainly Intel’s biggest smartphone inclusion to date. Along with this RAZR i to be released in Europe and Latin America, Intel has thus far avoided the United States. Instead the company has chosen more low-key product launches abroad to prove themselves. With its series of overseas releases in increasingly important markets and increasingly important smartphone manufactures, Intel has been slowly showing the rest of the industry that they are at last ready to battle it out with the likes of Nvidia, Qualcomm and ARM Holdings for control over the smartphone/tablet market. You can be sure that when an Intel-powered phone is finally released in the United States, it will be a very large announcement that will have all of the industry buzzing about it.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348236112784</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348237067337-17</Id><Title>HPQ downs against with PE ~=4</Title><Msg>Intc up yesterday while hpq was down 2%.

By Steve Patterson on Fri, 09/21/12 - 10:05am. Add a commentPrint . Motorola’s announcement of the Razr i smartphone is notable because it is an answer to the question that no one asked: Where is the "Intel inside" in smartphones? Easily overlooked because the Razor i is not available on many networks or in most geographies, Razr i is worth understanding. It’s the product of four brands - Android, Google, Intel and Motorola - and it is a big deal for two smart technology companies, Intel and Motorola. It’s a beautifully engineered, thin, fast phone with a 4.3-inch LCD that has almost an edge-to-edge display. Simply stated, Intel’s business is to sell the most valuable semiconductor components on the basis of gross margin per square millimeter into commodity markets. Intel, a company that has been facing the pressure of slowing growth in PC and notebook shipments, must be relieved to see the accelerating growth of the mobile market where it can capture new, accelerating revenues. Mostly absent from the mobile smartphone market, Intel announced its intentions last January to work with Motorola in the U.S. and Lenovo in China to produce smartphones based on Android and Intel’s Atom architecture. RELATED: Why innovative app developers choose Android first The new Motorola Razr line: A win-win for Google and Verizon What did Intel get? The right to engineer a version of Atom optimized for smartphones with Motorola/Google mobile development teams that understand the various proprietary implementations of the ARM processor that is almost ubiquitous in smartphones. In fact, the Razr i looks like the identical form factor as the ARM-based Razr M with many shared components so design outcomes can be compared. Intel spends about $8 billion per year on research and development (about 15% of revenue), most of it on building better highly integrated systems on "SoC" microprocessors. Its intimate understanding of manufacturing, design, performance and power management make the company a formidable competitor to the ARM processors manufactured by Freescale, Qualcomm and Nvidia. With the Motorola Razr i announcement, Intel introduced the 2 GHz Atom processor with the same 20-hour talk time as the recently announced Razr M with a 1.5 GHz Arm processor. The Atom Penwell is a highly integrated SOC with onboard functions, such as graphics and base band communications. Fine-grained power management reduces power consumption to match usage until it reaches idle mode with minimal consumption. According to Intel’s John Carvill, "power management is a function of both hardware and software. Intel has over 1,200 engineers working to optimize Android and the Atom SoC." Besides designing and producing valuable semiconductors, Intel executes incredibly well at packaging and selling its processors with reference designs and tools to accelerate design and product delivery and third-party software to ODMs around the world, especially in Asia. To estimate the potential impact that Intel could have on the smartphone market and Android, consider what Intel did for Wintel PC market and Microsoft. With the introduction of the Razr i, Google has succeeded in expanding the diversity of its ecosystem with a powerful partner that is aligned with the goal of establishing an Android architectural standard with broad adoption, diverse designs and low end-user cost. Google and Intel do not compete. Google is more interested in growing the number of devices running Android than in growing Motorola Mobility and designing a proprietary ARM variant to compete with Intel. Intel is interested in maximizing the value of its Android-optimized SoC semiconductors relative to the total value of the device. Intel is more motivated by the opportunity to absorb a large portion Apple’s system-level mobile margin than by the deceleration of the growth of the PC and notebook market. If Intel succeeds, Android market share will increase and Intel will siphon profits from Apple’s franchise.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1348240503754</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348240729518-27</Id><Topic><Title>IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SERIOUS MONEY VOTE OBAMA OUT.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1348207701120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 02:08:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's looting companies- and how does he accomplish this, by getting into their bank accounts- your a dumb fool Lets put Romney in there to tear companies apart and line his pockets</Msg><Username>mikemclaug</Username><Timestamp>1348240729518</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348240746476-28</Id><Title>Read this and congratulate yourself for buying Intel in the low 20's.</Title><Msg>Besides designing and producing valuable semiconductors, Intel executes incredibly well at packaging and selling its processors with reference designs and tools to accelerate design and product delivery and third-party software to ODMs around the world, especially in Asia.

The name that popped out many times on our recent trip to the US and as you could have guessed the main competitor for both Intel and Nvidia is now Qualcomm. Qualcomm has swept across the US smartphone market due to its dominance with LTE integrated SOC and Intel and Nvidia want a piece of that market. Right now AMD looks quite weak in its eternal fight against Intel and the Core architecture dominates the PC and especially notebook market, the fight goes down to tablets and phones. Intel wants to get into many Windows 8 and eventually Android tablets as well as phones. Qualcomm is in the way and it currently looks really strong in these markets. The key to success is LTE as well as low power chips and Intel is getting better and better in this market with each generation. It is finally starting to get important phone design wins, such as Motorola, and with Windows 8 we will see many tablets based on Intel Atom Clover Trail chips. Don’t forget the new category started by Asus that everyone now calls convertibles, which is basically an Asus transformer or – insert brand here — transformer, basically a convertible tablet or a tablet with a keyboard dock. We saw Dell and HP making these machines with Windows 8 that will hit the market in late October as soon as Windows 8 goes public. The big fight will be Intel versus the rest of the ARM market. Qualcomm and to some extent Nvidia are key targets and the showdown is about to start in roughly a month.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1348244523970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:22:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348244762332-44</Id><Title>Get out of market right now...its over</Title><Msg>they rally pumped it up this time</Msg><Username>chkto40</Username><Timestamp>1348244762332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:26:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348245586691-45</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC to offer only one process at 20-nm Dylan McGrath</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348118382067</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 01:19:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This is nothing new and neither the foundries nor the chip design companies are stupid.

Eric, you talked about the 14-nanometer multiple patterning having issues. Are you referring to 14-nanometer for Logic or were you referring to foundry processes? Eric Meurice - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Our foundry processes in the following sense that foundries are having another challenge that the IDMs would not have. The challenge is that they have to deliver design rules, which are less restrictive and they have to deliver shrink factor, which is very aggressive. So, yes, my comments on 14-nanometer being a competitor to being in the first to go concerns more the foundry environment than it concerns the microprocessor environment.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348245586691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348246253924-46</Id><Title>We like the 4% dividends and we are buying shares now</Title><Msg>WE are tricking the stockholders to give up their shares real cheap.

The reason is that most of the announced hardware is convertible or hybrid tablets instead of simple and lean tablets. Then I take the toys-r-us feature-matrix strategy as a diversion away from the performance. Of course an Atom tablet is lower cost and longer battery life than a Ivy Bridge Ultrabook. Then the Atom tablet can have a screen as large as 10.1" while the Ivy Bridge Ultrabook can have a screen as small as 11.6" (but not popular at that size). But if the Atom convertible or hybrid tablets don't have the screen refresh rate then they are just Netbook re-hashes. Well, the review above says that the Clover Trail Atom performance is very good.

Intel is a target for option trading related to dividend arbitraging. It is a regular Intel trading pattern to trade near the option strike prices because that is where the option premium is the highest. The "whatstrading" site indicates that a Sep 28th $23 6,000 contract straddle occurred earlier but I only see the put option volume so far. I think that it is large value and pension funds looking to enhance their income by playing the Intel dividend which should be announce in the next couple days and ex dividend early in Oct. Oct 3rd if history holds. It happens regularly.

Firms Rethink Fabless-Foundry Model Tuesday, July 31st, 2012 By Mark LaPedus As chipmakers move toward 20nm designs, finFETs and 3D stacked devices, the industry is beginning to re-think the fabless-foundry model. Leading-edge foundries are finally getting serious about the “virtual IDM” model, in which vendors will act more like integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), as opposed to being mere production partners. In this model, the foundries are not only manufacturing partners, but there is a deeper collaboration within a customer’s design team. In fact, given the variability challenges with finFETs, there is a school of thought that chipmakers must reside at the same physical location as their foundry partners’ fabs to ensure that design and manufacturing are on the same page. Otherwise, according to some experts, the chances for first-silicon success are shaky. For this reason and others, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) may take the “virtual IDM” model a step further. TSMC is considering a plan to build separate fabs for individual companies. And as part of its strategy, TSMC has accelerated its finFET roadmap. Rival GlobalFoundries is considering a plan to offer dedicated modules within a fab for customers. And taking another approach, United Microelectronics Corp. has floated an equity placement under which companies can buy a 10% stake in UMC. UMC also has licensed IBM’s 20nm and finFET technologies. Another foundry vendor, Samsung Electronics Co, has perhaps set the tone for the industry: It has already built a dedicated fab for Apple. And separately, in a surprise move, fabless chipmaker Qualcomm is considering the idea of building its own fab to gain better control of the manufacturing process. Qualcomm CEO “Paul Jacobs has discussed it openly of late,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research. “Qualcomm certainly has the revenues to build its own fab and start making its own wafers. The chance of success is still low. It would cost at least three times, and possibly as much as five times, to successfully get your first fab to viable production, or approximately $15 billion to $25 billion. In other words, it would be an out-of-body experience for the management team that tries it.” Sea of change In any case, there could be a sea of change taking place in the traditional fabless-foundry model. “The traditional foundry model, where you throw a GDS2 file over the wall, no longer works,” said Mojy Chian, senior vice president of design enablement at GlobalFoundries. “We have to work closer with the fabless guys. New challenges at 20nm and beyond will require deep, IDM-like collaboration to accelerate the time-to-market. In fact, the collaboration should start two to two-and-a-half years ahead of tape out.” In the late 1980s, the pure-play foundries emerged, which spawned a plethora of fabless companies. One of the drawbacks with the fabless-foundry model is that the design houses and foundries sometimes work in silos and do not cooperate. In some cases, fabless vendors will throw a clunky design “over the wall” to the foundries, which are still expected to make the chip on time. This brute-force methodology has experienced mixed success. The fabless and foundry firms began to change their ways at the 130nm node amid soaring IC design and manufacturing costs. “130nm is when process and design began to be recoupled. The result was the rise of DFM, which didn’t exist before then,” said VLSI’s Hutcheson. Then, starting in the early part of this decade, several foundries billed themselves as “virtual IDMs,” claiming they would work more closely with customers. But some of those efforts have fallen short of expectations. “The leading fabless suppliers got hurt badly when the leading foundries hadn’t dealt well with variability at 40nm, and more recently, with design-manufacturing interactive yield losses at 28nm,” Hutcheson said. Now, as the IC industry moves toward the 20nm node and beyond, the foundries have become more serious about embracing the “virtual IDM” model and for good reason: The stakes are higher. At 130nm, a fab was $1.45 billion, process R&amp;D costs were $250 million, and design costs were $15 million. But at 22nm, a fab runs $6.7 billion, process R&amp;D is $1.3 billion, and design costs are $150 million. Simply put, the traditional foundry model must evolve. “You can’t do it in silos,” said Subramani Kengeri, head of advanced technology architecture at GlobalFoundries. “The key is to have a tighter integration between product design and manufacturing.” This is especially true in the finFET era. Intel has moved finFETs into production at 22nm. Given the variability issues, the foundries face challenges to put finFETs into production at 14nm. Intel and the foundries are in the bulk finFET camp. But to make the finFET transition easier, the foundries should look at silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, said Chenming Calvin Hu, professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. “We are going to see (both bulk and SOI finFETs) in volume manufacturing,” Hu said. “[SOI] is easier. The supply chain is the one thing that manufacturers need to be assured of.” New business models On the business side, the industry could take one of two routes: Maintain the fabless-foundry status quo or move toward a “virtual IDM” model. Morris Chang, chairman and chief executive of TSMC, sees yet another model: Build dedicated fabs or joint-venture fabs for larger customers. “We made our mark serving many customers (in multiple fabs). We will retain that capability,” Chang said during a recent conference call. “There are going to be larger customers. So it makes complete sense to have one dedicated fab, or more than one fab, for one customer.” GlobalFoundries, meanwhile, is considering a slightly different model. “This is hypothetical,” said GlobalFoundries’ Kengeri. “Within a fab, we have modules. If one of our customers wants a dedicated module, it’s open for discussion.” In that arrangement, a chipmaker may have to share the risk and cost. And it must make economic sense. Clearly, though, Apple is one candidate for a dedicated fab. In fact, Samsung already has built a dedicated fab for Apple in Austin, Texas. Altera, Broadcom, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Xilinx are also possible candidates to occupy part or all of a fab. Qualcomm, for one, has the volumes and already is sourcing parts from all of the leading-edge foundries to keep up with 28nm demand. Qualcomm’s multi-foundry sourcing strategy “is a very expensive approach today, as designs don’t port to multiple foundries like they used to,” said VLSI’s Hutcheson. “Yields are far more difficult to obtain at these advanced nodes, and splitting production across multiple fabs means either less relevant data per learning cycle or longer learning cycle times. That results in longer time-to-money and higher costs, making going the IDM route seem more attractive.” It’s unlikely that Qualcomm will build its own fab, but it is possible it will end up with a joint venture fab with a foundry. In addition, Qualcomm and others would like the foundries to speed up their process roadmaps. The foundries are falling behind Intel, which also offers foundry services on a limited basis. TSMC, for one, plans to accelerate its finFET efforts. Originally, TSMC planned to introduce finFETs at 14nm by late 2014. Now, the company has no plans to brand its finFETs at 14nm, but rather it will introduce the technology at 16nm. TSMC’s finFET “risk production” is slated for the end of 2013 or early 2014, with production scheduled for the second half of 2015, Chang said. TSMC is not banking on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for 16nm. “We are very confident we can make 16nm finFETs without EUV,” he said. “I think EUV will come in at 10nm.” To accelerate 450mm fabs and EUV in the market, Intel recently inked a deal with ASML. ASML has also enabled customers to take a 25% stake in the company. Intel plans to acquire up to a 15% stake in ASML. TSMC and Samsung are also negotiating with ASML to take separate stakes in ASML. Taking a page from the ASML-Intel deal, UMC separately floated private equity shares under which strategic partners can take up to a 10% stake in UMC. This represents a change for UMC. The company has developed its own processes and has shied away from forming strategic alliances. UMC has controlled its own destiny, but it also has fallen behind its rivals. To jumpstart its process roadmap, UMC recently licensed 20nm and finFET technology from IBM. UMC’s finFET technology is reportedly a 14nm or 16nm front-end, with 20nm backend. “For UMC to do a finFET from scratch is very challenging,” said Shih-Wei Sun, chief executive of UMC, in a recent conference call. “This will kick start our finFET efforts.” GlobalFoundries and Samsung have yet to change their finFET strategies. GlobalFoundries still plans to roll out a finFET at the 14nm node in the fourth quarter of 2014 or first quarter of 2015, according to Kengeri.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348263808842</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:43:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348264306728-75</Id><Title>INTC headed for the drink, $19 by election</Title><Msg>The wheels are falling off this POS and the engine is backfiring and sputtering.

One of these is WiGig. Think of WiGig as a short range wireless Thunderbolt replacement as it can connect an Intel device to keyboards, mouse and display with a single multi-gigabit wireless connection. Today high-end smartphones have up to 64GB of storage. By 2014 we'll probably see models with 256GB and 14nm SOC's. With that amount of storage and power an Intel smartphone can easily run Android or other smartphone OS plus Windows 8 as a virtual machine guest. And running W8 on x86 will run at full speed. Consumers could carry their Intel-based smartphone into their office and place the phone on the wireless charging pad and their smartphone could wirelessly connect via WiGig to the peripherals and display on the desk. The Windows screen can be routed to the desktop display so the user can take advantage of the large screen display, applications and data already loaded on their smartphone. For ultimate portability connect your smartphone's instance of W8 to a wearable heads-up display. Many people talk about how tablets have killed the desktop and laptop and the battle for mobility is over, but make no mistake, tablets are not the end of the evolutionary path of the PC. What tablets do to the PC, the W8 capable smartphone can do to tablets. Consumers lust for no-comprise, full power mobility and Intel and Microsoft are uniquely positioned to bring it to them. And this is a journey ARM cannot even follow.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1348266132526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 18:22:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348267644164-77</Id><Topic><Title>INTC headed for the drink, $19 by election</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348264306728</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:51:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's well documented that you and your buddy (other alias?) nyk20h shorted twice on the way to 20 and got destroyed, even admitting it.
