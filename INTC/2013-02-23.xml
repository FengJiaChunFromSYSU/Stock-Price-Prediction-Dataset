[Yes, but the difference is that Intel is building customers while Nvidia is alienating all of theirs. Clearly you didn't read what Charlie had to say at SemiAccurate about Nvidia and the chances for Tegra 4. Below are a couple of Charlie's comments but you should read the whole article.] "The dozens of design wins Nvidia promised for Tegra 1, 2, and 3 that never materialized are indicative of just how bad the delivered silicon actually was. This isn’t some critic taking potshots at the company, it is a multi-year track record of unprompted statements by Nvidia PR, management, and engineers that simply did not happen." "In light of this, Nvidia burned just about all their potential Tegra customers, some quite badly." "Tegra 4 had zero non-reference design wins announced at launch. This wasn’t a fluke. " "At this point, Nvidia has burned all the players at least once, and the results are quite clear to anyone looking on, Tegra 4 has few if any real customers."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361604287720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 02:24:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361608009616-7</Id><Topic><Title>Expect to See More Intel Phones at MWC 2013</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361595596819</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 23:59:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Instead of focusing on how well NVidia is treating its customers, look at how far behind Intel is and how fool-hardy this whole effort, which some seem to justify with "given enough time" type arguments, really is.

It's pretty pathetic that out of all the 32nm phone processors only Intel can design one that can actually use all its cores as intended without breaking a 2W power budget. Clovertrail+ is only going to embarrass Apple A6, ARM A7-A9-A15 and Qualcomm's S4 in any serious performance test done over any length of time. What do you think the brand new 22nn OoO Merrifield will do too when that is unleashed ? The beneficiaries will definitely be the consumer but that is only because they will have excellent x86 processors to choose from in their future mobile needs rather than the mediocre dross the ARMy will be churning out ---- ? One of the worst posts I've read from you;) None of Intel's current phone chips can keep within their thermal budgets either, even with one thread running. This is the point of turbo boost - allow extra performance when the thermals allow. As for the Clovertrail+, she's going to struggle to put any meaningful performance distance between herself and the original clocked Tegra 3 on native benchmarks. Against the A6 and other newer SoCs's she's going to look ordinary. We know this as clovertrail is on geekbench (in a tablet form factor with it's higher thermal budget/battery and a less power hungry GPU). Even in Javascript, she's not going to have much more of a boost over existing Intel chips as these benchmarks are single threaded. Where Clovertrail+ will perform is the GPU....</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361609407758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 03:50:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361609770569-9</Id><Topic><Title>Can someone explain Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</Title><Username>technospec</Username><Timestamp>1361561667785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:34:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go to the AnTuTu database and look up either "Lenovo K900" or "Redhookbay" That's Clover Trail+, and it kicks the living snot out of any ARM chip. ---- Neither the Lenovo or Redhookbay are on the official AnTuTu database?

The device &amp; service must first deliver competitive TV viewing content and options relative to what consumers already have and that is not assured. Intel already said this isn't a value play so don't expect Intel's service to be any cheaper than one's monthly HDTV cable service today. And everyone knows how intrusive the built-in camera can be and Intel's intention to market family member's personal data to third parties. Intel has not even mentioned that streaming live TV all day long via IP can easily exceed the customer's monthly data allocation broadband providers have for their customers, therefore owners of Intel's Web TV can easily find themselves paying far higher bill for Internet service than they did without Intel's Web TV. This FCC no longer expects ISP's to deliver fixed-price unlimited service. Today, broadband service is tiered. More data means higher cost. Interestingly, the cable companies can stream IP video all day long to their customers but they don't count their streaming against the customer's monthly data allocation. This gives cable companies a built-in advantage over any competitor with an over-the-top streaming service. In fact, about the only business model innovation Intel brings with their idea is the additional revenue generated by spying on its customers but that is also the most objectionable part of the service. If there's good news to Intel shareholders the project doesn't cost much and the Web TV project is setup as separate effort with a different brand. It will be easily to eliminate the project and staff when its failed.</Msg><Username>mega.hurts</Username><Timestamp>1361632227866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 10:10:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361634190185-23</Id><Topic><Title>intel_dividend</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1361627135685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 08:45:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're out of your mind, boy.

So it is no great reach to project that it will pop by June. It just means growing awareness of the factors that indicate that ARM can't possible grow earnings fast enough to justify its enormous P/E ratio, which Yahoo today says is a mere 77. It will take ARM 77 years to earn back the price of a share of stock. Here are the factors that say that this is not possible. These are the factors that I believe cannot be hidden any longer even from those on Wall Street with their heads buried in the sand. 1.) Shrinking ASPs, margins and profits. We have to look no further than Apple whose stock price has dropped from 705 to 450 (36 percent) in the last year. This alone should have popped the ARM Bubble. This trend is just going to get worse for ARM as the tablet market moves toward lower average prices for the type of capability that ARM offers. We recently have seen that there is excellent demand for the higher performing tablet, such as the Surface Pro but ARM is unable to go there as demonstrated by the lackluster sales of the RT version of the Surface. If Apple is experiencing price pressure, it will be much greater for the rest of the ARM world. Pop. 2.) Performance problems. Charlie's article at SemiAccurate this last week on Nvidia indicated the price to be paid for making performance promises that don't get met. That price is one measly design win for the Tegra 4 after having burned the OEMs on the Tegra promises for the 1, 2, and 3. No one is buying their party line on performance now. This is a second major ARM vendor that is having serious problems. Serious enough in Nvidia's case that they are now thought of as a take-over candidate rather than a continuing operation. This also should have been enough to pop the ARM Bubble. Not the kind of pop ARM is looking for. 3.) Fabrication. The fabrication situation for ARM simply couldn't be any worse. Shrinking number of foundries coupled with shrinking funding and shrinking technology. ARM is currently stuck at 28nm and doesn't have very much of that with TSMC saying they are doing all of it. It will be a couple of years before 20nm arrives and it would be a band-aid if it arrived today due to limited planar performance benefits and significantly increased costs. Not to mention that the speed of ARM's ramps is dropping at each new node. As far as the half-step to 14nm goes, it is so far out at this point as to be not worth considering. It is certainly not going to keep the ARM Bubble from popping. So ARM will be at 28nm for years and years and years while Intel steadily moves ahead to 14nm at the end of this year, 10nm in 2015 and 7nm in 2017. Pop, pop and pop. 4.) Haswell. Haswell is the immediate reason that the pop is eminent. From Otellini: 'In the first half of this year we will launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable breakthrough innovations in form factor, battery life and usability. It will deliver the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel's history, and it is inspiring a new wave of ultra-sleek, convertible touch-based designs across our customer base.' From Marsavian: "No, it is the greatest Intel processor design since the Core 2 (Conroe/Merom). It will simultaneously lay devastating blows on AMD, ARM and NVDA. None of these companies will ever be the same again so be afraid ... very afraid ;-)." So, in June with Haswell, we will finally reach the tipping point. And because of the fabrication situation, ARM will never get back in the game. Pop. 5.) Clovertrail. Which brings us to Clovertrail whose capabilities we expect to hear a lot more about starting Monday at MWC 2013. From Marsavian: "They have already made a serious impact in mobile, Clover Trail has killed Windows RT absolutely stone dead at birth." "Clovertrail tablet production can't keep up with demand whereas SurfaceRTs are rusting in warehouses. Clover Trail has a long future ahead of it as a cheap tablet processor and Windows 8 adoption continues whereas these initial WinRT tablets will be the last. Atom did its job." Yet another solid indication that the tipping point has been reached. Pop. Conclusion We have five solid reasons why even if the ARM Bubble has survived to this point, it is in its end-of-days phase. It won't survive until June. It will take no more than one solid piece of new information to kick it down the slippery slope to what will eventually be single-digits. Heck, we might even get that piece of information this next week...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361642396668</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 12:59:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361642565364-35</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be able to leapfrog Samsung, if they use 22nm Atom in their Iphones.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361494967128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 20:02:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Intel's new CEO comes from outside and has a "mobile" background, what do you mean by mobile background - you mean low power? Apple needs to look at many aspects when selecting a manufacturing partner - and it's probably a trade off / compromise. "He indicated that they were too slow and "stodgy" Intel selected 3 small top notch fabless companies and demonstrated that they can efficiently work with the design teams of the 3 companies and can bring (just announced by Achronix) a leapfrogging chip into production. I think these 3 companies were a learning vehicle for Intel because they need to work with and listen to the outsider design team. I think that is a very important skill Intel might have lacked in the past but this has been fixed by working with the outsiders. Many might disagree with me but P.O. laid the foundation (granted somewhat late) for mobile. As Bohr said Intel neglected SoC but they are making great effort to catch up. Though SoC and CPU are two different beasts Intel can leverage the process technology and learning from CPU processing and apply it to SoC manufacturing which is a huge advantage compared to ARM foundries. A fab can not change from CPU to SoC production on the fly - very sophisticated S/W is used to run a fab and it takes some time to make adjustments. Though SoC and CPU use the same tool set the process flow differs between CPU and SoC. From: Intel Tips 22nm SoC Recipes, 14nm Process google it - it gives comparision between SoC and CPU Bohr also discussed Intel’s SoC process recipes for the 22nm node. In previous years, Intel developed a standard “one-size-fits-all” CPU process technology for a particular node. Starting at the 32nm node, Intel developed a CPU (P1268) and SOC (P1269) process. The CPU and SoC processes have identical feature sets, but the SoC version incorporates a set of recipes specifically for device designers. For example, Intel will provide a standard CPU process at 22nm, internally called P1270. Based on a tri-gate transistor structure, the CPU process incorporates high-speed logic circuits and interconnects. The SoC version, dubbed P1271, makes use of a low leakage technology, dense interconnects and passives. It will also include 1.2V low-power and 1.8V thick-gate options. Intel will provide some four SoC recipe options for designers: high-performance, standard performance, low power and ultra low power, according to Bohr. The technology is aimed for a range of applications, including the booming mobile space. Intel is seeking to propel its x86-based processors in the mobile space-and displace the ARM camp in the process.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361642565364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 13:02:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361642606941-36</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be able to leapfrog Samsung, if they use 22nm Atom in their Iphones.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361494967128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 20:02:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He also said this: "At the high-performance end, Intel is the best," Jobs said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361642606941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 13:03:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361642950147-37</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be able to leapfrog Samsung, if they use 22nm Atom in their Iphones.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361494967128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 20:02:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Problem is Apple doesn't have a choice.

But it's not nearly as risky as staying the course. They can't do business with Samsung and TSMC can't even meet its 28nm demand. They really don't seem to have much of a choice.

There is a rule of thumb I have observed, to get a foothold you need 50% better performance in some important metric to the user e.g. compute performance or low power or price and to be guaranteed to replace the incumbent you need to be 100% better. ARM is none of these things, all it has done is optimize low power sleep modes and the SoC concept in practice. Neither of these things are ISA/micro-architecture dependent and Intel is catching up fast in both. Remember before WinRT was released it was the great white hope of both ARM management and its assorted fanbois. As soon as Clovertrail as released with similar performance/power characteristics to ARM chips it was pretty obvious to me that no-one would bother to put up with a similarly performing similarly priced ARM chip with an inferior software base and no-one would bother to develop new software for it. All the ARM fanbois are being disingenuous now and pretending that it does not matter now and Windows is at fault and not the ARM architecture. But WinRT was supposed to be the beachhead by which Wintel PCs were supposed to be replaced by supposedly cheaper ARM PCs with better power characteristics. That dream is already dead and buried and it only took 6 months and both you and I and others here predicted it beforehand. Another important thing happened last week which also strengthens the PC x86 ecosystem going forward. Sony released the PS4 specs and it is basically two pairs of 1.6 GHz AMD Jaguar quad-cores allied to a reasonably medium-high end ATI gpu. Microsoft will also use the same architecture more or less for Xbox 720 so what this will do is ensure that the PC x86 gaming ecosystem will remain the world's premier gaming platform going forward and as Haswell can do anything that Jaguar can do but several times better it will already have the latest games developed for it automatically by these new PC consoles which can only boost future Haswell sales further than they otherwise might have been. AMD is fulfilling its x86 sidekick role admirably again ;-). p.s. Jaguar is a 64-bit 28nm x86 chip that will have roughly the same performance and power characteristics as the new ARM 64-bit chips like A57.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1361653555626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 16:05:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361653994286-53</Id><Title>Poll of the Day</Title><Msg>What ID does author and perennial Intel-basher Dana Blankenhorn post under? 1.) lucy_nuff 2.) tooofunnny 3.) lucifer_nuff 4.) harlan_titusville 5.) mark_this_post 6.) gordon.greco 7.)

Due to the long lead times ASML is probably the best early indicator - if Apple decided to go with TSMC than they must have make the decision a long time ago ...who knows ...perhaps today they would decide differently - the transcript is only 4 pages - so check it out So what I believe whether it is a 20 nanometer plainer or the 20 nanometer or 16 nanometer what TSMC is calling. But I think as far as I know, it’s actually 20 nanometer design rule with the finFET. From a litho perspective, there is no real difference between the tools that required for the plainer or the finFET process. So the combined 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer again whatever it’s going to be 20 nanometer or 16 nanometer, now will drive the 1.7 time that the spend over the 28 nanometer node So yeah, we don’t know I have an indication today on what the ramp of the 20 nanometer process will look like currently. But they’ll have to install a critical amount of capital. So actually there are some internal estimates on our part again not necessarily linked to what our customers have said, but most just looking at typical ramps of new nodes, they might suggest that there could be a fab work or about 40,000, 45,000 wafer starts to put in, which in the mid 2013 and mid 2014, and 45,000 wafer start fab at 20 nanometer is about €1 billion in little investment. Again versus the 600 or so for the 28-nanometer investment, it’s quite substantial.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361675549325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 22:12:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361676945970-66</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody subscribe to Semiaccurate?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1361662057227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 18:27:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CLEARLY he LOVES basing Intel... semiaccurateDOTcom/tag/nasdaqintc/#.USmKQVemVb8</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1361676945970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 22:35:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361679645541-67</Id><Topic><Title>Poll of the Day</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361653994286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 16:13:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>11.) wdblawgrow</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361679645541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 23:20:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361679856716-68</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be able to leapfrog Samsung, if they use 22nm Atom in their Iphones.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361494967128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 20:02:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Apple would be crazy to put all eggs in one nest" [Let's see what happens with the iWatch.

Microsoft stores at Century City (Los Angeles, Calif.), Palo Alto, Calif., Boston (Prudential Center), and Huntington Station, N.Y., all had "limited stock" of the 128GB model, CNET confirmed today. Other stores, such as ones in New Jersey and Texas, didn't have the model this morning. Representatives at two of the stores said that they couldn't guarantee availability at the end of the day due to the model's popularity. The 128GB Surface Pro sold out immediately online and in short order at most Microsoft stores after it went on sale on February 9. Related story LA Microsoft Store not mobbed, but Surface has a following "We're working with our retail partners who are currently out of stock of the 128GB Surface Pro to replenish supplies as quickly as possible," Panos Panay, who heads the Surface team at Microsoft, wrote on February 13. And Microsoft later updated the status to say online orders would ship "within 2-3 weeks," which Microsoft indicated on its online store is March 1. Update: The 128GB model is, as of Thursday afternoon, listed on Microsoft's online store as "out of stock" again, as Neowin reported. by Brooke Crothers</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361680513218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 23:35:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361680860910-70</Id><Title>Get the Intel® Software Adrenaline App</Title><Msg>[Hmmm, just saw this for the first time...] Intel® Software Adrenaline’s mobile app provides a window on the future—the evolving technologies, paradigms, insights, strategy, and roadmaps that will help you stay on the forefront of mobile computing, today and tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I also had to take the A/C adapter and cable which caused me to then wish for a USB cable to charge the Surface Pro. With a USB cable I could charge up the Surface using a portable battery or one of the slim USB to A/C adapters I have floating around. One benefit of the Surface Pro charger from Microsoft is that a USB port is on the charging brick so I was able to charge up a phone at the same time. I rented a movie to watch via Xbox Video and also downloaded the latest episodes of Walking Dead and Clone Wars in iTunes on the Surface Pro. I had already purchased these seasons on iTunes and almost bought them again on Xbox Video before I realized I can just intall the full Windows version of iTunes to access this content. This gave me lots of content to enjoy on my cross country flights and the kickstand on the Surface worked well on the tray table. I wrote a couple of blog posts using my cyan Touch Cover and the awesome Notepad Classic application. I used the Chrome browser to post to ZDNet and also stay in touch with people on Twitter. At the HTC One launch event there were Ethernet cables on each chair, but without an Ethernet port I used the solid WiFi connection instead. We sat in white plastic patio chairs without tables and I was able to type just fine on my Surface with the Touch Cover keyboard and both legs together to serve as a solid platform. I was actually surprised by how well I was able to have the Surface propped up and used on my lap -- as this was my first extended test of this arrangement. (BTW, I typed up this post on my Surface Pro while on my train commute this morning, but there was a table available.) I captured a bit of video (more on that later) and figured I would process it and post it when I arrived home and connected my phone to my MacBook Pro. Since I had a couple hours to burn at the airport, I decided to see what the Surface Pro could handle -- so I connected my Nokia Lumia 920 and imported the video to Microsoft Movie Maker. I was surprised how easy of a process that was and then found it dead simple to add a title page and post directly to my YouTube account. The entire process took something like 20 minutes, including the video upload via a tethered connection (see below). I think I've found my new video processing machine. Honestly, my stupid MacBook Pro has been suffering from kernel panics (the Apple Store can't even solve the problem) and restarted most of the time when I try to play or process videos which is a major reason I have not been posting many videos here on ZDNet. As a group manager, I also have to review and approve billing timesheets each week in Deltek Vision. I was able to go to the Desktop, run Vision, and get everything in on time thanks to the full Windows support of the Surface Pro. The more I use it, the more I am convinced that the Surface Pro may be my favorite tech purchase in a long time. I know there are more powerful Windows 8 devices, but none with such power in a super slim and light package. I never had a low battery issue since there were ample outlets at the airport and in my hotel room. I ran on battery at the launch event, but it wasn't long enough to impact my Surface usage there.

And this is just the beginning. In another six months to a year, this type of Windows 8 tablet is going to be available in a much thinner, much lighter, more powerful and more energy efficient form factor from many different vendors.
