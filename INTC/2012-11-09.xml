I have never seen such a clear example of disinformation, short of the Republican attack ads, that lost for them the last election. If you believe a fabless company like Qcom is really better than a giant megolith like Intel, than I urge you to bet your farm on qcom. But don't give me the balderdash that the fact Intel is design, development AND fab somehow makes it weak. And of course, Cramerian balderdash doesn't witness the 28nm shortage and what really underlies it all. AND, to backbay, et al, who charge that Ottelini should go because he isn't counter-spewing....let me say that if I witnessed Ottelini counter-spewing balderdash, I would see it as a weakness..a cover-up.

Stock options are issued and are designed to lock high value employees into the company by their staggered vesting and incremental awarding of shares. Option stock that is finding its way into the market today was awarded between 1 and 5 years ago.

Unlike earnings and revenues, the fiscal cliff doesn't offer investors a number to work, just a gloomy picture. There was some talk about the potential effect on the GDP should the U. S. go over the cliff at the end of the year. But there is no clear picture in terms of how much consumers might tighten their pocket book when the tax cuts expire or how much corporations may change their businesses over Obamacare. The market seemed to be dominated more by fear than actual economic expectation. In addition, those who had expected Romney to win might have been so disappointed that they capitulated. Technically, all three major indexes are now below their respective 200-day moving averages suggesting the downtrend started in September could morph into a longer term downtrend. Don't try to catch a falling knife. Wait for the market to find some stabilization before step in.

I think that those who spread fear for personal gain are worse. Not referring to you. The "fiscal cliff" is more of a "fiscal beach". There are triggers but the effects are much more sloping in their impact. Expect that the lame duck congress will not do anything before Jan. We have just started the brinksmanship game and the game cannot finish until the brink is upon us. The Democrats will allow the tax cuts to expire if they are pushed. With 70% of the electorate supporting another tax bracket and the CBO saying it has minor effect, the Republicans will get the credit for the expiration. (Reuters) - Allowing income tax rates to rise for wealthy Americans, and maintaining rates for the less affluent, would not hurt U.S. economic growth much in 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday, stepping into a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over how to resolve the so-called "fiscal cliff."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1352474223434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 10:17:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352474608082-44</Id><Title>teandtea = lucy_nuff = tooofunny = on and on and on</Title><Msg>Poor guy is so insecure with himself that he has to scream "told you so!" on a dumb message board.

Qualcomm uses ARM CPUs... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LONDON – Qualcomm's standing as the leading supplier of application processors for mobile devices – and the fact that it is fabless – has boosted its market capitalization past Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker. San Diego-based Qualcomm is expected to increase its sales by 30 percent in 2012, according to market researcher IC Insights. Qualcomm's annual chips sales are expected to reach about $12.8 billion in annual chip sales, moving it three spots in the researchers' rankings to No. 4. Although Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) remains the No. 1 chip maker as measured by sales volume, its standing relies on its dominant position in PCs, a market that is now perceived to be flat at best as consumers embrace smartphones and tablet computers. Those mobile devices are often powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors. In the eyes of investors who have driven up its market capitalization, the fact that Qualcomm is a fabless company relieves it of the burden of having to invest billions of dollars each year in process development and wafer fabs. As a result, Qualcomm's share price stands at $61.83, giving it a current market capitalization of $105 billion. Intel's market capitalization stands at $104 billion based on a share price of $20.96. According to IC Insights, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s market cap is about $84 billion, followed by Texas Instruments at about $33 billion.

A year ago or so, the entire economy was put in a collapse by the Congress (GOP) and its unwillingness to increase the debt ceiling, The President and the GOP came to an agreement kicking the ball down the road.The agreement said they would work together up until the start of 2013 to get an agreement, if no agreement was gotten, then massive cuts would be put in and the tax rates would go back to the tax rates during the Clinton last year. Neither side tried to do a deal this last year thinking they would win when they won the White House in the election. Funny thing has happened to the GOP--they lost the election and thus, if they do not do a deal with the President, massive tax raises will kick in screwing the GOP nimrods. Also massive cuts in the military will take place which is like a gun to the head of the GOP. SO--the GOP teabagging losers will now get to see what happens when you lose elections. Obummer will put the gun to the heads of the GOP and Boenner head will be forced to push his House GOP to allow the Obummer economic bill to pass or they will see massive tax increased on everyone nit just the 1% that those scumclowns are protecting.

Cray, which has used Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices for most of their supercomputers, is now embracing Intel chips for its new XC30 supercomputer line. The XC30—which had been codenamed Cascade—is Cray’s next-generation supercomputer product line, and the first of the XC portfolio, which will replace the current XE and XK brands as the company’s flashship HPC family, according to Barry Bolding, Cray’s vice president of corporate marketing. The new systems not only will come with Intel’s Xeon chips, but they also will feature significant improvements in interconnect technology and bandwidth, performance, energy efficiency and high-performance computing (HPC) software support. Bolding noted that the current AMD-based XE Blue Waters and XK Titan systems have been stalwarts in Cray’s supercomputer lineup as it has competed with the likes of IBM, Fujistu, Hewlett-Packard and others. “We anticipate that XC will be just as important to our competitiveness going forward,” he told eWEEK. The HPC server space is becoming increasingly competitive, not only with the continued demand from scientific and educational institutions, but also the growth in large enterprise data centers that need the same performance, scalability and energy efficiency capabilities. According to market research firm IDC, revenue in the HPC technical server space in the second quarter hit $2.4 billion. In 2011, overall revenues hit $10.3 billion, and analysts expect to see that number jump to $11 billion this year. IBM had 32.7 percent of the market in the quarter, followed by HP, with 29.8 percent, and Dell, with 14.2 percent. Cray during the quarter saw its revenues jump 43.7 percent, according to IDC. Cray’s announcement comes less than a week before the SC12 supercomputing show opens Nov. 12 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Cray’s XC30 system—which will be able to scale to more than 100 petaflops of performance—initially will be powered by Intel’s current 32-nanometer Xeon E5-2600 “Sandy Bridge” processors, and later by the 22nm “Ivy Bridge” server chips when they become available next year. The system also eventually will leverage accelerator technology, such as Intel’s Xeon Phi coprocessors and Nvidia’s Tesla graphics accelerator technology, according to Bolding. Cray opted for Intel’s chips for the XC30 for their performance and connectivity flexibility, he said. The performance improvements in the current Sandy Bridge and upcoming Ivy Bridge Xeons were important to Cray, as was the ability to leverage both Intel’s Xeon Phi coprocessors and Nvidia’s GPU accelerators. In addition, Intel’s incorporation of the PCIe-3 interconnect technology into the chips. A key for the supercomputer will be the addition of the Aries interconnect technology, which is optimized for HPC environments. The XC30 will offer a 20-times improvement in global bandwidth, and the because of Aries, each node in the supercomputer will be able to handle 120 million gets/puts per second, significantly faster than the 30 million to 40 million gets/puts per second for Cray’s XK systems. Each node in the XC30s will include a 48-port Aries interconnect. Development Aries had been with Cray until April, when Intel announced it was buying Cray’s networking assets for $140 million. Included in those assets were Cray’s Gemini technology and Aries. Along with Aries, Cray is introducing its Dragonfly topology, which is designed to free applications from locality constraints and create a low-latency network that includes adaptive routing capabilities. Cray also is introducing a new cooling system aimed at leveraging what Bolding called a transverse airflow to lower overall TCO for customers. Air is blown into one end of the a row of computers and out the other end, helping to eliminate the more traditional hot aisle/cold aisle setup in many data centers. The XC30—early samples of which are shipping now, with wider availability set for the first quarter of 2013—also will come with the next generation of the high-performance Cray Linux Environment, which includes enhancements in its clustering capabilities, and Cray’s HPC optimized programming environment, which includes compilers, job management, libraries and debugging tools. According to company officials, Cray already has more than $100 million in contracts for the XC30, which has been in development for more than five years.</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1352487524604</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:58:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352487862485-92</Id><Topic><Title>Ricky suckatelli of cnbc is a real loser crybaby woooosey</Title><Username>amdsuckks</Username><Timestamp>1352485254864</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:20:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAAA HAAA They said the President would take everyone's guns......even as gun sales, gun shows, and cc permits set new records They said the President was 'waging a war on religion'........even as the number of churches, religous based orgs, Sunday schools, and religious-political activists grew by leaps and bounds They said the President was weak, ineffective, and dangerously 'apologetic' in foreign affairs....even as he rid the world of those who attacked us, ended one war, began the 'drawdown' of the other, strengthened and increased our system of care for our veterans, enlisted our allies in responding to threats and challenges, and oversaw the rise of America's reputation and stature in the world....and made our nation safer.

Apple is, after all, the poster child of a company that wants to control its own destiny: It makes its own hardware and software, and is a proponent of the walled garden ecosystem exemplified by its iTunes Store and App Store. Even more recently, Apple has taken deeper control of its processor design; the iPhone 5s A6 chip uses Apples own custom ARM-based design, rather than taking a standard ARM core and just dropping it in, as the company has with past iOS devices. However, its one thing to design a CPU thats different but software compatible with existing designs, and another thing to drop in a completely different core. Apple has done that with the Mac twice in the past, once, when it migrated from Motorolas 68000-based chips to the PowerPC architecture it co-designed with IBM and Motorola, and again when it transitioned from PowerPC to Intel. It wasnt a painless process in either case, but in both cases Apple had a key advantage: It included emulation technology that allowed the newer CPUs to run old Mac binaries (most of them, anyway). In the latter case, especially, the Intel CPUs were considerably faster than the PowerPC processors, so running in emulation mode didnt adversely affect performance too badly. Moving from Intel to ARM is a different proposition, for two key reasons: First, current ARM performance really doesnt compare with what Intels processors offer when it comes to the kind of performance expected from MacBooks and iMacs. Secondly, the currently shipping ARM-based products are 32-bit. ARM announced the ARMv8 64-bit architecture at the ARM Tech Conference on October 30th, but products based on ARMs 64-bit core are unlikely to hit the market until sometime in 2014. Intel isnt sitting still Meanwhile, Intels not resting on its laurels. Next year, the company will ship its new Haswell CPU in mid-2013. Haswell will offer somewhat better processor performance than the Ivy Bridge CPUs used in the current MacBook and iMac lines. However, Intel expects graphics performance for the integrated Intel graphics to double compared to the existing Ivy Bridge graphics. Given that Apple thought Ivy Bridge was good enough to build its new 13-inch MacBook with Retina Display using the chips integrated graphics, having even more performance will likely be an attractive proposition for Apple going forward. Beyond Haswell, Intel will be building a new CPU, code-named Skylake, on its upcoming 14nm manufacturing process, which should substantially shrink the CPU die and reduce power consumption even more significantly. Intel is betting on its processor technology to help it reduce power consumption, and Haswell itself has major tweaks for power management; at idle, it will use less power than any recent mainstream Intel CPU. Unpredictable Apple Still, Apple is nothing if not unpredictable. If we assume for a moment that Apple is really relentless about completely controlling its hardware chain, the company has more than one way to make that happen. It could move to ARM by the time the 64-bit core hits the streets; thats certainly feasible. But if so, it probably wont happen in the next generation of MacBooks or iMacs. Apple could also design its own 64-bit ARM core for Mac. As mentioned above, the company already did something similar with the A6 used in the iPhone 5. Finally, Apple could always let the Mac product line slowly wither away. This last item seems more likely. Apple could continue with Intel as long as the Mac line is alive. Meanwhile, it could gradually scale up its iPads to be more powerful and more flexible. Once theyre powerful enough for the kind of pro graphics applications that run on desktop Macs, then the writing could be on the wall. Or, Apple could keep shipping Intel-based Macs that are on the higher end of the performance spectrum, while also building a low-cost, ARM-based laptop that relies on iCloud for most of its services and storage, much the way Google is trying to do with Chromebooks. That way, it could test the waters for ARM-based Macs, and if unsuccessful, quietly move away from them. But dont expect any of this soon. Next years iMacs and MacBooks will almost certainly sport Intel CPUs. In the end, Apple still needs to ship products that serve its users needs, so replacing all of its desktops and laptops with systems running on ARM CPUs is unlikely in the short term. Beyond that, is anyones guesswell, anyone who doesnt work at Apple, at least.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352492179344</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:16:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352492188570-112</Id><Topic><Title>what is a garbage</Title><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1352490927972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:55:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dhort erm lows could be close, the question will then become when to sell, the highs for the semi cycle are likely already in, way up there at 24 and above. taxes will go up, spending will get cut, fiscal cliff or not.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352492188570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:16:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352492459413-113</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Paul O., how is business doing??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1352491108525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:58:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Otellini has had years to make INTC go and yet the stock price today is much lower than when he took over as CEO. If you compare the price to when he was COO, the differential is even greater. How much time would you suggest to allow a CEO to show performance, or show him/her the door? How long should a stock price languish? I think investors have spent enough time in purgatory waiting for the performance that has totally escaped his grasp, so perhaps it is time he step down and INTC get somebody in there that has a vision and a passion to get this company moving--there more than sufficient qualified CEO types that can accomplish that objective which has eluded his grasp. Just being a "CEO Caretaker"is not a sufficent reason for his remaining a CEO. If you measure a company's performance on its dividend, then Otellini's reign is a joke! Measurement is usually based upon how well a stock price has performed during a CEO tenure--and on that basis Otellini has been a disaster.</Msg><Username>shmemony</Username><Timestamp>1352492459413</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:20:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352492701437-114</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Paul O., how is business doing??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1352491108525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:58:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You make a good point, but look what we just did with the president.

The chip requires 8 percent less power while in use and 80 percent when idle, The Wall Street Journal reports. The Itanium chip line was developed by Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and HP (NYSE: HPQ) more than 10 years ago and competes with products from IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) and Oracle Corp. HP on Thursday also announced a new line of servers that use the new processors.

You're right, we are all phucked. some, like you, are just too stoopid to know it BUSH put us here. Blaming BUSH is appropriate until the damage he caused in gone. BUSH fired up all the spending. BUSH destroyed the revenues. The BUSH FINANCIAL PANIC should take 10 to 15 years to clear out. BUSH appointed regulators who did not do their job. It could have been avoided. GWB is already ranked in the bottom QUARTILE of presidents by historians and he sinks farther each year as the full impact of his disaster becomes clear. Those who want to be blind, can easily ignore these facts. Some people are "too stupid" to be embarrassed by what they say. They don't realize how uninformed they really are. SOME are STUNNINGLY uninformed and I hope that is the case, otherwise, if they are really informed, their statements are FOXNEWS-worthy criminal.

But for now, the market is just gaga over Apple. So who was in top 5 as Apple dropped out? Lenovo and ZTE were two of the top 5. Last I checked, both ZTE and Lenovo announced that they will be using Intel chips in at least some of their smartphones. That's supposed to be a positive thing for Intel. But for now analysts and others like clown Cramer have their listener drinking their koolaid. The obvious results will come out in time showing Intel taking market share from ARM in smartphones and tablets. Tablet market share will be taken in combination of tablets and ultrabook hybrids. Performance will matter as ARM tablet users will see their limits tested. And the Apple going to ARM with Macs is a complete joke. Apple knows better than to ignore completely Intel's chip fabrication lead of 5 years .</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1352509641186</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 20:07:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352517751860-138</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone drops from top 5 in China.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1352509641186</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 20:07:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>short AAPL then. make up for your lost profits in INTC.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352517751860</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 22:22:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352522651048-139</Id><Title>Wintel or Andrel - INTC wins</Title><Msg>Lots of talk out there about how tablets are cannibalizing the PCs (laptops). That is just mainstream media #$%$. Tablets, with their touch user interface, is revolutionary. As with any new type of revolutionary device, it will sell by the boatloads. Meanwhile, the PC (laptop) has reached its innovation peak and sales are down. But does it mean that tablets are replacing PCs? h*ll no! Just ask yourself these questions: Do you still own a PC? Do you still use the PC? Of course you do!...now look into the crystal ball for what will happen in the future...Windows 8 is out with touch capabilities. INTC will be coming out with a Haswell chip that will be more powerful than the current Core i's but require wayyyy less power. What does this mean? It means that there will be PCs out there that will be thinner than the thinnest Macbook Air. On top of that, these new PCs will be convertible in design, meaning that they can be both an ultrabook and a tablet. The PC is innovating again by incorporating touch UI! The tablets and PCs are merging into one device! Sure there will be some stand alone tablets out there, but convertibles will be the wave of the future. Android currently dominates the smartphone market. INTC will soon be a big player in the smartphone space with the release of their z2580 chip and subsequent chip releases...INTC has stated that for the Atom chipset, they plan to excelerate their releases. Alot of people are right now rolling their eyes and saying it's too late for INTC in this space. That's mainstream media #$%$. Do a little research. Their 3 year old z2460 chip was faster than previous ARM chips and competitive in power comsumption. The z2580 will be more powerful than the ARM Cortex A15 and will require less power. INTC has also spent the last year perfecting the performance and interoperability of Android on x86 platform. So you can say that they have not made much headlines in this space on purpose! Come end of this year and early next year, we will see! The z2580 will come out and everything will become clear as to just how great INTC really is! They will dominate in terms of performance and power consumption. The z2580 will first be built using 32nm technology. Then in mid 2013, INTC will come out with another chip built on 22nm technology and then in 2014 another using 14nm technology. But INTC's chips are more expensive you ask? INTC's gross margins will surely suffer if they try to compete in this space you say? You forget that INTC designs and build their own chips! That they can under cut ARMs chips and still make a big profit! The smartphone and small tablet market will be dominanted by Android+Intel = Andrel.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1352522651048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 23:44:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
