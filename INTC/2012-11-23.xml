It doesn't really run any desktop applications. It mostly just connects to websites. If you pay some website $20 a month they can certainly take care of your photos for you. But if the website is free then it might shut down and lose your photos. Intel Clover Trail Atom for tablets is out, but Intel Hawell for tablets looks like the correct strategy. Meanwhile, there are nine Samsung ATIV 500T tablets in the country. So some retailers are now giving a stock date of December 05 against the previous dates of November 20 and November 29. But it's the ATIV 500T for extra battery life or the ATIV 700T for higher performance.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1353654532851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 02:08:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353655151645-15</Id><Topic><Title>If Paul O.'s departure is so amicable then why...</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1353622174692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 17:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Times are changing, you need to wake up to reality..Intel's best days are over!!! For sure they are -LOL the days of "cheap" ARM chips are over - you don't get it. ARM is completely clueless when it comes to manufacturing - in particular to economics of advanced manufacturing... it looks like Abu Dhabi finally saw a light - TI pulled out..... very long Intel hedged with ASML et al because ARM suckers will buy a ...load trying to catch up with Intel. So actually there are some internal estimates on our part again not necessarily linked to what our customers have said, but most just looking at typical ramps of new nodes, they might suggest that there could be a fab work or about 40,000, 45,000 wafer starts to put in, which in the mid 2013 and mid 2014, and 45,000 wafer start fab at 20 nanometer is about €1 billion in little investment. Again versus the 600 or so for the 28-nanometer investment, it’s quite substantial.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353655151645</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 02:19:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353655707944-16</Id><Title>razr atom and 4g.</Title><Msg>Does the razr I have 4g ?

According to the blurb posted by Marvasian GF is trying to become profitable/break even by 2015 - TI exiting mobile (selling it to Aamazon!!!???) - what does this tell you. TSMC easy profits all come from mature (depreciated) process - that's the difference in regards to GF - GF only around for a short time and highly exposed to leading edge (low margin business). Six month ago or so Apple came out with 45nm processor - now they are scrambling to get 20nm in the future - what does that tell you? SMD: So if Intel is planning to get into that market, the company is experimenting with that technology right now? Bohr: Yes, and we've been public about exploring TSV and 3D technology for a couple years. Although there are some challenging technology aspects, the real issue is cost. Doing TSVs and stacking chips -- especially these custom Wide I/O chips -- is expensive. So this might be a better engineering solution in terms of density, performance and power, but will the market bear the added cost? Not all markets will bear the higher cost.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353686725639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 11:05:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353686808837-54</Id><Topic><Title>byu now its teim</Title><Username>induxit</Username><Timestamp>1353430977054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:02:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>post thanks givnig maerkts i tried to tell u johhny 77777777777777777</Msg><Username>induxit</Username><Timestamp>1353686808837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 11:06:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353687445436-55</Id><Topic><Title>I would wait to sell INTC is going a lot HIGHER and the shorts still have to cover</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1353684420332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 10:27:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TIC TOC what TIME is it?

Despite recent news negatively affecting market observers' evaluations of Intel's future performance, the upcoming Intel low-power chips designed for handsets and tablets are seen as a milestone for the company. The new line of low-power processors will see power consumption move closer to that rival ARM's, while reducing production costs through a process shrink, the sources indicated. Intel recently announced the upcoming retirement of CEO Paul Otellini, followed by speculation that Apple is considering replacing Intel processors in its Mac PCs with designs based on ARM's architecture. Despite the roll-outs of several Atom processors since 2012, Intel has thus far failed to catch up with ARM in the mobile space. ARM licenses its architecture to chip suppliers including Qualcomm and Samsung, and even system vendors which design their own chips, such as Apple. While working hard to compete with ARM in the mobile computing segment, Intel has not seen the availability of Microsoft's Windows 8 OS trigger a PC replacement trend and buoy its performance in the sector. In general, market observers hold a pessimistic view on the future of Intel. Nonetheless, Intel's planned launch of new processors including the next-generation Haswell microarchitecture and Atom processor (Clover Trail) will enable the company to close its gap with ARM, as the upcoming solutions will be built based on its newer process technology and feature significantly lower power, the sources believe.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353689617421</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 11:53:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353689898688-62</Id><Title>Intel leaves Calif = Instant gain to bottom line</Title><Msg>do it!</Msg><Username>metalmeister79</Username><Timestamp>1353689898688</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 11:58:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353690181796-63</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Dumps CEO Two Years Too Late at Forbes 10:00am EST</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1353684020760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 10:20:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard that Lucy ran off with Prunoid to Brookings, OR.</Msg><Username>jeangenou_pomme_verte</Username><Timestamp>1353690181796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 12:03:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353690234541-64</Id><Topic><Title>byu now its teim</Title><Username>induxit</Username><Timestamp>1353430977054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:02:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get an id, indexit.</Msg><Username>jeangenou_pomme_verte</Username><Timestamp>1353690234541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 12:03:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353690642596-65</Id><Title>Buyers dividend at 9.50%</Title><Msg>Better hurry BUY NOW!

Intel is insanely oversold...] U.S. stocks rose solidly on Black Friday, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. Traders were encouraged by positive economic news from Germany and China, two engines of global growth. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 121 points at 12,957 after an hour of trading, on track for its best weekly percentage gain since early June. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 13 to 1,404. The Nasdaq composite index gained 31 to 2,957. German business confidence rose unexpectedly in November after six straight declines, a closely watched survey showed, raising hopes that Europe's largest economy can continue to weather the continent's financial crisis. Munich's Ifo institute said its key business climate figure rose to 101.4 in November from 100 in October. Economists had predicted a modest drop. China's manufacturing expanded for the first time in 13 months in November, the latest sign that the world's second-biggest economy is recovering from its deepest slump since the 2008 global crisis. HSBC Corp. said its monthly Purchasing Managers' Index improved to 50.4 for November. Any number above 50 indicates expansion. The PMI measures overall manufacturing activity by surveying indicators including orders, employment and production. The result was released Thursday, when the U.S. market was closed for Thanksgiving. Around the U.S., shoppers flocked to malls and logged on to computers to take part in the annual cheer-fueled retail rush known as Black Friday. Many stores opened earlier than ever. Target and Toys R Us opened on Thanksgiving evening. Retailers are also trying to draw shoppers with free layaway and shipping, by matching prices of online rivals and by beefing up mobile shopping apps. Retail is a key driver of the nation's economy. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. November and December, which can account for as much as 40 percent of a retailer's annual revenue, are crucial for stores.

Intel back to 25 before February ends and 30 is doable if a great CEO is landed along with Google Intel phones shipping in volume in America. Oh well---Guess the shorts had their day. It was a great short play--Intel from 28 to 19 something. Hats off to them all. But Intel is NOT little old AMD. Intel is a mean #$%$ nasty gut throat company which happens to have the best fabs in the world and shrinks to come in the Intel chips which will make them 50% better than any other chips made in volume on the planet. A new Young CEO--good looking--Hip---and ready to market like Stevie jobs did--is coming to Intel. Google phones shipping in Massive volume coming too (Motorola) Intel inside. Shrink to 14 nm trigate putting Intel in a position to butt pluckkk those who think Chips do not matter. I have been thinking and I think it is more likely than not that Samsung goes to Intel chips on the top end for CPUs in phones than it is that Apple will do it. Samsung uses android already and it has one goal in mind--to destroy Apple. Apple gave the finger to Intel thus getting CEO ottelini fired. The New CEO will look at Apple has the enemy and treat it like the Russian army treated the Nazi army--as a kill at any cost target. Samsung-Intel---they will make Apple ROADKILL Jobs would have never ever made this stupid move to screw Intel. He would have made the deal with Intel because he saw ahead instead of to the next quarter. Happy New Year Intel longs because when it goes over 30 in early 2013, you will be in a frrreaking good mood.

Major stock indexes closed one of their best weeks of the year. Traders were encouraged by positive economic news from Germany and China, two engines of global growth. Technology stocks soared after a few weeks of selling. And early reports from retailers suggested strong consumer spending. ‘‘Foot traffic appears heavier than we've seen in recent years, there are a lot of positive statements out of the companies themselves, and momentum appears to be strong,’’ said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at the brokerage TD Ameritrade. Many stores opened earlier than ever this year, Kinahan said, allowing for earlier informal reports about their performance. Technology stocks soared, lifting the Nasdaq composite index by more than 1 percent. Dell, chipmaker AMD and Hewlett-Packard were the top three gainers in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500. Technology rose the most among the index’s 10 industry groups. The stocks were bouncing back after confidence in tech stocks declined broadly, Kinahan said. AMD dropped sharply in recent weeks as investors fretted about its solvency. HP plunged 12 percent on Tuesday after executives said that a company HP bought for $10 billion last year lied about its finances. The Nasdaq ended up 40.30 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,966.85. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 172.79, or 1.4 percent, to 13,009.69 — the first time since election day that the Dow closed above 13,000. The S&amp;P 500 added 18.12, or 1.3 percent, to 1409.15. The rally gave the S&amp;P 500 its biggest weekly point gain since last December — 49 points, or 3.6 percent. The Dow gained 3.4 percent and the Nasdaq almost 4 percent for the week. The market closed early, at 1 p.m. EST. Stocks started strong after news that German business confidence rose unexpectedly in November after six straight declines. The gain in a closely watched index published by Munich’s Ifo institute raised hopes that Europe’s largest economy can continue to weather the continent’s financial crisis. China’s manufacturing expanded for the first time in 13 months in November, the latest sign that the world’s second-biggest economy is recovering from its deepest slump since the 2008 global crisis. HSBC Corp. said its monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index improved to 50.4 for November. Any number above 50 indicates expansion. The PMI measures overall manufacturing activity by surveying indicators including orders, employment and production. The result was released Thursday, when the U.S. market was closed for Thanksgiving. Around the U.S., shoppers flocked to malls and logged on to computers to take part in the annual cheer-fueled retail rush known as Black Friday. Target and Toys R Us welcomed buyers on Thanksgiving evening. Retailers are also trying to draw shoppers with free layaway and shipping, by matching prices of online rivals and by beefing up mobile shopping apps. Retail is a key driver of the nation’s economy. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. November and December, which can account for as much as 40 percent of a retailer’s annual revenue, are crucial for stores. The Friday after Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday because it begins the period in which many retailers turn profitable for the year. Traders will be looking for signs about how enthusiastically Americans are spending. That could reflect the momentum of the economic recovery...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353698900713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:28:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353700055446-85</Id><Topic><Title>Stocks soar on Black Friday; tech leads the way</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353698900713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:28:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell 'um, Wallus!</Msg><Username>kermit_the_hogg</Username><Timestamp>1353700055446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:47:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353701210600-86</Id><Topic><Title>Paully Capellini says Grazie</Title><Username>trappedbybears</Username><Timestamp>1144725249000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2006-04-10 23:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for your contribution to his $18.9 million 2005 "compensation".</Msg><Username>harlan_titusville</Username><Timestamp>1353701210600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 15:06:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353701355439-87</Id><Topic><Title>Stocks soar on Black Friday; tech leads the way</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353698900713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:28:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are ya havin' fun yet, Walldope?

Software--perhaps Intel products direct to come and that is all good. When Intel is making over 4 billion net a quarter by the end of 2013, will the idiots who said Intel was dead be around?

All seems to be going well. The company was initially formed by bringing together the manufacturing capabilities of a somewhat distressed processor manufacturing company Advanced Micro Devices, that was looking to go fabless, and the oil riches of the Gulf state of Abu Dhabi. Back in 2008, Abu Dhabi had a plan. The billions of dollars Abu Dhabi has provided – an investment in adapting the emirate to a post oil-economy world – that has allowed Globalfoundries (Milpitas, Calif.) to make such rapid progress. But it now seems that the time of easy money – and we are talking of well in excess of $10 billion – could be coming to an end. With talk of a future IPO of shares, Globalfoundries is entering a new phase of its existence and a reading of the runes suggests a significant change of heart in Abu Dhabi government circles. The announcement of a goal for Globalfoundries to be profitable by 2015 and a potential IPO suggests Globalfoundries' parent - the sovereign wealth investment vehicle Advanced Technology Investment Co. – wants to stop handing out cash and indeed is looking to reduce and, possibly, to eventually eliminate its stake in the chip maker. At the same time, there was no explicit mention at the time we reported on the expected IPO that of a now-moot plan to build a wafer fab in Abu Dhabi. That was expected to cost another $6 billion to $8 billion. The apparent abandonment of the Abu Dhabi fab plan suggests that the numbers aren't adding up for the wealthy emirate. Without a Middle Eastern manufacturing and technology infrastructure as an end-goal, it is hard to see how Abu Dhabi would justify continued involvement in Globalfoundries. Mike Noonen, Globalfoundries' executive vice president of worldwide marketing and sales, emphasized that profitability is the first step, and that step would allow Globalfoundries to take "control of our own destiny." That could be another way of saying that, after 2015, Globalfoundries may have to fund future wafer fabs from profits, which will be no easy matter. Already, United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), the previous No. 2 foundry, with annual revenues similar to Globalfoundries', is considering whether it can afford to keep up with the semiconductor race to smaller geometries. If a company is strategic to a nation's or a region's interest, steps can be taken to reduce the cost of capital for that company, making spending decisions much easier. But without a manufacturing foothold in Abu Dhabi, Globalfoundries looks set to be a global company that will have no one place to call home. That could be a significant disadvantage against formidable rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung or Intel.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353708271672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 17:04:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353708351004-126</Id><Topic><Title>Intel will meet/beat 4Q &amp; 2013 estimates</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1353604382132</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:13:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes you are fabricating things very well.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1353708351004</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 17:05:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353708563323-127</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Speeds Up Chip Development</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353701794091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 15:16:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Ok then quit discussing it.

The struggling part was against the high end which: "it is struggling to compete with ARM processors, including mid-range and high-end chips developed by Qualcomm and Nvidia and entry-level models offered by Taiwan-based MediaTek, according to Taiwan-based handset supply chain makers." Intel Medfield struggling against ARM platforms, say Taiwan makers Monica Chen, Taipei; Adam Hwang, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 19 September 2012] Although Intel's smartphone platform, Medfield, and has won adoption from several vendors including Orange, Motorola Mobility, Lenovo, ZTE and Lava International, it is struggling to compete with ARM processors, including mid-range and high-end chips developed by Qualcomm and Nvidia and entry-level models offered by Taiwan-based MediaTek, according to Taiwan-based handset supply chain makers. Among smartphone vendors adopting Medfield, only Lenovo and ZTE have witnessed good sales performance, but they have launched only a few Medfield models, while others have each launched only one model of smartphone equipped with Medfield processors, the sources indicated. In addition, shipments of Medfield smartphones have been in relatively small volumes, the sources pointed out. According to its roadmap, Intel will offer Atom Z2000, a processor specifically for use in inexpensive smartphones for sale in emerging markets including India, China and Russia, the sources indicated. Atom Z2000 appeals with its graphics and video/audio functions, support for Android mobile games, support for Intel XMM 6265 3G/HSPA+ data communications technology, and 2G/3G dual-SIM technology, the sources pointed out. Smartphone models equipped with Atom Z2000 are expected to be launched in early 2013, the sources noted. Although it is difficult to compete with vendors of ARM platforms for the time being, Intel is expected to keep upgrading its smartphone platforms in terms of performance, power consumption and cost through gradually using more advanced 22nm and 14nm processes, the sources pointed out.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353716894267</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:28:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353717122778-142</Id><Title>Dividend typically doubles every seven years or so</Title><Msg>Check it.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1353717122778</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:32:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353717281802-143</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith said last earnings that all focus was on 14nm</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1353706995341</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 16:43:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah they sure did not want to talk about how poor mobile is right now for them.
