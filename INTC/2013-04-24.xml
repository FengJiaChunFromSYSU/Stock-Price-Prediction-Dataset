The new Intel 3570K is really a remarkable processor. The thing that I've found most interesting is that under a full load it doesn't get over 40 degrees Celsius rendering video files for 20 minutes. This is in a 70 degree room. The motherboard also doesn't seem to heat up as well . I know it's a big whoopie as far as most of you are concerned but I look at heat generation as one of those not so often discussed criteria. Less heat to me means that the processor is running more efficiently. This can lead to longer life for hardware and in server farms less energy conscription and less cooling issues. In the bigger picture if you haven't looked at Intel's lineup recently you should take another look. For the price of an entry level iPad you can get your hands on a very compelling PC. Five years ago a $200 processor would be some forgettable Core 2 Duo processor. Even at the time you would feel underwhelmed. Today the built in video is strong enough for most of us to do without a video card. Intel is really pulling ahead when it comes to hardware, and Microsoft is holding the PC hostage with Windows 8. I really would love to see Google take a few billion dollars and really finish off Linux to be a viable competitor to Microsoft. They could make an interface that is as exciting for consumer as Android and iOS. Watching how Google Docs has evolved that may not be too far off.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366777639220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366778380179-2</Id><Topic><Title>Insight on Ivy Bridge</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366777639220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:27:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The thing that I've found most interesting is that under a full load it doesn't get over 40 degrees Celsius rendering video files for 20 minutes.

Five articles tonight.] We finally have a release date for Lenovo and world’s first Intel Clover Trail+ powered dual-core K900 Android smartphone. The phone will go on sale first in the Chinese market on May 6 and will be followed by a release in Philippines in June. There is no word on the pricing in either of the countries. Delayed by almost a month, Lenovo K900 was first showcased at Consumer Electronics Show this year. The phone comes with a 6.9 mm thick stainless steel alloy plus polycarbonate body and runs on Android 4.2. The feature-set of the phone is pretty impressive. It comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p display with Gorilla Glass 2, 13MP F1.8 camera with dual flash, front camera with an 88-degree super wide viewing angle, 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage with microSD card. Given the smartphone launches from Lenovo in the Indian market, we expect to K900 make its way to Indian shores sometime in the next few months and it would certainly be a great competitor to LG’s Optimus G Pro that is going to be released in June or July. from AnroidOS period in</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366779997532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 01:06:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366780592865-4</Id><Title>Next Stock to Explode</Title><Msg>The hottest stocks in the upcoming months will be companies with the technology to deliver any video format, over any network, to any IP connected device. Harmonic (HLIT) rose to a new 52-week high today of $6.02 and after the close reported a non-GAAP EPS loss of ($0.02) down $0.05 from a non-GAAP EPS profit of $0.03 in 2012. HLIT's trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS declined from $0.25 down to $0.20 and the stock afterhours was trading at $5.89, for a P/E ratio of 29.45. While HLIT's non-GAAP EPS declined $0.05 year-over-year, their close competitor Concurrent (CCUR) reports on April 23rd and they are expected to report GAAP EPS of $0.09 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 vs. GAAP EPS of $0.04 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 last year. CCUR's trailing non-GAAP EPS will likely rise by $0.05 next week from $0.35 up to $0.40! CCUR could have double the trailing EPS of HLIT and CCUR closed Tuesday at only $6.77! With HLIT trading for $5.89 afterhours, CCUR could make a move to double HLIT's share price or $11.78 per share! CCUR has only 8.72mm o/s, a market cap of $59.03mm, $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and an enterprise value of $34.43mm or 0.55X its trailing revenue of $62.59mm. CCUR has big gross margins of 58.81%, which are 30.69% higher than HLIT's margins of 45%. HLIT is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.93. CCUR deserves a multiple that is 30.69% higher than HLIT. This would give CCUR an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.22 and value CCUR at $11.58 per share! HLIT recently sold their low margin cable access business for $46mm. It was breaking even with $52.9mm in revenue. HLIT's cable access business sold for 0.87X revenue when it only had gross margins of 30%! CCUR's gross margins are nearly double this and CCUR is about to report their 5th straight quarter of profitability! There is no way on earth that CCUR should have an enterprise value/revenue ratio of below 1, which values CCUR at $10 even. CCUR could be ready to rally to $10+!</Msg><Username>pauslf844</Username><Timestamp>1366780592865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 01:16:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366781054699-5</Id><Title>Haswell Due in Five Weeks</Title><Msg>What an excellent time to pay $46 for a share of ARM stock and its 230 P/E ratio.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366781054699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 01:24:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366781168469-6</Id><Topic><Title>Insight on Ivy Bridge</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366777639220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:27:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey #$%$, Americans are smart enough to figure out what I said. #$%$ off eh?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366781168469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 01:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366781251684-7</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC, Intel, Altera, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, ARM, Oracle, Qualcomm, Synopsys, etc...</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1366771121926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 22:38:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Challenges of FinFET Design FinFETs are the most significant innovation in SoC devices in decades. As a result, they affect the design process in many ways, but these are often more subtle than might be expected. For example, discrete device sizing presents challenges to circuit designers, but these can be largely hidden from higher level design. FinFET extraction, on the other hand, introduces changes that RTL designers will notice kind of funny how the herd is following Intel - I did see plenty of power point schematics - I did not see one picture of FinFets ( angle, fin height distribution) - when Intel came out with 6/3/2012 Ever since the “Intel Reinvents Transistors Using New 3-D Structure” PR campaign I have been at odds with them. As technologists, I have nothing but respect for Intel. The Intel PR department, however, quite frankly, is evil. Correct me if I’m wrong here but Intel did not “reinvent” the transistor. Nor did they come up with the name Tri-Gate. If not for prior art, Intel would certainly have trademarked it, my opinion.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366781251684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 01:27:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366781711845-8</Id><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Msg>Can't wait to see what happens tomorrow.

What a jerk Intel is rumored to be charging $50 for the eDRAM adder on top of GT3, which would deliver very good margins for Intel.

NVIDIA will still likely offer better perfoming solutions, not to mention the benefits of much stronger developer relations and a longer history of driver optimization.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366819814515</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366820068187-50</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366816509289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:15:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A totally content free post from Waldork entitled technicals without one word regarding technicals.

The last recent fixed resistance point left was 23.64 and that was taken out too and notice how it quickly became firm support. All that is left now is to retrace the old resistance points of 24, 24.5, 25, 25.5, 26, 26.5,27 and then it's 28, 29 and free air. This won't happen straight away but when all the short term moving averages catch up with the current price ( e.g. 25, 50,100,150, 200 DMA) this will add to the upward pressure and force the issue.

Quote: SK Hynix said it expects DDR3L-RS memories to be specified for Ultrabook and tablet computers. The proportion of the ultrathin shipments in the laptop market is expected to be 11 percent in 2012 and 39 percent in 2014 and 52 percent in 2015, said SK Hynix referencing market research firm IHS-iSuppli as its source......... Quote Translation: Haswell will use embedded DRAM (eDRAM). And rather than source the memory from a third-party supplier, Intel will build it in-house using its own 22-nm fabrication process. Kanter apparently got his hands on the paper early, because his article includes an in-depth comparison of Intel's eDRAM and the eDRAM found inside IBM's POWER processors. My eyes glazed over a little at that point, but the main takeaway wasn't hard to grasp. Intel seems to have made some design choices that favor yields over performance and density—not entirely surprising, considering how much cheaper Haswell will be than IBM's high-end POWER CPUs. Still, Kanter expects Haswell's eDRAM to be very fast, essentially like a "bandwidth optimized L4 cache." The article also points out that Intel's (re-)entry into the memory business may pose an indirect threat to large DRAM makers like Samsung and Hynix. Intel probably won't jump into the commodity DRAM market, since the margins there are razor-thin. However, as Kanter points out, Haswell's eDRAM-equipped GT3 integrated graphics are supposed to be as fast as a discrete GeForce GT 650M—and the GT 650M often ships with a couple gigs of DDR3 RAM. Once Haswell comes out, memory makers may lose out on business from lower-end discrete GPUs like the GT 650M, since those won't be needed anymore.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366830989546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:16:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366831103383-71</Id><Title>Folks</Title><Msg>its kinda confusing. Normally when the durable goods miss like we had today would send the mkts into a tailspin; BUT the mkts both in Europe and the US didn't budge much. On the other hand the S&amp;P500 has reached its resistance as well as the Russel 2000 reached 932 its resistance and there is no sign of any pullback. There is just too much cash coming into the mkts and there is just too much complancy. All this indicates to a mkt moving higher as long as the fed is accommodative and now the Bank of Japan has joined in. But the other side of the story is that the fed is talking about raising interest rates to the tune of 2-1/4 by end 2013. Right now it is 0.25 percent. Not sure how the mkt is gonna take it in a good or bad way cause again in a good way would mean is that the economy can now sustain itself and don't need the fed no more and ofcourse the Finiancials ie the Bank stocks will benefit the most wheeas the Housing could get hit which includes construction and materials stocks. There will be money rotation but couldn't tell what would the mkts reaction. Normally in the past with interest rates hikes the mkts have tanked but this time there is a possibility it could be different. What will hit the mkts for sure is when the mkts revert back to the fundamentals ie Earnings/Revenue/Profit.

The 5.5-incher’s official release date is May 6, though pricing details remain under lock and key. According to MyDrivers (Chinese), the K900 could be made available for a mere 2,599 Yuan in China, which translates into $420, give or take a couple of bucks. That would be crazy affordable for what looks like a high-end smartphone in basically every way, from premium design to state-of-the-art hardware. Lenovo’s K900 is not just the zippiest Intel-powered smartphone to date, but, based on early benchmarks, it’s basically as powerful as all the other Android giants around. Besides the dual-core 2 GHz Intel Atom Z2580 CPU, the beast has Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, 2 gigs of RAM, a 13 MP camera, a Full HD screen and a 2,500 mAh battery as major selling points. The icing on the cake is obviously the design, with the K900 rocking a sturdy and elegant aluminum frame and at the same time measuring an incredible 6.9 mm in thickness. Too bad Lenovo is not a bigger name in the Western smartphone world, so chances are the monster will never get a stateside release.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1366832924136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:48:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366833131616-79</Id><Topic><Title>Have Noticed</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1366832194389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:36:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pain ones posting a blog on a board doesnot even make a 000.1 cent dent in a stock unless there a fund getting out of a stock so that shows U R a friggin novice with no more than half a brain cell.

Qualcomm now estimates that North American 3G/4G device sales actually declined in 2012, slipping to 199 Million units in 2012 from 200 Million units in 2011. Qualcomm is also revising its year 2013 North American device sales downwards; to 215 Million from 220 Million it previously expected. This is a pretty extraordinary development. It implies that despite the widening availabity of LTE-equipped smartphones and tablets, the North American demand is remarkably tepid. This could well have something to do with Apple ‘s growth problems in its home market; Apple’s growth in Americas slipped below 10% in the most recent quarter. One reason for disappointing North American device volumes is the US consumer preference for WiFi-only tablets. The mobile industry once dreamed about consumers flocking to tablets with LTE support. That has not happened yet. What this means for the smartphone industry is that Asia’s role in the smartphone market continues growing strongly – at the expense of North America. Qualcomm revised the China/India device volume estimate for 2013 notably, up 13 Million to 256 Million units. As recently as in 2011, North American market was still clearly ahead of China/India, by 200 Million vs. 165 Million units. But now Qualcomm is projecting that in 2013, China/India 3G device shipments will outpace North America by a huge margin; 256 Million vs. 215 Million units. Asian smartphones are cheaper on average than models sold in North America, partly due to the enormous subsidies employed by US operators.

Not only is Haswell expected to be around 10-15% faster than Ivy Bridge, but its integrated GPU is expected to double the performance of Ivy Bridge’s HD 4000 iGPU. If that wasn’t enough, Haswell was intentionally designed to optimize the power reductions afforded by Intel’s early jump to the 22nm FinFET process node — in short, Haswell should be the most efficient, high-power chip on the market, with some SKUs reaching TDPs as low as 7W, barely more than the ARM Cortex-A15. With Intel also attacking the ARM/mobile space with Bay Trail, this year could be very exciting for Intel indeed — and a horrible year for AMD and its marginalized APUs. extremetechDOTcom/computing/154192-haswell-cpu-pricing-leaks-suggests-intel-is-shifting-focus-to-low-and-mid-range</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1366850681749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 20:44:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366851223699-105</Id><Title>Amazon reportedly introducing set-top box this fall</Title><Msg>[I wonder if this set-top box will have Intel inside.

A plurality of silicon bodies are formed from a monocrystalline silicon on the substrate to define a plurality of transistors including dual-gate memory cells, PMOS transistors, and NMOS transistors. An insulative layer is formed overlying the silicon body of the memory cell. A layer of a high-k dielectric and at least a metal layer cover the silicon bodies and their overlying layers. Next, gain regions of the transistors are filled with polysilicon. Thus, a gate is formed on the top surface and both sidewalls of a tri-gate transistor. Thereafter, the high-k dielectric and the metal layer overlying the insulative layer of the memory cell are removed to expose the insulative layer. Thus, two electrically-isolated gates of the memory cell are formed. Ban, Ibrahim (Beaverton, OR, US) Chang, Peter L. D.
