FranklinComputerGhost wrote: Let me just demonstrate how Samsung’s 20% increase on the cost of those iDevice processors will affect profits this year alone. Samsung’s processor sales last year are said to be around $6 Billion in A Series chips alone. So that at 20% increase would be $1.2 Billion alone not including Apple’s Tax breaks and Duty Free benefits they will still be eligible for off Samsung’s FTZ. That’s still a straight $1.2 Billion more in Samsung’s pocket and a negative $1.2 Billion Dollars off Apple’s Net Profit margin for this year! :D Even though Apple and TSMC (who had tons of issues last year at 28nm process) are feverishly attempting right now… to not only redesign and shrink A6x for TSMC’s Engineering and Yield Plagued Gate Last 28nm process, but TSMC doesn’t even have a single line retooled and up and running. They haven’t even produced a test chip yet. Which means full ramp up of chips for new iPhone and iPad Mini models couldn’t possibly be coming off line for months. In fact they’ll be lucky to get them ramped up for a fall launch this year. That’s if everything goes right in both the redesign in Apple leased from Samsung FTZ property design lab. Oh and minus the Genius chip designer Jim “The Intel Killer” Keller. Who left to work for AMD back in July. After A6 was tested and ramped up for iPhone 5 last year. Without him… they don’t have anyone of merit, that can do what Jim did with all of Apple’s A series chips. So to say Apple could even be close to having any new iPhone or iPads lauched in JUNE is totally absurd! …and you can bet that TSMC will be charging for the retool and ramp up process, along with engineering, Yield testing, etc and charging a premium as Apple won’t have volume discounts with them yet either!!! ;p" [This guy referred to TSMCs 28nm as the "TSMC’s Engineering and Yield Plagued Gate Last 28nm process". Again, it's not exactly a secret that TSMC had ramp problems at 28nm and it's extremely likely they will have more at 20nm as each process is more and more complicated. Russ Fisher doesn't think TSMC will have volume production on 20nm until 2015, which is a reasonable assumption if they don't begin production until 2014. Of course this would be a total and complete disaster for both TSMC and Apple if they continue down this path...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361078440169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 00:20:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361079294733-3</Id><Topic><Title>Note to board: BEWARE of WALLISWEAVER</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361061711010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 19:41:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"beware of WALLISWEAVER, GETANID61" never thought I'd be grouped with Wallis... but I'll play... find one post of mine you think is incorrect... you can answer from any of your numerous aliases...

Tegra 3 (which is large by ARM standards) is smaller (@40nm) than Clovertrail (32nm). The Tegra 3 has 5 A9's V the 2 hyperthreaded Atom cores in Clovertrail. By the time we get to 14nm, both Intel and the ARM collective will have 2 arch. changes, so the relative size of the CPU cores will change. There are other factors such as the increasing size of the GPU. The other thing to remember is that Intel's measuring standards are different from the foundries.

Windows based anti-virus software is the biggest scam since mortgage derivatives and big banks participate in this scam because they don't want the public to know how risky it is to do online banking from one's PC because the banks are busy closing thousands of branches and laying off staff across the country to increase profits. The truth is that banks are very aware that the client's PC is the weak link in banking security because Windows-based anti-virus software is ineffective against the new malware that facilitates "Account Takeover" - which means the cybercriminal empties your account. The security research Imperva recently released a study that showed that the best Windows anti-virus software can only even detect about 5% of new malware. That means 95% of malware attacks are going undetected. It's no wonder bank fraud is rampant. And despite bold marketing claims extolling the virtues of their security, the vendors have virtually no chance of ever getting ahead of cybercriminal's ability to make newer malware. There is a very effective solution however. It is specifically designed to protect online banking and it's free. Its design as a trusted and verifiable on-demand mini-OS, called CyberShield-OS, that one uses just for banking. Every bank session loads a perfect copy of the software, and it isolates one's bank session from Windows, which is crucial in protecting the user from contamination. There are additional security features but beyond the scope of this post. One can learn more about this solution and download the software for free at cybershieldsolutionsdotcom. There are also video tutorials that explain the technology and show how to use it. Today, the banks mantra is "keep your anti-virus updated" knowing it is woefully inadequate. When the account holder does get hacked the bank can then say, "guess your anti-virus software wasn't updated" and blame the client for the loss. Good luck to all.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1361134249919</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 15:50:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361135598770-41</Id><Topic><Title>Intel - Outspending and Outgunning Rivals</Title><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1361129497576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 14:31:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did you get a link to post here? :)</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1361135598770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 16:13:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361136340673-42</Id><Title>Getting Chippy Out There</Title><Msg>And it's no surprise.

One analyst thinks so Apple's lack of innovation with the iPad could leave the door open to new PC form factors such as ultrabook systems, says one analyst. Citibank analyst Glen Yeung believes that Apple needs to do more than make its flagship tablet lighter, thinner, and faster if it is to not become vulnerable to new classes of PCs. "We believe Apple will launch an iPad Mini Retina and a thinner/lighter iPad5 (both likely sporting newer processors) in 3Q13 … iPad innovation of this nature is insufficient to reverse share loss," wrote Yeung in a note to clients earlier this week, reports CNET. "Whereas we see limited innovation in tablets in 2H13, we see growing innovation in PCs. The growing presence of touch-based, ultrathin, all-day notebooks at improving price points (e.g., Intel requires all Haswell-based Ultrabooks to have touch and envisions price-points as low as $599) could create competition for 10" tablets not fully anticipated by the market." Haswell is a new line of processors that Intel plans to launch in June. They are be built using the same 22-nanometer process and the 3D tri-gate technology as Ivy Bridge chips, but will deliver performance per clock and lower power consumption. This makes them perfect for use in mobile devices powered by a battery.

And future earnings are to a very large extent all about fabrication. Intel's fabrication has reliable economics, is based on FinFET and the roadmap extends all the way down to 5nm. ARMs future on the other hand is substantially unknown because its fabrication roapmap essentially ends at 20nm. ARM doesn't have FinFET and not even 20nm production yet. In fact, 28nm still isn't close to being fully ramped and everyone believes ARM will be at 28nm for a substantial part of its production for years and years. ARM is attempting to implement a half-step to 14nm FinFET because it is clearly losing the fabrication race and also because its 20nm planar only offers limited performance improvements at a significantly increased cost. No one knows if it will be successful or when. The bottom line is that Intel will have volume production on 14nm for at least two years while the bulk of ARM is still at 28nm. This represents a two process node lead that will have huge implications in the marketplace. It means that Intel has a bright fabrication, financial and economic future while ARM fades to black. Here are 16 solid, factual, confirmable reasons why Intel's bright fabrication future should result in the company having a higher P/E ratio than ARM: 1.) Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361150932986</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 20:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361151183770-60</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Web TV Getting Some Positive Spin</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360809161308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 21:32:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My 2 cents on the topic – Intel makes money by selling chips. Studios make money be selling content. ISPs/Cable companies make money by providing the means of transmission. And there are others in that chain (e.g., T.V manufacturers). Intel is not a competitor to studios or cable companies. In contrast, Apple essentially burned record companies by buying music from then for cheap and then re-selling it, making a ton of money. The entertainment industry (content producers) won’t make that mistake again, which is why “Apple TV” is going nowhere. Amazon makes money by re-selling content they buy from studios. They are a middle-man. So is Netflix – a largely non-value added re-selling intermediary. Intel’s interest is in selling chips – they want Intel chips in every living room in the US. Intel’s interests could, if they work things right with producers/studios, and cable companies, develop some tools that could benefit everyone – studios, cable companies, Intel. How? We’ll have to wait and see. Bottom-line – Intel is not a competitor to content producers or cable companies, but a possible value-added partner. Possible value-added. We’ll see.</Msg><Username>clcellve</Username><Timestamp>1361151183770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 20:33:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361151411989-61</Id><Topic><Title>RC delay</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1360911753483</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 02:02:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree, but a blatant plug for LRCX warrants a plug for AMAT technology -------------------------------- The Black Diamond II nano-porous low-k film is the industry standard for the 45/32nm copper/low-k interconnects, with a k-value of approximately 2.5.

In the meantime the ARM Bubble continues its descent into the land of sharp objects. Intel's 10nm production - now that's a very sharp object...] Intel's Israeli subsidiary more than doubled its exports in 2012 to $4.6 billion and is seeking to bring manufacturing of the company's next generation of chips to Israel. Intel's exports, which rose 109 percent from $2.2 billion in 2011, were boosted by the start of production of chips using 22 nanometre technology at its Kiryat Gat plant in southern Israel, which is now operating at full capacity. Intel, the world's No. 1 chipmaker, will build chips over the next two to three years with features measuring just 14 nm in Ireland and the United States but the company is already thinking about where it will produce 10 nm chips. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. Intel Israel executives said they would like to see 10 nm production in Israel. "The average life of a technology is two to six years so we need to be busy to get the next technology, 10 nanometre," Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told a news conference on Sunday. "We need to get a decision far enough in advance to be able to upgrade the plant. So for 10 nanometre, decisions will need to be made this year."
