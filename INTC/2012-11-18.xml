Remember that INTC has been swimming against this tablet fashion tide since iPad was introduced in 2010 but actual results defied the critics so the stock hit $29 regardless. What has happened lately is that Windows 8 and all the new different form factors caused a pause in PC inventory buying and the critics returned to hammer the stock down. Results have to start surprising on the upside again for the stock to rebound as nobody is pricing any hype or hope into this stock. I expect Q42013 to be the best quarter Intel ever had but there maybe results before then that turn the tide back again. Clovertrail is an absolute killer Windows 8 tablet processor and 10W Haswell will make the current Ultrabooks much more desirable so it's a question of how fast Intel can ramp these two new processors to add incremental revenue to its core business to convince the ANALysts INTC is a growth company again. Remember also that all stocks have been hammered since the election due the fiscal cliff stalemate, once that has been resolved all stocks will recover to the extent that the next great Bull market starts IMO. It's always darkest before the dawn, between now and the end of the year is the time to pick up any stocks you have had your eye on.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353231767189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 04:42:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353244151207-4</Id><Title>Marsavian</Title><Msg>I'm not calling you out at all, just a question.

I said at the time Intel would have to increase its performance/power by a factor of 2 with Medfield to be competitive against ARM chips and they more than delivered. Once Medfield appeared it was obvious it would be a player but not the knockout blow a lot of you thought due to the early Intel PR. Again balance in the discussion was needed which I helped to bring. However no more caution is required as ARM has showed its hand with A15 and there is so much low hanging fruit to be had with 22nm Silvermont on both the architecture and process front that it won't fail to be a compelling phone chip, probably taking the performance/power crown from Apple's A6.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353257848414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 11:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353257852409-7</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL fall from high is comparable to INTC's</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1353175958589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 13:12:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not talking about all-time highs...those are meaningless.

Intel will not only release its next generation "Haswell" chips (which should enable thinner, longer lasting laptops and even very powerful tablets), but it will start to ship its dual core Atom SoC for smartphones paired with its LTE modem. Further, we will get a look at just how Windows 8 tablets are performing in the market place (Intel owns this space, and Windows RT machines simply aren't selling that well). Further, Intel will continue to aggressively push its way into the server market (in which it commands a staggering lead as it is) by expanding further into the HPC market (with its newly released Xeon Phi), as well as its 22nm refresh of its server chips ("Ivy Bridge EP/EX"), which should not only drive refreshes in the big-iron X86 space (in particular the "EX" model), but also in workstations and networking. All of this with a by-then mature 22nm process that will enable smaller chips and better gross margins. Finally, the end of 2013 will give us a glimpse into the next generation "Silvermont" processor and the accompanying system-on-chip solutions for smartphones, tablets, etc. This is a ground-up redesign of the Atom core (the current one in smartphones/tablets is five years old, and still is faster/more power efficient than most of the ARM processors, although many people seem to ignore raw technical data for what the media likes to perpetuate) that, given Intel's strength in designing efficient CPUs (compounded further by what is enabled by being on a fundamentally superior process node) should put to bed any doubts that Intel can compete effectively in this space.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353279969015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 18:06:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353280254576-22</Id><Topic><Title>Why are all the insiders still selling?

While the first half of 2012 was filled with analyst praise for its growing revenues, clearly defined mobile strategy (first given at the analyst day in May 2011), and fabrication advantage, the second half has not been so kind. Media pundits, who were calling the stock a "screaming buy" earlier this year, are now vehemently spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt. For example, CNBC's Jim Cramer, on a recent edition of his popular show "Mad Money," had this to say about Intel: It has a good yield but no products being used by mobile products. I'm saying don't buy. I believe that this statement - likely to be taken to heart by a good majority of the investment public - is misleading. In fact, not only is this misleading, it's patently false, as Intel's latest Atom Z2760 tablet chip will be featured in no less than 20 very thin and light tablet design wins. Further, the company's Atom Z2460 is already powering smartphones that offer better performance and battery life characteristics than many of its ARM (ARMH) based competitors. In fact, over the last several months - especially after last month's Intel Developer Forum - Intel's mobile strategy has become quite clear. In this article, I hope to explain just how clever its mobile strategy really is, and why it will be a dominant force in the smartphone and tablet spaces going forward. Attacking From Above - Core Intel has been relentless over the last few years about pursuing power efficiency on its notebook, desktop, and server chips. Each iteration of its processors has focused on improving performance in an incredibly power efficient manner. In fact, the "rule of thumb" for Intel's micro-processor design teams is that a feature can only be added if, for every 1% increase in power consumption, the design gains a 2% increase in performance. To this end, we have seen lower power chips with higher performance in each generation. A combination of clever circuit design, strong micro-architectural decisions, tighter platform integration, sensible instruction set extensions, and process technology leadership has allowed Intel to fit significantly greater performance within ever-decreasing power envelopes. In fact, as demonstrated at the Intel Developer Forum this September, an 8W "Haswell" will provide the same performance as a 17W "Ivy Bridge" - even built on the same transistor technology (22nm tri-gate). So, with the firm's upcoming "Haswell" able to fit into an 8W thermal design power, the implication here is quite clear: Intel intends to use its high-end "Core" processors in thin and light tablet and convertible form factors within a generation or two (14nm + further integration should whack the TDP down even more). The "Core" product line will be the high end, high performing, and high margin offerings for everything from tablets to high end desktops. Attacking From Below - Current Atom Manages To Compete Now, the more interesting part of the Intel mobile equation is the "Atom" line of systems-on-chip. While the high end "Core" line will be very power efficient for their performance levels going forward, the "Atom" has traditionally been the company's "low power, low end" solution. Unfortunately, the emphasis here has been on "low end." Since introducing the first "Atom" processor in 2008, the core has not fundamentally changed, while the higher end cores have been getting refinement after refinement under the "tick-tock" strategy. As a result, the competition (ARM Holdings and its various licensees) was able to produce very competitive designs on the performance/watt front by employing more modern micro-architectural techniques such as out-of-order execution. In tests, Intel's current "Medfield" and "Clover Trail" system-on-chip designs are actually still quite a bit ahead of the shipping ARM-based designs today such as the Nvidia (NVDA) Tegra 3, the Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon S4, and even the custom designed Apple (AAPL) "Swift" (performance data here). It even does so while being quite power efficient. In fact, according to the aforementioned Anandtech review of the iPhone 5, At least based on this data, it looks like Intel is the closest to offering a real competitor to Apple's own platform from a power efficiency standpoint. [...] I can't stress enough that the x86 power myth has been busted at this point.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353280949464</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 18:22:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353281145209-24</Id><Topic><Title>Why are all the insiders still selling?

The Technology Trader column said: As Barron's said a month ago in our cover story on the future of the PC ("Bye-Bye, PCs," Oct. 22), the winds are blowing ill these days for the traditional computing business. Signs of that change continue to mount, and as they do, stocks at the heart of the PC business become cheaper and cheaper. Microsoft trades for eight times next year's earnings; Intel (INTC) trades for 10 times next year's earnings, Dell (DELL) fetches a little over five times, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), an astoundingly low 3.7 times, and disk-drive makers Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), just under five times. Are any of these stocks worth dipping in a toe? Probably not. The latest sign of the slide in the PC world was Dell's fiscal third-quarter report last Thursday, in which revenue missed analysts' expectations. The worst part of the report was the part that touched on PC demand. Consumer revenue fell by 23%, while sales of "mobility" products, primarily laptop computers, fell by 26%. Plenty of other anecdotal evidence points to the rise of the non-PC world. Networking-equipment vendor F5 Networks (FFIV) told analysts on Thursday at its annual investment forum that by 2020, 71% of all computing work done by individuals will be "mobile or Web-based."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353283919456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 19:11:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353287716306-27</Id><Topic><Title>Projections for the Week Ahead</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353278497878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 17:41:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL... let's sure hope not....</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1353287716306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353290401241-28</Id><Topic><Title>BARRONS SAYS AVOID INTEL</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1353279228991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 17:53:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft has a forward P/E of 8.19 while Intel has a forward P/E of 10.25. If we think that smartphones and tablets are replacing PC's then Windows 8 Phone is currently being chosen by several smartphone makers. And Windows RT is available for ARM tablets. Then Intel has single-core Clovertrail Atom processors for Phones and dual-core Clovertrail Atom processors for tablets. And Intel is better represented on server computers than Microsoft. This is all in addition to the traditional PC market except to say the PC processors are currently going to lower energy use and that could be a very dramatic fundamental.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1353290401241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 21:00:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353290821357-29</Id><Topic><Title>BARRONS SAYS AVOID INTEL</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1353279228991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 17:53:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's a PC example: Photoshop Elements will run on an Intel Clovertrail Atom tablet.
