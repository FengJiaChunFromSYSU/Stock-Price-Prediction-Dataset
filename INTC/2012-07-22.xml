There is no way you can know that everything is legal with Romney returns anymore that you can say that my returns are legal. The returns may be perfectly legal. You can say that everything is legal. Mitt was probably aggressive about the decisions made to minimize tax liability. Fine. Very few people know about the Romney taxes. None of those people are posting on this message board. The Romney taxes could be clean and have no issues at all. One or more years of the Romney taxes could be in active audit by the IRS, or in some stage of dispute/resolution. The IRS will not disclose these procedures. Only Romney could release any information on problems. I would much rather Mitt stop attributing McCain quotes to Obama, than to bother with the taxes.</Msg><Username>mitt_flop</Username><Timestamp>1342936267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 01:51:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342941144000-3</Id><Topic><Title>14 nm "Broadwell" A True System-on-Chip (SoC</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1342885690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 11:48:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I know yoo don't like the architecture - stop whining ..." got it, you don't have an answer other than integration...

I have yet to hear a single thing that Romney would do differently. Cutting taxes doesn't create jobs and there isn't any trickle down. Exactly what's the plan??? And why is it that no Republicans seem to have any ideas on how to create jobs or fix the economy? The only idea that Republicans have is to oppose every single thing that Obama proposes.

Intel has set aside $300m to market ultrabooks that have svelt designs and promise all day battery life, two factors that should make the units popular with punters. However IDC says that consumers are shunning ultrabooks, favouring smartphones and tablets instead of buying ultrabooks that look very much like four year old Apple Macbook Air laptops. IDC wasn't very keen on ultrabooks, saying that the market is sensitive to prices - meaning that vendors will have to cut prices to tempt punters. The firm said the impending launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 will see OEMs push revamped ultrabook designs. Intel's ultrabook drive isn't all about marketing, with the firm championing with its own money the use of solid-state drives and better screens in laptops. Even with Intel's millions spent, the biggest problem is that companies such as Dell, with its impressive XPS 13 ultrabook, simply cannot undercut the equally impressive Macbook Air. Previously NPD said that ultrabooks were gaining popularity in the US premium laptop market, accounting for 15 per cent of laptops sold that cost more than $700. However it seems that IDC's European data suggests that laptop makers are not enjoying the same sort of success across the Atlantic. µ The Inquirer (http://s.tt/1iu2G)</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342983267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:54:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342986212000-21</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL DOOM:IDC says European consumers are shunning ultrabooks</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342983267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:54:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, have you checked out the price of that "equally impressive" Apple MacBook Air?

Adding the "INTEL DOOM" to the Inquirer article defines one level of negative filtering. The London based Inquirer might have a nationalistic filter that favors good news for the home town team. IDC says a number of things in their press release. The quote in question says that consumers seem to be waiting for the Intel promised price points and overall spending is slowing in Europe. Not a surprise and not unexpected. The first batches of Ultrabooks will be much more attractive to businesses for their company refereshes. The security and protection features of the Ultrabook have value to companies but not as much to consumers. "New ultra-book and ultra-slim products have come to market, but consumer spending continues to be geared toward other devices, tablets or phones, and the market remains very price sensitive or in a "wait and see" mode and therefore more receptive to lower price points for the time being. However, the Windows 8 launch in October, combined with the expected push from vendors on ultra-slim models, will help revive consumer traction and drive a rebound during the back-to-school and Christmas seasons."

He has five military age pro-war pusswad sons none of which have done any military service. 4. Hid millions of dollars in a secret Swiss bank account and failed to pay income tax on the interest. 5. Has an enormous $100 million + IRA account that no one can explain. 6. Ran Bain Capital whose main objectives were to maximize profits and minimize taxes no matter how many American jobs were shipped off shore. 7. Has no explanation for his 'retroactive resignation' at Bain Capital. 8. Implemented 'Romneycare' in Mass. which includes a mandate that carries a much higher penalty than 'Obamacare'. So far, what we 'little people' know about Slick Willard isn't very supportive for a presidential candidate. Maybe he should start talking a little bit more when the press asks him questions. Oh wait, the press has a 'liberal bias' so he should just clam up. This man will either withdraw from the race or will get cornholed bigtime in November.</Msg><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343002391000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343009800000-38</Id><Topic><Title>What we know about Romney...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343002391000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>List-tastic!</Msg><Username>aapljack</Username><Timestamp>1343009800000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343012138000-39</Id><Topic><Title>What we know about Romney...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343002391000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you people insist on cluttering a message board about an EQUITY with politics?

Whenever analysts mention the sales of tablets, the only numbers that are published are that of the iPad sales. We don't hear much if any of other tablet makers. How about the Motorola Xoom numbers, or the Samsung Galaxy tablet numbers, or the Vizio tablet sales, or any of the other tablet makers that all use ARM based processors. So are tablets successful because they are a great new alternative to the PC or is the success of the iPad alone being use to make a case for the so called cannibalization of the PC. The facts currently are that PC sales are near 400 million units a year and still expected to grow. The percentage of growth may seem small but the quantity in growth is still very large. If all the tablet sales other than the iPad grew by 100%, that would be a growth of 5 to 10 million units. But if the sales of the PC and tablets grew by a mere 5%, that would be over 20 million unit growth. So other than Apple's initial success of anything that they build, it remains to be seen if tablets are becoming an alternative to the PC. I for one do not think so. The largest and greatest chip maker, Intel, recently said that they have 20 design wins for tablets. Yet they have over 140 design wins for the Ultrabook. That fact alone seems to suggest that thin and high performance laptops may be more desireable amongst the masses than tablets. If the tablet form factor was more desireable than the desktop or the laptop, or more recently, the Ultrabook, then other tablet makers would have seen great success in sales as the iPad has seen. Tablets are very new. And the iPad is cannibalizing other tablet makers and video game makers, such as Sony and Nintendo. The iPhone has caused most damage against other smartphone makers such as Rimm or Nokia. I could verifiably say that the iPhone did not cannibalize laptop sales and can confidently say that the iPad will not cannibalize laptops as well.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343014297000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:31:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343014610000-41</Id><Topic><Title>How successful are tablets?</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343014297000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:31:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The IPad was pitched as the internet in your hands.
