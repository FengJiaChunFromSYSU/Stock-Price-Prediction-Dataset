Aside from the benchmark results outlined above, the Medfield entry offered a marginally faster response to most actions. Powering up both phones, the RAZR i landed at its home screen around 12 seconds ahead of the Snapdragon sibling. Loading into the Chrome browser was around the same speed on both, likewise the camera app -- both launching and capture -- was equally swift on both. In addition to this admirable performance, we were interested to see how Intel's mobile chip fared in terms of battery life -- with the Motorola RAZR M sharing screen similarities and more, we can make a better judgement on whether those promises stand up. On our battery rundown -- video playback, 50 percent brightness, WiFi and 3G on, social networks and email on sync -- Intel's iteration lasted nine hours, compared with eight hours for the RAZR M. That's a marginal victory, but as with the LTE version, we were more impressed with how the phone managed to go the distance on typical or mildly intensive use. Ultimately, we never felt the need to seek out a charging port during a day's work. Intel continues to march out better handsets -- the RAZR i is a more accomplished, more premium handset than the San Diego, although we're still waiting for Intel to step up and power a flagship device. Perhaps once it's got the LTE compatibility sorted, we'll see the chip maker power bigger (and probably pricier) handsets. The 2GHz Medfield processor dishes out performance that you'd be hard pressed to distinguish from many Snapdragon-powered dual-core phones in day-to-day use. Elsewhere, the RAZR i is just as accomplished as its trans-Atlantic twin. It bests plenty of existing middleweight smartphones like the Xperia P, with solid hardware, a breezy (borderline vanilla) UI and a surprisingly decent camera. Expect the greatest screen or the fastest performance and you're likely to be a little disappointed, but at this upper-middle price point -- and free on several modest contracts here in the UK -- the RAZR i is easy to recommend, especially if bigger phones are an ergonomic no-go.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1349697182927</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 07:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349697700057-5</Id><Title>Intel took 0.2 percent smartphone unit shipment share in 1H 2012</Title><Msg>techcrunchDOTcom/2012/10/05/report-intel-gained-just-0-2-of-smartphone-chip-market-in-1h-as-qualcomm-milked-lte-lead</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1349697700057</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349701993905-6</Id><Title>Lines in Apple stores insane, also 10 million Ipad mini's ordered to make for holidays</Title><Msg>Who's Intel's Daddie?</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1349701993905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349702497870-7</Id><Title>Intel unveils "MILSTEAD"</Title><Msg>Intel unveils Atom processor-based network-attached storage platform By Shawn Knight On October 8, 2012, 7:30 AM EST Intel has unveiled an Atom processor-based platform designed with network-attached storage (NAS) devices in mind. It’s called Milstead and uses existing Atom D2500 and D2550 chips to power personal cloud systems for individual or small business use. Both of these processors are dual-core 10W TDP parts although the D2550 features hyper threading and a marginally faster GPU. Atom-based NAS’ will support Windows and Linux with cross-platform file sharing and up to six SATA drives with hot-plug capability. Interestingly enough, one of the Asustor NAS systems highlighted on Intel’s page shows eight drive bays. Capacity can be expanded via USB should the need arise. The chip maker says up to 14 additional storage drives can be connected via USB. The platform is already available from companies like Asustor, QNAP and Thecus with other vendors working on solutions to release in the near future. Intel points out that Mpstor and Dane-Elec have developed an optimized storage stack for small business customers. The platform has integrated support for digital readouts while dual display support (HDMI and / or VGA) can help to lower bill of material costs. A maximum of 4GB of main memory can be added to each system. We’d expect Gigabit Ethernet to come standard although the press material didn’t mention network connectivity specifics. If you have a small business or are looking to set up a personal cloud in your home but don’t want to build a system yourself, Intel’s off-the-shelf solution might be worth looking into.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1349702497870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:21:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349702565707-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel took 0.2 percent smartphone unit shipment share in 1H 2012</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1349697700057</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not the start, it's the growth rate, dufus.

IHS (El Segundo, Calif.) said foundries likely began seeing a reduction in orders for future sales during the third quarter. While demand for advanced technology will continue to drive overall revenue growth within the industry, IHS predicted that foundries will being to feel the effects of external influences—such as a deteriorating global economy. Pure play foundry sales grew by 16 percent in the second quarter to reach $7.8 billion, IHS said. But growth began to slow in the third quarter, with sales reaching an estimated $8.3 billion, up 8 percent from the second quarter, the firm said. From EETimes IHS projects that pure play foundry sales will decline by 5 percent in the fourth quarter to $7.9 billion. Foundry sales typically decline in the fourth quarter after peaking in the third quarter. What is unusual about this year is that pure play foundry sales grew by a higher percentage in the second quarter than the third, the firm said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349703273191</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349703491154-13</Id><Title>Intel pushes Atom for 'personal cloud'</Title><Msg>Intel Corp. is pushing some of its latest Atom processors for use in network-attached storage (NAS) devices that deliver "personal cloud" storage to small businesses and consumers. Intel Thursday (Oct. 4) launched an Atom-based storage platform combining multimedia capabilities, energy efficiency and performance for NAS devices. The platform, based on the Atom D2550 or Atom D2500, is billed as a solution for small businesses and consumers grappling with exploding storage needs in a secure, accessible way. "With the huge number of devices coming out, from traditional laptops—which have been with us for decades—to tablets to smartphones, the opportunities for consuming data are huge," said David Tuhy, general manager of Intel's storage division, at a briefing here Thursday. There are already NAS devices using previous generations of Atom on the market. But with the launch of its Atom-based storage platform Thursday, Intel trotted out new NAS systems using it made by customers Asustor, QNAP and Thecus. More firms are expected to launch systems based on the platform in the near future, Intel said. NAS devices are file-level computer data storage systems that connect to a computer network. According to Intel, the devices provide small businesses like retailers and medical and legal offices with on-site solutions to store data that can be accessed both locally and remotely. Using them, businesses are able to provide employees with a "personal cloud" they can access from any connected device. NAS devices also serve as a handy way to back up crucial data, Tuhy said. Intel markets its higher-end Xeon processors for bigger data storage applications like servers. But, for NAS devices, which typically have two or four hard drives, Atom offers sufficient capability, Tuhy said. "We think we have a really compelling price point solution with Atom in this category," Tuhy said. The market for NAS devices is expected to be worth more than $6 billion by 2014, according to IDC. Intel said its Atom-based storage solution features built-in hardware acceleration for HD content (video surveillance and playback as well as media playback), support for multiple operating sytems, including Microsoft Windows and Linux, and support for software-based RAID data safeguards so that files are recoverable even if a hard-drive fails. The solution also offers scalable I/O connectivity to support four to six SATA drives with hot-plug capability of up to 14 USB ports and integrated support for digital display and dual display, as well as up to 4 GB of main memory.

This is a great showing for x86 on its first serious attempt at a phone chip (45nm Moorestown was still a WIP in hindsight). 2) It can be reasonably expected that Silvermont will have greater overall performance/power by virtue of both being a 2nd generation design which starts using some low hanging fruit like going to out of order instruction processing and also by using the new advanced and tuned 22nm LP trigate SoC process. The latter will allow Intel to match ARM core for core in the same power envelope while still retaining the performance advantage of hyperthreading which will mean double the threads in the same power envelope. 3) Being an IDM over using a foundry only really matters if you can't get a high enough asp for your finished product. A case in point is TI's OMAP4 which sells for $13.5 in the Kindle Fire. TI can't make this profitably when designs and foundry costs are taken into account which is why it is exiting the business. The $21 Tegra 3 is hardly any better as that division has never made a profit and is being continually supported by Nvidia's gpu divisions. androidauthorityDOTcom/revamped-google-nexus-7-3g-32-gb-120157 This where Intel's n-1 IDM generation will show its true strengths as I believe Intel could pump out $10 Medfields at cost price on fully depreciated 32nm FABs which have already been paid for by Sandy Bridge. When 32nm Medfield becomes Intel's lowend when 22nm Silvermont is introduced it will be the new performance/price king at the low end as Silvermont becomes the new high profit performance/watt king at the high end. The first will gain market-share while the second will bring in the profits. This double pronged attack will ultimately mean only Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung and Intel (and maybe Nvidia if it gets its act together) will be the last ones left standing in any high volume Smartphone future. The true benefit of 32nm Medfield has yet to be revealed, 2013 will show that as it coexists along 22nm Silvermont in cheaper phones.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1349710564410</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:36:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349711301416-40</Id><Topic><Title>Hottest Penny Stock Picks!</Title><Username>treasargp326286</Username><Timestamp>1349708942099</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:09:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very informative.

The phones nowadays have become so fast that speed is no longer the major differentiating factor that it was in PC days and in early mobile phone days. Intel is going to face a tough sell on its home turf which is speed. If you look at the way Apple markets its iPhone, they don't even mention the clock frequency of their chips. In such a market, pitching a "faster" chip will not be easy. Both Samsung and Apple have a history of making smart phones. Their overall experience and expertise is what differentiates them, not the speed of their chips. It's a little too much to expect a reference design to compete with a well executed product. Reference designs are for nibbling at the tail end of the market.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1349717615759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349718819896-60</Id><Title>SMELLTEL IN ITS OWN BEAR MARKET</Title><Msg>Down 23% from last spring's high.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1349718819896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:53:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349719954551-61</Id><Topic><Title>What INTC Shareholders Do Not Know</Title><Username>hooddavenport245</Username><Timestamp>1349699580111</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:33:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More more and more articles please.</Msg><Username>flynnacosta69</Username><Timestamp>1349719954551</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:12:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349721029194-62</Id><Topic><Title>You should read this profile</Title><Username>peggieejcc54510</Username><Timestamp>1349712246476</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 12:04:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just joined.</Msg><Username>aracelypzjy66991</Username><Timestamp>1349721029194</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349721090941-63</Id><Topic><Title>Repost from Kitchedee and I have the same question</Title><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1349715315757</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 12:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>khitchdee.......if Intel had no chance of succeeding in Mobile, why do you spend most of your life here if you aren't worried one bit ????</Msg><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1349721090941</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:31:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349721244171-64</Id><Topic><Title>SMELLTEL IN ITS OWN BEAR MARKET</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1349718819896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet it's still more than 10% higher than when you sold it and almost 20 percent higher than the stock you sold it for TWO YEARS AGO.

Going by their past record, they don't seem to have the staying power to wait it out for their time. e.g. Look at what happened with XScale. If they hadn't sold it off to Marvell when they did and stuck with it, today, they could have been supplying most of the mobile gadget market with ARM based chips. Instead we have today's scenario where a big scheme is being played out under the low power IA banner. How long they'll stick with it is anybody's guess.

The issue here is functionality not speed. Manufacturers keep adding functions to cell phones. This in turn makes chips bigger. To keep the chip the same size you have to shrink the die size. So Intel has a huge advantage here. Manufactures who use Intel will be able to add a lot more functionality than those who don't. Going forward this will be more and more of an advantage as Intel takes its fabrication where ARM can't follow. If you say that no one is adding functionality then you simply don't have any knowledge of cell phone developments. Additionally, the processor market is large and getting larger. This idiocy about Intel not being able to sell state-of-the-art technology is just that. ARM customers who can't get 28nm would love to be able to get 22nm from Intel. At this point Intel has no reason to sell to them. Processors are going into more and more things every day. The internet and cloud aren't going away. More servers are needed every day. And the Internet of Things is just getting cranked up. Intel will have a role and market share in all of this. And they will constantly grow market share in mobility. Intel's huge advantage with its WiFi chip development will accentuate their moves into mobility. Intel has prepared intensively for two years to eat ARM's lunch. Now it is starting to happen and the trend will increase dramatically in 2013. While the foundries were sitting on their thumbs Intel was building 22nm and 14nm capacity. But here is what is really critical. Tablet and cell phone companies are working on designs that are one to three years out and having to make decisions about which processors to use. Those decisions are being made now. And these people are bright enough to see the danger in going with non-Intel chips. It means they won't be state-of-the-art where their competitors will. What do you want to bet that some of these discussions aren't happening at this very moment? I'm thinking that's a major reason why Intel is so quiet these days. They are probably hammering out the agreements that will deliver up huge business to Intel based on 14nm technology. The only companies that will be on 14nm in 2014 will be those talking to Intel today. You think Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and a host of other ARM shops don't know this? You think they are going to bet the survival of their companies on TSMC and 28nm production? Think again...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349725713536</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349726056532-78</Id><Title>Next Piece of the Low Power Puzzle</Title><Msg>The next piece of the low power puzzle is the tablet space, and that's what the Atom Z2760 is for.

Further, Intel claims that power consumption is significantly better than the latest generation iPad, slightly worse than the iPad 2, and slightly better than the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity.

In particular, Rasgon posits that Intel has had a better mix of SKUs in recent years, with lower consumer sales and more corporate sales, and a shift to the higher end of its processor lineup, and that things could shift back the other way, unfavorably: Solid success from their “Good/Better/Best” strategy around Core i3/5/7 products. In fact, the company has seen significant mix shift toward Core i5 […] We believe there is material risk of Intel’s notebook SKU distribution shifting back in favor of Core i3 products over the next 12-18 months given a push to bring Ultrabooks down to true mainstream price points (almost all of which so far utilize Core i3 processors) […] We believe such a mix shift could drive a 7-10% decline in mainstream notebook ASPs for Intel in 2013. Rasgon is modeling a decline in average selling price from $94.17 this year to $88.84 next year, and $85 in 2013, and slightly higher if one excludes sales of the cheaper “Atom” line of processors. He’s modeling shipment growth of 2.4% this year, excluding Atom, and 2% next year. That leas to revenue this year of $53.92 billion and revenue next year of $54.22 billion, and gross margin of 62% this year and 60.5% next year. Rasgon points out that he’s not negative about the current quarter. In fact, his estimate, $13.23 billion and 49 cents a share, which is about in line with the Street. For Q4, he’s modeling $14.29 billion and 60 cents, which is actually higher than the consensus $13.8 billion and 55 cents. Rather, “this call is on longer term fundamental trends that we see impacting Intel over the next year which should lead to underperformance in the stock.” Rasgon maintains an Outperform rating on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares, arguing “Here we have the curious situation that arises often in investing – namely, separating good companies from good stocks. Intel is certainly the former but may not be the latter; AMD (while certainly risky) may be, we believe, the reverse.”</Msg><Username>romekay</Username><Timestamp>1349728805293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:40:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349728829089-95</Id><Topic><Title>It's getting killed in the after hours...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1349727121219</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:12:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read that Barrons article, however he still rates INTC a buy interestingly enough..</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1349728829089</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349728972110-96</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Bernstein Says Sell, ASPs Set to Decline</Title><Username>romekay</Username><Timestamp>1349728805293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:40:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That guy's an idiot... rating intel underperform and AMD outperform... all I can say is WOW...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1349728972110</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:42:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349729115641-97</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL IS LAYING PEOPLE OFF</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1349725614919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:46:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Federal Government under Obamination</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1349729115641</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349729641367-98</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Bernstein Says Sell, ASPs Set to Decline</Title><Username>romekay</Username><Timestamp>1349728805293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:40:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So let me guess.

The Federal workforce was 4.1mil when Bush took office in Jan 2001 and it was 4.2mil when he left in 2008. During 2009, 2010, 2011, the Federal Workforce increased from 4.2mil to 4.36mil in 2011. That is a difference of 154k workers. 110k of them were uniformed military personnel. A number of the executive numbers include the temporary census workers.

The stock added 3.4% to close at $7.29, as analyst Stacy Rasgon also argued that the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company (US:AMD) would get a lift from an expected “snapback” in demand in the second half of the year. “It now appears that AMD has secured the supply they need,” Rasgon wrote in support of the upgrade to outperform from market perform. “This, coupled with an above-consensus view on demand into the back half of the year, and very respectable performance characteristics of Llano’s successor, Trinity, are enough to bring us back to the more positive side of the fence.” Rasgon referred to AMD’s newest PC processor, part of its Fusion portfolio, a state-of-the-art processor that combines core computing with graphics processing capabilities. AMD suffered a setback late last year when it announced that manufacturing problems at joint venture GlobalFoundries prevented the chip maker from producing Fusion chips in volumes needed to meet demand. But AMD’s seen recovering from that problem. Rasgon said: “AMD’s recent results suggest that they have in fact solved the supply issues.” The company also took a hit from disruption in the PC market caused by the hard disk drive shortage resulting from the Thailand flooding disaster. But Rasgon said it looks like the PC market is poised to recover from that issue as well, projecting a “snapback in microprocessor sales in the back half of the year due to a recovery in HDDs.”</Msg><Username>san_warzone</Username><Timestamp>1349744275732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 20:57:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349744920679-130</Id><Title>More Stacy Rasgon's Record...</Title><Msg>Mr. Stacy Rasgon is not even close once again on his "calls".

And he raised target higher to $41. Instead the stock drops 3% while the market rises 3%. The stock drop to below the previous price target of $36 instead of moving towards what he said it could go to. I would say that you are right.

The dividend level will typically lag the profit levels are currently at 30%. This implies there is some headroom between the 30% and 40%. Profits can drop down or dividends can be bumped up toward the 40% of profits level. Beyond the profits target, Intel has even a larger buffer between its cash flow and the dividend payment. The dividend is very well covered. Your $23 target is close but I have not surprised at what analysts are saying. Bernstein even said that Q3 might be good but the future quarters are going to be a problem. Berstein has shifted the date out 6 months. OH!!!! We should also hear from Nomura, Romit Shah tomorrow and he will echo the bad news. He will maintain his REDUCE and also lower his target below his current $22. Romit likes to take his target down to CURRENT PRICE minus $2.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1349748775368</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 22:12:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349750633707-135</Id><Topic><Title>While the firms were selling the analyst were giving</Title><Username>dc10050</Username><Timestamp>1349747164085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:46:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's pretty simple, just like this board.

Concerns about the declining PC market once again made headlines after Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) CEO Meg Whitman ended last week suggesting the HP "turnaround" will occur sometime this millennium ... maybe. As the leader in PC processors, HP's announcement certainly didn't help the drop in Intel price. But as much as anything, Intel's mobile chip division is responsible for current pressures to its share value. Earlier this year, Intel announced it was (finally) getting serious about mobile computing, inking deals with providers including Lava International, Orange, and ZTE. Intel was already working with mobile players Lenovo and Google's (Nasdaq: GOOG ) Motorola Mobility. So what's the problem? Mobile computing and a need for speed It would be easy for Intel bulls to point to the six new smartphones shipped this year, all powered by its much-ballyhooed Atom processor. That's good stuff, and it would seem to support Intel's long-awaited mobile strategy. But there are a couple of problems. Of the six smartphones shipped so far in 2012 with "Intel Inside," none are here in the States. Europe and Asia are the landing points for the phones, including Motorola Mobility's foray into Europe -- the Razr i. That's fine, except the U.S. smartphone and mobile computing market is where the revenues are. So why the lack of a U.S. arrow in Intel's mobile computing quiver? As the world of smartphones, tablets, and the like shifts to the more robust 4G network, particularly domestically, Intel doesn't have a chip solution -- yet. The future is (almost) now Intel's director of product marketing, Sumeet Syal, shared an interesting 4G-related tidbit with TechCrunch a couple of weeks ago. According to Syal, Intel will begin "shipping some LTE products later this year and ramping into 2013." Intel naysayers will cite Qualcomm's (Nasdaq: QCOM ) existing 48% share of the smartphone processor market in Q2 as too big a hurdle for Intel. But not so fast. First, discounting Intel in virtually any market it sets its mind on entering is unwise. You don't become a $113 billion worldwide leader in any market unless you've been around the block once or twice. Second, as important as the 4G smartphone market is to Intel's future growth -- rising to $5.5 billion annually the first half of 2012, a 61% jump versus the same period in 2011 -- that's not the only opportunity value investors should consider. Intel's commitment to cloud technologies remains an intriguing prospect for growth. The revenue estimates for the cloud marketplace going forward are nothing short of astronomical. According to Forrester Research, in just two years' time the cloud will be a $55 billion business annually, as much as $241 billion a year by 2020. That's a lot of upside. Now, consider those exploding cloud market numbers alongside Intel's server market share: ending 2011 with its highest share of the market ever, at 16.5%. Intel's announcement Oct. 4 introducing the Atom-based storage platform cloud product, specifically addressing the needs of small businesses, is another in a long line of cloud revenue-generating solutions. Intel is notorious for understating earnings leading up to quarterly announcements. As discussed in an article about this time last month, sharing the dour earnings expectations news on Sept. 7 was pretty much par for the course, and that got the negative ball rolling. But don't be surprised when Intel ekes out a slightly better than forecast Q3 when it shares results on Oct. 16. With a yield nearing 4%, more than $13.6 billion in cash to continue its growth, and financials that should have value seekers salivating, Intel remains a growth and income dream. For investors with the need for speed, Intel may not offer the immediate gratification you're looking for. But a 4G chip is coming, the cloud market is exploding, and Intel will ride both to steady growth.</Msg><Username>hweich</Username><Timestamp>1349750761625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 22:46:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349754274255-137</Id><Title>Everybody dump this POS tomorrow</Title><Msg>Lets take this sinking Titanic below $20.
