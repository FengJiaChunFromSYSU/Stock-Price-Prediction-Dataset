First of all, Intel is on the verge of becoming the leading semiconductor provider for smartphones and tablets. In 2014, their tablet and smartphone offerrings will give them a total of about $8 Billion more in revenue. Their core PC segment may be about flat in 2014, but will have to grow somewhat in the 3 years following that do to more affordability rates worldwide. For the data group, they should have an average growth rate of at least 15% CAGR, due to strong smartphone and tablet useage along with new types of TV offerrings through networking. Total, Intel could easily reach a revenue base of between $75 Billion to $80 Billion. Taking a historic estimate of how all other factor will play out in determining EPS such as Gross Margin, R&amp;D, sharecount of around 4.5 Billion in 5 years, and tax rates, they can approach EPS of about $4.80 about 5 years from now. Seeing how they are paying a dividend of about .92 now with EPS near $2, I believe Intel will be able to raise their dividend to above $2 about 5 years from now with ease. As for $3 per share, I think Intel will be able to reach that level within the next 10 years along with a reduction to below 4 billion in sharecount.</Msg><Username>analysis101vp</Username><Timestamp>1371528197426</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:03:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371528256252-2</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Intel Delays 14 nm Broadwell, Schedules Haswell Refresh for 2014</Title><Username>intel.justice</Username><Timestamp>1371526620541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 23:37:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Report: Intel Delays 14 nm Broadwell, Schedules Haswell Refresh for 2014 intel.justice 1 post | Last Activity: 24 minutes ago Member since: Jun 17, 2013 Nice try - they are actually pulling it in</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371528256252</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371529754369-3</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Intel Delays 14 nm Broadwell, Schedules Haswell Refresh for 2014</Title><Username>intel.justice</Username><Timestamp>1371526620541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 23:37:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, nice try...looks like shorts are in desperation mode.

However, in this new world of hyper-segmentation and intense focus on mobile, things have gotten a little tricky to understand, particularly on the Intel side of things. In this article, I'd like to "set the record straight" so that investors do not get the wrong idea from the numerous sites on the web spreading what appears to be faulty analysis of good leaks. 14nm Is Not Delayed To 2015 Intel bears have pointed to the following leaked roadmap slide in an attempt to prove that Intel is running into problems with its 14nm process and that processors based on that process will not be available until 2015: However, this is actually not the case. See, following the 22nm "tock" known as Haswell, Intel indeed has a processor core known as Broadwell. The rub, unfortunately, is that this processor will apparently not be coming to the socketed desktop format, but will instead only be coming in "BGA" (that means the chip is soldered to the motherboard) format, implying that it is a part aimed exclusively at mobility and integrated form factors such as high end tablets, notebooks, and Ultrabooks.

Why Broadwell Won't Be Coming To Socketed Desktops When Intel released a socketed "Ivy Bridge" for the desktop, it seemed pointless from the point of view of the folks who buy these things. Sure the die size was smaller, and the integrated graphics were better, but these are the sorts of things that mean absolutely nothing to the socketed desktop crowd. The majority of folks buying these chips will either find the integrated graphics already "good enough", or if they need more 3D gaming performance, will be buying separate cards from either Nvidia (NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices. Finally, while "ticks" do wonders to reduce power consumption, this is not something that people buying "towers" (where socketed chips/boards go) care too much about. As long as the electric bill isn't enormous and the heat dissipated isn't terrible, then the customer base here cares much more about performance than anything else. And, did I mention, that this customer base is a rather niche market? See, Broadwell will be the same sort of thing; a minimal improvement on the CPU side of things from Haswell (think 3-5% performance per clock improvement), but a solid improvement in power consumption, a big jump in graphics (Broadwell gets the new "Gen 8" graphics micro-architecture), and overall an excellent improvement for mobile users who care about performance within a power constrained, battery-life driven environment.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371530123508</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:35:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371530202503-6</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's 14 Nanometer: Setting The Record Straight</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371530028491</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:33:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continued-2 So, from Intel's perspective, why should it release a new chip for a user base when that new chip will not improve meaningfully on any vectors that this user base cares about? Broadwell is for all-in-one desktops, notebooks, Ultrabooks, and tablets, and it makes sense for Intel to not waste any of its 14nm capacity in this space when its 22nm (which should be very mature and cheap by then) parts will do the trick. In addition, it seems that Intel has something even better than "Broadwell" planned for the socketed desktop: "Haswell-E". Haswell-E: First Details Revealed The enthusiast crowd ("-E" stands for "enthusiast") doesn't want integrated graphics. This crowd wants gobs of performance, lots of cores, insane memory bandwidth, and doesn't care so much about power because they are very likely running systems with 1200W power supplies, 2-3 200W+ graphics cards, and more memory than an iPad has storage space. Intel, instead of bringing a socketed Broadwell which will be met by enthusiasts with a yawn, is apparently going to be stepping up its game on the "-E" parts in the Broadwell time frame:</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371530202503</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:36:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371530285317-7</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's 14 Nanometer: Setting The Record Straight</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371530028491</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:33:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continued-3 This is what desktop enthusiasts want. More cores, lots of memory bandwidth, big caches, lots of PCIe Gen 3 lanes, and all of this with only a moderate regard for power consumption. So, while Broadwell and the next gen 14nm Atom known as Airmont soak up the 14nm capacity for the markets that really need the latest and greatest in power saving and graphics (all at a competitive price, so smaller dies help), Haswell and Haswell-E will service the customers who would rather build towers and workstations. Intel wins because it doesn't have to worry about validating additional Broadwell SKUs for the desktop socketed platform (where it would receive a lukewarm reception at best) and instead can focus on where the money is: mobile. At the same time, Intel can use cut down server parts as "high end desktop" parts aimed at the hardest-core enthusiasts. For investors, this is a very clear win. The best part of all of this is that the only "competitor" in this space is AMD, and that company will not be transitioning to its 28nm architectures until the end of 2013/early 2014, so it is very unlikely that AMD will be able to (profitably) compete on performance or cost against Intel's 22nm high end desktop parts. Conclusion So, the takeaway is clear: Intel's 14nm process will debut 1H 2014 with Broadwell aimed at all-in-ones, notebooks, Ultrabooks, and high end tablets where the real volume will be. The high end desktop will stay longer on 22nm Haswell until the 14nm "tock" known as Skylake, where Intel will be able to offer a meaningful CPU performance increase and platform update, which will be a compelling offering to the socketed desktop crowd (and it will be even more compelling as the users will not be upgrading from a "tick" but from the last "tock"). This all makes perfect business sense, and I believe that investors should take heart in knowing that Intel is doing the right things in each of its markets from a competitive and cost structure standpoint.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371530285317</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:38:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371530922974-8</Id><Title>technicals</Title><Msg>closed above a major resistance level at 25.02. here comes new highs.

Those VETS who followed your advise would be down 20% in just a couple of months. If they followed your advise for 6 months, just imagine how much they could lose following your advise. Intel will generally trade with the market through the summer but with a general upward bias due to new product introductions, gentle short covering and share buy back program. Chart readers will mistakenly read the chart as overbought and get fearful. That will be a mistake on their part. If an investor has funds to invest and 3.7% on that investment would meet their needs, deploying a portion of a full position to Intel is fine ..... even today. If the market drops 20%, Intel will drop almost 20% but less than the market will drop. If Intel does drop, I think that $22.50 (4% yield) is a barrier and $20 is a barrier that will take some selling to get through.

(If they could just master due diligence perhaps they wouldn't need the expertise in statistical manipulation.) Well, with their track record they get a lot of experience in trying to mitigate recognition of their stupidity. Here's an example: If Intel went up $100 in a day, then the shills would say things like this: The stock went to $102 but was unable to hold it. Weak, weak, weak. Even with today's gain Intel's P/E is still less than that of ARM. XYZ stock went up $110. Intel underperforms again. Bottom line: Shills are down almost six bucks since November. They can compare it to whatever they want in the past, but they are still down by that amount. No comparison is going to turn their losses for the last seven months into profits.

The firm disclosed details at the International Semiconductor Conference (ISC 2103) in Leipzig, where it also unveiled new 7100, 3100 and 5100 families of its current Xeon Phi Coprocessor lineup. Codenamed Knights Landing, the next generation Xeon Phi will be produced on a 14nm process technology, according to Dr Rajeeb Hazra, vice president of Intel's data centre and connected systems group. It is unclear whether this will be Intel's first 14nm chip, as the company declined to indicate an availability date for the product. An update of Intel's mainstream Core chips codenamed Broadwell was expected to debut on 14nm later this year, but recent press coverage has suggested this may be delayed until sometime in 2014. However, Hazra did disclose that Knights Landing will be able to operate as a CPU in its own right, while the current Xeon Phi products are designed as PCI Express coprocessors that work in concert with standard Intel CPUs. "The most significant aspect of where this takes innovation forward is that it is no longer simply a PCI Express coprocessor. It is also a standalone CPU," he said. The reason for this move is that using a coprocessor to offload the processing burden is "unnatural" for programmers to code for, according to Hazra. "They simply want the ability to take what they do on a single CPU today but have much more pervasive threading and parallelism and vectorisation going on. And that is what we will be doing in the next generation Xeon Phi processor," he added. Knights Landing will also feature integrated on-package memory, in an attempt to boost performance by moving the memory as close as possible to the processor instead of using GDDR5 memory chips, as the current Xeon Phi coprocessors do.

[]While I am content with a continuation of the "crab boil" of Intel shorts, the Numis downgrade of ARM yesterday demonstrates that a "Eureka!!" moment at the arrival of the end of the ARM era is quite possible. I don't think it will be a single catalyst although this too is possible. It will probably be a string of events - like the Altera deal, the Mac upgrades, the Silvermont announcement, the Haswell release, Bay Trail, Merrifield and the Samsung event in two days. The roadmap is robust, the pipeline is full, and the wave of significant events will continue far into the future.

"It was still a big leap in purchasing a 40 percent stake in Falling Sky, one of 20 horses scheduled to run in the 139th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs (CHDN) in Louisville, Kentucky, in two days, Covello said. The 3-year-old went for $425,000 at the Ocala Breeders Sales Co. winter sale in January, by far the highest price of the session three years after the colt was purchased for $16,000 at Keeneland." My Comment: How about that name? Falling Sky. You can't make this stuff up. Covello paid a pretty penny for Falling Sky. "Falling Sky’s price compared with an average of $15,368 in his sale division for horses of racing age, according to Ocala spokesman Jay Friedman." Covello paid about 25 times the average. How did Falling Sky do in the Kentucky Derby? DEAD LAST. Falling Sky is one of 40 horses owned by Covello. He claims to make money on his horses.

The high-tech timepiece is one of a range of “experimental devices in the lab” CTO Justin Rattner explained this week, VentureBeat reports, describing it as part of the chip firm’s exploration of “novel display devices.” “Actually, we’re looking at novel display devices” Rattner said during an appearance at the Bloomberg Next Big Thing conference. “The watch is kind of – if you want to put the time on it, that’s fine. But if you’re talking about texting today, wouldn’t it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?” Unsurprisingly, Rattner was not forthcoming on any other details about the smartwatch; nor, indeed, on the other “novel display” approaches the company was trialling. Intel obviously isn’t alone in weighing the smartwatch market. Pebble, for instance, proved wildly successful on Kickstarter, though Sony, GEAK, AGENT and others have all made attempts to grab space on users’ wrists. Meanwhile, Microsoft is also said to be working on a device of its own in its R&amp;D labs. What’s particularly interesting about Intel’s experimentation, however, is the potential Apple connection. Although the Cupertino firm wasn’t specifically mentioned by Rattner this week, rumors late last year pegged Intel and Apple as collaborating on a smartwatch device, at the time said to have a 1.5-inch PMOLED display and to hook up to an iPhone via low-power Bluetooth 4.0.

Shorties who counted on GS...GS is doing the devils work... back in January In short, Goldman thinks Intel's level of capital spending will lead to excess supply. If so, there is a chance Intel may reduce its capex plan later this year. This would be similar to 2012 when Intel invested $11.0 billion in capex, below its initial guidance of $12.1 to$12.9 billion, as noted in the Goldman report. “That said, for those investors who wish to express a positive view on semi cap in light of Intel's higher than expected capex, we are very positive on Applied Materials. Our bullish view is based on a company-specific turnaround story at Applied but if we are wrong and Intel maintains this high level of capex, then that is positive for Applied," said the analyst.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371581873519</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 14:57:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371581967124-94</Id><Topic><Title>Huge June 27 call open interest. 58k.</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1371569736265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 11:35:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The largest volume that I have seen in INTC was in Nov 2011 when there were two deep call strikes $15 and $17 I think.

But now that Intel has shifted its laser focus onto the mobile space, ARM investors are getting jittery. Intel is putting pressure on ARM from two sides. First, its Clover Trail+ Atom silicon is delivering significant power savings compared to what ARM is offering. The Atom Z2580 is so good that tests carried out by ABI Research suggest it packs a punch equivalent to that of the Samsung Exynos Octa or the Qualcomm APQ8064T while consuming about half the power. News that Samsung has chosen Intel over ARM to supply chips for its new tablets have put ARM shares into a downward spiral since the beginning of June. The second pressure on ARM is Intel's next-generation Core processors based on the Haswell architecture. While there's no doubt that these processors are pricey, they do bring to the table significant power savings, and put significant pressure on ARM. As x86 processors become more efficient, the less OEMs want to compromise new tablets by kitting them out with ARM silicon. Microsoft had hoped that its Windows RT platform would give ARM greater reach into the mobile tablet space, but this platform hasn't as yet been well received by either consumers or enterprise customers. Intel's sudden arrival into the mobile market is making investors and analysts twitchy. Analysts at Bernstein Research warned in a note to clients that they found "a great deal of evidence that with its current products, Intel is competitive against ARM" before going on to conclude that "we can't stress enough how much we are worried about current expectations for ARM." This threat from Intel doesn't just apply to ARM, but also extends to its rivals, such as Imagination Technologies. While its share price hasn't been rocked as hard as ARM's, it too is living in an increasingly vulnerable market space.

The finiancial sector has had its run and every bank from the community banks, credit unions to the big banks are all way way overbought and have only one way to go and that is down. The Transportations have had their runs as well as the mkts look at things 6 months ahead. So no matter what Bernanke says and does this mkt is headed lower. Tomorrow when the FOMC meeting is done like everyone is saying the tone will be the same as what they have been saying all along depending on data and Ben is gonna leave the decision of tapering to his successor whoever that maybe. There are 3 contenders Yewette from the Fed Reserve, Summers and Timmothy Geithner. Now tomorrow when the fed makes its statement saying nothing new the mkts could rally more but after that its gonna be profit taking. This rally has had its runs and its been sheer manipulation of short squeezes. Now that the shorts are fried and are mostly out this mkt is out of conviction and steam. If the finiancials and Transportation are headed down the whole mkt is gonna head down. Intel has its own challenges now that AMD is gonna produce ARM chips "Seattle" for the server mkts and most of the OEM's say they would like to see a mkt share taken away from Intel so that intel margins can come lower and hence the price. So I am gonna wait it out with intel.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1371583164132</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 15:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371583415093-103</Id><Title>Do you teabaggers think OB cars about his approval rating now?

To us, AMD’s vision is a bit perplexing given that the company appears to be going in multiple directions with a limited R&amp;D budget. Thus to an extent, we feel that plans for its partnership with ARM could be more transparent via firm commitments. In regards to Intel, they have the ability to support its roadmap through balance sheet strength and world class manufacturing. For AMD, given what we perceive to be a lack of focus, it could be challenging to grow presence across its end-markets.
