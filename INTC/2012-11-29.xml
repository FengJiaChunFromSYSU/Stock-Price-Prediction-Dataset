Should they stop buying Intel's chips because they are not in America? They say most of Intel's future growth is to come from emerging markets outside America. Becoming an SA author is an open process and there is no restriction on your opinions on the market. If that were not he case, where would be free speech? What makes you think someone expressing their opinion with open explanations and logic is manipulating stocks. Investors make their own decisions but they may follow someone's logic. That's not manipulation.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354167903228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 00:45:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354168140748-3</Id><Title>With Surface RT flopping big time, Windows on ARM</Title><Msg>is dead.

I find them so informative . I am a chip designer myself. Just one question i had for you. If Intel's single core Atom solution that has currently gone into Intel powered smartphones is so compelling for performance/watt perspective, why isnt Intel being able to grab a bigger share of the smartphone market ?

Intel's chips have just been released, so it takes time for them to get designed into new devices. 2. Lack of LTE. In 1H 2013, Intel will be out with a dual core version of medfield along with its own XMM 7160 LTE baseband/radio. This will allow Intel to finally penetrate the US, which is very much LTE-focused.

That's probably why the stock is down today. They need to concentrate on CPUs, especially mobile. Someone needs to go to Apple and offer them the deal of the century to get them to buy INTC processors. Maybe even ask them what they'll pay to go to INTC and tske any reasonable offer they give. This is not a difficult business decision. I should apply to be the CEO. I can't do a worse job for the stockholders. And I have no interest in a special dividend since the stock price will go down whatever amount they pay.

Intel Corporation (INTC) Killing Desktop [REPORT] November 28, 2012By ValueWalk StaffIntel’s upcoming Broadwell processors will be soldered to the motherboard. This could signal the beginning of the end for desktop PC’s, and the end of the consumer market of computer upgrades. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will be releasing its upcoming 14-nanometre Broadwell architecture processors as a ball grid array (BGA) rather than a land grid array (LGA). The rumors have been circulating for months, but the news broke out earlier this week by Japanese tech site PC Watch; English translation here. This means that consumers will no longer be able to upgrade their CPUs – potentially limiting the lives of their computers. ...</Msg><Username>tony25er</Username><Timestamp>1354201674092</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 10:07:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354201770489-66</Id><Topic><Title>still dont understand why intc is down today ?</Title><Username>lilies778</Username><Timestamp>1354200778150</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 09:52:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because I gave it a very good short!

Some guess below but you should double check for my math errors. The problem in determining the tax is exactly what you make, your exmptions and deductions, and ..... It depends on what agreement is reached. There are several big problems that must be negotiated and the final result will be unknown until "it is known". Expect the payroll tax to go back up by 2%. That will hit the first paycheck. Dividends? It won't be less than you now pay. It won't be more than ordinary income. If you add the $4k dividends to the top of your final adjusted gross income, you can see what that difference would be. From the 2012 tables, it does NOT appear that you will be paying more than 15%. $45k +$4k = $49k - exemptions - deductions Single w/ no dependents: $49k - $5,950 = $43k : Above $35,350 will be in the 25% bracket. About 10% more on the $7,650 above the $35,350 bracket. That is $765 increase. Married: no difference. If temporary tax cuts allowed to expire. 2012 Standard Deductions Standard tax deductions will also lower your taxable income, if you don’t decide to itemize taxes. The 2012 standard deductions have also increased: ■$5,950 for single filers &amp; married filing separately (up from $5,800) ■$11,900 for married filers (up from $11,600) ■$8,700 for head of household (up from $8,500) ■$950 for dependents (same as 2011) And now, on to the tax bracket changes. 2012 Tax Brackets 2012 Tax Brackets for Singles: 10% – $0-$8,700 (up from $8,500) 15% – $8,700-$35,350 (up from $8,500-34,500) 25% – $35,350-$85,650 (up from $34,500-$83,600) 28% – $85,650-$178,650 (up from $83,600-$174,400) 33% – $178,650-$388,350 (up from $174,400-$379,150) 35% – $388,350+ (up from $379,150+) 2012 Tax Brackets for Married Filing Jointly: 10% – $0-$17,400 (up from $0-$17,000) 15% – $17,400-$70,700 (up from $17,000-$69,000) 25% – $70,700-$142,700 (up from $69,000-$139,350) 28% – $142,700-$217,450 (up from $139,350-$212,300) 33% – $217,450-$388,350 (up from $212,300-$379,150) 35% – $388,350+ (up from $379,150+) 2012 Tax Brackets for Married Filing Separately: 10% – $0-$8,700 (up from $0-$8,500) 15% – $8,700-$35,350 (up from $8,500-$34,500) 25% – $35,350-$71,350 (up from $34,500-$69,675) 28% – $71,350-$108,725 (up from $69,675-$106,500) 33% – $108,725-$194,175 (up from $106,500-$189,575) 35% – $194,175+ (up from $189,575+) 2012 Tax Brackets for Head Of Household: 10% – $0-$12,400 (up from $0-$12,150) 15% – $12,400-$47,350 (up from $12,150-$46,250) 25% – $47,350-$122,300 (up from $46,250-$119,400) 28% – $122,300-$198,050 (up from $119,400-$193,350) 33% – $198,050-$388,350 (up from $193,350-$379,150) 35% – $388,350+ (up from $379,150+)</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354203570857</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 10:39:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354203684312-82</Id><Title>att4glte SOLD TODAY</Title><Msg>That could signal a bottom for the shares.

Have you built computers before? If you are upgrading to a newer class CPU, most likely you will need a new mother board anyways. For example the 1st gen i7s VS the 2nd gen i7s will require you to have different mother board. If you were to upgrade within the same line of CPUs of the same generation but would like a faster speed (for instance i7 930 VS i7 950 1gen), then you can keep the CPU. BUT... who upgrades within the same generation of CPUs??? Most people use a computer for 3-4 years until their next upgrade, which will require a NEW mother board. Therefore, intels plan (if true) to have the chip soldered to the board is a great idea because that will lessen the hassle for people to get a CPU and a mother board. I think it will make building/upgrading computers a lot easier for a lot of people.</Msg><Username>warmninja</Username><Timestamp>1354203930559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 10:45:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354204000542-85</Id><Topic><Title>they were crucified in a journal piece as Cramer says...</Title><Username>slice_hicks</Username><Timestamp>1354199260359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 09:27:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The PC is going away?

HPQ and DELL obviously get this part cheaper but I think they might like to remove the socket cost from the board. If sometime between now and the introduction, DELL, HPQ, .... suggest to Intel that a soldered part is not a good idea, Intel would probably release a non-embedded part that is socketed.

Since Intel has already earned $1.65 in the first 9 months, GS is saying that Intel Q4 earnings will be between -0.05 to 0.25. If Intel loses money in Q4, it will be a surprise. Sept. 30, 2012 0.58 June 30, 2012 0.54 March 31, 2012 0.53 Off Schwab Intel news: In keeping with their negative view of the stock, analysts at Goldman Sachs maintained a Sell rating on Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and lowered their price target to $16.00 (from $20.00). The problem, in the view of Goldman, is margins. "We expect excess supply as Intel and AMD (NYSE: AMD) have record inventory," warned analyst James Covello. "Our hardware team expects the PC unit CAGR to be zero from 2011-2014E, and we believe the full extent of Intel's new capacity has yet to come online," Corvello noted that Intel stock is highly correlated to gross margin, which could take a hit as supply builds. "Intel's 3Q12 capex was its second highest ever, suggesting that significant supply will come online for several more quarters and exacerbate current excess capacity," added Covello. For the record, Covello's Sell rating on Intel is based on cyclical concerns. In other words, it is not a call related to the so-called 'death of the PC'. Goldman lowered Intel's 2013/2014 EPS estimates to $1.60/$1.90 from $1.70/$2.05. For an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) click here.

Microsoft Surface Pro. The good news: the Intel-powered ultrabookish tablet mash-up will be out in just a couple of months. The bad news? It might cost more than you want to spend. Microsoft announced today that Surface Pro will start at $900 at launch for a 64GB version, while a 128GB version will run you $1000. Both models come with 4GB RAM, a USB 3.0 port, and run full Windows 8. That price also includes a fancy stylus, but not one of Microsoft's handy—and frankly, for this device, necessary—Touch or Type Covers. Those cost $120 and $130, respectively, meaning that to give yourself a true laptop replacement you're going to have to shell out at least $1020. For some perspective, that means the base, 64GB, 10.6-inch Surface Pro with keyboard cover will cost more than a comparably spec'd MacBook Air. That seems like a tough sell. Microsoft had always been clear that Surface Pro would be priced comparably with ultrabooks, but that implies a pretty broad range of prices. A range that Surface Pro, it turns, out, is near the top of. And while on the one hand you could argue that the innovative form is worth a premium over your standard 11-inch Dell, Microsoft's main concern right now should probably be getting Surface in the hands of the masses. The company's biggest hardware challenge now, no matter how many dance-filled commercials it runs, is a knowledge deficit. Why take a flyer on a $1000 hybrid device when you know for a fact that comparable MBA or Zenbook performs well and costs less? The Surface Pro might be the greatest technological marvel to come along since the rotisserie oven. Or it might be a disappointment. Either way, it's a leap of faith for buyers. In that sense, it's a whole lot like the original Xbox, another new entrant into a crowded field that was a longshot at best. Microsoft sold it at a loss for years, literal years, undercutting Sony and winning a massive install base in the process. And if Microsoft's already taking a massive hit on a $1,020 entry level price, well, maybe it was an ill-fated pursuit to start with.</Msg><Username>jimbohomegamedyall</Username><Timestamp>1354212908773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:15:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354212920439-144</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro just priced at $ 899</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1354212645075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:10:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surface Pro is a winning product ...IMO, it will sell over 40million units in 2013</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354212920439</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:15:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354212950561-145</Id><Topic><Title>Shameless A.

In the three weeks after Windows 8 launched on Oct. 26, sales of Windows PCs and tablet computers fell 21 percent compared with a year earlier, according to NPD, which tracks U.S. retail sales. There's no sign that Windows 8 made things worse for PC makers. Rather, NPD said the weak sales are a continuation of a trend seen throughout this year. U.S. consumers appear more interested in spending electronics dollars on smartphones and tablets than on upgrading their computers. Several tablet makers have released new models this fall, and Apple (AAPL) has made a smaller version of its market-leading iPad. Microsoft Corp. developed Windows 8 with tablets and touch screens in mind. The new operating system features a new look and is designed to make desktops and laptops work more like tablets. The Redmond, Wash., company is supporting the launch with its largest-ever advertising campaign. UBS analyst Mary Jo Foley put the value of the campaign at $1 billion. PC makers were officially optimistic and have largely switched their consumer-focused product lines over to Windows 8, but they were cautious about stocking large numbers of PCs ahead of the launch. Reviews of the new operating system were mixed. "After just four weeks on the market, it's still early to place blame on Windows 8 for the ongoing weakness in the PC market," NPD analyst Stephen Baker in a statement. "We still have the whole holiday selling season ahead of us, but clearly Windows 8 did not prove to be the impetus for a sales turnaround some had hoped for." Baker said Windows 8 laptops with touch screens were doing well, helping drive up the average selling price of PCs. Microsoft has said it sold 40 million licenses to Windows 8 in its first month on the market, but that number includes licenses bought by PC manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. for machines built but not yet sold. Research firm IHS iSuppli has predicted that 349 million PCs will be shipped worldwide this year. That would be a 1 percent decline from the year before -- the first year-over-year decline since 2001. In the U.S., PC sales have been declining for two years already.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1354215448094</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354215485982-167</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend approaching 5%</Title><Username>gfhandel2006</Username><Timestamp>1354214760831</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:46:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>at&amp;t 5.3%</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1354215485982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:58:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354215744108-168</Id><Title>INTC: 2013 is turnaround year</Title><Msg>With release of Intel's new z2580 with 4G LTE support, Intel will have multiple smartphones in US market in 2013.

Is this a concern? I don't think so. I think we are in the mist of a PC device transition from non-touch devices to touch devices. The same NPD report shows strong numbers for Windows ultrabook with touch. They accounted for 6% of ultrabook sales. The weak numbers is due to fact that there aren't enough touch devices out there in the market. Consumers are smart. Windows 8 is meant for touch devices so they are waiting and will be buying touch devices. As 2013 comes around, and with Haswell introduction, all new devices with have touch. Once that happens, PC device sales will pick up. I think Goldman et al just took advantage of the currently situation (and this report) to really cause panick to INTC shareholders. I will be buying more at these levels.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354223303189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 16:08:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354223450561-208</Id><Topic><Title>PC transition to touch-base devices</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354223303189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 16:08:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are crooks of the wallstreet.

But then there IS a need for PC tablets in additon to the ARM tablets. An ARM tablet is just a browser. A PC tablet, for instance, will run Photoshop. Also, a PC tablet could be a replacement for a laptop. And then we have stock-market analysts saying that the price point of PC tablets is too high.

You might want to try to buy back, maybe a bit cheaper. The reasons are: the dividend is in no trouble and INTC could raise it if they saw fit to do so based on positive cash flows. INTC remains strong on research and innovation. INTC is severely oversold right now and many say it will rebound in 2013 to PT of $30 (Seeking Alpha). I recall in the past that analysts were a couple times ready to write off Big Blue; however, IBM always rebounded based on its superior position. Management, cash and R&amp;D development. I'm going to begin buying more shares INTC at under $20. I'm betting also that Goldman will start buying before it gets to $16. I see no reason to wait as it may not go there. That's a truly aburd thought. Remember, tech is disruptive and intel remains a strong survivor in the IBM mold. Also, some patience is necessary to play this game. Apple was a low-teens stock for many years before its meteoric rise! You may want to reconsider at some point.......</Msg><Username>ngaibruce</Username><Timestamp>1354238965148</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 20:29:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354240478973-249</Id><Title>Goldman's call somthing is fishy</Title><Msg>On Nov 21st - Goldman downgrades HPQ to "Neutral" rating with a price target reduced from $16 to $14. HPQ - is highly leveraged compared to Intel which is kind of debt free. Still Intel is rated a "Sell" essentially saying HPQ is better than Intel. The analyst at Goldman Sachs - I wonder whether he knows to read a balance sheet in the first place or he knows somthing we dont. I think it is latter. Why would he rate Intel like HPQ when Intel's balance sheet is way way better than HPQ? They brought the PPS from $25 to $20 - they already knew Paul O was on his way out when it was $25. what this time? a) another Revenue warning?( Cramer the clown said the same today morning on CNBC - I know he is an idiot but well this is manipulation and his buddies from GS must have given him a tip) b) new CEO from inside and not a "Mobile" oriented guy? Somthing is wrong here and I think they will take it down to $17 to show that they are credible . If you are long - I would strongly encourage to hedge your position. $17 puts are worth looking into( will cost you 22 cents = divy that you would get for the next quarter). By then lot of uncertainity would be out of our way too.

Yesterday, lots of people here were happy because INTC closed above $20. They were thinking $20 is some kind of magic number and just because it closed above $20, it means the next stop is moon. I am only trying to help. As you can see I set my target price at around $17. Once it gets to $17 I have to reevaluate and maybe I will lower my target again or maybe I'll raise my target price. Till now I want you to be very very caution and down side is more favorable compared with upside. As a matter of fact, once again we have to refer to our investment 101. yesterday stock was up on a lower volume compared to avg. Today it was down with higher volume compared to avg.
