FP is the most power hungry part of a cpu which is why AMD allied two integer cores with one floating point core in a Bulldozer module and certainly helps to explain some of the extra power usage in A15. ----- On a single thread basis, the A15's integer numbers aren't that "bad", but I would have expected them to be better, still probably the best of the bunch though. As you say, FP it's the most power hungry aspect of any chip. These benchmarks still aren't using the SIMD aspect of the ARM cores, and I'm hearing good things about performance in that regard, so the total FP numbers can probably be improved on when using appropriate algos and compilers. Float is used all over the place, especially games, GUI's, dynamic scripting languages, javascript etc.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1353331648086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 08:27:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353331869494-10</Id><Topic><Title>Get your Tickets Ready!

Has laid down the foundations for a very successful Intel future in both its legacy and new mobile markets. Basically killed AMD while still retaining huge profits doing so. It's not easy to quickly produce a mobile chip if your focus for years has been on high performance cpus but he got there in the end. I suppose he paid the price in the end for the time it took but it always was going to take that amount of time if Intel was going to do it using x86 to maximize Intel's future profits and a brand new design which takes at least 4 years just for the cpu nevermind the other SoC elements. The money in mobile is not in the chips anyway but the phones themselves but those kind of real details get lost when you have a screaming herd calling for your head.

Even clock adjusted A15 is still well behind Athlon64 in integer performance. Floating point performance is easy to get, you just keep throwing more parallel units and bandwidth at the problem and you end up with something like a gpu, very hot but effective in certain limited apps. Good integer performance is more useful (general purpose) and much harder to get because it is often about reducing cycle times and latencies and more functional units can sometimes get in the way of that. Requires far more skill and ultimately is what makes Intel the undervalued $100bn company it is today. PowerPC had better FP performance than the x86 that replaced it in Macs but no-one noticed or bothered about it. Stuff like games is mostly integer limited as long as you have a certain amount of FP performance backing it up. Integer-FP is an asymmetric relationship in modern processors so pinning any great hopes on a RISC's FP ability like ARM's to make it standout in common apps will prove to be a futile exercise.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353343229600</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:40:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353343628829-107</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH at new 52 week high today...</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353337846890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 10:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>35.6 hurts to watch it. paul gtfo now.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1353343628829</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:47:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353343731174-108</Id><Topic><Title>Intel predicted to break at least 21 today- big news story this afternoon!</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1353341342757</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:09:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HA HA... really... with Paul O retiring, that can't be seen as a good thing for the stock --------------- The stock has been in the green all morning on huge volume, goofball.

Integer-FP is an asymmetric relationship in modern processors so pinning any great hopes on a RISC's FP ability like ARM's to make it standout in common apps will prove to be a futile exercise. ----- Are you sure about the PowerPC? I had a quick look at Geekbench and it seems that the Powers had higher int performance (but much lower float) than some of the X86 machines that replaced them. It could have been the cross over models that I looked at? Games aren't init limited, they are typically float limited (any modern day physics engine is all float code as is all the 3D logic) . ARM does have an issue with integer performance and as a MIPS fan you should know where it is, any why it goes away with ARM64?:)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1353345139975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:12:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353345270543-113</Id><Title>It was over for Right-wing trash ballllllll loser Paul O when he publicly endorsed Rombo Romney THE LOSER!</Title><Msg>Intel is still run by Libs on the Board and they went NUTS when Paul O publicly made a horses rump of himself by backing a LOSER!

Thought this was interesting and worth passing on. Obama used it in the health care bill. Now isn't this interesting? It is also included in the health care law. Dhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. Type it into Google and start reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists.. It is a REAL word. +++++++++ Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam. ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States . Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be "gambling", "risk-taking", and "usury" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivable, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1353345676802</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:21:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353345902278-118</Id><Topic><Title>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO RUNS INTEL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE WRONG CHIPS</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1353340993643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:03:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, so that's it.

While many will naively be cheering for this development, I have to stress that this is probably one of the worst things that Intel shareholders could have woken up to on 11/19. Some Background Before Intel CEO Paul Otellini took the helm in 2005, the company was, quite frankly, a mess. Intel - despite its huge capital and resources - was getting beaten down badly by much smaller competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), due primarily to a mismanagement of the firm's vast engineering resources. Otellini changed all of that. Under him, the firm began its "tick-tock" strategy that has ensured that in every field it plays in, the company takes the lead very quickly. While The Street's Rocco Pendola believes that it's about time, the author misses the fact that under Otellini, Intel achieved milestones that far exceed the low ASP smartphone processor market, including: Becoming the dominant PC processor vendor by leading a crusade towards ever-improving performance-per-watt and system integration Becoming the dominant server processor vendor (i.e. owning HPC, cloud, etc.) Scoring the Apple (AAPL) design win in the Mac products (Intel is now in the iMac, MacBook, MacPro, and MacMini) Became the #2 contributor to the Linux kernel (which was instrumental in getting Android up and running on x86 so quickly) Got Intel through the financial crisis without cutting its core R&amp;D This led to record revenues in 2011 at a staggering $54B, up 23% from 2010. Paul Otellini has been an excellent CEO, and he was one of the major reasons that I am bullish on Intel's prospects. What's Next? Well, Intel has 6 months to find a new CEO. The firm noted in its press release that the hunt for the new executive will include combing through internal and external candidates. As an Intel shareholder, I would be much more comfortable with an internal candidate than an external one simply because there are no other companies out there that are like Intel. Who else has both leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing as well as leading edge design in everything from mobile SoCs to the biggest of the big iron server processors along with the software expertise to fully utilize it? Nobody. The candidates internally seem to be: Renee James - Head of the software business Brian Krzanich - COO and head of the manufacturing business Stacy Smith - CFO and director of corporate strategy I would personally bank on Mr. Krzanich given how well the manufacturing side of Intel has been run, but it is too early to rule out the other candidates. Externally? It is tough to imagine who else would be qualified for the job, although I am sure that we will get more clarity on this in the coming months. Conclusion Otellini's retirement is not a good thing and shareholders have every right to be nervous. This CEO turned Intel into an execution machine after years of missteps (like the Pentium 4 disaster - the chip was hot, power hungry, and inferior to the competition). I now wait nervously to find out who the next CEO of Intel will be.</Msg><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1353345928769</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:25:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353346377079-121</Id><Topic><Title>intel will open up their foundaries</Title><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1353345450793</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:17:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No shame but what if Intel helps its ARM competitors to close the gap on x86 and kill its legacy profits by being real competitors rather than just paper ones ?

If ARM is superior to x86, you continue to make it. If its inferior, it will die off naturally. INTC has superior manufacturing and can out produce any other fab and command a premium price for doing it. If QCOM,Samsung or AAPL go with ARM 22nm then 14nm, they will leave the others in the dust.

He said he was surprised when Otellini told him last week he would retire. Although Bryant had talked with Otellini in past, “We were targeting further out” for a transition, said Bryant. “I thought I would have more time.” Bryant said he’s been talking with Intel executives and employees, and that “It’s a hard day here at Intel; Paul is extremely cherished and valued.” Bryant said although he tried to get Otellini to stay, Otellini felt it was time to turn over the reins to a new generation as Intel admittedly faces challenges in the mobile computing arena — challenges, however, that Bryant feels Intel can meet through its superior chip-making technology. Following are more extensive remarks by Bryant: He and I talked a lot about this in past. After almost 40 years at Intel, and the Intel CEO job for 8 years, which is a really hard job, he felt it was time to move to the next generation of leadership. We do have big issues in front of us, moving to the tablet and phone markets, and he was ready to let the next generation lead those battles. I did everything I can think of to buy myself another year [of Otellini's leaderhip]. We were targeting further out for this. He surprised me last week when he said this. We do need to look both internally and externally, I think that’s good governance and appropriate. We’ve got five very senior executives, including the three promoted today [Renne James, the head of software; Brian Krzanich, the head of manufacturing; and Stacy Smith, Intel’s CFO] as well as Dadi Perlmutter [head of Intel's mobile efforts] and Arvind Sodhani [president of Intel Capital] who are important to run Intel into the future. We generally think we have a deep and strong bench. Paul made his decision last week and by SEC rules, we have four days to make a public announcement, and so we are just now at the beginning of a process we didn’t expect to have to conduct. Paul has a very strong record of achievement. On the manufacturing front, we’re ahead of Samsung [Electronics (005930KS)] and everyone else in the world. We’re shipping the most advanced [semiconductor] process, and providing chips in smartphones outside the U.S., and in tablets inside the US. The ultrabook is remaking the PC market. We’re pretty comfortable with where we are technically. This year, we have to continue to push the power/performance envelope. We’re the best in the world with the technology and as good as anyone with efficiency. Meaning, one is the best science, and the other is the best process technology. I would expect Samsung and others to continue to make progress, and you never assume people you are competing with will stop the technological advance. But we expect to take advantage of the increasing gap in technology we’ve established. My intention is to be around at Intel for a substantial amount of time. I’ve been talking with quite a few executives and employees at Intel. It’s been a hard day here. Paul is extremely cherished and valued, and above all, this was his decision.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353348413030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:06:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353348538003-132</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Chair Bryant Tried to Get Otellini to Stay; ‘Cherished’ CEO’s Departure ‘A Hard Day’</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353348413030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:06:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He knows something we don't intel aligning deck chairs on the Titanic.....AMD us up today</Msg><Username>republican_idiot</Username><Timestamp>1353348538003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:08:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353348631444-133</Id><Topic><Title>intel will open up their foundaries</Title><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1353345450793</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:17:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>arm chips are easier to make. they can make a fortune if they could make apple's chips for them</Msg><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1353348631444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:10:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353348763450-134</Id><Topic><Title>Article says. . .</Title><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1353345928769</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:25:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Externally?

No one said anything about abandoning their current path. What they need to do is add ARM to their portfolio and produce it with their excess capacity. This does several things. First it lower their overhead cost per unit. Second it reduces new capex cost.

Frankly, I am still absorbing it. At one level, you are living through history, as we have only changed CEOs five times in our 45 years as a company. Yet change is inevitable. In our company, in our industry, and not least, in our products. For me, it was just time. Time for me to stop doing a job that I love dearly, in a company that I love deeply, a place which has given me the privilege of working everyday alongside remarkable people who have built one of the greatest companies in history. When May comes around, it will be the first time in four decades that I will not get up, dress, and clip my Intel blue badge onto my belt. Important as it has been for me to be your CEO, no individual trumps the collective strength and intelligence of our amazing company. We will thrive because of the talent, dedication and competitiveness of our people. I will remain fully engaged as CEO over the next six months and work with Andy, the Board and our management team to ensure an orderly succession. Intel will benefit now, as it has many times over the years, from Andy's steady hand and profoundly sound judgment. We both have very high confidence that our deeply experienced leadership team will continue to execute the business strategy we have laid out. Intel is a great company, and a timeless one. We evolve. We compete. We succeed where others fail. We are not the same company we were in 2005. We are not the same company I joined way back in 1974. But we are still Intel. Our values are enduring, and therefore so are we if we adhere to them. There is no perfect time to leave. But this is the right time for me to do this. I take great comfort and a good deal of pride in what we have accomplished together. Growing the company to over $50 billion in revenue, reinventing the PC, seeing the first phones and tablets for sale with Intel Inside them, and seeing the emergence of a vast network of cloud-based computing all built with our products. These are all things that were barely imaginable when I became CEO in 2005. I have been honored to work here and to lead you. I am not going away for six more months, so this is not goodbye. But it was important to me that I speak to you in my voice and share my thoughts with you.

Bohr: 3D stacked die have advantages, but only for certain market segments. You have to be very clear about what problem and what market segment you are trying to serve. For a small handheld application where a small footprint and form factor are key and power levels are low, it probably makes good sense to use 3D stacking. For desktop, laptop and server applications where form factor isn't as valuable and power levels are higher, 3D stacking has some problems that make it not an ideal solution. And his thoughts on interconnect... SMD: Is the interconnect [on chip] becoming more problematic? Bohr: If you talk to a designer 10 years ago you would have heard the same thing. Maybe now they're saying, 'This time we're really serious.' SMD: How about new interconnect technology? Bohr: It's hard to replace copper and low-k other than by making lower k. But at least in the low-power cell phone market, stacking chips does help to minimize some of the interconnect issues, particularly between the logic and the memory chips. SMD: You're referring to through-silicon vias? Bohr: Yes. SMD: So if Intel is planning to get into that market, the company is experimenting with that technology right now? Bohr: Yes, and we've been public about exploring TSV and 3D technology for a couple years. Although there are some challenging technology aspects, the real issue is cost. Doing TSVs and stacking chips -- especially these custom Wide I/O chips -- is expensive. So this might be a better engineering solution in terms of density, performance and power, but will the market bear the added cost? Not all markets will bear the higher cost. Intel to use DDR4 with TSV starting in 2014? Despite these comments, IFTLE would be remiss if we didn't point out that rumors continue to swirl that Intel will use 3D stacked DDR4 memory in their Haswell-EX platform for enterprise computing [link]. Since Haswell will feature microprocessors with 12-14 cores, it will benefit from lower memory power consumption, higher memory bandwidth, and the memory capacity that DDR3 simply cannot provide. DRAM makers will make high-capacity DDR4 chips using through-silicon-via (TSV) technology that will allow to increase capacity of memory chips at a very fast rate. For servers, special switches will be introduced to avoid one module/one channel limitation. Samsung DDR4 Indeed, Samsung demonstrated its next-generation DDR4 chips and memory modules at the Intel Developer Forum. Samsung showed a 300mm wafer of DDR4 die processed using 30 nm technology, insinuating that it could start production of DDR4 anytime the infrastructure became ready. Samsung plans to take DDR4 module speed for 2014 servers [like Haswell-EX?] to 2.666 GHz. Eventually, Samsung and Intel intend to boost the effective clock-speeds of DDR4 server memory modules to rather whopping 3.20GHz.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353353502843</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:31:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353353581653-149</Id><Topic><Title>The market is up big,</Title><Username>harlan_titusville</Username><Timestamp>1353348942283</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:15:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Market way up, INTC down... but I think it's expected.

While many will naively be cheering for this development, I have to stress that this is probably one of the worst things that Intel shareholders could have woken up to on 11/19. Some Background Before Intel CEO Paul Otellini took the helm in 2005, the company was, quite frankly, a mess. Intel - despite its huge capital and resources - was getting beaten down badly by much smaller competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), due primarily to a mismanagement of the firm's vast engineering resources. Otellini changed all of that. Under him, the firm began its "tick-tock" strategy that has ensured that in every field it plays in, the company takes the lead very quickly. While The Street's Rocco Pendola believes that it's about time, the author misses the fact that under Otellini, Intel achieved milestones that far exceed the low ASP smartphone processor market, including:  Becoming the dominant PC processor vendor by leading a crusade towards ever-improving performance-per-watt and system integration  Becoming the dominant server processor vendor (i.e. owning HPC, cloud, etc.)  Scoring the Apple (AAPL) design win in the Mac products (Intel is now in the iMac, MacBook, MacPro, and MacMini)  Became the #2 contributor to the Linux kernel (which was instrumental in getting Android up and running on x86 so quickly)  Got Intel through the financial crisis without cutting its core R&amp;D This led to record revenues in 2011 at a staggering $54B, up 23% from 2010. Paul Otellini has been an excellent CEO, and he was one of the major reasons that I am bullish on Intel's prospects. What's Next? Well, Intel has 6 months to find a new CEO. The firm noted in its press release that the hunt for the new executive will include combing through internal and external candidates. As an Intel shareholder, I would be much more comfortable with an internal candidate than an external one simply because there are no other companies out there that are like Intel. Who else has both leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing as well as leading edge design in everything from mobile SoCs to the biggest of the big iron server processors along with the software expertise to fully utilize it? Nobody. The candidates internally seem to be:  Renee James - Head of the software business  Brian Krzanich - COO and head of the manufacturing business  Stacy Smith - CFO and director of corporate strategy I would personally bank on Mr. Krzanich given how well the manufacturing side of Intel has been run, but it is too early to rule out the other candidates. Externally? It is tough to imagine who else would be qualified for the job, although I am sure that we will get more clarity on this in the coming months. Conclusion Otellini's retirement is not a good thing and shareholders have every right to be nervous. This CEO turned Intel into an execution machine after years of missteps (like the Pentium 4 disaster - the chip was hot, power hungry, and inferior to the competition). http://seekingalpha.com/article/1018081-intel-retirement-of-ceo-paul-otellini-is-bad-news?source=email_rt_mc_focus&amp;ifp=0</Msg><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1353362701022</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:05:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353362797674-198</Id><Topic><Title>A message from Paul Otellini to employees</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353351443161</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:57:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry, the i cores are based on the AMD64!

I've never seen anything about Intel's strategy having anything to do with "mobile division hotheads" or wild predictions. Intel has never made any wild predictions in regards to mobility. They have studiously avoided them. Intel's strategy mirrors their earlier and wildly successful ones used to take over major markets. It's not an instantaneous, hot-headed approach. It's a calm, methodical approach. They've taken the time to prepare the foundation needed to win in mobility. They have laid out the steps and know if they just follow the path they will be extremely successful. The fruit of that labor is just starting to arrive. We'll see it arrive in 2013, starting with LTE offerings in the US. The new Intel tablet reference design is very promising. After 2013 Intel is going to own the power efficiency crown. In the meantime, ARM's foundries continue to struggle as their fabrication improvements grind to a halt. They will be paused at 14nm for so long it's going to look like they are parked. They have EUV and 450mm to deal with along with trying to find huge sums of money. Intel will have a huge lead in manufacturing capacity and technology. The ARM stock price is puffed up a like a blow fish. Intel has never been such a great buy. Those who continue to advocate shorting Intel are shills getting paid by the post. The recent (resurrected) story about Apple dumping Intel was such horse malarky yet the tech media distributed it everywhere. There wasn't a single bit of new information. You have to admire the manipulative abilities of the big Wall Street firm skumbags. Very impressive. As well as their just pure dumb luck. But it hasn't changed the value of Intel. Wait and watch. This story is a long ways from being over. We've had a dip while Intel gets traction on its mobility strategy. The economy and the politicians trying to tank the economy haven't helped. But economic recovery and energy independence are on the way. Building capacity during tough times will turn out to be a major key to Intel's success. It ain't over til it's over. It ain't over... *** It's not the will to win that matters...everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters.

The quad-core Bay Trail-T processor is due for a release in 2014, which is said to be due for a reveal during CES 2013, as well as the unveiling of the Bay Trail-T-powered tablets manufacturers are working on. The chip will launch in a SoC codenamed Valleyview-T. Although it'll be a few years late to the market, the chip will compete with Nvidia's Tegra 3 and Qualcomm's S4. The Bay Trail-T utilizes a 22nm core process (unlike the existing Clover Trail chip), with Intel promising that it'll result in half the the power requirements, leading to 50 to 60 percent improvement in performance for tablets. Intel's slides suggests users will be able to play over 11 hours of video from one charge. Other features the new chips would bring is higher memory capacity, better audio quality and superior graphics performance. The leaked roadmap also confirms the option to include cameras that has the ability to record 3D video.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353386094305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:34:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353386485751-233</Id><Title>The entire PC world is suffering.

Only Apple and Samsung are doing well.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1353386485751</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:41:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353386757206-234</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT: The Market top is now in IMO &gt;</Title><Username>kored35</Username><Timestamp>1334861831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-04-19 14:57:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talk about a thread that has stood the test of time... The market is going to go up eventually secondary to devaluation of the dollar - the hyper inflation you spoke of in one of your earlier posts. Once the market finds it's new high, it will go sideways for a long time (with swings of 10% up and 10% down). The best thing to play is dividend paying stocks when it's up, 3X leveraged ETFs when it is down. Easy stuff. All IMO of course.</Msg><Username>boprn</Username><Timestamp>1353386757206</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:45:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353387520819-235</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Bay Trail, Valleyview Atom Tablet Chip Roadmap Leaks</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353386094305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:34:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mobilegeeksDOTcom/leaked-intel-atom-tablet-roadmap-bay-trail-t-valley-view-t-detailed</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1353387520819</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:58:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
