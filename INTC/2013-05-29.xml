Lenovo may be best known for its laptops outside of China, but it’s recently become the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the country, a position which prompted Yang to consider further international expansion. In 2011, analysts at IDC put Lenovo’s share of the Chinese smartphone market at just over 4 percent, but come the end of 2012, this figure had risen to 11 percent, and the company is now second only to Samsung. Lenovo already sells its phones in important emerging markets such as India and Indonesia – efforts which at the end of 2013, saw it become a top five contender in the worldwide smartphone manufacturer charts – but it’s going to face a far harder challenge if it wants a degree of success in the U.S. The massive Lenovo K900 (with Intel Inside), which recently went on sale in China following its CES 2013 launch, is an example of the hardware which the company could use to spearhead its U.S. campaign. It’s a powerful, attractive device with a suitably impressive spec sheet...

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369816169590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 04:29:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369816191227-10</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369816169590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 04:29:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes they are in trouble</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369816191227</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 04:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369823823734-11</Id><Topic><Title>More Comments from the ARM London Message Board</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369805065349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:24:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LTE/4G networks remain scarce in most of the world's markets where 3G technology continues to be dominant.

In fact, if you even think of going long on Intel, you are laughed at. Intel is thus stuck in the inertia of Show me the money. Intel stock goes north only after and not before Intel delivers.

While Intel seems poised for success in smartphones, tablets and has potential in many other endeavors an investor today in Intel should b prepared to wait at least a year to see if the company's strategy is successful-In the meantime collect your dividend. A year from now investors may be kicking themselves for not buying in now or giving in to the naysayers and selling early. Anyway it promises to be a roller coaster ride with many ups and downs before we see results.</Msg><Username>kip_castle</Username><Timestamp>1369836723488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369837516142-35</Id><Topic><Title>Only just a matter of time before</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1369836391880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:06:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wish....not looking like it though is it?</Msg><Username>albchem</Username><Timestamp>1369837516142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:25:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369837541512-36</Id><Topic><Title>A good day for me and one for you.

This Haswell Core i3 tablet will cannibalize a Haswell Core i3 PC according to the IDC definitions of tablet and PC. Acer readying new Windows 8 tablet sporting Haswell processor By Mike E on May 29, 2013 There is a report claiming that Acer is almost ready to launch a new 11.6" tablet that will sport Intel's latest Haswell processor. With Intel’s latest Haswell processor about ready to be unleashed on the masses, it is reasonable to expect that many manufacturers will begin updating their lines of tablets and ultrabooks to include them. Acer has been rumored to be cooking up a few Windows 8 tablets. First there was word about the 8-inch windows RT device they were about to release, and now there is word of a larger one that will run Windows 8 Pro. The information comes from a report on the Greek website Techblog.gr, and it states that Acer is almost ready to launch a new tablet with the codename Acer Bulgari. The device is rumored to have the following specs. • 11.6” display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 • Intel Core i3 processor (Haswell) • 4GB RAM • 64GB storage • Memory card slot included • 8 megapixel camera There is no word on possible pricing, but the report does mention that it should be officially launched in the next month, which doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility. Expect to hear a lot more news about new Windows 8 hardware running the latest Haswell processors in the near future.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1369838187615</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:36:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369838197103-40</Id><Topic><Title>A good day for me and one for you.

Commenting, Goldman analyst Donald Lu said, "We view the announcement as incrementally positive to TSMC shares as it suggests FinFET progress will be on par or ahead of Intel's(Nasdaq: INTC) major foundry customers'. TSMC's accelerated time to market of FinFET validates its superior execution and should help to deter major competitors, in our view. We continue to expect TSMC to gain market share and surpass Intel and Samsung LSI in capex in 2014-2015." Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Tablet sales are projected to grow 50%. "The PC is Dead" missed the mark. It should read, "The Laptop is Dead, the PC is a commodity." I believe people will prefer tablets to laptops for ease of use/keyboard cover/weight. IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo... low margin, low labor costs, high volume. HP and Dell are getting squeezed on margins because they did not adapt, so people see them losing growth, so the sky is falling. Lenovo is growing (almost doubling) each year, picking up the slack of HP, Dell, et al. IBM is in talks to sell its server business to Lenovo, but can't agree on price... fair warning server makers. Smartphones sales are projected to grow by more than 50%, and are growing in triple digits (sub $100) in the China, India, and the rest of Asia. Lenovo again. I'm not a Lenovo cheerleader, nor do I own stock. I'm just illustrating that the box the computer/laptop/tablet/phone comes in doesn't matter to the 4 billion people on the planet who still don't have any form of computer. The box is a commodity. People in Africa still use Nokia phones because of frequent blackouts. They can have one charge last three days. The smartphone market is still sub-15% penetration there. Low margin commodity will penetrate first.

What are the chances that there will be "Intel Inside". Dennis Woodside, chief executive of Google's GOOG -1.47% Motorola MSI -0.36% Mobility unit, confirmed the company will introduce a high-end smartphone called Moto X. Unlike virtually all other smartphones, the device will be built in the U.S.–in a facility outside of Fort Worth, Texas. The Wall Street Journal reported late last year that Motorola Mobility was working on a high-end smartphone, codenamed the X phone. Woodside made the comments at the D: All Things Digital conference. All Things D and The Wall Street Journal share a parent company News Corp NWSA -1.32%. Motorola Mobility has lost sales ground to emerging handset rivals such as Samsung Electronics, which like Motorola makes smartphones powered by Google’s Android software. But Woodside said Motorola is relaunching its entire product lineup between now and October. He said Motorola won’t make dozens of phones, but instead will concentrate on a handful that will show where the company is going under Google’s ownership. “We’re turning the corner,” Woodside said. Woodside said the Texas facility that will built the Moto X will employ 2,000 people before August. He acknowledged some of the essential parts for the phone are from international providers. The Moto X, he said, will have advanced sensors and will be “contextually aware” of what’s going on around it. Woodside didn’t disclose the price of the new phones, but he did say Motorola can afford to sell smartphones at smaller profit margins than other handset makers.</Msg><Username>dewey_duhawk</Username><Timestamp>1369873573507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:26:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369874632849-117</Id><Title>Wednesday Apple Rumors: WWDC to See Debut of New Macs, iOS 7</Title><Msg>Here are your Apple rumors and AAPL news items for today: Waiting: Speculation is swirling over what products Apple (AAPL) might announce at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), AppleInsider notes. The WWDC will be held in San Francisco early next month and is a platform for Apple executives to unveil or at least hint at new devices and software. According to journalist Jim Dalrymple, the company will not debut a new iPhone or iPad, but will show off new Macs. The updated Macs may feature Intel‘s (INTC) new Haswell processors. Available inventories of MacBook Air computers have been shrinking as the WWDC approaches, signaling that an updated MacBook Air could be one device debuted that the event. Apple watchers are also looking for possible refreshes to the Mac Mini, Mac Pro and Macbook Pro lines. Apple is also widely expected to launch a new version of iOS at the WWDC. Reports indicate that iOS 7 has received a complete makeover directed by Apple’s lead designer Jony Ive and could represent a major departure from prior versions of the software. Dalrymple, however, thinks that changes to iOS 7 will be more modest.
