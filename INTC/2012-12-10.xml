It said it will make effective immediately its Intel central processing units (CPUs), motherboards and solid-state drives, and that it will work with multinational brands to support their entry to Burma. “We are encouraged by developments in Myanmar and believe that now is the right time for Intel to be supporting the nation's growth,” said Uday Marty, managing director of Intel's business in Southeast Asia. “Intel looks forward to being a partner to Myanmar. Our support will include both our leading technologies and education programmes, which together make a difference to nations globally. “Intel will focus its skills and resources in ways which can improve the social and economic welfare and prospects of the people of Myanmar. In addition to our technologies, it is our intention to explore partnerships with the Myanmar government on education and digital literacy in 2013,” Marty said. Intel's Thailand office will reportedly play a significant leadership role in sales and marketing. “As the world leader and innovator in technology development, Intel believes that technology has tremendous potential to improve lives and position nations for greater global competitiveness,” Marty said.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1355146993561</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 08:43:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355147181918-4</Id><Topic><Title>INTC will rule the cloud</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1354911571979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:19:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you promote an inferior Limey product over a vastly superior made in America one?</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1355147181918</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 08:46:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355148564851-5</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola Atom Razr I beats ARM dual-core Razr M in battery</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355093534769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:52:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>link?</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1355148564851</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:09:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355148960467-6</Id><Title>Motley Fool</Title><Msg>Does it get any worse than Motley Fool?

ET . Intel: Miller Tabak Cuts Target to $23; PC Data Suggest Weak December . By Tiernan Ray Shares of Intel (INTC) are down 7 cents, or 0.4%, at $20.09 after Miller Tabak’s Brendan Furlong this morning reiterated a Neutral rating on the shares and cut his price target to $23 from $25, after trimming his estimates for 2013 for revenue and gross profit margin, warning that data on the “build rate” of original design manufacturers (ODM) of PCs are “softer than expected” for December, and that “Weaker demand into a seasonally strong quarter is not a good sign for Intel.” Total ODM revenue appears to have dipped 5% in November, he writes, whereas “historically November has seen positive trends before a seasonal decline in December. ” Adds Furlong, “On a quarterly basis, year over year growth continues to be very weak.” He’s modeling 5% total quarter-to-quarter growth for the December quarter, down from 7% growth in the same period a year earlier, and a decline of 8%, down from a 1% decline in 2011′s Q4. Despite an attractive valuation and dividend, Furlong advises holding off on the shares until PC data reach a floor: Intel is suffering from a double headwind of negative PC market growth and excess inventory. We see these issues lasting into 2013. Until the company gets inventory under control, so that gross margins can put in a bottom, we do not see investors rushing to buy the stock. We think the company can eventually get inventory under control but it is tough to tell when the rot stops in the PC market. The stock has declined significantly in the last several months and valuation appears to be attractive. The dividend is also attractive at these price levels. While the valuation and dividend are attractive, we are maintaining our Neutral stance on the shares until we see some signs of stabilization in the PC and server markets. For the current quarter, Furlong cut his estimates for Intel to $13.3 billion and 43 cents a share in profit from a prior $13.5 billion and 45 cents. That is below the Street consensus of $13.54 billion and 45 cents a share. For 2013, he models $52.9 billion and $1.70, down from a prior $54.4 billion and $1.93. That is below the consensus $54.36 billion and $1.96.</Msg><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1355157406544</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:36:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355158648024-18</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Miller Tabak Cuts Target to $23; PC Data Suggest Weak December</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1355157406544</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:36:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember when you, Lucifer, downgraded it to 15 last year before it ran to 29+? hahahahahaha</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1355158648024</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355159652599-19</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola Atom Razr I beats ARM dual-core Razr M in battery</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355093534769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:52:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Medield is not two cores but two threads and you already know that Geekbench is recording it incorrectly so no need to repost the error.

November 22, 2010, 10:31 AM ET. INTC: Beware The Tablet Effect, Says FBR. Add FBR Capital’s Craig Berger to the list of folks warning of poor trends in the PC business. Eric, in his column over the weekend, noted the trend to recent low-balling of Q4 by Dell (DELL), and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as Chris Danely with JP Morgan warnings of Asian supply chain weakness. But not just any weakness: tablets such as Apple’s (AAPL) iPad are cannibalizing the PC, writes Berger. Berger this morning writes that his checks of the supply chain recently are “slightly weaker” as concerns Q4 notebook PC builds than they were a month ago. For Intel (INTC), he thinks “tepid” growth in notebook units and “slight shrinkage” for desktops means the company will trend toward the lower end of its forecast for the quarter of $11 billion to $11.8 billion. “The math on tablets is not good for PCs,” writes Berger. “We think every two tablets sold is in place of a PC,” citing grandma, the person who just wants to read email. Berger sees Apple producing 40 million tablets in 2011, and Samsung (SSNLF), Research in Motion (RIMM) and others producing a combined 30 million, cannibalizing 28 million PCs.</Msg><Username>lucifer_numbnuts</Username><Timestamp>1355164212154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:30:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355165242618-27</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Miller Tabak Cuts Target to $23; PC Data Suggest Weak December</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1355157406544</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:36:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>loser</Msg><Username>gordon939</Username><Timestamp>1355165242618</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:47:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355165352102-28</Id><Topic><Title>Can INTC lose even more than today?</Title><Username>bellpeter550</Username><Timestamp>1355163285810</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:14:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing</Msg><Username>burkeeric24</Username><Timestamp>1355165352102</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:49:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355165461689-29</Id><Topic><Title>Lucifer Nuff's life hasn't gotten any better in 2 years</Title><Username>lucifer_numbnuts</Username><Timestamp>1355164212154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:30:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Imagine lying on your deathbed thinking you wasted your adult life bashing Intel and trying to run the US economy into the dirt.

Taiwan Semiconductor: Apple's New Friend Has Big Upside December 10, 2012 | 4 commentsby: Mike Williams | about: TSM, includes: AAPL Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. (More...) Though the investment community is infatuated with the daily swings in Apple's (AAPL) share price, the major opportunities have been in the shares of firms within the tech-giant's supply chain. Investors in Cirrus Logic (CRUS) who entered positions in early 2012 are sitting on a 200% return (with a 52-week high that allows for 300% gains) as a result of the massive revenues generated from three Cirrus audio chips in the iPad mini and iPhone 5. Arm Holdings (ARMH) has also had an excellent 2012, now trading near its 52-week high thanks to its integration into Apple's mobile products. Perhaps the least discussed Apple derivative play is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Shares are up nearly 31% on the year, largely in part to realized revenue gains from its part in Apple's supply chain, and speculation centered around major potential future deals. TSM's Story Taiwan Semiconductor is the biggest pure-play semiconductor foundry in the world. TSM produces the semiconductor concepts for large tech firms such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Altera (ALTR), Broadcom (BCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA). Revenue growth exploded in Q3, up 33% year over year; returns on equity were exceptional, above 30%. TSM is planning on CAPEX of nearly $9 billion, up significantly from 2011 in response to flourishing wafer demand. Currently Apple sources its A5, A6, and A6X processers from Samsung (SSNLF.PK), which is a relationship that Apple is obviously trying to break due to patent fights and general product competition between the two. A year ago, such a move was potentially illegal. The early designs had input from Samsung, and thus some intellectual property that Apple didn't own. Asking TSM to produce the processors would have led to major lawsuits against Apple. However, Apple is the sole designer of the new A6 and A6X processors used in iPads and the iPhone 5. Samsung currently produces the A6 using a lower power 32-nm technology, but rumor has it Apple is experimenting with production utilizing TSM's even higher quality 28-nm tech. This rumor doesn't appear to be simple speculation. Apple and Qualcomm already unsuccessfully attempted to gain sole access to TSM's fab capacity, and TSM's gargantuan capital expenditure plans implies that the company is preparing for demand that would have a transformative impact on the firm's bottom line. In regards to TSM's 20nm process, J.T HSU, an analyst from Citigroup Global Markets, was quoted as saying, Volume production is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2013, raising the possibility that TSMC will hike capital expenditure to US$11-12 billion in 2013 and 2014. Conclusions There is a major shakeup underway in the Apple supply chain, and it looks like TSM is going to be the major beneficiary. The ultimate effect on the bottom line is difficult to project, but if the management of TSM sees the need to for almost $9 bb in CAPEX this year, with projections of another $2-3 bb over the next two, the potential is quite exciting. With next generation iPads, iPhones, and an Apple TV in the works, TSM has earnings growth potential that its current valuation (16.5, in-line with the broader market multiple) simply doesn't reflect. The company has a net-cash position of $1.5 billion, little debt, and pays a solid dividend of 2.3%. While TSM's main upside is dependent on its relationship with Apple, the company is well diversified and management is (so far at least) unwilling to allocate too large a portion of its capacity to just one customer. TSM's overall competitive position, competent management, strong balance sheet, and growth prospects offer an apparent asymmetric risk-reward return profile; I recommend purchasing shares of TSM at current prices and on any pullbacks.</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1355170348225</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:12:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355170464858-39</Id><Topic><Title>Lucifer Nuff's life hasn't gotten any better in 2 years</Title><Username>lucifer_numbnuts</Username><Timestamp>1355164212154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:30:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Effwad: Tell everyone about 30 and how much fun it is getting there.

(NIR ELIAS) More Intel coverage Latest news More about CEO Paul Otellini Market update: INTC SEC filings Company profile SAN FRANCISCO -- Intel (INTC) presented new manufacturing technology that it said keeps it on track to launch a new generation of chips for smartphones and tablets as it rushes to catch up with Qualcomm and other rivals in the fast-growing mobile market. The world's largest chipmaker dominates the PC industry but has been slow to adapt its processors for mobile gadgets that depend on batteries and demand power efficiency. At an industry conference in San Francisco on Monday, Santa Clara-based Intel reported on the progress of its technology for making SoCs, or "systems-on-a-chip" with features measuring 22 nanometers. "Intel's 22 nm SoC technology will be ready for high volume manufacturing in 2013," Intel said in a copy of the presentation. Intel's current mobile SoCs are manufactured at 32 nm, while Qualcomm makes its top-end SoCs at 28 nm and Nvidia uses 40 nm technology. Manufacturing chips with smaller features allows for better performance and power efficiency. Intel already makes PC processors at 22 nm, but since SoCs pack more features onto one piece of silicon, manufacturing them at 22 nm is more complicated, said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights &amp; Analysis. "They (Intel) have all the right ingredients to make a very competitive mobile chip, but we won't know Advertisement if they do until 2013," Moorhead said. While Intel's industry lead in manufacturing technology is well-established, competitors and many on Wall Street say the chipmaker's mobile SoC designs do not stand up to SoCs designed by Qualcomm, Apple (AAPL) and others with technology licensed from Britain's ARM Holdings.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1355179180835</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 17:39:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355179362740-69</Id><Topic><Title>TXN vs INTC</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1355175659719</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 16:40:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world needs analog more than digital.

Naturally, Otellini is confident about the transition to 450mm and EUV manufacturing, since Intel is leading the way in cutting edge manufacturing processes and it has done so for years. Transitioning to 450mm will result in cheaper chips, something that Intel desperately needs to take on the ARM alliance in smartphone and tablet markets.

As process nodes shrink and more components move on-die, the characteristics of each new node have become particularly important. 22nm isn’t a new node for Intel; it debuted the technology last year with Ivy Bridge, but SoCs are more complex than CPU designs and create their own set of challenges. Like its 22nm Ivy Bridge CPUs, the upcoming 22nm SoCs rely on Intel’s Tri-Gate implementation of FinFET technology. According to Intel engineer Mark Bohr, the 3D transistor structure is the principle reason why the company’s 22nm technology is as strong as it is. Other evidence backs up this point. Earlier this year, we brought you news that Nvidia was deeply concerned about manufacturing economics and the relative strength of TSMC’s sub-28nm planar roadmap. Morris Chang, TSMC’s CEO, has since admitted that such concerns are valid, given that performance and power are only expected to increase by 20-25% as compared to 28nm. Intel, in contrast, is predicting record gains. The company claims that its 28nm SoC “employs high speed logic transistors, low standby power transistors, and high-voltage tolerant transistors in a single SoC chip to support a wide range of products, including premium smart phones, tablets, netbooks, embedded systems, wireless communications, and ASIC products.” The company reports enormous improvements in leakage currents and Intel plans to take full advantage of the improved performance.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355187440344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:57:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355187647701-77</Id><Topic><Title>Intel unveils 22nm SoC transistors, while TSMC and GlobalFoundries plan risky process jumps</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355187440344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The challenge for both TSMC and GlobalFoundries is going to be how to match the performance of Intel’s 22nm technology with their own 28nm products. 20nm looks like it won’t be able to do so, which is why both companies are emphasizing their plans to move to 16nm/14nm ahead of schedule. There’s some variation on which node comes next; both GlobalFoundries and Intel are talking up 14nm; TSMC is implying a quick jump to 16nm. I don’t want to say too much on how the three companies’ future processes might compare; tech papers at IEDM may shed more light on the particulars of each solution. What’s clear is that both GF and TSMC are going to try to accelerate FinFET development. GF’s tech papers imply that the company will deploy a hybrid 22nm-14nm process to make the jump more quickly.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355187647701</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 20:00:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355187711573-78</Id><Topic><Title>Intel unveils 22nm SoC transistors, while TSMC and GlobalFoundries plan risky process jumps</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355187440344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will it work? Unknown. TSMC and GlobalFoundries both have excellent engineers, but FinFET is a difficult technology to deploy. Ramping it up more quickly than expected while simultaneously bringing up a new process may be more difficult than either company anticipates. Given the advantages Intel claims for the technology, it might’ve made more sense to ramp FinFET on an established node. One of the most significant demonstrations of what Intel thinks it’s getting out of 22nm FinFET is the company’s decision to revise Atom for an out-of-order architecture. Intel has resisted the call to overhaul the in-order CPU; the current core at the heart of Medfield and Clover Trail offers nearly identical performance to the design that debuted in 2008. 22nm Atom should close the gap with existing ARM CPUs and give Intel a substantial advantage. Overall, the situation looks like Intel holds the cards until GF and TSMC manage to revise their roadmaps for the sub-20nm market.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355187711573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 20:01:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355188724244-79</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola Atom Razr I beats ARM dual-core Razr M in battery</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355093534769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:52:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A multi-core benchmark is not the same as a multi-threaded benchmark.

Sylvie Barak 12/10/2012 4:30 PM EST Scalable roadmap Ultimately, said Bohr, the distinction between regular processors and SoCs is blurring, with even CPUs like Ivy Bridge incorporating typical SoC elements like multiple computing cores, graphics, high performance IO circuits and cache. SoC,s however, are still taking those components to the extreme. “It’s a matter of degree,” Bohr said. Indeed, Intel’s SoC is almost identical to its CPU version in terms of structure, including only some “minor tweaking” to provide either the lower leakage or higher volatage. It could even be described as a “superset” of the CPU version with expanded features. The SoC and CPU versions share many of the same process features; the same transistor structure and pitch along with similar interconnect and fab process equipment. “These two technologies can be run side by side in the same factory,” said Bohr, noting that all the yield learning for Ivy Bridge had been translatable. Bohr acknowledged that SoCs had presented Intel with new challenges. “When you talk about leakage, once you get down into the below 30 pico amp range, you have to deal with multiple sources of leakage, whether it’s through the gate oxide or leakage from source to drain or leakage from the drain to the substrate,” he said, adding that it had taken a lot of “tweaking an balancing” to finally get it right. The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said. In terms of how Intel’s 22-nm SoC process stacks up against the 28-nm low power or forthcoming 20-nm processes from TSMC, Bohr claimed Intel had “far surpassed” the performance and low leakage capabilities of competitors. “We have a significant lead over our competitors,” he asserted. Intel is also banking on he new technology process having a long tail. “We know that it’s scalable to 14-nm,” he said, concluding that tri-gate was not only a big power advantage for Intel’s CPUs, but for other low power SoCs.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1355190300684</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 20:45:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355192257415-83</Id><Title>• Could Intel Raise Its Dividend 50%?</Title><Msg>Eric (Motely's article ) - sure can</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1355192257415</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:17:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355192770963-84</Id><Title>Intel likely to FoundryCisco and Apple chips</Title><Msg>Apple would likely switch over to using Intel CPUs for all o9f its products but phones.

The chip giant outlined this new path for its ultra-low power System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designs in a paper presented at the 2012 International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in San Francisco. But Intel isn't just relying on die shrinks. The company said it will move its Atom SoC platform to 22nm differently than it did with Core and Xeon. "This SoC variant of Intel's 22nm logic process differs from the original CPU variant, which entered production in late 2011, by being optimized for low power SoC products," Intel spokesperson Chuck Mulloy told PCMag in an email. The new twist on Intel's 22nm process "incorporates low standby power and high voltage transistors together with high-speed logic transistors in a single SoC chip to achieve industry leading drive currents (a measure of performance) and record low leakage levels (a measure of power)," he added.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355194550169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:55:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355194637255-90</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Ready to Take On ARM With 22nm Chips</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355194550169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:55:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Designers of Intel's next-gen SoCs will have a great deal of flexibility in mixing and matching different types of transistors, high-density interconnects, and RF/mixed-signal features, Mulloy said. The authors of the IEDM paper elaborated further, saying that Intel is the first company to develop "a leading edge 22nm SoC process technology featuring 3D tri-gate transistors which employs high speed logic transistors, low standby power transistors, and high-voltage tolerant transistors simultaneously in a single SoC chip to support a wide range of products, including premium smartphones, tablets, netbooks, embedded systems, wireless communications, and ASIC products." The company actually revealed the general shape of its 22nm SoC strategy at the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco earlier this year—specifically talking about its ability to optimize next-gen products for performance or low power leakage. The IEDM paper simply reveals a lot more technical details about how Intel does that.

They are thoughtful, deliberate and years in the making, unlike today's announcement. Twenty years ago Otellini and Andy Bryant were in the top echelon of Andy Grove’s executive team and yet Otellini was already known to be the eventual successor to Craig Barrett (who took Grove's place). Otellini’s understanding of the PC market gave him the edge over Bryant who would take the position of CFO in 1994 and hold it for 13 years. Since Intel’s market valuation peak in 2000, the company's x86 business has underperformed while process development has outperformed and is about to reach a 4 year lead relative to the rest of the industry. Since leaving his CFO post, Bryant has focused on Intel's manufacturing excellence and in a sense outperformed Otellini's side of the business. Bryant’s work in this area led to his elevation as Chairman of the Board this past May. What is transpiring now is the most radical transformation of the company since Grove and Moore exited the DRAM business in the early 1980s in order to focus on the nascent, yet highly profitable and growing x86 processor business that powered the PC revolution. Foundry now will reign supreme. If one goes back and reviews the presentations given to the investment community for the past three years, one will see that there is a constant theme that Intel’s growing process technology lead will eventually propel them to a leadership position in the PC and new Mobile world. It worked perfectly in the 1990s, however the center of gravity in computing architecture now is driven by the new ARM based ecosystems (iOS, Andorid etc.) and by the valuable baseband communications capability led by Qualcomm. Playing catch up is not what Intel is good at unless it is on the x86 architecture driven by the Microsoft Windows. The overwhelming success of Apple’s iPAD and Qualcomm’s 4G LTE silicon are the two significant high points of the year and yet imagine how much further ahead Qualcomm would be if they could have met the step function demand for their new chips.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1355195202266</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 22:06:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355195269710-93</Id><Topic><Title>Intel likely to FoundryCisco and Apple chips</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1355192770963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:26:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple’s iPAD came into the world as an underpowered Internet screen and has been transformed this past year with the high-resolution screen and the new A6X processor into a mobile computing platform that can more than hold their own in the business world against x86 mobiles. Meanwhile the recently introduced iPAD Mini looks to be ready to cannibalize the sub $400 home PC markets. AMD felt the effect first and now it looks like Intel will take the all important step of breaking away from its reliance on x86 PCs and become a Foundry to the broader mobile computing world. I see it as a much better position than what Microsoft faces. Wintel is broken. The transition that is about to occur for Intel may take place much faster than people believe. Looking back it now appears that a game of chicken was set in motion two years ago by Otellini, Bryant and the Board of Directors over the future of the company. If, Intel truly was going to be 4 years ahead of the industry by the time 14nm ramped then they should build a fab footprint that should serve the majority of the leading edge process silicon of the world. This meant doubling Intel’s wafer starts at a cost of $25B. Meanwhile Otellini had to execute on a plan to not just grow x86 mobiles but to win the smartphone and tablet market. On this score, Otellini was not able to execute fast enough or we can say the market outran him. Therefore, what is likely to happen is a retreat in the product development of x86 smartphone solutions, including baseband silicon to remove any competitive barriers to bringing Apple, Qualcomm and others on board. There is no doubt in my mind that there have been foundry discussions between Intel and Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom and even nVidia. My guess is that Bryant has led this side of the business while Otellini focused on Intel’s traditional business. Now that the PC market is shrinking, Intel is at 50% Fab utilization at 22nm and the company’s valuation has dropped to $100B, below that of Qualcomm, there was a need to change the business model. There is little time to waste for Intel to leverage its assets. Apple is working on a transition plan to TSMC that is supposedly starting late next year in 20nm. Given their growth rate and the need to reduce geographic and Geopolitical Risk (EU, USA employment, antitrust and tariffs) it will be necessary to diversify their foundry business to worldwide locations. Only Intel can offer this to Apple with its fabs in the USA, Ireland and Israel. An Intel retreat on Atom and a friendlier wafer supply agreement should open the doors to an Apple partnership for leading edge capacity that heretofore was only given to x86 components. Apple’s A6 and A6X processors will now offer Intel better margins than consumer x86 processors – this is a first. Intel’s 14nm process will offer Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom and the rest of the industry power and cost savings that are tremendous and as I expect will generate for Intel better margins than what TSMC receives. Intel’s current market cap is roughly $100B. TSMC at 40% of Intel’s revenue is at an $80B market cap. If Intel were to split into three companies: Datacenter, x86 client and Foundry, then one could see a significant increase in valuation. The Datacenter business, if it was fabless and valued like F5 would be worth nearly $60B as both companies make roughly 80% Gross Margins. The Foundry business, if it were to win 50% of Apple’s and Qualcomm’s business could bring in $10B in a run rate revenue by end of 2013, offsetting much of the loss in the x86 client business. But that is just the beginning as companies like Apple ramp from 300MU to 1BU+ in the next few years. Over the course of the next year Andy Bryant will have to fill 3 leading edge fabs as the ramp for 14nm starts. If he accomplishes that goal, look for a major consolidation in the semiconductor Foundry industry as the value shifts away from the old 350MU PC semiconductor supply chain to the 1BU+, extremely low power, leading-edge mobile semiconductor key components. As mentioned earlier this year when Qualcomm was overwhelmed with orders for its 4G LTE chips, we are now witnessing an industry that has an insatiable demand for leading edge process technology. Until now Intel was hamstrung from pursuing what is the future Billion Unit market, now it is in the hands of the manufacturing guys. The irony may be that Intel has come full circle.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1355195269710</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 22:07:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355195953020-94</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola Atom Razr I beats ARM dual-core Razr M in battery</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355093534769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 17:52:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and it is still using 32 nano silicon.

The 8 signified that it had 8 kb of memory. One of our classes (called a Lab) used giant (8" by 10") boxes which contained about about 8 flip flops and we were taught Boolean Algebra (AND, OR, NOR gates, lol). So, that class lasted 4 months. Oh, the PDP-8s were made by a company called Digital Equiptment Corp (up in Braintree or possible Boston). DEC came to our school every 4 months to recruit new workers, as did National Cash Register in Cambridge, Ohio. By the time I left school in '73 the PDP-8s had doubled in memory. My point is that since then, computing power doubles every 18 months, that's why we have personal computers on our desk top and #$%$ Tracy type radios on our wrists. Intel isn't going anywhere soon, and since as I stated computing power doubles, and we still don't know when it will start to level off, it's open to ones imagination where you will see IC's and CPUs.
