It's that simple, content providers want to bring Live TV to every device in order to generate more revenue thru ads. Don't worry about data cap issue being brought up by this sanddollars586 fellow; if content providers are willing to work with Intel, they will go all the way with Intel; they will fight the comcast, dish etc on Intel's behalf. And can you imagine the backlash that would be created if comcast or another internet providers start putting a cap on data? That's like go back to last decade; no, there is no question that Live TV will be made available to internet audience sooner or later.</Msg><Username>iltm_29</Username><Timestamp>1364360547752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 01:02:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364360942899-4</Id><Title>I can't wait to get a Haswell-based Surface Pro</Title><Msg>The only flaw to Surface Pro right now that I can see is the battery life.

Rumors have been circulating since at least December that the chip giant is working on its own set-top box and hopes to pair it with a "virtual cable" service that offers unbundled channels. Of course, content creators are reticent to give up the lucrative package deals they've struck, which require providers to serve up smaller outlets alongside popular ones. But the tides are starting to shift, and many are demanding that these channels be offered à la carte. According to Bloomberg, Intel is getting close to offering such a service and is reportedly closing in on deals with Time Warner, Viacom and NBC that would allow them to offer both live and on-demand content over the internet. Sources are reporting that the broad terms of the deal have been agreed to, and its only a few fine details and some financial terms that need to be finalized. Intel is also allegedly in talks with Disney, CBS and News Corp. Though, those negotiations are in the preliminary stages. If Intel can successfully land deals for CNN, Comedy Central, MTV and other properties owned by its supposed new partners then its TV experiment could stand a legitimate chance at success.

CCUR holds the largest global video on demand technology market share with a reach of 50mm homes across 4 continents. CCUR's business is set to boom big this year as cable TV operators invest heavily to upgrade their systems for multi-screen video delivery. CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen video delivery platform was just selected by a $23 billion company Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK, who is using it to power their new Virgin TV Anywhere service that allows their 3.8mm subscribers to watch on demand content from any location on their tablets and smartphones! CCUR has best looking chart possible and could explode beginning Tuesday! Their #1 competitor Seachange (SEAC) just hit a new 52-week high and is now trading with enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.9, which would make CCUR a $15.60 per share stock! Just an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1 would value CCUR at $9.50.

Consumers could pay for data incrementally like they pay for electricity or water and their bill would vary every month, or they can have tiered service with defined quantities of data so that their monthly bills will be the same predictable amount. Most broadband providers and consumers prefer tiered service over incremental pricing. There needs to be a way to distinguish between one tier and another so caps are a necessary attribute of tiers. Unlimited communication services can sometimes be accommodated by providers during temporary periods of overbuilt infrastructure and excess capacity, but that is only temporary because there is no economic principle that exempts Internet access from the laws of economics.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364385663526</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 08:01:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364386207582-14</Id><Topic><Title>Cable Industry Finally Admits That Data Caps Have Nothing To Do With Congestion</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364343148220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:12:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indisputable?

All anyone has to do is read the Terms of Use. To say that caps is like going back to the last decade is also incorrect. The FCC encouraged ISP's to move away from usage pricing to fixed-price unlimited with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. So for the past 15 years the FCC demanded unlimited service. It was last year under the Democratically controlled FCC reversed the policy and moved away from fixed-price unlimited to tiered pricing with caps. If one wants to stream IP based video 24x7 to multiple TV's all one has to do is get the streaming service from their broadband service provider. The cable companies own services are treated separately and do not count against one's monthly Internet data allocation.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364389115751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 08:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364389714342-18</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

Intel is an appropriate part of my portfolio and so its influence on my account has been positive. It could have been more positive but I expect it wiill be strong compared to the market. Short interest has to peak. When it does, INTC will start moving back up. It is taking 1.5m short increase per day to keep INTC flat. If they stop, INTC goes up. If they cover, INTC goes up. The INTC share buyback looks like it is being implemented to change the technicals on the chart. The buyback is methodically building an attractive chart for the chartists.

ET Intel: Cut Spending, Says Goldman, PC Inventories Too High Email Print smaller Larger By Tiernan Ray Shares of Intel (INTC) are up 9 cents, or 0.6%, at $21.86, as Goldman Sachs’s James Covello offers a suggestion: cut capital expenditures. Covello, who has a Sell rating on Intel shares, and a $16 price target, thinks a 3% climb in the shares through yesterday was all about investors expecting Intel would cut some of the $13.5 billion in spending it has planned for this year. After spending 100% of operating cash flow in seven of the last eight quarters, on capital spending, on dividends, and on share repurchases, net cash fell from $20 billion to $5 billion from Q4 of 2010 through Q4 of last year. Covello thinks PC inventories are too high, and that Intel has been unnecessarily contributing to that inventory build-up: If Intel were to significantly reduce capex to about $7-$8 bn, then we would likely be less negative on the stock. As we have written previously, the primary reason for our Sell rating is our view that Intel’s robust capex has created excess supply. For example, Intel’s 4Q12 fab utilization was about 50%, and PC OEM inventory is near a multi-year high (Exhibit 2). We do not believe a small capex reduction would be sufficient to fix the supply problem, as Intel already added significant capacity with its capex increase to $11 bn in 2011 and 2012 from about $5 bn on average in 2007-2010. In addition, our hardware team expects 2013 PC units to decline slightly yoy. The equipment makers wouldn’t be hurt too much, Covello thinks, by a cut in spend by Intel, given “Intel’s orders to the SPE companies are currently very low and this is unlikely to change that.” “In fact, we believe one reason investors expect a capex cut is due to comments from the supply chain on low logic orders.” Covello models Intel making $53.4 billion in revenue this year and $1.65 in GAAP EPS. That is below consensus of $53.8 billion and $1.93.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364397808305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364397825702-50</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have entered my email address.

The phone/mobile internet sector has three inter-related, interdependent components - service providers/system capacity and speed, hardware (the devices), and software (use interface). TV adds a fourth component - content, and content providers (mostly, but not solely, "Hollywood") are not fools - they gave away the store to Apple with music, and they won't let that happen again - they will drive a hard bargain to get the most return on their product.... A lot is at stake as the larger "TV" system (content, transmission, hardware, software) evolves. Consumer attitudes will also play a big part - older consumers will be less willing to change, with younger consumers ready to jump onto any new platform/paradigm. It's interesting (intriguing) that Intel thinks it has a potentially important role to play. I hope they do, but I have to confess I'm skeptical. But, we'll see how this evolves.</Msg><Username>clcellve</Username><Timestamp>1364399007208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:43:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364399105838-53</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just read your article.

The combination of security technologies Intel is embedding into its mobile products can potentially solve a key issue of content protection while sharing video with other devices in the home. The question that deserves to be asked is what is the most effective role Intel should have in realizing the concept? As a provider of core technology and perhaps even a reference design Intel can make a very strong case. They may even have a good argument for building the box. However, as the provider of the service - instead of the cable companies themselves - Intel would function as a cable bypass and competing directly against the cable's own video services. This is where the concept becomes very complicated given the many advantages cable companies enjoy over any bypass operator delivering this service. I suspect Intel initially wanted to partner with the cable companies but the cable operators weren't interested and by the time the cable operators passed on the opportunity Intel was so wedded to the idea that they justified doing it solely on their own. There is nothing technically stopping anyone with a large ego and cash from launching an Over-The-Top live streaming service. However, making a viable business competing directly against the cable operator's core business is another matter.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364401133973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:18:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364401266324-57</Id><Title>Sandollars obsessed with Intel failing in TV</Title><Msg>Give it a rest, man.

Cable company IP streaming is not Over-The-Top because the data used is internal to the cable offering and not part of the customer's Internet service. Check xfinitydotcomcastdotnet/watch-live-tv/ Intel said they aren't offering a lower price and they said they aren't offering unbundled programming. Intel makes great servers and anyone can buy them and build a data center. A lot of people have the talent and resources to do this; Amazon, Google, Netflix, Vudu, etc. Nearly every consumer would like to see a la carte selections of video content but know this - 1). The FCC solidly supports cable bundling, 2). The content producers and content distributor's business models are based on bundling, and 3). The regulatory policies that apply to cable operators give them unparalleled advantage for services delivered over their network, and 4). Cable operators can buy whatever useful technology Intel may produce and compete against Intel's Web TV service with marketing and pricing advantage Intel can't hope to have. Intel is certainly welcome to try going head-to-head against the cable industry, but we have seen Intel spend billions already trying to impose a transformational strategy on the wireles industry only to see the telecom incumbents take the idea and market opportunity away from them.

The high-end server market is tiny compared to the PC consumer space, and the RISC market SPARC plays in is a tiny fraction of that. 9.5 million x86 servers shipped in 2012. The number of RISC servers (including IBM's Power, Itanium, and SPARC): 154,870. In such a small market, it's a little surprising to see Oracle attempting to destroy HP's Itanium business or IBM slamming Oracle's benchmark claims for the T5." "If the situation doesn't change soon, T5 may be Oracle's last hardware hurrah. The company has been de-emphasizing x86 sales in favor of pushing its own proprietary solutions -- and that's obviously not working."
