Bay Trail will pull people into the showroom. People who cannot afford more will buy Bay Trail. Folks who can afford more will move up to i3, i5, and upwards. For a computer that you expect to use at least 3 to 4 years day-in and day-out, it will be crazy to hold back a couple of hundred dollars.

The Silvermont architecture will deliver up to 5x reduction in power at the same level performance or up to a 3x improvement in performance over our prior generation of architecture. Silvermont is unique and its ability to stay in the market’s appetite for computing. From ultra-mobile devices to the datacenter. And it’s of course both windows and android. The Silvermont platform were underpinned – are underpinned our products for tablets, two in ones and desktops, as well as our phones and microserver products for the datacenter. The products will be Bay Trail, Merrifield and Avonton respectively. At Computex, we launched the Haswell family of processors, which delivered the biggest improvement in battery life in Intel’s history, making no comprises, high performance, two-in-one devices that make – that all day battery life a reality. Haswell along with Bay Trail were powered in more than 50 different two-in-one devices in the pipeline, including the very first fanless Core design. The same week at Computex, we also announced the landmark tablet design in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. The Galaxy Tab 3 will use an atom SoC and our LTE solution, signaling important progress in the tablet space. The datacenter strategy is continuing to pay dividends. Our cloud storage – cloud and storage business each grew the revenue more than 40% year-over-year. Networking grew more than 20% and high performance computing business were 98% of all new systems entering the top 500 list. In fact, the number one system on the top 500 was all Intel for the first time since 1997, using a combination of Intel Xeon CPU’s and Xeon Phi accelerator. Finally our investments and expertise in process technology continue to be the foundation of our industry leadership. With 22nm defect density and throughput times at record low levels and 14nm on track into production by the end of the year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374125574019</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:32:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374125744523-19</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: CEO Comments</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374125574019</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:32:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd: Just a few weeks ago, I announced a significant reorganization. The changes we’ve made flatten the organization, improved decision making and will contribute to a culture of even greater accountability. These elements are critical in the fast pace ultra-mobile environment. In addition to the organizational changes, we have made several strategy and priority changes that will allow us to focus and win in that environment. These changes will drive a greater emphasis on Atom-based products bringing the full weight of our process and architectural leadership to the Atom family. We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology and focus on the SOC integration of key components like graphics, communications and other devices. This does not mean we will lessen the value or leadership of our Core product family, but rather make Atom an equal player in technology leadership for the ultra-mobile space. Those product lines will be driving Intel's future. In general, you're likely to see us making moves and adjustments in the market before you hear us talking about them.

Second quarter revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. The Core business came in as expected but we saw some softness in our baseband business. At a segment level, the PC group grew 1% sequentially and the data center group grew 6%. As expected inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly as customers began building Haswell based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages based on uncertainty heading into the back half of the year. For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter which is at the lower end of the historical range as a result of our expectation that our customers will continue to operate with lean inventory levels exceeding the third quarter. Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin of 58% was in line with our guidance and up 2 points from the first quarter as a result of the qualification for sale of additional Haswell products and higher volume. As expected, the reduction in excess capacity charges in the second quarter was offset by an increase in 14 nanometer start-up costs. For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 3 points to 61% as we qualify our Bay Trail product line for sale, increase our volume, and start to see factory start-up costs come down.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374125950293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:39:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374126107194-21</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: CFO Comments</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374125950293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:39:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd: For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.7 billion. For the third quarter, we're forecasting an increase to total spending of $100 million. The reclassification spending on process engineers from across the sales to R&amp;D increases our spending but we expect this will be mostly offset by spending reductions across the company. These spending reductions allow us to reduce our spending forecast for the year to $18.7 billion. Operating income for the second quarter was $2.7 billion with earnings per share of $0.39. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, up slightly from the first quarter. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock. While our first half financials played out as expected, the overall PC market segment for 2013 is expected to be weaker than we forecast at the beginning of the year. Our expectation is now that revenue will be approximately flat to last year. As a result, our gross margin forecast for the year is now 59% versus the prior forecast of 60%. Additionally, we have reduced our forecast for capital spending by $1 billion to $11 billion.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374126107194</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:41:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374126217494-22</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: CFO Comments</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374125950293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:39:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd: 2 We have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the second half of this year across all the segments of our business.

And right now our view on that is just fairly cautious. We expect that they'll continue to run lean inventory levels but the reality is we won't know that until we get into late August, early September. That's when you normally start to see them putting in the supply line that also aligns with other things in the industry and so we think that's when we're likely to really get a sense of Q3 and the momentum into Q4. [In other words they are being cautious but don't be surprised when Intel blows out the estimate...] The question is can x86 go into these ultra-mobile markets and how do the customers view that? And my answer would be they are more than willing to accept it. The fact that x86 works on both Android and Windows is a real advantage to our OEM base. They look at that and say that they can have one architectural design, one set of products and use both operating systems. So it's a unique feature that we are able to provide. It's more been in focus by Intel of actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products in there. You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail. Haswell on the Core side and Bay Trail on the Atom side really being designed for those ultra-mobile products. We talked about Haswell producing the first stainless Core products out there in the market in any kind of real volume. And then Bay Trail really being designed for the much lower price points that you see these tablets and even down to the entry level of tablets. And so the fact that it’s x86 is an advantage actually because we’ve been able to produce both Android and Windows on our product now.

So the startup cost trend is directionally the same as what we’ve seen in other generations, it will be the same shape. Generally the same impact on gross margins, so you’ll see the peak in startup cost in the second quarter will come down some in Q3 and then we’ll get a bigger benefit in Q4 and then they’ll come down a bit more in the first half of next year, so it's a comparable trend. In the fourth quarter the puts and takes we’d just do the gross margin progression across the year we were at 56% in Q1. We hit our forecast in Q2 at 58%. We’re expecting few points of increase in the third quarter to 61%. And then as, if I think about Q4 I think we have a couple of tailwinds, so I’d expect the volume to be up some. We should get some good news associated with startup cost, and then the offset in Q4 is going to be, we should be well into the build of Broadwell. So, I don’t know if anything really surprised me. I think the things that were positive for me is that, our customers especially if they want Intel to get into this expanding ultra level market, they’re looking for Intel to be stronger and have a better and more capable product light up in there, and they’re excited about the products that we have coming, the Haswell and Bay Trail. So I’d say the key message that they’ve been giving us is, we really want you there, we see the products coming, we want even more and we want a faster line up following those. And so that you hear or you heard in my speech today and in the earnings release that we’re really putting much, much stronger effort on Atom and driving our SSE integration and pulling it forward to the leading edge. So, I’d say that was the major point or major comments I got back from our customer base.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374126888486</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374127069486-25</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: From Q&amp;A</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374126606859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, I’d say it's a couple of things. And I’d also say what we’re guiding for Q3 is sub-seasonal growth, so it's off of an okay Q2 but not a game buster Q2. So I don’t think it's a wildly optimistic forecast. In terms of the tailwinds that I see first and foremost is the product cycle. Haswell is a great product for ultrabooks in two end runs and as Brian said with Bay Trail coming to the marketplace we’re going to be hitting price points in the touch enabled segment of the PC market that we’ve never touched before and we’ll be able to do that profitably, and we’ll start hitting share in tablets. We’ve got kind of our first big tablet wins out in the market place and with Bay Trail we think again we enable other designs to come to market at price points that are going to be I think nicer in consumer price points. The second tailwind that I’d say is we expect generally in improving macroeconomic climate as we go into the back half. I think that’s aligned with most economists in the first half the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we have thought starting the year. China was a little bit weaker but generally I’d expect the improving macroeconomic environment in the back half. So, first let me say our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don’t believe it will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe what it really does it allows us to get into these markets that we’re not in, in a big way today. And that as Stacy said are these sub $400, sub $300 in some case, clamshells and touch enabled convertibles in two in one devices, and tablets $199 and below some you’re going to see even lower below $150 and much below that as we go through the holiday season. So Bay Trail really first and foremost we believe gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the competition in price points and markets that were simply not in, in a big way today.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374127069486</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:57:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374127356828-26</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: From Q&amp;A</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374126606859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So there still is a healthy segmentation in the marketplace where Bay Trail will play – it will start to expand this into markets where we don't play today. And because of the cost structure we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we would be able to do if we were going after that segment today with Celeron or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful product from that perspective. As you probably anticipate I'm not going to get pinned down inside the range. I'm still very comfortable with the 55% to 65%. I think the second half is a great proof point. We're going to be – from Q1 to Q3 we're going to quadruple our tablet volume. We're running a 61% gross margin at the company level. As Brian said, the market's going to go where it's going to go. We've got some great products to give us a cost structure to go after them profitably and I'm still confident on that gross margin range and we'll talk more about the specific segments when we get to the investor meeting. Yeah, so we're still confident in the second half growth of our data center business overall. As we mentioned, we're seeing strong growth in the cloud, the high performance computing, our networking and our storage. We think those continue through the second half of this year. What was down as Stacy mentioned was – the enterprise data centers were down a bit in the first half. We think as the macroeconomics continue to improve through this year that picks up a bit. When you put that all together, we believe that – absolutely our view is that we can continue through this year with that low double digit growth.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374127356828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 02:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374127482406-27</Id><Topic><Title>OMG!

We're not going to increase our OpEx spending and in fact, what we've really been focusing on is managing that as well. What you're going to see and remember, as we move our architecture more and more toward SOC, a lot of the work we do bridges between Core and Atom and as we pull Atom forward onto the leading-edge technology, again, that allows a lot of the architectural work to be in alignment and be shared amongst the two products. So, we believe that we can move faster on Atom and into this ultra-mobility space without having to change or increase our OpEx. So absolutely that's the current model that we're working under. From when will you start to see it? Some of these changes have been started a while back and you see Bay Trail coming out towards the end of this year. It's a product that is on that Atom/Core that is truly industry leading. We talked earlier about there are a lot of the benchmarks coming out showing it very strong against the competition if not leading the competition in many of the metrics. And so we believe that you’ll start to see some of this just naturally over the next six months as Bay Trail ramps up and gets into production, but we have a series of products after and you’ll see more and more acceleration. So don’t think of this as a onetime shift where you’ll see a digital move. Look at it as a constant pushing of the accelerator down and the thing just gets faster and faster as time goes by. And so you’ll just see more and more strength of that Atom line as time goes through here, and it will be kind of just, you’ll look back and say well it's obviously that the Atom line has truly become strong and they’ve got share in the tablet space. If I could just add to that, maybe I can give you a little bit of sense of where we’re trying to go. You, I’m sure noticed we brought down the overall spending forecast for the Company. We know that we’re running hot in terms of spending as a percent of revenue.

You, I’m sure noticed we brought down the overall spending forecast for the Company. We know that we’re running hot in terms of spending as a percent of revenue. We’ve been very consciously making investments in that space. What I’ve seen in Brian in his tenure is he’s very focused on driving that efficiency and bringing it down. We’ll come down a few points between where we were in Q2 in the end of the year in terms of spending as a percent of revenue and the expectation is we can come down more next year. As far as our 14 nanometer Core launch in our – just our general product launch, I think what we’ve said so far is, first half of 2014. I gave you a pretty strong hint with the fact that it will be taking prequalification reserves, you can kind of sense that we’re well – those are going to be material. So we will be well into production on the fourth quarter. I think you’ve seen us trying to be very responsive to changes in demand and get the balance right. And so as our view of the market change, we saw some opportunities for things that we thought we were going to put in place this year that we no longer have to put in place. And it’s across the board, it’s no one thing. Similar to what you saw in Q1, we’ve found opportunities to drive more re-use. Here we’re finding some opportunities to push some capital out of the year. Some of it is 450 not based on schedule changes, but it’s just based on some efficiencies that we’re able to find and shortening the time it takes us to install certain things and that kind of stuff. Some of it is M&amp;E for 14 nanometer, some of it is space, just a variety of kind of small things that added up to a billion bucks.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374127841113</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 02:10:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374128242321-30</Id><Topic><Title>2Q-2013: From Q&amp;A</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374126606859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 01:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd tell you what's different moving forward, again we've kind of talked about this is Bay Trail. Bay Trail is going into some of these same classic PC devices that you see today. The clamshells where they've got touch-enabled clamshells coming down into the $300 range. You're going to see convertible clamshells where you can detach or flip and it access both a tablet or a PC in the sub-$400 range, right around $400. As we move into next year, those price points will continue to drop. So the fact that PCs especially with Bay Trail are going to move down into this, let's call it $200 to $400 range, is going to shift that market we believe as well and that's different than what's been out over the last few years. So you've got fan-less Haswell. You've got Bay Trail coming in.

FBR Capital analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated an Outperform rating and $28 price target on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) following Q2 results and Q3 guidance slightly below the Street. Management also lowered 2013 revenue guidance from low single digits to flat year over year (though the Street was already estimating approximately flat) and gross margins from 60% to 59%, the analyst noted. "... given worsening investor expectations and sentiment into quarter-end, we were surprised to see the stock trade down as much #$%$ in after-hours trading on what we consider a very benign report. Also, despite Gartner's estimate for PC units to fall 4% QOQ, Intel reports that it saw PC units increase 5% QOQ (though we acknowledge some channel build for Haswell here). Additionally, the 2Q13 miss was not attributable to PC; rather, the overall $100M shortfall was attributable to a combined $130M shortfall for non-core segments outside of PC and server (likely baseband, Atom, and "other" revenue). To boot, the company lowered capex another billion for the second quarter in a row." For EPS, the firm is rising 2013E (due to the one-time Clearwire asset sale) and lowering 2014E EPS to $1.95 (Street $2.01).

All of the optimism by mgmt and bulls on this board haven't changed that. I've been long Intel since mid-2010 with an average purchase price of $20. For me,with what was said yesterday by mgmt, the November update will be the tell on whether they will put up or shut up.

"Consequently, we believe the [company's] transition into faster growing mkts (ultra-mobile, foundry etc.) will require patience, but expect the shares to slowly rise as signs of success emerge in 2H13 (tablets, convertibles etc.) and become more meaningful in 2014 (LTE handsets)."

His first earnings call Wednesday supplied some clues, including a bet on the impact of much lower PC prices. The chip giant’s profits fell 29% in the second period, and Intel predicted its revenue will be flat for all of 2013, down from a prior prediction of growth “in the low single digits.” But Krzanich is betting that some new chips–particularly those stemming from an overhaul of its low-end Atom line–will have a big impact on demand later this year and into 2014. Historically, Intel showed a tendency to emphasize its flagship Core line of chips, which can sell for hundreds of dollars. Atom chips, by contrast, sell for tens of dollars. Krzanich has vowed to change that bias, through steps such as shifting Atoms production to new Intel manufacturing processes once reserved for Core chips. A key part of his strategy is based on a forthcoming Atom model that is code-named Bay Trail. The company expects the chip to offer performance approaching that of mainstream PCs but at much lower prices. Results, Krzanich said, will include clamshell-style laptops with touchscreens–which are now pretty rare at less than $500–that will be priced at $300 or lower. “PCs, especially with Bay Trail, are going to move down to $200 to $400 range,” Krzanich said. And devices that function in both clamshell and tablet style, which are even more expensive now, will fall to the $400 range, he said.

Getting Intel technology into those kinds of prices points opens up major opportunities to drive large volumes of chip sales, Krzanich said. The Intel call touched on many other topics, including: –Capital spending. Intel came into 2013 expecting to spend a whopping $13 billion on factories and equipment to make chips, a commitment not popular on Wall Street amid gloomy prospects for PC sales. About $2 billion of its spending was earmarked for early investments to get ready for a major change in production technology, shifting to 450-millimeter silicon wafers rather than the 300-millimeter variety to reduce costs of producing each chip. After the first quarter, Intel lopped $1 billion off that estimate, and on Wednesday it cut another $1 billion, reducing Intel’s spending projection for the year to $11 billion. Stacy Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said only a small amount of the savings is associated with spending related to the new wafers. Generally, he said, Intel is just able at current unit sales expectations to spend less on new equipment than it had planned, he said.

Not at all, Smith said. “We are running healthy levels of utilization in the second quarter, and expect to run the factories healthy in the back half of 2013,” he said in an interview. –Unit chip sales. At first blush, Intel’s estimate that unit chip sales in its PC client group declined just 5% from the year-earlier quarter seems a bit puzzling–at least when you compare it to Gartner and IDC statements last week that second-quarter PC sales fell about 11% in the second quarter. But Smith said there are some key differences in what is counted. IDC and Gartner factor in falling shipments of the low-end PCs called netbooks, which caused a big bulge in sales volume several years ago but fell off dramatically after tablets arrived with the iPad in 2010. Intel, however, no longer puts sales of netbook chips in its PC client group. Instead, the company includes netbook chips sales in a group called “other Intel architecture,” which also includes businesses such as still-nascent sales of chips for smartphones. Revenue for that segment was off 15% in the second quarter, and it posted an operating loss of $608 million. The PC client group also includes some products that IDC and Gartner do not–including chips for Microsoft MSFT -0.21%’s Surface Pro tablets, Smith said. When you consider such factors, Intel’s view of the PC market is pretty close to that of the two research firms, he said.

Programming costs are soaring through the roof and cable TV operators need to consolidate and gain leverage to push costs down. As cable TV operators merge and achieve big cost savings, they will rapidly increase their spending on technologies that will fuel the industry's future growth. Cable TV operator stocks are rallying, but the biggest gainers during this summer's consolidation wave will be the industry's leading technology vendors. We could soon see the largest tech vendors like Cisco (CSCO) rapidly acquire smaller cable TV tech pure plays like Seachange (SEAC) and Concurrent (CCUR). An analyst at Brean Capital issued a research note about SEAC in December, which speculated that it's a takeover target, "Because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." The consolidation scenario they alluded to is now getting underway, much sooner than expected. SEAC reached new 52-week highs the past three trading days! Yesterday, SEAC hit a new 52-week high of $12.72 and closed at $12.58. It has a market cap of $412mm with $114.23mm in cash and an enterprise value of $297.77mm or 1.91X revenues of $156.11mm. SEAC is rising due to takeover speculation and CCUR will likely be next to explode! Search for and read the article 'Motorola, Cisco Buyouts Vex VOD Market' to see how CCUR is also a takeover target with Arris reported to have shown interest. CCUR just surpassed SEAC to become the #1 VOD tech vendor, while Arris is #4 and could easily acquire CCUR to dominate the market - both companies based are in Atlanta! CCUR needs to rise to $16.35 just to match SEAC's enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.91! When CCUR files their 10-K next month, their trailing non-GAAP EPS will likely reach $0.50 and surpass SEAC's non-GAAP EPS of $0.44!</Msg><Username>aogmg95</Username><Timestamp>1374156535784</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374156615391-89</Id><Title>Intel :Buy under $21 soon or later</Title><Msg>Cutting forcast is not a good news....We are heading for another World recession without central banks pumping borrow money!!!</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1374156615391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:10:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374156616705-90</Id><Topic><Title>Walking it down one penny at a time</Title><Username>iheartdaddy</Username><Timestamp>1374095487376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:11:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Happening.</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1374156616705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374156809627-91</Id><Title>The shorts have to cover.</Title><Msg>It will be down at this price or somewhat lower until they do.

We know now that Krzanich is speeding development up while cutting costs significantly. This is a great combination. What we know now is that Krzanich feels the urgency and is taking decisive action. We know now that a huge product pipeline is in place with absolutely great price points. Krzanich talked about being able to compete in a number of new product categories.

At 235million shorts, you have to consider some permanent level of shorting that is driven by investment strategies that you are already aware of. 1. inverse ETF. An inverse ETF creation unit is created by shorting the stocks or taking positions in tracking derivatives like options. When people buy inverse SP500, DJI, large cap value/growth, technology, semiconductor, Russell, .... ETF's they are generating a price independent short position iin Intel as part of the index. 2. option market maker hedging. The OMM will try to hedge his position 100% at the time of option trades. If he matches a buyer with a seller and does not participate, he will skim the spread. If he has to participate as an option WRITER or HOLDER, then he will hedge. He looks at the collection of positions and if he expects to get shares, he shorts them immediately and if he expects to deliver shares, he will buy them immediately. Like ETF, he does not care if INTC goes up/down. 3. Convertible notes. Intel sold $1.75 billion of 2009 convertibles have conversion into 78.8 million shares at a price target, today, of $22.20. Those notes are likely owned by hedge funds who use the strategy of shorting Intel against shares from the convertible bonds. Above $22.20, you have a build in 78.8 million shares of potential short. anyone who would buy a low interst corporate bond would be very tempted to lock in a profit when Intel was $29. 78.8 million potential shorts. 4. straight short positions. These are the ones that you are talking about and I think they are a small portion of the short position. "Retail" shorts? not too many.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1374158413642</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374158481293-124</Id><Title>INTC Cell fone? just like BBRY or NOK?</Title><Msg>how is MCafee how is SSD drive make a lot of $$$$$$$$$$$$ tell me so I can load up INTC stock!</Msg><Username>joesmoe_y2k</Username><Timestamp>1374158481293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374158490092-125</Id><Topic><Title>What We Know Now</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374156855123</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"And you will keep riding it down won't you?"

Listen to the folks that say it is dead money. Quite honestly when I invested in Intel back in January I thought it might be dead money most of the year and kept telling people that it was a second half of the year story, and some bulls didn' t want to hear that. At the 4.25% yield at the time I am fine waiting. I have other investments that are maturing and producing gains. My life is not depending on INTC. The shares are still up 10% from what I paid for them. So even if I get the yield plus appreciation of 10% that is 14.25 percent not including a dividend raise. So this is not a bad rate of return.

A tablet doesn't hack it. It's for mostly mindless #$%$, watching movies, games, reading newspapers or books, buying or selling stocks or bonds, or for people that just need to fill out forms of one sort or another like insurance adjusters. You like carrying a tablet around from place to place? I don't. And I don't like carrying a computer around either. Real work is done sitting down with a laptop or desktop. Fact is, there is room for all type of chips in the world. SOCs made by Intel are going to be everywhere you want or need to be in the next few years. In your car, your refrigerator, TV set top, TV itself with no box, countless other places. Intel will do fine.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the new investments -- which include stakes in CVS Caremark and DirectTV -- were likely made by Berkshire's new investment manager Todd Combs rather than Buffett himself. The investment in the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip-maker -- Oregon's largest private employer with 16,000 workers in Washington County -- wasn't the biggest headline-grabber among Berkshire's new holdings.

There is a segment of the market that barely use PC's that historically would have purchased a desktop or laptop to do simple email and a little bit web surfing. If that's all these people needed they could probably have purchased the low-end AMD gear and kept their system for many years. But whether they purchased Intel or AMD these folks had Windows and access to the world's largest software ecosystem in the event they actually needed to do something more than email. This is not the case with either Android tablets and even iPad doesn't give the owner MAC OS software. Intel has shown that a Haswell based tablet with 64 bit W8 can rival laptop performance but a Haswell tablet is just as attractive to Intel financially as a laptop. It remains to be seen what the consumer dynamic will be with Windows-based or dual-boot Bay Trail tablets but an Android only Bay Trail is still not a PC replacement.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1374164410799</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 12:20:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374164469423-185</Id><Topic><Title>Ben is moving on before the big crash FED is losing control, We all know its coming</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1374162570529</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 11:49:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>800,000 furloughed DOD veterans is going to really cause a slow down and its just started the week after the 4th of July, Wait until they get the first full check with both furlough days in it, I tried to get you to move to cash and let Wall Street and Congress know that it was wrong and get them to fix it before it gets to a point they can't fix it</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1374164469423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 12:21:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374164494126-186</Id><Title>longs say bye bye to gains. 26 25 24 23 22 ....</Title><Msg>Watching the titanic sink here.

The company also lowered its full-year capital spending plan. It now expects to spend $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million, down from a previous view of $12 billion. "While this [revenue] guide is mildly disappointing, we believe the [company] has now set the bar realistically and importantly shown continued signs of cost control by trimming capex/opex (- $1b/-$200m)," Seymore wrote in the note. "Consequently, we believe the [company's] transition into faster growing mkts (ultra-mobile, foundry etc.) will require patience, but expect the shares to slowly rise as signs of success emerge in 2H13 (tablets, convertibles etc.) and become more meaningful in 2014 (LTE handsets)."

Windows RT has been no different. Between the underwhelming sales response, loud criticism, and added price cuts, it's become clear that Microsoft isn't winning over the world with the idea of Windows RT. In what appears to be an effort to clear out existing inventory to make room for a product refresh, the company reduced the price of the 32 GB Surface RT tablet by $150 to a more palatable $349. Unfortunately, that price doesn't include the innovative keyboard Touch Cover, which will cost another $100 as long as it's bundled with a Surface RT tablet. It's believed that Surface RT version 2.0 will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, which has built-in 4G connectivity and is twice as fast as the NVIDIA Tegra 3 powering the current Surface RT. Coupled with an updated version of Windows RT, the hope is that users will find more utility out of the crippled ecosystem, despite it lacking backwards compatibility with millions of legacy Windows applications. Lipstick on a pig Call me old fashioned, but a product refresh alone isn't going to address the structural issues associated with Windows RT. Additionally, the future Surface RT will be competing with tablets powered by Intel's upcoming Bay Trail processor, which is expected to be featured in devices starting in the $200 to $300 price range and will be capable of running the full version of Windows 8.

Microsoft was late to the game with mobile computing and Windows RT allowed it to address the growing demand for ARM computing devices. However, with Intel finally catching up with its ARM counterpart, it's become increasingly clear that Windows RT will be a bridge product thanks to its lack of backwards compatibility. This may be a tough pill for Microsoft to swallow, but if it wants the Surface family to be successful with everyday users, perhaps it should consider dropping Windows RT altogether and introduce a "Surface Atom" powered by Bay Trail. Not only would this move eliminate the frustration and confusion surrounding Windows RT, it would create a clear defined line between itself and the Surface Pro, which would be powered by Intel Haswell and geared toward business use.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374172310789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374172492034-231</Id><Title>Intel’s new CEO says 50 new 2-in-1 laptop-tablet hybrid designs in the works</Title><Msg>If you fancy a hybrid laptop/tablet PC, chances are it’s going to have Intel inside. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said in an analyst conference call today that computer makers have 50 designs for hybrid laptop/tablet PCs in the works that use Haswell processors. Speaking in his first call with analysts becoming CEO, Krzanich said those designs are based on the fourth-generation Core processors, codenamed Haswell, that debuted in June. The hybrid designs are proving popular as a way to bridge the world of productivity computing of laptops and the ease-of-use and greater portability of tablets. The 2-in-1 hybrid requires a beefy but power efficient processor, and that’s what Krzanich says Intel has in Haswell, which offers 50 percent better battery life than the prior generation of chips. Those new products will include the first hybrid computers that require no fans. That allows them to be thinner and smaller than in the past.

Morris Chang says the competitive landscape has changed. It's no longer Foundry versus Foundry, but Grand Alliance versus IDM. Actual quote from CC: "Grand alliance, by that, we mean our alliance with customers, with the design -- electronic design EDA companies, and companies such as ARM and imagination technology and companies like Cadence, Mentor Graphics, as well as our own platform, the Open Innovation Platform. So it's an alliance with the customers, with the EDA companies, with the IP providers, and of course, with the -- our key vendors, critical vendors. Now the reason I want to point that out is that for TSMC, we have entered a new era of competition. We pointed that out almost every time we get together in this meeting, and we've been pointing out for the last 1 or 2 years now. Now in this new era of competition, the competition is not foundry to foundry. It is not foundry to IDM. It is grand alliance to IDM. Have I made it clear? That's the reason I'm pointing it out." Ha! Language is a tool and "Grand Alliance" certainly puffs up their side. How will an alliance hold up when it is under pressure, not just from Intel, but declining growth rates in smartphones? I think individual members of the alliance will look after their own best interests and betray the alliance.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1374174690624</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:11:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374174857952-248</Id><Title>Those with the best fabs, win</Title><Msg>But Krzanich made clear several things: Minimizing power, not maximizing performance, is now the point of almost everything Intel does.

Israeli 3D technology made big news this week with two acquisition stories – one confirmed, one not – that could fundamentally change the way we interact with devices. Intel confirmed on Tuesday that it is purchasing Israeli 3D gesture technology company Omek, in a bid to beef up its "perceptual computing" development program. According to Intel SVP and Intel Israel president Mooly Eden, laying out the company's vision at a recent event in the country, the advent of the tech is "just around the corner". In the other potential deal, Apple was rumoured to be in talks with another Israeli 3D gesture tech company — PrimeSense, the company that developed the Kinect for Microsoft. PrimeSense has described the story as "ridiculous", and the reported purchase price bandied about in the media — about $290m — sounds a bit on the low side for a company that has a proven product track record. But the business PrimeSense is in now — 3D sensors for small devices — would nonetheless be a sound addition for the 3D gesture tech that could (most likely) go into future iPhones and iPads.

Management also lowered 2013 revenue guidance from low single digits to flat year over year (though the Street was already estimating approximately flat) and gross margins from 60% to 59%, the analyst noted. "... given worsening investor expectations and sentiment into quarter-end, we were surprised to see the stock trade down as much #$%$ in after-hours trading on what we consider a very benign report. Also, despite Gartner's estimate for PC units to fall 4% QOQ, Intel reports that it saw PC units increase 5% QOQ (though we acknowledge some channel build for Haswell here). Additionally, the 2Q13 miss was not attributable to PC; rather, the overall $100M shortfall was attributable to a combined $130M shortfall for non-core segments outside of PC and server (likely baseband, Atom, and "other" revenue). To boot, the company lowered capex another billion for the second quarter in a row." For EPS, the firm is rising 2013E (due to the one-time Clearwire asset sale) and lowering 2014E EPS to $1.95 (Street $2.01). "While headwinds in PC are discouraging, we acknowledge computing form factors will change over time. We believe Moore's Law is considerably more durable than any one form factor and presents as good a business plan as any in the technology industry. Moving forward, we are increasingly confident that Intel can opportunistically extract value from the extra transistors afforded to it through the best silicon manufacturing operations in the world, and therefore we rate Intel an Outperform with a price target of $28, representing 13.5x our 2014E GAAP EPS."</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1374175459628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374175525857-254</Id><Topic><Title>Those with the best fabs, win</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374174857952</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:14:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TSM not only has fabs, they've got GIGAFABS. I'm not 100% sure what a Gigafab is, but from this answer from Morris Chang, apparently when you connect several fabs with corridors, they become a Gigafab. Here's the advantage: "Cost advantage, yes. I believe, there is some cost advantage in connecting all the fab into one GIGAFAB. But I think the main advantage is probably in time to expand or time to market. That is -- we qualify only once because -- in one big GIGAFAB, we qualify only once. Whereas if they are disconnected, if they are separate fabs, there, usually, we have to qualify each fab on the same product for this, yes -- well, on the same technology, let's say, yes." This Morris Chang fellow is pretty clever with "Grand Alliance" and "Gigafab". He knows how to use words to make things seem much more special than they are.

That said, INTC is doing what it can control, cutting costs and capex spending plans. We believe a sub-seasonal Q3 guide, lean channel inventory, and more compelling products continue to make the shares attractive. INTC reported Q2 EPS of $0.39, vs. $0.54, $0.01 below our estimate.

This proves ARM performance is junk. Microsoft said the $900 million charge related to its Surface RT tablet, which was launched alongside Windows 8 in October but has not sold well. No they are trying to sell it for $350. Still won't sell. They have to drop it to levels that HP dropped their first tablet to which was $100 for a fire sale. In other words, sell it as junk because it is a junk. RT ended up being a total failure. Microsoft needs to spend all its resources to make an Intel based tablet or phone successful.

Detroit declared bankruptcy today btw. The Quote of the Decade: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better." ~ Senator Barack H.

Windows 8 backlash has it it's bottom line and intel's as well. The backlash on latest XBox is just another in a line of issues for Microsoft. They probably saw Steve Jobs standing up telling people "You have no idea what this is, but soon enough you'll be waiting six hours in line to buy it." I really think that they felt that since Steve Job's is gone they could carry on his model of not listening to the customer. But now that the numbers are showing that this isn't right, what should they do? I think Microsoft should move from a model of selling software to leasing it. The first year's lease would be free with any new computer. I'm not talking about Windows 8 only, but any Microsoft OS. If you bought a new HP you should be able to come home and quickly convert it back to a Windows 7 machine if that's what you want.
