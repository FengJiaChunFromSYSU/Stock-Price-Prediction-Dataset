However, Netflix can quickly and easily remedy this and they don't even need their customers to buy new hardware. Today when launches Netflix on their device the interface immediately opens to the single household account. However, with only minor changes in software Netflix can add subaccounts to give each family member their own customized account and viewing recommendations. Selecting the individual account is a mere button click. Further, Netflix captures the unique MAC address of every Netflix device in a household and can allow specific subaccounts to be the default account in specific rooms (such as the ten year old daugher's room), so for those devices the button click isn't even necessary. Thus the parents don't need to see movie recommendations for the ten year old and vice versa. And best of all this personalization is done with no intrusive spying. Further, the Intel box is going to have a problem in any room where two or more family members are present because while it may be able to uniquely identify them it will have difficulty deciding who to give viewing priority; for instance the first person in the room? The oldest? One can imagine the family disputes this could create. In short no amount of "intelligent" boxes and intrusive spying will replace common sense. And if Netflix can easily add this backend customization so can Vudu and every other movie streaming company. So with minimal effort today's movie streaming products can neutralize the over-hyped intelligence of Intel's Web TV with no new hardware, no extra cost to the consumer and with far more common sense.</Msg><Username>mega.hurts</Username><Timestamp>1361801144384</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:05:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361801255874-13</Id><Topic><Title>Increase your portfolio by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>harvey_irvin</Username><Timestamp>1361797694427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 08:08:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fantastic info on report</Msg><Username>ninorichard776</Username><Timestamp>1361801255874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:07:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361801542656-14</Id><Title>PC sales may be decreasing, but...</Title><Msg>I know PC sales are decreasing, but i like my PC tower.

Intel recently disclosed it already has chips that can operate in one LTE mode, and is announcing Monday at MWC that by the end of the first half of the year it will also have the multi-mode variety that most customers will demand.

It is the truth and if you knew anything about software development you'd know how easy it will be for Netflix to add subaccounts to its service. Further, I have stated that there are many reasons to be bullish on Intel and I fully expect Intel to continue to dominate its traditional markets and do extraordinarily well in mobile. However, that does not mean everything Intel does is great. Intel just doesn't control enough of the media's critical assets to dominate in live TV or extract enough of the recurring service profit. As pitched Intel'a Web TV effort is largely a camera monitoring patent looking for a problem to solve.</Msg><Username>mega.hurts</Username><Timestamp>1361802923586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:35:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361803126852-20</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm's Achilles' Heel</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361754981169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 20:16:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You call me stupid? you're the one that cowers behind aliases &amp; stalks people on chat boards nuff, as if people don't know who you were &amp; the POS you are.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1361803126852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:38:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361803138232-21</Id><Title>Lenovo K900 hands-on impressions and synthetic benchmarks</Title><Msg>gsmarenaDOTcom/lenovo-k900-hands-on-impressions-and-synthetic-benchmarks/ Youtube videos of k900 in action youtubeDOTcom/watch?v=6jMfR5TLsi8 youtubeDOTcom/watch?v=Jtp-LilABDs</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361803138232</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:38:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361803328181-22</Id><Topic><Title>Increase your portfolio by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>harvey_irvin</Username><Timestamp>1361797694427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 08:08:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>best out there</Msg><Username>johngardella72</Username><Timestamp>1361803328181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:42:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361803411361-23</Id><Topic><Title>Who bought Intel at 29 and shorted ARM at 22 like Wally told you to do?</Title><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361282031580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 08:53:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A bulk of the shares of Intel are traded by ETF and mutual funds.

These index ETF are concerned about getting the best price at the moment but they cannot wait a week or month or even an hour. They have to buy.

Depending on how they are used, any system that is not running at least Sandy Bridge Core iX-2xxx is burning too much power and is costing you. A Core i3 2000 series or 3000 series is faster and lower power than your existing system. Quieter since lower air cooling. They will pay for themselves in lower power consumption and lower cooling cost in less than 12 months. You can probably even buy barebones systems and swap over drives, monitors, ..... If you have 20 older systems, you might even be able to buy a small EP server and run VM sessions, depending on your layout. I just retired my last pre-Sandy system for exactly that reason.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361805919043</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:25:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361805925384-41</Id><Topic><Title>Where are all the Intel GPU bashers today?</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361805003171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:10:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where are they?

MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS, Barcelona, Spain, Feb. 25, 2013 – Intel Corporation today announced a range of new products, ecosystem and enabling efforts that will further accelerate the company's presence in mobile and help usher in new devices and richer experiences with Intel Inside®. The announcements include a new dual-core Atom™ SoC ("Clover Trail+") platform for smartphones and Android* tablets, and the company's first global, multimode-multiband LTE solution that will ship in the first half of this year. Other disclosures included "Bay Trail" momentum, mobile device enabling efforts, and continued smartphone momentum in emerging markets with the Intel® Atom™ Z2420 processor-based platform. "Today's announcements build on Intel's growing device portfolio across a range of mobile market segments," said Hermann Eul, Intel vice president and co-general manager of the Mobile and Communications Group. "In less than a year's time we have worked closely with our customers to bring Intel-based smartphones to market in more than 20 countries around the world, and have also delivered an industry-leading low-power Atom™ SoC tablet solution running Windows* 8, and shipping with leading OEM customers today. Looking forward, we will build upon this foundation and work closely with our ecosystem partners, across operating systems, to deliver the best mobile products and experiences for consumers with Intel Inside." New, Efficient Atom™ SoC Platform Intel's new Atom™ processor platform ("Clover Trail+") and smartphone reference design delivers industry-leading performance with low-power and long battery life that rivals today's most popular Android* phones. The product brings Intel's classic product strengths, including high performance that lets you enjoy smooth Web browsing, vibrant, glitch-free, full HD movies, and an Android* applications experience that launches fast and runs great. The platform's 32nm dual core Intel® Atom™ Processors -- Z2580, Z2560, Z2520 -- are available in speeds up to 2.0 GHz, 1.6 GHz and 1.2GHz, respectively. The processor also features support for Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology, supporting four simultaneous application threads and further enhancing the overall efficiency of the Atom cores. The integrated platform also includes an Intel® Graphics Media Accelerator engine with a graphics core supporting up to 533MHz with boost mode, and delivering up to three times the graphics performance1 for rich 3-D visuals, lifelike gaming and smooth, full 1080P hardware-accelerated video encode and decode at 30fps. "Our second-generation product delivers double the compute performance and up to three times the graphics capabilities1, all while maintaining competitive low power," Eul said. "As we transition to 22nm Atom SoCs later this year, we will take full advantage of the broad spectrum of capabilities enabled by our design, architecture, 22nm tri-gate transistor technology, and leading-edge manufacturing to further accelerate our position." The new Atom platform also brings advanced imaging capabilities, including support for two cameras, with a primary camera sensor up to 16 megapixels. The imaging system also enables panorama capture, a 15 frame-per-second burst mode for 8 megapixel photos, real-time facial detection and recognition, and mobile HDR image capture with de-ghosting for clearer pictures in flight. The platform is also equipped with Intel® Identity Protection Technology (Intel IPT), helping to enable strong, two-factor authentication for protecting cloud services such as remote banking, e-commerce, online gaming and social networking from unauthorized access. Since Intel IPT is embedded at chip-level, unlike hardware or phone-based tokens, it can enable more secure, yet user-friendly cloud access protection. Intel is working with partners including Feitian*, Garanti Bank*, MasterCard*, McAfee*, SecureKey* Technologies Inc., Symantec*, Vasco Data Security International* Inc. and Visa* Inc. to incorporate this technology into their services. With WUXGA display support of 1900x1200, the platform will also enable larger-screen Android* tablet designs. It also includes support for Android* 4.2 (Jelly Bean), Intel Wireless Display Technology, HSPA+ at 42Mbps with the Intel® XMM 6360 slim modem solution, and the new industry-standard UltraViolet™ Common File Format. Customers announcing support for "Clover Trail+" platform for phones and tablets include ASUS*, Lenovo*, and ZTE*. Debuting at CES last month, the Lenovo* IdeaPhone K900* is based on the Intel® Atom™ processor Z2580 and delivers rich video, graphics and Web content at fantastic speeds. The IdeaPhone is 6.9mm thin and also features the world's first 5.5-inch full high-definition 400+ PPI screen for increased clarity of text and images. The K900 will be the first product to market based on the Atom processor Z2580. Lenovo plans to introduce the smartphone in the second quarter of 2013 in China, followed soon by select international markets. Building on the Atom processor platform ("Clover Trail+"), Intel also highlighted its forthcoming 22nm smartphone Atom™ SoC ("Merrifield"). The product is based on Intel's leading-edge 22nm process and an entirely new Atom microarchitecture that will help enable increased smartphone performance, power efficiency and battery life. Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) Intel's strategy is to deliver a leading low-power, global modem solution that works across multiple bands, modes, regions and devices. The Intel XMM 7160 is one of the world's smallest2 and lowest-power multimode-multiband LTE solutions (LTE / DC-HSPA+ / EDGE), supporting multiple devices including smartphones, tablets and Ultrabooks™. The 7160 global modem supports 15 LTE bands simultaneously, more than any other in-market solution. It also includes a highly configurable RF architecture running real time algorithms for envelope tracking and antenna tuning that enables cost-efficient multiband configurations, extended battery life, and global roaming in a single SKU. "The 7160 is a well-timed and highly competitive 4G LTE solution that we expect will meet the growing needs of the emerging global 4G market," Eul said. "Independent analysts have shown our solution to be world class and I'm confident that our offerings will lead Intel into new multi-comm solutions. With LTE connections projected to double over the next 12 months to more than 120 million connections, we believe our solution will give developers and service providers a single competitive offering while delivering to consumers the best global 4G experience. Building on this, Intel will also accelerate the delivery of new advanced features to be timed with future advanced 4G network deployments." Intel is currently shipping its single mode 4G LTE data solution and will begin multimode shipments later in the first half of this year. The company is also optimizing its LTE solutions concurrently with its SoC roadmap to ensure the delivery of leading-edge low-power combined solutions to the marketplace. Intel® Atom™ Platform Z2420 As Intel expands its geographic presence, the company sees tremendous opportunity in delivering rich Intel-based mobile experiences to consumers across emerging markets. As part of its strategy to take advantage of the fast growing market for value smartphones in emerging markets, which some analysts expect to reach 500 million units by 2015, Intel highlighted continuing momentum with the Intel Atom Processor Z2420 platform (formerly "Lexington"). Since it was first announced at CES, Acer* (Thailand, Malaysia), Lava* (India) and Safaricom* (Kenya) have all announced new handsets. Etisalat Misr*, a leading telco operator based in Egypt and a subsidiary of Etisalat group UAE, in collaboration with Intel today announced plans for the Etisalat E-20 Smartphone with Intel Inside®. Set to debut in Egypt in April, the Intel-based handset will be the first in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the second introduction in Africa to-date, building on the recent launch of Safaricom* in Kenya. Demonstrating the flexibility of the Atom SoC platform to accommodate a range of device and market segment needs, ASUS* later today will announce a new Android* tablet based on the Intel® Atom™ Processor Z2420. Tablets with Intel Inside® Building on the device momentum and industry-leading power-efficiency of the award-winning Atom processor Z2760, Intel's first quad-core Atom SoC ("Bay Trail"), will be the most powerful Atom processor to-date -- doubling the computing performance of Intel's current- generation tablet offering and providing the ecosystem with a strong technology foundation and feature set from which to innovate. The "Bay Trail" platform, scheduled to be available for holiday 2013, is already up and running on Windows* and Android* and will help enable new experiences in designs as thin as 8mm that have all-day battery life and weeks of standby. Intel is currently working with Compal*, ECS*, Pegatron*, Quanta* and Wistron* to accelerate "Bay Trail" tablets to the market. Intel is also extending its work with leading OEM partners globally, building on the strong foundation of Intel Atom processor Z2760-based tablet designs in market from Acer*, ASUS*, Dell*, Fujitsu*, HP*, Lenovo*, LG Electronics and Samsung*. Enabling Mobile Devices with Intel Inside® Intel today announced an expansion of its ecosystem enabling efforts to deliver new device and market innovations across a range of Windows*- and Android*-based mobile devices. Intel platform and enabling programs have been the foundation of OEM and ODM innovation for decades. The new program will focus on accelerating time to market for leading-edge mobile devices based on Intel® architecture with top OEMs and ODMs. The program will focus first on tablets, followed by phones, providing pre-qualified solutions with simplified building blocks to scale designs quickly for mature and emerging markets. The Atom Processor Z2760 and the company's forthcoming 22nm Atom SoC, codenamed "Bay Trail," will be the starting foundation for the effort.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361806134147</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:28:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361806327477-45</Id><Title>Intel Now Has Phones with 10 Companies in 20 Countries</Title><Msg>The tipping point has been reached.

Its Transformer line merges tablet and laptop, while the Padfone has been an effort to allow a phone to plug in to a larger screen and become a tablet. Now comes the Fonepad, a 7-inch Android tablet that also makes phone calls. Although it looks like a standard 7-inch tablet, it has built-in telephony features as well as an Intel processor. Asus Chairman Jonney Shih says that the company is trying new things to adapt to changing lifestyles, but insists the company isn’t just merging things just to see what can be mixed. “There is reason behind it,” Shih said in an interview. Most people spend a lot of time using their portable device as a computer and very little time making calls. So why, Shih, reckons, should the screen be so small. The size of people’s hands and their pockets certainly comes to mind. But Shih thinks there are people willing to carry a primary device that is the size of a tablet. Nor is Asus isn’t alone in putting phone capabilities into a clearly tablet-size product. Samsung is including phone capabilities in the global version of its just-introduced Galaxy Note 8.0. Asus is competing particularly hard on price. Asus plans to sell an 8GB version of the device for $249 unsubsidized. That’s not much more than a standard tablet without a built-in cellular modem. And while Asus is a longtime Intel partner for laptops and netbooks, the expansion into tablets is a welcome addition as the chipmaker struggles to land big-name mobile customers. The device is slated to go on sale in Asia in March, Europe and April and the United States shortly after that. Asus also introduced the latest in the Padfone line.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361817445159</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:37:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361817928407-74</Id><Title>Cisco Server with 4-core Intel CPU</Title><Msg>Cisco brings server virtualization to the branch office UCS Express is fast, easy to manage, well designed, and pricey By Joel Snyder, Network World February 25, 2013 06:00 AM ET</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361817928407</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:45:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361817943737-75</Id><Title>Italy just threw Europe back into a mess...</Title><Msg>They just re-elected there previous scandelous Prime Minister who they threw out.

Aimed at enterprise customers....not sure how the market will adopt it. ====================== New Windows 8 PC phone revealed, plus tablet and desktop It looks similar to the latest jumbo, slab phones, but it’s a more potent machine inside. The phone runs on Intel’s “Clover Trail” hardware and Windows 8 Pro, so it’s a full-blown PC capable of running most desktop software. Called the Intelegent, the device could go on sale this summer for $750, which is less than the price of an unlocked iPhone 5 with the same amount of storage capacity. The phone is more powerful than most tablets. It has an Atom processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage. It’s designed to work with HSPA+ and LTE 4G wireless networks and have up to 10 hours of talk time. I-mate will sell the phone alone or as part of a $1,600 desktop hardware suite including a docking station, called the “hub.” Docked in the hub, the phone can be used with a traditional, wired phone handset or make video calls. It also functions as a desktop PC — powering a 23-inch touch-screen display, keyboard and mouse — and drives an auxiliary wireless tablet with a 10.1-inch, 1080p display. blogsDOTseattletimesDOTcom/brierdudley/2013/02/25/new-windows-8-pc-phone-revealed-plus-tablet-and-desktop/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1361818076499</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:47:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361818096184-77</Id><Topic><Title>Performance: Clovertrail+ V Tegra 4</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361811991281</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 12:06:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would matter if true and it is an interesting first comparison. There are some tough problems in fairly comparing systems. All of the OS have power management systems that are configured by the user and can be modified to change the benchmark scores. There are configuration files that can set up to check for benchmark programs and override user defined power settings. The operating conditions can be different and affect the results. The device can be in airplane mode or using resources to connect to a network. Cycles spent on the net are not available for the benchmark. I expect the K900 (smartphone) has power management settings for smart phone. I would expect the Tegra 4 tablet reference platform to have settings for a tablet (I think that implies a larger battery). The HTC Honor 2 was able to bump their AnTuTu scores from 12,757 to 14,948 by adjusting their power setting dynamically. They watched for AnTuTu running and then overrode the power settings to run in benchmark mode. More data points will be needed for comparison but that will not insure more wins.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1361818096184</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:48:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361818145439-78</Id><Topic><Title>Breakout on INTC</Title><Username>barbourticiara81</Username><Timestamp>1361545250780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:00:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i just subscribed!</Msg><Username>latricia.eddy89</Username><Timestamp>1361818145439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:49:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361818219868-79</Id><Topic><Title>Increase your portfolio by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>harvey_irvin</Username><Timestamp>1361797694427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 08:08:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow great stuff cant wait</Msg><Username>charleselias22</Username><Timestamp>1361818219868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:50:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361819698379-80</Id><Title>"Billions" yes "Billions: of potential cost-conscious Mobile cusomters for Intel</Title><Msg>Why Intel Is Beating the Dow Today By Anders Bylund | More Articles February 25, 2013 | Comments (0) The Dow Jones International Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI ) is a mixed bag today. As of 1:15 p.m. EST, the blue-chip index is just 26 points, or 0.19%, below breakeven. One of the strongest gains came from semiconductor titan Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) , which rose 0.7% on renewed hopes in the mobile market. Intel just unveiled a handful of products aimed at the heart of mobile systems. The push into smartphones and tablets continued with two Atom-branded central-processor designs, one focused on high performance and the other more concerned with low cost. These chips support the Google Android software out of the box, and three device builders will introduce Android tablets with Intel Inside this quarter. In addition, Intel presented a reference design for Atom-based smartphones. Aimed chiefly at developing markets, the platform is already set to debut in Egypt, Kenya, and India this spring. Industry watchers like the combination of low cost and complete feature lists that Intel is offering, and Google will surely appreciate another tool for cracking open the smartphone market in a number of massive populations. We're talking about billions of cost-conscious potential customers here. If this platform is a hit, Intel might sacrifice some profit margin in exchange for large revenue streams. Last but not least, Intel also introduced a single-chip modem for 4G LTE wireless data connections. QUALCOMM (NASDAQ: QCOM ) revealed a similar product last week, and a plethora of wireless radio stocks plunged in response to the new competition. The same stocks are falling today thanks to Intel's entry into the market, albeit to a lesser degree. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) has lost 3.6% today, and RF Micro Devices (NASDAQ: RFMD ) has dropped 1.7% -- far less serious than last Thursday's 11% plunges. Intel is, after all, a relative upstart in wireless radios and less of an obvious threat than sector leader Qualcomm. Still, the salad days of low-hanging fruit may be over for Skyworks and RF Micro as single-chip solutions replace their bread-and-butter multiprocessor concoctions. It's much too early to count the old wireless guard out -- especially the quality-focused team at Skyworks. I'm sure they all have single-chip responses brewing in order to stay relevant. But it's also clear that Intel takes the mobile market very seriously. The company's smartphone and tablet portfolio has never been this complete, and I like the unexpected focus on low-cost products for underdeveloped markets.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361819698379</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:14:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361820490252-81</Id><Title>An Actual Positive Financial Story on Intel</Title><Msg>Check out this story just posted on Intel's Current Fiscal Condition.

The company has announced its first dual-core Atom processors (Clover Trail+) for smartphones and tablets. The Clover Trail+ Z2580 (2.0GHz), Z2560 (1.6GHz) and Z2520 (1.2GHz) CPUs are all 32nm processors. The company says these processors will deliver "industry-leading performance" thanks to the hyper-threading technology. Intel has also supposedly changed the battery performance of the new chip. The company says that the new processors will match the performance of all current high-end devices. Intel showed up at MWC with four new processors The three CPUs support full HD resolutions up to 1900 x 1200, Android 4.2 and have HSPA+ 42Mbps modems. The chipmaker has already inked pacts with ASUS, ZTE and Lenovo to bring devices with Clover Trail+. The graphics processor of the SoC is the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator engine, which supports video in 1080p, playable at 30 fps. It also boosts graphics performance up to three times over the last-gen graphics engine using a core that supports 533MHz using boost mode. The new Atom platform supports two cameras with 16MP sensor at the most. Intel says the camera on a Clover Trail+ can shoot up to 15 frames per second in burst mode. Intel also announced the quad-core Bay Trail processor line for use in tablets. Performance of the new processor is said to be double that of the last-generation tablet CPU. Intel claims it can produce this line using 8nm technology in the future. The Bay Trail processor will be making an appearance in Android and Windows 8 tablets by the holiday season with the likes of Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, LG Electronics and Samsung producing devices. The company also said that it will make a transition to 22nm Atom SoCs later this year for what would probably be a 2014 deployment. Finally, Intel’s chips will likely bring power-efficient multimode and multiband LTE along with them. The company announced the XMM 7160 LTE chip, which supports a massive 15 LTE bands simultaneously. The chip also contains the SKU that also gives OEMs connectivity for LTE, DC-HSPA+ and EDGE. The company hopes to ship the LTE chip with its new line of processors by the end of the year. “The 7160 is a well-timed and highly competitive 4G LTE solution that we expect will meet the growing needs of the emerging global 4G market,” Hermann Eul, Vice President and Co-General Manager - Mobile and Communications Group, Intel, said. “With LTE connections projected to double over the next 12 months to more than 120 million connections, we believe our solution will give developers and service providers a single competitive offering while delivering to consumers the best global 4G experience.” From Tech2</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361820993765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:36:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361820994403-84</Id><Topic><Title>Breakout on INTC</Title><Username>barbourticiara81</Username><Timestamp>1361545250780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:00:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for sharing this</Msg><Username>rebeccagraham22</Username><Timestamp>1361820994403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:36:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361821458991-85</Id><Title>Intel introduces new 4G LTE Modem</Title><Msg>This writer got it wrong relative to competitors.

Still, the salad days of low-hanging fruit may be over for Skyworks and RF Micro as single-chip solutions replace their bread-and-butter multiprocessor concoctions.</Msg><Username>inovermyhead_2000</Username><Timestamp>1361821458991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:44:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361822262194-86</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Now Has Phones with 10 Companies in 20 Countries</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361806327477</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:32:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a 40 dollar stock --------------------- U R NUUTIER THAN A SQUIRREL TURD, Buttcrack, but U sure provide plenty of laughs!

First 20nm Product Tape Out In the second quarter of 2013, Xilinx will tape out its first 20nm product on TSMC's 20SoC manufacturing process. Xilinx will be readying device samples this year for strategic customers who can begin implementing next-generation applications. First Ten Early Access Customers Xilinx is now engaging with the first ten customers on 20nm architecture evaluations and implementation activities. With availability of documentation since November 2012, Xilinx has been working closely with an increasing number of strategic customers doing early design work. I have a feeling that Xilinx will be at 14nm or lower in early 2014</Msg><Username>peak_n_valley</Username><Timestamp>1361832117408</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 17:41:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361832346326-126</Id><Topic><Title>illegal manipulation of Intel's by me today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1361501412738</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 21:50:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reporting this to SEC.

Sharing its manufacturing plants, or fabs, to strategic customers could help the world's top chipmaker offset the growing costs of developing new technology and help keep the plants running near capacity as Intel's traditional PC business loses steam. Intel will make Altera's programmable chips using its upcoming 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology, the most notable agreement of its kind announced so far by the chipmaker. "It's a step in terms of building into a business level we wish to achieve," Sunit Rikhi, Vice President and General Manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters on Monday. "There's no doubt in my mind the foundry will be a significant player in the future." Building new generations of chip manufacturing plants is becoming more and more expensive, and Intel has said in the past it was willing to open its facilities to carefully selected customers - as long as doing so does not its help competitors. Intel has announced agreements to manufacture on behalf of Achronix Semiconductor Corp and other small chipmakers but Monday's announcement with Altera, one of two leading programmable chipmakers, is potentially much larger. "They've crossed over the line from it just being a questionable experiment to - we're going to do this for tier-1 customers," said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. With Intel struggling to find its footing in smarpthones and tablets with its own processor designs, some investors believe Intel may eventually agree to make Apple's processors for the iPhone and iPad. "If and when we are called upon to serve large mobile customers who can drive a lot more volume, we could serve them today in terms of capability," Rikhi said. "I'm confident we have a very strong platform of offering upon which we can scale." He declined to discuss Apple specifically. HEAVY INVESTMENT Most chipmakers in recent decades have given up running their own capital-intensive fabs, turning instead to contract manufacturing "foundries" like Taiwan's TSMC. Intel has kept its own fabs and invested heavily in them over decades, resulting in a lead in manufacturing know-how that allows it to make chips that in some respects are more advanced than products from rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Altera Chief Executive John Daane told Reuters in a phone interview that Altera, which depends on communications infrastructure for about half of its business, is the only major programmable chipmaker that will have access to Intel's plants. "We are essentially getting access like an extra division of Intel. As soon as they're making the technology available to their various groups to do design work, we're getting the same," he said. Daane said Intel's manufacturing technology will give Altera's chips a several-year advantage against Xilinx, its main competitor in programmable chips. He said Altera would continue to make other chips with TSMC, its long-time foundry. Shares of Altera were unchanged in extended trading after closing down 0.96 percent at $35.01. Xilinx was down about 0.9 percent at $37, versus a close of $37.30 on the Nasdaq. Intel's stock was up 0.49 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.93 percent at $20.23.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361849702861</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 22:35:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361849839369-180</Id><Topic><Title>Altera will be Intel’s only FPGA customer on 14-nanometer manufacturing.</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361845102473</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 21:18:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You checking job openings for your research !!!!

Hmmmm, maybe he doesn't think Acronix is a major FPGA company. I suppose the agreement could have specifically excluded Xilinx. If so, I bet they had to pay extra for that.

Intel is looking less stodgy all the time...] Last week, with some fanfare, Intel, the world’s leading microprocessor company went into the media business with a new kind of online publication. It’s called iQ. This is no old-fashioned e-newsletter IT or B2B purchasing agents. iQ is a state-of-the-art zine trying to appeal to just about anyone who consumes news online. It uses a tiled Flipboard-style format, presents both aggregated and original content, which it categorizes into three categories: Media, Life and The Planet– pretty much covering everything this side of alien abductions. Other than the cover credit of “curated by Intel,” I found no mention of Intel or microprocessors. But I found two interesting reads on solar race cars and prosthetics for dolphins. The second is by the Intel curators–a cadre of 160 social-media certified Intel employees, who are picking and sharing what they like online. The content is reviewed by two editors before it is posted on iQ, and the most popular get larger display tiles, again using crowd preference to determine prominence. All content includes technology but the focus is not. This is an end-user publication and would not appeal to deep technologists. I would assume a great many of the topics being covered involve products powered by Intel, but on the surface, that appears to be besides the point. “We are following technology and all the wonderful places that it goes. Very often Intel was involved somewhere along the line, but that’s not what we are covering,” Bryan G. Rhoads, editor-in-chief told me. Rhoads is also the zine’s designer and has been among those working on the project for about a year. He is one of two editors who review content before it is posted, and is responsible for a food deal of the original content you see at iQ such as the dolphin prosthetic story. Rhoads told me the new zine is designed to take maximum advantage of touchscreen technology and sees iQ moving further toward mobile. He emphasized the current version is beta with “a great many” innovations coming in the short term. From a branding perception, bypassing it’s business customers and reaching out to their respective customers is nothing new for Intel. The company has been consumerizing microprocessors with the venerable Intel Inside® campaign since January 1991 when the company built a Disneyland-type booth for attendees to tour the inside of a Pentium chip at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. iQ is a neat and slick little zine, and in the short-term I would guess that it will be generally well received.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361852604519</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 23:23:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
