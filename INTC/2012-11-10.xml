Bear market rallies often get overbght at rsi 50 and fail to have macd crosses back up. By the time, the last bear ended the smh had lost 2'3rds it's value, way up there near 45.00, close to the 04 peak, to 15.00. INTC peaked in 2004 at 34.00, by 2007 it hadn't reached that point. Bear markets can have huge rallies, Washington Mutual, had a nice yield as well, dropped from the 40's to 10, rallied 100 percent, to 20.00, then in the end went bust. any new recession will drive the unemployment rate back up, and unemployed people don't buy houses. The most idiotic thing the retail consumer did when housing bubbled up was refinance to pull money out to buy junk, ie depreciating stuff.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352524924089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 00:22:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352532142049-2</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Paul O., how is business doing??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1352491108525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:58:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on!!!!

It features the same architecture as the Atom Z2460 but instead of a single Saltwell core it has two, with Hyper Threading enabled (2 cores, 4 threads). The CPU cores can burst at up to 1.8GHz, while the default max CPU frequency remains at 1.3GHz ---- Assuming all this is true, it means the Z2580 has a lower burst speed than the Z2460 (in the Razor I) meaning it'll have poorer Javascript benchmark numbers (as they are single threaded). The key thing about the Z2580 is the much improved GPU and LTE support.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1352537191174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 03:46:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352538027088-4</Id><Topic><Title>Can ARM cpus match Intel's Performance/watt ??</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352397480335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:58:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's you who doesn't understand fractions.

Using ApacheBench, a single 5.26 watt Calxeda EnergyCore server delivered 5500 transactions per second, compared to a 102 watt (TDP) Intel E3-1240 that saturated the network at 6950 TPS. About 2 months later, Intel spoke with Timothy Pricket Morgan at The Register to provide their response. You have to hand it to Intel; they make really fast processors, which are appropriate when maximum compute performance is needed. But Intel’s argument is missing the point, the very reason why Extremely Efficient Servers are a promising trend: by right-sizing the compute, memory, and networking infrastructure to meet real workload requirements, one can save a great deal of money and power. Intel’s response is classic PC-Server era thinking: use a faster CPU, and then feed it like a force-fed goose being prepped for foie gras. In this case they added a 10G ethernet port to try to close the gap. But if 5000 transactions per second is all your website needs, or you use load balancing to handle the peak loads above normal usage, Calxeda is dramatically more efficient. That is the point. It is a bit surprising Intel went to these lengths when Intel’s own math shows that Calxeda maintains a 4-5X performance/watt advantage versus the solution most websites would use. Apparently not satisfied, Intel then upped the ante and added an expensive 10 Gb network infrastructure to keep their uber-fast processor busy. With this configuration, Calxeda is still some 30% more efficient than the significantly more expensive* 10Gb Ivybridge solution. But small-medium web sites rarely use or need a 10Gb ethernet port; a 1Gb interface is usually sufficient for typical demand. Moreover, Intel’s proposed alternative would require two 10Gb top of rack switch (TORS) ports in addition to the 3 NICs (2 for data, 1 for management). Those TORS ports alone could add 10-15 watts per server for the 10Gb solution that were not included in Intel’s math. But hey, it won the benchmark (well, almost)! Calxeda is focused on providing energy-efficient solutions for real-world problems and we believe that bigger and faster is not always better. Leaner and cleaner can be less expensive and far less power hungry, lowering costs for real-world workloads which can be highly variable. Which is more representative of your real real-world environment? You be the judge. * Based on comparing the servers w/o disks to isolate the server-power, and adding 1 watt to each 5.26 watt Calxeda node to estimate wall power, assuming a modest 24 nodes in a chassis share the power supply and fans. Note that each Intel server equipped as Intel suggests would require a PCI extension with 10 Gb NICs, and switch ports; 2 for data and 1 for management. These are costly additions ($700 per 2 ports, plus the required 10Gb TORS ports) to the IvyBridge server, and of course consume even more power. We are still optimizing our platform and Calxeda will publish a slew of benchmarks and wall-power measurements in the coming weeks</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1352554016313</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 08:26:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352554120690-9</Id><Topic><Title>Can ARM cpus match Intel's Performance/watt ??</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352397480335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:58:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Low voltage 17W Xeons have twice the performance/power of performance orientated Xeons. ----- Yes, and the Atom server line.

Please read the last sentence of the paragraph carefully: --------------------------- From Anandtech: From the first paragraph of the same article you quoted (do a search for z2000, z2580 article dated 2/27/2012): Intel had a few updates about its Android SoC strategy for us at MWC this week. The first is a spec revision. The Atom Z2460 we talked about in great detail at CES was originally specced to run at a max of 1.3GHz but it could burst up to 1.6GHz if the thermal conditions allowed it (ala turbo boost). Z2460 yields on Intel's 32nm LP process are apparently better than expected so the Atom core will be able to turbo up to 2.0GHz instead of 1.6GHz. The default max frequency remains unchanged at 1.3GHz. ---------------- To summarize: The Z2460 was supposed to have a burst speed of 1.6GHz, but with good yields from its 32nm LP (low power) process, Intel was able to turbo it up to 2.0GHz. Now, if Intel could go from 1.6GHz burst speed to 2.0GHz for Z2460 - why wouldn't they be able to increase the burst speed for Z2580? With the target for burst speed for Z2580 being 1.8GHz, can they do 2.0GHz? Or go still higher to 2.2 or 2.4 GHz? I would bet they do at least 2.2GHz. Of course, better GPU and LTE integration would be great advantages as well to start winning against Qualcomm.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1352554375549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 08:32:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352556925827-11</Id><Topic><Title>Wintel or Andrel - INTC wins</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1352522651048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 23:44:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now, if Intel could go from 1.6GHz burst speed to 2.0GHz for Z2460 - why wouldn't they be able to increase the burst speed for Z2580?

This chip will be more difficult to boost as it will be much bigger (the extra CPU and big GPU V Z2460 ) but they may be able to boost one core independently so for those single threaded work loads (such as the javascript benchmarks) you'll get the same results as the Z2460 (@2.0GHZ but better if 2GHZ)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1352556925827</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 09:15:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352568155778-12</Id><Title>AAPL going away from INTC chips not good for INTC, The hope to get in phones is gone INTC was to late</Title><Msg>AAPL going away from INTC chips not good for INTC, The hope to get in phones is gone INTC was to late</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352568155778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:22:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352570553925-13</Id><Topic><Title>Can ARM cpus match Intel's Performance/watt ??</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352397480335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:58:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are a couple things, other than the system configuration problems, that might make a difference. The comparison is not fair. By a long shot. There are market segments that need to be discussed differently. The instruction sets on an ATOM are slightly different than a XEON CPU.

That is why Intel invests in their own compilers and yes, even Fortran. The Intel compiler just released has optimized BOOST libraries used in VINA that will make the comparison "unfair" in the Intel directioin. When someone says my system is faster and better than your system, the first thing to examine is the conditions used for the measurement. They used the CPU power for their "twice as fast" statement and used the E5 2620 95W times two to get 200W of power. I The lowpower website comparison was not fair for a number of reasons.

In Q1 2013, Intel will introduce Haswell. Haswell has a feature, TSX, that will allow multiple threads to make progress as long as the threads are not modifying the same data. The thread stall is gone and multi-threaded applications can run many times faster with no change. I have not looked at the code but when you link with pthreads to manage critical regions, you have locks, semaphores and other synchronizaion code. You can't have one thread modify data that another thread is looking at. One thread gets a lock and other threads wait until they can get their turn holding the lock.

Next week, Congress will be back in session. Expect more talks on the fiscal cliff which will likely keep traders on edge. Technically, stocks are oversold and they could rebound some more next week. The S&amp;P 500 is near the bottom of its down channel started in October. It could bounce toward the top of that channel near 1410. However, as the clock ticks toward year end, fear over falling off the cliff is likely to keep volatility relatively high until we get an idea on a workable solution. Trade the bounce but hedge or keep stops tight. have a nive weekend</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1352577113754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352577759037-27</Id><Topic><Title>One OT question:</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1352576944024</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:49:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just get her a cheap PC and use Windowns Media Player. If you want to store all your MP3s somewhere else other than on the PC--use Google play. You can set it up for her by putting it where she can find it easily on her desktop . Click and then click on the song she wants and it starts to play. JBL speakers are of course the best but Bose speakers are good and small sitting next to the screen. OH yeah--for her music--stuff that is real old--you can find it all on youtube and use" Free studio" MP3 converter to convert Youtube Video over to MP3s. You will find everything from the 1920s to now when looking for music. Oh yeah--no file sharing here so you do not need to worry. You will not open her up to sharing files with others. In fact--if you simply put the music on Windows media player for her--she will never ever have to worry.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1352577759037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 15:02:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352578048510-28</Id><Topic><Title>Can ARM cpus match Intel's Performance/watt ??</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1352397480335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:58:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: Calxeda's responce to Intel. I am not convinced there is the market Calxeda thinks there is for ultra cheap low power low performance servers, Seamicro never made a profit for instance before being bought by AMD. Servers are an important part of any company's infrastructure and they usually don't skimp on costs. If Calxeda does not have significantly better performance/power than LV Xeons or Atoms and I don't believe it does then it just won't sell especially as they are only 32-bit with very basic RAS features but hey they can knock themselves out trying, it's a free market ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1352578048510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 15:07:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352578642393-29</Id><Title>I just increased my Intel holding by 30%.

The idiots in Congress will of course end up giving OB everything he wants since they have no choice so there will be no deadlock. What? You listen to the #$%$ on CNBC and the networks? OK--Listen once here and then make some money. Remember the fiscal cliff deadlock last year and the deal struck? If Congress and OB do not reach a deal by the start of 2013, huge cuts kick in on military spending. the old tax rates under Clinton go back into play. SO? Did OB just win reelection? YES Does he have to run again EVER? NO So he can sit there and stare into Mitch McConnell's face and into BONERS face and smile--I will not give ONE bit on the increase in taxes on the rich. If you do not give me what I want--their taxes go up more than what I am offering. The 99% will hate you for letting their taxes go up and pushing the nation into recession and in the end--you will end up giving me everything I want anyway. SO--give it to me now and avoid the bloodshed but like I say--I will not bend. Elections have consequences and you just lost so eat it Mitch and Bone man. Boner to OB--BUT if I do this, I could lose re-election. OB--if you do not--you for sure will lose reelection and look like a fool too. Fuxed up news will sit there crying and asking for their country back while they call the Chicago guys names. But those Chicago guys kicked rump on Romney and now they are here to collect the winnings. There will be a deal sooner than you think and the stock market will rally to 15,000 before the end of the spring. Intel to 30.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1352578642393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 15:17:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352579037346-30</Id><Topic><Title>I just increased my Intel holding by 30%.

Moreover, Intel trades at much lower multiples of 9.6x and 11.2x past and forward earnings, respectively. With the largest economic moat in the field at a $110.4 billion valuation and a much higher dividend yield at 4.1%, there is simply little reason to buy TI over Intel. I believe that as macro trends pick up, investors will start to realize this and cause multiples to equalize. That means downside for TI and upside for Intel.</Msg><Username>bull_no_bear</Username><Timestamp>1352588146745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 17:55:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352609902174-32</Id><Topic><Title>One OT question:</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1352576944024</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:49:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for 85 yr old... something with buttons instead of pure touch screen sony, or some sandisk models if you really just want a large screen colby has some models with 4.7 to 5 inch screens if you want just screens... read the reviews...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352609902174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:58:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
