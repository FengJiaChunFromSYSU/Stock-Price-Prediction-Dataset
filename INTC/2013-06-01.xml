Even at 28nm, it competes and beats INTC at 22nm. It's a stunning design win for ARM. Who is going to build it? TSMC? My friends here in Taiwan are already pushing the limits of volume production, even to the point of prioritizing customers. Battleground. Looking forward: Companies see 22nm Haswell. x86 already runs Windows and Android. Dual boot means one less (large) overhead, design cost. Overhead drops, market reach (potential buyers) increases. Even if, only if, Haswell is on par with ARM, your market is shrinking (WIN RT is dead) by sticking solely with ARM. 2013, companies create hardware for Win, Android, and ARM? Good, work out the kinks for.... 14nm. No one is stating INTC's move to 14nm is a fantasy. How fast was FINFast crushed by analysts and people in the know? Eshraf? It's 2014. TSM is still maxing out their 28nm process. Why are they still maxed out? First, they didn't spend (or have) the billions in CAPEX in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Second, they can't functionally move past 28nm, yet. I would not, however, underestimate them. They will solve their problems, but this is a time to market argument. It's 2014. The smart company is working on form-factor, not platform... any transitional bumps in the road have been smoothed. 14nm fabrication is, once again, smaller, faster, cheaper (factor in 450mm wafers on top of that) than 22nm. Again, no one is doubting INTC's manufacturing processes. Volume is not an issue. IMHO, the laptop is dead. 2013 is the year of the tablet (detachable keyboard) for INTC. 2014 is the year of the smartphone. The main problem with a fabless business model is that someone needs to build your design. Even if ARM creates a masterpiece, there is no one to build it. Back in 2013, what should an ASUS, Lenovo, Acer, HP, Dell do? In the spirit of honest debate, please show me where I'm wrong. I don't bash and being refuted might save me some money</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370059353218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370059557845-2</Id><Title>One thing that sniffer Mr Weaver hasn't figured out, is that all his posts</Title><Msg>and everyone elses are on record, with dates.

The S&amp;P 500 has been climbing in a nice up channel since last November, and that is still intact. However, higher yields and tapering talks are relatively new for this market and will continue to keep investors nervous in the near term. In addition, the nearly 12% plunge in the Nikkei index in the last six session since it reached a multiyear high on May 22 can't be ignored by investors in the U.S. The market could be telling us that although QEs have floated equity prices higher, its effectiveness is diminishing. There will be plenty of data for the market to digest next week. The May ISM index will be released on Monday, followed by the ISM service index on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the ADP employment report will be out, which will lead to the official jobs report on Friday. Technically, for the S&amp;P 500, watch the 1600 area for support. The 1600 level is where the broader market index's 50-day moving average stands right now. It is also the lower bound of the rising channel the index is in. Breaking the 1600 level could indicate a longer term trend change.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1370071071047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 03:17:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370071309690-7</Id><Topic><Title>The battle begins at 22nm and ends at 14nm</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370059353218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It's a stunning design win for ARM." No. Intel had decided not to compete. Not enough margin, and they had a bigger battle with AMD for more lucrative business, like servers. AMD imploded since then. While Intel was looking the other way ARM has encroached their domain. It's a perfect time for Intel to fight back. Apple and ARM, and others, has developed a very lucrative marker that Intel didn't have to spend a dime on. Now Intel has the technology and the freedom to harvest and takeover that market. Otellini took all the right steps at the right time. Wall Street and Tech Media pundits always like a David/Goliath situation, and they exploited that for the last few years with David ARM since they gave up on their sweet David AMD. ARM will soon go back to being the king of the toasters and tv remote control. ARM design does quite well running deliberately crippled OS's. But as phones and tablet become computers consumers will want more. Like now. Apple and others now have no choice but to get on 22nm FinFET ASAP. I agree with much of rest of your post.</Msg><Username>butexcuseme</Username><Timestamp>1370071309690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 03:21:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370074001256-8</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung having serious problems with "big-little"</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370051850561</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 21:57:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wwwDOTgeekDOTcom/chips/samsung-is-putting-an-octo-core-exynos-in-its-arm-chromebook-1556999/</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1370074001256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 04:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370079591721-9</Id><Topic><Title>The battle begins at 22nm and ends at 14nm</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370059353218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"A stunning design win for ARM" is a hypothetical point.

GSM Arena conducted battery test comparision between galaxy S4 international version (Samsung's octa) and the US version (snapdragon 600). The 600 beats octa by a mile. Read it here: ibtimesDOTcoDOTuk/articles/473315/20130531/galaxys4-gti9500-gti9505-exynos5-snapdragon600-battery-testDOThtm The Snapdragon 600 quad-core variant of Samsung Galaxy S4 with model number GT-I9505 delivers longer battery life compared to the Exynos 5 octa-core variant bearing model number GT-I9500, according to battery tests. GSM Arena has conducted a range of battery tests which suggest the battery endurance capacity of Galaxy S4's Snapdragon 600 variant is more than the Exynos 5 variant, although both variants use similar battery (2, 600mAh). As the talk time battery test suggests, there is a remarkable difference between the talk times offered by both the models of Galaxy S4. The octa-core model stayed for just 11 hours in the test; which is approximately eight hours less than the talk time of the Snapdragon 600 variant, at 18 hours and three minutes. Unfortunately, the Exynos octa model of Galaxy S4 failed to match the talk time delivered by its major market rivals including Sony Xperia Z, both first and second generation Galaxy Notes, HTC One, Nexus 4 and HTC One X+. In the web bowing test, the Snapdragon 600 variant stayed for seven hours and 24 minutes as opposed to the browsing life offered by Exynos 5 variant at six hours and 58 minutes. The results were similar again in the video playback test. The battery of Galaxy S4 Snapdragon 600 model drained out after staying for 12 hours and 30 minutes: which is an hour more than the video playback time delivered by the Exynos 5 model. Moreover, the Snapdragon 600 model was one among the top five performers in the video playback test.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1370098606402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 10:56:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370099484010-16</Id><Title>sweet divy coming next week</Title><Msg>divident</Msg><Username>starbauch</Username><Timestamp>1370099484010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 11:11:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370102057638-17</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung having serious problems with "big-little"</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370051850561</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 21:57:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARMH will be below $20 by end of year.

When Intel's 14nm FinFET product hits the market, it is going to change the competitive landscape forever...] Watch for four positive developments, starting with long-awaited gains in mobile devices. Intel launched its Atom processors in 2008 as low-cost components for netbooks, but has quietly moved them to the forefront of its development efforts. This year it launched Atom chips with cutting-edge, 22-nanometer designs, and next year it will move to 14 nm, while ARM-based chips likely will be stuck at 28 nm. The numbers refer to the line width of patterns created on chips. Finer patterns allow for faster processing, lower power consumption, or both. Samsung and Asus recently chose Atom chips to replace ARM-based chips in larger tablets that use Google' s (GOOG) Android operating system. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore calls that a harbinger of success, and expects Intel to gain share in tablets this year and smartphones starting next year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370102506836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 12:01:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370102642967-19</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung having serious problems with "big-little"</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1370051850561</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 21:57:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, and for some reason it will still have a higher P/E than INTC. why not, eh?

I’ve been researching device modularity since 1996 and have kicked it into high gear over the last few years with phones, tablets and PCs. Think of how the smartphone has sucked in the GPS, mp3 player, and camera and has the potential to do the same to the TV remote and even auto entertainment. I’ve been doing a lot of research lately on the potential for a touch-based PC to pull utility away from 10” tablets, and based on what Intel INTC +0.27% has said publicly on Haswell, I think the “2 in 1” case gets very strong. Let’s start with some grounding and context. The first day I used the iPhone in 2007, I knew that if that same utility could be shifted to a larger display, it would provide a very good experience. Many people thought I was nuts where I worked at the time, but based on how the iPad has been received, it was a solid prediction. The distinction between the iPad and PCs in 2010 was immense: Notebooks required keyboard and touchpad, lasted 3-4 hours, weighed 4 lbs, could be two inches thick, took 10 seconds to wake from sleep, and required expensive shrink-wrapped software. You can find some of the gory details on PC of the past here. Of course the 10” iPad looked sexy and operated with finger touch, delivered up to 10 hours battery life, 1.5 lbs, was half an inch thick, immediately woke from sleep, and had fun apps for $.99. Net-net, the iPad trumped the PC on many content consumption vectors and the downsides of not running Windows, MS Office, lack of USB weren’t an issue for an extended device. Users didn’t replace the notebook with an iPad, but it augmented and extended the overall compute experience.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370106495603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 13:08:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370106596681-25</Id><Title>Forbes: Intel Haswell Dramatically Strengthens The '2 In 1' Device Argument Part II</Title><Msg>If you fundamentally buy into the 10” iPad’s attractiveness on variables of design, touch, battery life, weight, responsiveness, thickness and cheap, responsive apps, we all need to anticipate what Intel’s Haswell offers and its impacts to tablets. Compared to Intel’s Ivy Bridge, Haswell provides twice the GPU performance, 10% more CPU performance, but most importantly, brings the power down to #$%$ using what Intel calls, “scenario design power” (SDP). SDP isn’t TDP (thermal design power), but it’s closer to how smartphone and tablet SOC makers measure power. In fact, try to find a spec sheet on how many watts a modern tablet SOC draws. Good luck. The typical 10” Android or iOS tablet draws around 4-5 watts at peak power, so hopefully you can see how the world could change with a #$%$ Haswell. Let’s assume that Intel stops at #$%$ SDP and goes no further and discuss potential implications. At #$%$ SDP, this could enable a tablet, detachable, or convertible with up to 8-10 hours of battery life with PC-like performance. As a tablet, it would require a small fan and if it were a tablet would be a bit thicker than the iPad at 11-12mm, a bit heavier, and more expensive. The trade-off is you get PC performance and features. Consider a convertible or detachable in this scenario. You are basically getting the most powerful notebook at the thinnest dimensions with up to 8-10 hours battery life, always-on, always connected that can serve as a decent tablet under many circumstances. All three of these form-factor scenarios are powerful, and I believe that this would sway many people to buy a new Haswell-based tablet, detachable or convertible. At this point you need to question just how many consumers will lay down $699 for your typically configured 10” iPad.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370106596681</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 13:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370106696336-26</Id><Title>Forbes: Intel Haswell Dramatically Strengthens The '2 In 1' Device Argument Part III</Title><Msg>Now let me speculate a bit on what could be in store for Intel’s Haswell.

I’m speculating, yes, but this could mean a fanless tablet as thin, light, with similar battery life to today’s iPad but with PC-level performance. This could be the game changer as it would guarantee a “2 in 1” as it relates to 10” tablets. At that point, the only debate is price. No, Intel’s competition isn’t standing still, but, nonetheless, Haswell will be a real disruptor to the entire 10” tablet ecosystem over the next year and I believe provide a boost in PC sales.

Under the agreement, Samsung Electronics will use Intel’s Atom-branded processors in its Galaxy Tab3 tablets. The latest move is expected to pave the way for Intel to expand its presence in the rising mobile device market. The Tab3 is expected to be unveiled at the 2013 Computex conference during the first week of June in Taiwan. “This is a win-win deal for both sides. Intel, which is trying to cut its heavy reliance on PC business, offered better pricing for Samsung that is shifting its focus toward tablets following its huge success in smartphones,” a Samsung research staff at one of its local factories Thursday. “Samsung wants to secure as many processors as possible at better pricing. That’s why Samsung Electronics has recently been diversifying its procurement channel in processor chips as a strategy to stabilize production yields of its in-house Exynos-branded processors,” he added. Samsung’s co-CEO Shin Jong-kyun recently told reporters that it plans to grow its tablet business two-fold by 2013 by selling some 33 million Galaxy Tabs. He then vowed to expand its leadership in the smartphone to tablet sector. Processor chips are powering an entire computing system and chip makers are migrating to the profitable chips amid the increase of data-intensive devices. Intel is considered a late comer in the market. In an apparent strategy to further expand its partnership with Samsung, Intel Korea is hiring more chip developers, according to industry officials. “The number of Intel’s Atom-branded chip engineers increased to over 50 this year from last year’s six in Korea. Most of them are working for Samsung-related projects with a mission to customize circuits for adaptation on Samsung products,” said an Intel source, asking not to be named. An Intel spokeswoman in Korea said it doesn’t publicize the number of chip engineers. Through its collaboration with Samsung Electronics, Intel is trying to expand its presence in the mobile technology industry and to offset falling sales in conventional chips. Intel has been improving the performance and energy efficiency of its “Atom” and “Core” processors and embracing Google Android, with the hope that it will convince more device makers to use its chips in their products. Lee Hee-sung, country manager at Intel Korea, is ready to back the headquarters’ drive for mobile processors as he hinted at launching a full-scale promotional campaign to push leading consumer electronics firms including LG Electronics to buy its Atom processors. “Intel is strongly requesting Samsung and LG Electronics to use our processors for their smart devices and I can say the chances are very high,” said Lee in a recent meeting with reporters at its office in Yeouido, Seoul. “The smartphone market will expand in a steady manner. Intel has more chances to grow our processor business as manufacturers are reviewing the possibility of using different chips from different sourcing channels in order to lower risks in sourcing,” said Lee.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1370120674851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 17:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370121428575-37</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung said likely to use Intel in some smartphones.</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1370120674851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 17:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung as and Intel foundry customer for Samsung products incorporating the Atom core.

It is not functional or even powered on in the shipping product (i9500). In fact, this has been such of an issue, that as a result, the chip was almost cancelled. It was reportedly only salvaged by having it work in the cluster migration policy and bypass the CCI entirely. While contradicting, it questions the validity of ARM’s own videos while demonstrating the Octa. Internally at SLSI, as many as three projects were cancelled late last year. We don’t know the reasons for their cancellation, however it is said that the issues are related, and unacceptable power consumption also plays a big role. One can argue that ARM’s Cortex A15 is partly to blame here: The inherent architecture is to power consuming to be implemented in a smart-phone. big.LITTLE provides major breathing-room, but only in scenarios where continuous load is not an issue. HD gaming is a major Achilles heel where power consumption can run rampant. Nvidia is having it much worse with their Tegra 4: With only a single tablet design win besides their own Shield gaming console, it’s a chip that needs to, and will be, quickly forgotten. Plagued by delays, hardware bugs, and high power consumption, one could view the Exynos 5410 as nothing short of a failure. In fact, Samsung’s Mobile division was so dismayed at the whole situation that their next major products will completely forego the company’s own Exynos chips and go straight with Qualcomm’s offerings. Reports that the Note 3 would come with the S800 match with this information, and are probably very correct."

Though we expect the company to save its best announcements for the Build developer conference on June 26th, we will likely learn more about Windows 8.1 at Computex. Microsoft Corporate Vice President of the OEM Division Nick Parker will be giving a keynote address on Wednesday where he may demo Windows 8.1. We also wouldn't be surprised to see some devices at Microsoft's booth with the new OS preloaded. Android Everywhere At last year's event, we saw our first Android stick. Since then, several companies have announced Android gaming systems and we've even seen an Android notebook in the HP SlateBook X2.

[This was posted yesterday.] You know what that means! Er, wait. You might not, actually. It means Computex is coming next week. Every year, in early June, tech movers and shakers converge in Taipei, Taiwan, for Computex, a five-day trade show celebrating all things computing-related. Computex is big—it’s often the biggest expo of the year for PC manufacturers such as Acer, AMD, and Asus. Computex is revelatory. Computex is important. One of the biggest reasons for that: Computex keeps it real. Boots on the ground, not pie in the sky Let's be honest: The gadgets unveiled at CES and CeBIT may be killer, but they’re usually prototypes or reference designs that surface for that particular show and then disappear for months on end. Ultra-high-res 4K displays, flexible smartphone screens, vibrating forks, and their ilk are cool, but they’re experimental, big-picture things that show what might one day be. They’re not real-world products destined to appear in stores anytime soon. Tellingly, most of the standouts at CES 2013 have yet to hit the streets, more than six months later. But things are different at Computex. “The time of the year is perfect to show what the holiday season has in store for us,” says Carolina Milanesi, Gartner’s research vice president for consumer technologies. “In a way, CES is the promise of what could be, and Computex is the execution of that promise.” From PCWorld</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370130778220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:52:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370130875694-50</Id><Title>Teeing up for Taipei: Why Computex matters Part II</Title><Msg>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy, has been to Computex 15 times, and he echoes Milanesi’s sentiment almost word for word. “Computex’s timing in June makes it a very good time to go showcase the real products that will be assorted during the back-to-school and holiday timeframe,” he says. “CES and CeBIT aren’t optimal for this because the shows are too early.” What is dreamed at CES is delivered at Computex. At CES, Intel showed off a pie-in-the-sky reference design for a hybrid laptop powered by its long-promised Haswell processor. At Computex, Intel is actually launching Haswell. A flood of Windows 8 devices, including Acer's W510 hybrid tablet, appeared at Computex 2012. Likewise, last year’s Computex was a parade of live tiles, hybrids, and touchscreens, as Asian manufacturers gave physical-hardware form to the promises of Windows 8’s software. What gadgets will companies unveil at the show this year? We can only guess for now, but one thing is certain: What you see at Computex, you’ll get by the holidays. Location, location, location If Computex is so critical to the crucial holiday push, why don#$%$ organizers move the show stateside, where it would be bound to garner more American attention? Well, Computex is produced by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, and that alone cancels out any thoughts of transferring the show to the United States. But beyond that, Computex’s location makes it vitally important to the entire technology industry.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370130875694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370131067823-51</Id><Title>Teeing up for Taipei: Why Computex matters Part III</Title><Msg>“Computex is a key show for its location, right in the middle of where everything comes to life: Taiwan,” says Milanesi. “I always think of Taiwan as the manufacturing arm of Silicon Valley. [Manufacturers] that matter in the computing-devices business all have a presence there.” Major manufacturers such as Foxconn and Pegatron indeed call Taiwan home. Holding Computex in their backyard not only gives the show a cultural vibe you won't find in the West, but also grants big-name Western companies (such as Intel and AMD) access to a rising star in the world of consumer technology. “Computex is a very important show for non-Asian tech companies,” says Moorhead. “Taiwan is a major tech gateway to China, the fastest-growing technology market. Chinese come to the show, and also the press stories are covered in China out of Taiwan.” Chinese contacts and Chinese press are worth their weight in gold in the technology world. “If Computex moved to Vegas, attendance would be huge, but you would lose an important part of the show—the culture,” Milanesi says. “Companies like Asus, HTC, and Mediatek have a distinct culture that would just get lost overseas.” Even if they come in the wee hours, the reports still flow from Taipei, and the most important gadgets are highlighted in roundups that publish at times more reasonable for the North American audience. We’ll be shining a spotlight on the biggest news out of Taipei all next week.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370131067823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:57:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370131163632-52</Id><Title>Teeing up for Taipei: Why Computex matters Conclusion</Title><Msg>"If you want to see what the true tech of tomorrow will be, rather than vague promises and smoky vaporware, you need to keep an eye on Taipei."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370131163632</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:59:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370131250120-53</Id><Topic><Title>Alex</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1370127673128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:01:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These are fun puzzles. Thinking .... thinking .... I guess a ...... a "Diagonal Bull Call Spread" The volume is rarely all buys or sells. The transactions are rarely one person/group but large trades like this with low open interest are usually instigated "mostly" by one person/organization. It looked like during the day that the BID SIZE on the 6/7 was higher than the ASK SIZE. That would suggest buying. The 6/22 looked like the reverse. Someone appeared to be selling. If I combined the two transactions, the reason someone would buy near at 6/7 cents bid/ask and sell the June 22nd for a 7/9 bid/ask would be to own control of the shares during the Haswell introduction and the Intel speeches on Taipei Tuesday of Kilroy, Skaugen (PCCG) and Eul (Mobile and Comm). If I just use the closing option prices and link the two trades (and assume 15,000 contracts) it looks like a "Diagonal Bull Call Spread" computing something like .... Bottom line ..... The bid/ask of the near call of 6/7 cents, and the bid/ask of the far call of 7/9 Someone probably put in a combo option order to buy 15,000 June 7th $25 calls and sell 15,000 June 22nd $26 calls with a CREDIT of 2 cents. If Intel tanks, they make the 2 cents a share spread. If Intel goes to $100, they make a maximum of $1.02. The 2 cents premium plus the $1 difference between the calls. They have a profit. The only risk would be if Intel went above the near call, shares were assigned and then Intel tanked leaving them holding the bag. You can imagine what risk that would be and outs they could take. 2 cents per share is $2 per contract. They lock in $30,000 minimum CREDIT for 15,000 contracts. Upside of $30,000 + $1 per share or $30,000 + $1,500,000 = $1,530,000 max. Just my guess and worth slightly more than it costs. Lots of rambling ... sorry.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370131250120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 20:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370133648772-54</Id><Title>This stock will go down next week on Haswell news and pumping by</Title><Msg>Mr Weaver..

When their is a 10k block, you have to expect that the option market maker is on one side of the trade. If the OMM is on one side of the trade, you have to assume that he can see the orders and will only take the trade when he can lock in at least a small profit based on his total holdings. There are a lot of option sayings or folklore that I think are just wrong. PUT/CALL ratio .... lots of calls bullish. lots of puts bearish. Not necessarily. If I sell 10,000 Intel July $20 calls, that is not "bullish". I am either expecting the price to drop or it is a proxy sell. Worse yet, selling the calls can be a proxy for SHORTING plus the shorter is pocketing the option premium. When the calls are assigned and he does not own the stock, the shares are shorted in his account. If I sell 10,000 Intel July $25 puts, that is not "bearish". I am expecting to get shares and the option premium OR I expect the Intel price to rise making my puts expire worthless. That is Bullish. IF THE OPEN INTEREST on our early June 7 calls was much greater than 15k contracts, then it could have been someone ROLLING UP 15k contracts from $25 to $26 in hopes of keeping the shares. It is very easy to misinterpret trades. The trading pattern of the stock gives some clues but they are easy to miss. It makes my tiny brain hurt. Options gurus on TV make my brain chuckle.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370138486815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 22:01:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
