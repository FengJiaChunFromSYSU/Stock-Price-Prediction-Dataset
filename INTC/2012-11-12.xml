Chips in the Xeon Phi range, also called "Knights Corner," work with server CPUs to speed up scientific, math and graphics tasks. Targeted at servers and supercomputers, the first Phi chips have 60 or more cores, with the fastest chips delivering more than a teraflop of performance per second. The Phi chips are the stepping stones toward Intel's goal of reaching an exaflop (about 1,000 petaflops) supercomputer by 2018. The first Xeon Phi chips will be used alongside Intel's Xeon E5 server CPUs in a 10-petaflop supercomputer called Stampede that could be active at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas by early next year. Boosting computing power is necessary to solve complex scientific and national security issues, said Joe Curley, marketing director of Intel's Technical Computing Group. Applications can be broken down and executed simultaneously over multicore Phi chips within defined power limits, Curley said. The Phi chips mix x86-compatible general-purpose and vector processors, and are a response to high-end graphics processors such as Tesla from Nvidia. Some of the world's fastest supercomputers today, including the U.S. Department of Energy's Titan supercomputer and the Tianhe-1A system at the National Supercomputer Center in Tianjin, China, combine Nvidia GPUs with x86 CPUs. The first Knights Corner chip to ship is the Xeon Phi 5110P, which has 60 cores and a clock speed of 1.05GHz. It offers 1,011 gigaflops of peak double-precision performance, 30GB of cache and memory capacity of 6GB. Much like a graphics card, the chip can be plugged into a PCI-Express 2.0 slot, and is cooled by a system fan. Curley said the product is priced competitively with Nvidia's Tesla or AMD's FireStream GPUs, which are used in supercomputers. Intel will also ship two Phi 3100 series chips in the first half of next year. The chips will offer peak double-precision performance of 1 teraflop per second, and include 28.5GB of cache and memory capacity up to 6GB. The Phi 3100A will come with its own fan, while the 3100T uses the system's fan. Intel did not provide specific pricing or a shipping date for the chips. Intel also announced the Phi SE10X and SE10P processors with 61 cores and 1,073 gigaflops of computing power. The parts were specifically built for TACC's Stampede supercomputer and will not be released commercially, Curley said. In addition to TACC, some leading companies and institutions will support Phi chips in servers and supercomputers, Curley said. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Asus and Acer are expected to offer Phi chips in products ....</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1352732668381</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 10:04:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352732901740-16</Id><Topic><Title>NOTICE</Title><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1352685782508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 21:03:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!

The two companies have already been at each other in courtrooms across the world fighting over alleged patent violations, and according to a new report, there is now a fresh wedge between them. Samsung has raised the price of mobile processor it supplies to Apple by almost 20 percent, Chosun Ilbo reported on Monday. “Samsung Electronics recently asked Apple for a significant price raise in (the mobile processor known as) application processor,” a source was quoted as saying in the report, according to Market Watch. “Apple first disapproved it, but finding no replacement supplier, it accepted the (increase.)” Our 20-page proprietary analysis of Apple’s stock is ready. Click here and to get your Cheat Sheet report now! Apple bought application processors for the iPhone and the iPad from Samsung to the volume of 130 million units last year and more than 200 million units this year, the report said. The Korean company has a contract to supply the processors, including the A6 chip for the iPhone 5 and the A6X processor for the fourth-generation iPad, until 2014 and the two companies have already begun reflecting the new supply price. There have been rumors recently that Apple is seeking alternative chip suppliers in order to reduce its dependence on Samsung and may have recruited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) to begin building quad-core 20-nanometer chips for it starting late next year. It has also been speculated that Apple may be looking to start designing its own processors and reduce its dependency on external suppliers. The company recently hired former Samsung and AMD (NYSE:AMD) chip specialist Jim Mergard. Do you really think TSM has the capicity to handle this at 20nm when they can't even supply 28nm to clients in quanities needed?</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1352737207451</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:20:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352737515614-33</Id><Title>AMD will bring out ARM Opteron APUs before X86 version</Title><Msg>CHIP DESIGNER AMD said it needs to get ARM CPU cores accessing the same memory as its GPU cores before it can bring out ARM accelerated processing units (APU). AMD's decision to design ARM chips for servers means that the firm can combine the ARMv8 architecture with its own GPU, something the firm already revealed to The INQUIRER. Now AMD has said that it needs to ensure both the CPU and GPU can access the same shared memory before it will launch an ARM based APU. Suresh Gopalakrishnan, corporate VP and GM of AMD's Server Business Unit told The INQUIRER the firm could already design an ARM chip with a CPU and GPU that would each have their own memory, however that won't bring the advantages in both programmability and performance of having a shared memory structure between the two cores. He also talked up OpenMP support in future ARM APUs, an application programming interface that both Nvidia and Intel are working to support in their Tesla and Xeon Phi accellerators, respectively, for sharing memory among different cores. Gopalakrishnan said, "You'll see the ARM APU first [before an Opteron APU]. You'll see the first ARM APU at a similar time as the first ARM chip. The value proposition [of an APU] is that we can go to the memory controller to access a common memory pool, that is what we have already done between our X86 and GPU cores. ARM has joined the HSA foundation and we have some work to do to make the ARM [core] and the GPU access the same memory. [...] Once that is done we can bring an ARM APU to the market." AMD had previously said that Opteron APUs were in the pipeline, but Gopalakrishnan's comments suggest that Opteron APUs will not appear before 2014 at the earliest. It is a shame for the firm, which could have played on its GPU technology to win some server business from Intel and its Xeon chips. Nonetheless, AMD must think it has a better chance of gaining market share in the newer ARM server market. µ</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352737515614</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:25:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352738283590-34</Id><Topic><Title>Today will be bottom</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1352737176719</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:19:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It desperately needs some good news... the whole tech sector is down, but intel isn't down as much as the rest of it.. without some good news of substance though, I don't see it going up very much.

Because they handle hundreds of calculations simultaneously, GPUs can go through many more than CPUs in a given time. Yet they draw only modestly more electricity. By relying on its 299,008 CPU cores to guide simulations and allowing its Tesla K20 GPUs, which are based on NVIDIA's next-generation Kepler architecture to do the heavy lifting, Titan will be approximately ten times more powerful than its predecessor, Jaguar, while occupying the same space and drawing essentially the same level of power. When complete, Titan will have a theoretical peak performance of more than 20 petaflops, or more than 20,000 trillion calculations per second. This will enable researchers across the scientific arena, from materials to climate change to astrophysics, to acquire unparalleled accuracy in their simulations and achieve research breakthroughs more rapidly than ever before. The University of Texas Intel 6,400 PHI based machine was also new in the top 10 results. This is the reason that Intel released a new C and Fortran compiler in January. The Univ of Texas needed a compiler for their benchmark run. The other new system in the Top 10 is Stampede, a Dell PowerEdge C8220 system installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas in Austin. It uses the brand new Intel Xeon Phi processors (previously known as MIC) to achieve its 2.6 Petaflop/s.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1352742910133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:55:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352743277919-42</Id><Title>Intel's Xeon Phi cracks top 500 supercomputers</Title><Msg>SAN JOSE, Calif. – Intel’s Xeon Phi co-processor made a strong showing on the latest list of the world’s Top 500 supercomputers, powering seven of the systems including one in the top 10. Nvidia’s graphics chips continued to dominate the coprocessor category, and the Infiniband interconnect widened its lead over Ethernet as the top interconnect. Titan, a Cray XK7 system installed at Oak Ridge National Lab, ranked as the world’s most powerful system at 17.59 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark. It uses nearly 300,000 AMD Opteron processors and 261,632 Nvidia K20x graphics chips as accelerators. Although it consumes a whopping 8.21 megawatts, the Cray Titan edged out IBM’s BlueGene/Q architecture as more energy efficient, delivering 2,143 Mflops/W. BlueGene/Q was the most popular architecture in the top 10, used by the second, fourth, fifth and ninth most powerful systems. Twenty-three systems on the latest list cracked the petaflops milestone. Roadrunner, the first petaflops-class system, debuted on the Top 500 four-and-a-half years ago. The use of massively multicore coprocessors is fueling the rapid rise in performance. Sixty-two systems on the latest Top 500 list used coprocessors, up from 58 six months ago. Fifty of the supercomputers on the latest list use Nvidia graphics chips as coprocessors. Intel’s Xeon Phi appeared in seven of the systems including Stampede, a Dell PowerEdge C8220 system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center in Austin, Texas. Stampede hit 2.6 petaflops, good for seventh place on the list. Xeon Phi surpassed accelerators such as the AMD Radeon and IBM Cell, used in three and two systems, respectively. “There’s a need for energy efficient architectures,” said Erich Strohmaier of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of four researchers who compile the Top 500 list. “IBM's BlueGene/Q architecture as well as accelerators from Nvidia, Intel and others offer different alternative paths towards this goal, and currently there is no clear winner among them,” he said.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352743277919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 13:01:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352749205751-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332 Romney 206 HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA LOSERRRRRRS</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1352669134420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:25:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU LOST! HAA HAAA Get over it. Obummer will get credit for the following BOOM in the American economy to come now. By 2020, United States Will Become World's Leading Oil Producer, Says IEA By 2020, the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia to become the world's leading oil producer, the International Energy Agency says in a new report. At the moment, the United States imports 20 percent of its energy. So this prediction is bold and points to "a dramatic reversal" for the U.S. "The result is a continued fall in U.S. oil imports, to the extent that North America becomes a net oil exporter around 2030," the report finds. "This accelerates the switch in direction of international oil trade towards Asia, putting a focus on the security of the strategic routes that bring Middle East oil to Asian markets." So Obummer gets us to 2016 and by then the American oil boom will be in full gear. Then Hillary wins and rides the Libs to oil independence day and the economy goes nuts. By the time she leaves office in 2024, the GOP will be ROADKILL! Texas will be Dem along with Florida, California, and New York--GAME SET MATCH! Quit you crying Teabaggers.

It is supposed to launch in Q2 2013 from what we know and at this time it won’t storm much of the desktop market. The current plans for desktop CPU transition state that in the first half of 2013 less than five percent of all Intel desktop processors shipped will have a Haswell core. Sandy Bridge E will remain fixed at its one to two percent, as it always was, while Ivy Bridge is destined to take some 75 percent of total processor shipped. Atom remains fixed at less than 5 percent, while Sandy Bridge remains at slightly over than 10 percent. These are estimate numbers, of course. This is what Intel hopes and expects and sometimes it doesn’t live to its expectation. The projection for the desktop mix in 2H 2013 looks rather interesting, as Sandy Bridge will remain with very small market share, well below Atom market share that stands fix at around 5 percent. According to the latest Intel plans Sandy Bridge should stay within one and two percent in 2H 2013 market share. Ivy Bridge will decline to 60 to 65 percent while Haswell could occupy a massive 20 percent of market share in the second half of 2013. This is definitely a smaller ramp than with Ivy Bridge, that started with some less than five percent in first half of 2012, only to grow to 35 percent in second half of 2012. Haswell won’t be able to grow that fast, and we remain curious about the cause. It might be that Haswell will have an aggressive role on the mobile front as with its 10 W TDP possibility it might end up quite attractive. At this time, these are the desktop numbers and the mix that is expected for the latter part of 2013.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352750424434</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352751563334-45</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell 20 percent of market in 2H 13</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352750424434</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:00:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hate it or love it, Intel's on top and we gonna shine homee til out heart stop.</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1352751563334</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:19:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352752213421-46</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell 20 percent of market in 2H 13</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352750424434</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:00:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suspect both the Haswell and Atom (Clovertrail/Medfield) figures will be higher.

Both of them will also feature 3MB of L3 cache, Intel's HD 4000 graphics part and most likely, will support Intel's Hyper-threading technology. The Core i3-3227U will have a slightly higher (100MHz) clock when compared to the 1.8GHz clocked Core i3-3217U CPU released back in June. As a part of the cheaper ULV lineup, the Core i3-3227U will lack Intel's Turbo Boost feature and will most likely replace the previously noted Core i3-3217 CPU. The Core i5-3337U will have a slightly lower 1.8GHz base clock, but will feature Intel's Turbo Boost that will take it as high as 2.7GHz when needed.

"Unlock and Unleash with Extreme Confidence," the company says in its announcement of the new enthusiast products, which include a "full complement of controls targeted for performance tuning and overclocking." The new i7-3960X for desktops joins the i7-3920XM for laptops, released earler this year, at the top of Intel's enthusiast line. Enthusiasts hankering for either of those two chips should be forewarned that they'll pay a hefty premium to chase the heights of enthusiastic performance: the OEM "tray" price for the the i7-3960X is $999 and the i7-3920XM, $1,096; the new i7-3960X is also available in a consumer-market box for $1,059. The six-core, 12-thread i7-3960X has a base clock speed of 3.3GHz that's turbo-boostable to 3.9GHz, and includes 15MB of cache. It supports 64GB of RAM in four DDR3-1066/1333/1600 memory channels with a maximum bandwidth of 51.2GB/s, is baked in a 32-nanometer process, and has a thermal design point (TDP) of 130 watts. the Intel Desktop Board DX79SR Extreme Series is chock-full of enthusiast-level goodies (click to enlarge) The new Desktop Board DX79SR, code-named "Stormville", is – as surely you've guessed – based on Intel's X79 Express chipset, and is designed for Extreme Edition processors like the i7-3960X that slip into its LGA2011 socket. The DX79SR has three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots along with eight DIMM slots that Intel says will support overclocked DDR3-2400 memory, delivering up to 64GB/s memory bandwidth – although Intel notes in a fine-print footnote on the board's product brief that "DDR3 2400 memory support on this motherboard requires advanced knowledge of BIOS and memory tuning; individual results may vary." The same fine print also issues a stern note of caution to overclockers: "Warning: Altering clock frequency and/or voltage may (i) reduce system stability and useful life of the system and processor; (ii) cause the processor and other system components to fail; (iii) cause reductions in system performance; (iv) cause additional damage; and (v) affect system data integrity. Intel has not tested, and does not warranty, the operation of the processor beyond its specifications." That language was undoubtedly inserted by Intel's legal team, but it's unlikely to deter enthusiastic overclockers undaunted by the prospect of unspecified "additional damage.".</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1352752890114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:41:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352753593975-50</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332 Romney 206 HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA LOSERRRRRRS</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1352669134420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:25:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>headed to be a 3rd world country. you guys are happy because of one thing "entitlements" get a job!</Msg><Username>gotburned26</Username><Timestamp>1352753593975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:53:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352753761403-51</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332 Romney 206 HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA LOSERRRRRRS</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1352669134420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:25:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>go jump out of a building, idiot. better yet, next time you do drugs, overdose.</Msg><Username>gotburned26</Username><Timestamp>1352753761403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:56:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352753881891-52</Id><Topic><Title>Crammer says don't buy Intc yet</Title><Username>suckerborneverysecond</Username><Timestamp>1352723131657</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 07:25:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL</Msg><Username>gotburned26</Username><Timestamp>1352753881891</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:58:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352754019384-53</Id><Title>Don't start buying until 19.50, it should be your first buy because INTC might not hold the 19.50</Title><Msg>Don't start buying until 19.50, it should be your first buy because INTC might not hold the 19.50</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352754019384</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:00:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352754163777-54</Id><Title>Another down day with another new low...</Title><Msg>Still waiting for the upswing... when the shorts have to start covering, then we'll not only be in the money, but in the big money... sadly I don't think it will happen till after the 1st of the year... just hope it stables between now and then and quits dropping...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1352754163777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:02:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352754293132-55</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332 Romney 206 HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA LOSERRRRRRS</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1352669134420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:25:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>never fear, before the end of the Obamination's final term, the DOW will hit 6000.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352754293132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352756009587-56</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332 Romney 206 HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA LOSERRRRRRS</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1352669134420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:25:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No need to be constrained by facts or reality.

In fact, INTC is better positioned than it has been in some time because it has realized the need to optimize for both power and performance rather than just power. INTC will have a great multi-year run from here. Everyone is being herded into exactly the wrong LT investments right now. I'll bet anyone INTC has a dramatically higher market cap than TSMC in 10 years, despite being only 15% higher now (all the while having a higher yield, 2.5X as much EBITDA and roughly 10X the FCF -- not quite sure why GS put TSMC on its Conviction Buy list...).

GILBERT, Ariz. Police say a woman who was upset over the outcome of the presidential election ran over her husband because he didn't participate in his civic duty. Holly Solomon, 28, chased her 36-year-old husband Daniel Solomon with the family Jeep SUV on Saturday night over a political argument stemming from the fact he didn't vote, CBS station KPHO in Phoenix, Ariz. reported. She pinned him between the underside of the SUV and the curb when he tried to run for help. The husband told investigators that Solomon believed her family was going to face hardship from President Barack Obama's re-election. Witnesses told police that Solomon followed her husband in her car through a parking lot while screaming at him. He hid behind a light pole to protect himself while Solomon circled several times. She struck him as he tried to make a break for the main road. There were no signs Solomon was impaired either by alcohol or drugs, KPHO said. She was booked on an aggravated assault and domestic violence. Her husband remains in critical condition at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center, news outlet Arizona Republic reported.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1352774807433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:46:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352776813788-67</Id><Topic><Title>4 MORE YEARS OF MISERY AHEAD.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1352272744072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 02:19:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama had 4 years for his so called change.

Boo ya!</Title><Msg>Acer unveils $199 Intel-powered Chromebook, goes on sale tomorrow By Shawn Knight On November 12, 2012, 5:30 PM EST Comments 6 Last month Google announced a new sleek Samsung-branded Chromebook intended for everyday computing tasks. The $249 price tag seemed attractive enough in this post-netbook era but now Acer has launched a Chromebook of their own priced at just $199. The C7 Chromebook is powered by a 1.1GHz Intel Celeron 847 processor, unlike the ARM chip found in Samsung’s offering. As Geek points out, it’s a decently fast chip that’s in line with older processors like the Core Due T2700 and the Core2 Duo T7250. It’s not a powerhouse chip by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s faster than an Intel Atom and should be able to handle common computing tasks without incident. Acer also elected to bump up the storage capacity on their Chromebook significantly by including a 320GB hard drive. It’s a lot of space for what is essentially a notebook that will be used to surf the web and check email. For comparison, the Samsung variant ships with just 16GB of flash storage. As with most any tradeoff, there are pros and cons to weigh here. While the Acer delivers a ton more storage space, it comes at a cost: speed. The physical hard drive in this system will be much slower than the zippy flash storage found in the Samsung system. Other specifications include an 11.6-inch, 1,366 x 768 resolution display and a battery that leaves a lot to be desired. Acer says the unit is good for up to 3.5 hours of life – that’s a full three hours less than Samsung’s Chromebook. Interested parties can pick up an Acer Chromebook starting tomorrow at select retailers and through Google Play. acer, intel, samsung, celeron, chromebook Next Article: Microsof</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1352779330214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:02:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352780257354-71</Id><Title>wallisweaver, the chump pumped and bolted</Title><Msg>Who bought at 29 based on Wally's pumping?
