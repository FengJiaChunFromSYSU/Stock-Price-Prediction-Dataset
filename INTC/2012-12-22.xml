On another mobile front, the x86 giant will show Haswell Ultrabooks at the Consumer Electronics Show and discuss a sub-10W variant. Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3." Intel compared a Windows 8 tablet using Clover Trail with a Microsoft Surface tablet running Windows RT on Tegra 3. The systems were hooked up to meters measuring consumption on the processors’ power rails on a variety of jobs. The Nvidia chip uses four main and one helper core. Brookwood said Windows RT does not use the helper core as extensively as Android. Intel did not show Clover Trail’s performance running Android. In the second half of 2013, Intel will roll out Bay Trail which is expected to use the first out-of-order Atom cores to bolster performance. It will also roll out Haswell, a new 22-nm PC processor geared for a variety of systems including ultrabooks. Intel “hasn’t given up on Ultrabooks by any means,” despite sluggish market uptake to date, said Brookwood. “They are convinced ultrabooks represent a journey,” Brookwood said. “They haven’t been able to quite deliver all the features and form factors they wanted to yet, but they think Haswell will give them the muscle they need” and better than all-day battery life, he added. Intel is expected to show at CES a reference design using a Haswell chip that consumes less than 10W and fits into an Ultrabook as thin as an Apple iPad. Separately, Intel demoed its Medfield chip running in Android smartphones, outperforming Qualcomm and Nvidia chips in some cases while having similar battery life. “The problem Intel faces is they have no hope of the U.S. market due to their lack of LTE support--that forces them to focus just on Asia and Europe,” he said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356187944941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 09:52:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356187954999-12</Id><Title>INtel dumping Xeon Phi: Standard MO for INtel</Title><Msg>" pricing model, it is clear as day that Intel won't even cover the manufacturing cost" " giving the parts completely for free, which is what they did with an unnamed Wall Street financial institution.

If Apple goes with TSMC, that would be an earthshaking positive and if Apple went with Intel, that would be terrible. Morris Chang may be following the Apple dictated responses but he also might be telling the truth and simply stating the facts. Is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) building a multi-billion dollar, top-secret chip plant with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) in the United States? That is the rumor spreading through many technology publications, and given Apple’s intensifying courtroom battle with Samsung (SSNLF.PK), it would be logical for the company to want to reduce its dependence on the Korean electronics manufacturer that builds all of Apple’s custom A-series processors. But although TSMC Chief Executive Morris Chang told the Taipei Times that the company would be building a new manufacturing plant, a project code-named Azalea, he denied that Apple was involved. “The US is one of the places under consideration,” Chang said. “But this has nothing to do with Apple.” "While the plant would be right in line with comments Apple CEO Tim Cook made earlier in December about moving some manufacturing to the United States, Chang said that the increased production capabilities would be used to fulfill orders from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Currently, TSMC can only make 68,000 12-inch wafers per month, and both semiconductor manufacturers have complained about the supply restraints. Furthermore, as the publication Cult of Mac noted, 68,000 chips are less than “one-two-hundredth of the number of processors Apple would need TSMC to make.” However, this is not to say that Apple isn’t considering building a plant on domestic shores. After all, Cook did say in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that Apple would be bringing some production to the U.S. next year. “This doesn’t mean that Apple will do it ourselves, but we’ll be working with people and we’ll be investing our money,” he said.

[TSMC is far too lame to be able to meet Apple's demand. There is absolutely no way TSMC will have large volume 20nm production in 2014. That's a dog that won't hunt. And if Apple is so misguided as to try it, I welcome the effort. Intel can take out Apple and TSMC at the same time for being so ignorant as to rely on ARM's fading fabrication.

We are on our second generation no one has figured that out, they aren't going to figure that out." This is a very important comment for Mr. Otellini to make. He is saying that the foundries such as TSMC (TSM) will never make the transition to Trigate. Never. Perhaps this is strictly due to finances. Why would TSMC invest $10-15 billion in technology development and CapEx only to remain 1-2 nodes behind Intel at the end of the day? I have written an article on just this subject. TSMC could just give up on the technology race. Texas Instruments (TXN) did just that, they gave up at the 65nm node and will never again be a factor in any technology below 65nm. This is the company that is the co-inventor of the integrated circuit; they simply gave up to Intel, and now have left the mobile base band and application processor business. Any leading edge competitor of Intel (there are only two, Samsung and TSMC) would have to consider the immense un-utilized capacity for 14nm Trigate that Intel is expected to have by mid-2013. That capacity will not remain unfilled. That fact has to keep management at TSMC and Samsung awake at night. Intel could change direction without notice and make billions of dollars' worth of production capacity available to any customer with a check. That would be a devastating blow to TSMC or Samsung. As a short-timer, Mr. Otellini's credibility could be considered higher than if he were not retiring soon. His comments in the transcribed part of the conference clearly indicate that he feels Intel has already won the end game in the semiconductor business. I agree with him.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356204387646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:26:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356204573991-22</Id><Topic><Title>Otellini Believes Intel Has Already Won</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356204387646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:26:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a nutshell why Intel is good for 30.

Here's my take: I believe there are currently 3 prevailing views regarding the relationship of PCs and tablets: View 1: The tablet is replacing the PC. This view sees the tablet as the end-all be-all form factor and that we are witnessing a 'post-PC era' where all PC transitions to tablets. This is the view point most news media like to run with. But, I think most people with half a brain would realize this view is simply bogus. View 2: The PC and tablet are separate devices. You use tablets to 'consume' information while you use the PC to to 'generate' information. To put it another way, you use tablets to surf the web, listen to music, look at pictures and watching movies. You use the PC to do real work like writing reports, generating excel sheets, writing articles or writing computer programs etc. View 3: The PC and tablet can be one device. This is the view that Microsoft is betting on with Windows 8. This view sees the keyboard and mouse as vital parts of the user interface. It sees the consumer wanting ONE device to do both consuming and generating (best of both worlds). It sees stand-alone tablets still existing in the future but will not be as popular as most people will opt for a device that can act both as a PC and a tablet. I believe View 3 will win. Only just a couple of months after the release of Windows 8, we are already seeing early evidence of this. 1) On the consumer side (not including corporations), the Lenovo Yoga and other hybrid devices (convertibles and detachables) are out-selling the traditional non-touch PCs 2) The weak sales of Windows RT devices indicate that consumers prefer the backward compatibility of Windows 8 ie. they want a device that can be both a PC and a tablet.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356211575806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 16:26:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356211711273-33</Id><Topic><Title>Check it out</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356204985998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:36:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've been trying to post it up --------------- Have you tried posting it down, Buttplug?

When asked if Intel Ireland was still planning to introduce a 14-nm FinFET manufacturing process – or tri-gate as Intel calls it – at Leixlip in 2013, Eamonn Sinnott, vice president and general manager of Intel Ireland, said there is no delay and no change to the process introduction schedule in Ireland. However, Sinnott declined to give any indication of what schedule, if any, is in place. The Irish Times recently reported that Intel was sending up to 600 Irish staff home early from production training in the U.S. after deciding to delay the introduction of the P1272 14-nm process at Fab 24 in Leixlip. The newspaper reported that the ramp of 14-nm production in Ireland had been pushed out six months to late 2013, attributing the delay to a slowdown in demand rather than technical problems. Intel is also planning to ramp P1272 at Fab D1X in Oregon and at Fab 42 in Arizona. "The sending home is not related to plans to introduce 14-nm," Sinnott said during a press tour of the Leixlip campus. He added: "Paul Otellini [CEO of Intel] has identified Intel Ireland on the roadmap for the introduction for 14-nm." At present Fab 24 is manufacturing a variety of logic chip sets on 65-nm CMOS process technology, a mature technology for Intel that could be phased out relatively soon. Intel's Fab 24 is running the same process as Intel's Fab 68 in Dalian, China. The introduction of a leading-edge process, such as the P1272 14-nm FinFET process, is clearly fundamental to maintaining Leixlip as an Intel chip manufacturing site. A large sign was noticeable in communal area of Fab 24 that said: "Our chance to shine – 14-nm."</Msg><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356215098256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 17:24:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356216280783-37</Id><Title>Why is it this POS never goes up</Title><Msg>They work their employees 24/7 but still no PPS increase.

Motorola/Google's Xphone will differenciate itself from the rest of the smartphones out there with Intel's newest chip inside. Going forward, it only gets better as Intel is expected to release its quad-core Medfield manufactured on Intel's 22nm. Then in 2014, there is the possibility that an Intel core processor (Broadwell) will make it's way into a phone! Imagine that! As another poster has stated, if Apple is smart, they will also align with Intel and develop a 'pro' line for their iPhone and iPad with Intel inside. They should also come out with a 'MacPad' that runs a hybrid MacOS-IOS to combat against the hybrid PCs that will be cannabalizing the iPad. This 'MacPad' should continue to keep Apple's tradition of multi-platform support ie. they should create a Bootcamp version to support Windows 8 with it's touch capabilities. Mac users depend of this capability. If Apple is stupid and decide, for example, to come out with a ARM-based Macbook air, then definitely they will draw the battle lines and you will see Intel aligning MUCH more closely with Google. Rumor is that Google is in the process of merging their Chrome OS with Android (google it) and if that is true, then they might be able to get traction into the PC market by creating their own Bootcamp to run windows for their Chromebooks.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356219447634</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 18:37:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356220876328-48</Id><Title>Intel, TSMC &amp; Apple</Title><Msg>TSMC has confirmed that they are 'considering' building a new manufacturing plant in the US. Most news article are speculating that this new plant is a dedicated fab site for Apple. However, TSMC has flat out denied these reports. To me, who and how Apple plans to manufacture their chips is still up in the air. It all depends on Apple's future products. I see 3 scenarios: 1) Apple goes all ARM. They decide they will design all their chips for iphone, ipad and macbooks. In this scenario, Apple definitely going with TSMC or GF. 2) Apple decides to go all Intel for all their future products - iphones, ipad and macs. In this scenario, fabbing definitely goes to Intel. 3) Apple decides to create 'pro' line for their iPhones and iPads with Intel inside. The pro lines products will be high end such as a 5" iPhone and an iPad with much higher performance than its ARM-base counterpart. In this scenario, arm-based fabbing might be done by TSMC or Intel. I think there is the possibility that Intel might agree to fab ARM chips in this scenario knowing that Apple will differenciate the ARM-based iphones and ipads from Intel's pro lines...so there is technically no competition. I think scenario 3 is most likely.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356220876328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 19:01:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356222041853-49</Id><Topic><Title>Intel, TSMC &amp; Apple</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1356220876328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 19:01:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you look at recent reports, Apple is facing competitive threats from the market below their price points in parts of Europe, South America and Asia, not at the top end where something like a Pro would go.

On another mobile front, the x86 giant will show Haswell Ultrabooks at the Consumer Electronics Show and discuss a sub-10W variant. Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3." Intel compared a Windows 8 tablet using Clover Trail with a Microsoft Surface tablet running Windows RT on Tegra 3. The systems were hooked up to meters measuring consumption on the processors’ power rails on a variety of jobs. The Nvidia chip uses four main and one helper core. Brookwood said Windows RT does not use the helper core as extensively as Android. Intel did not show Clover Trail’s performance running Android. In the second half of 2013, Intel will roll out Bay Trail which is expected to use the first out-of-order Atom cores to bolster performance. It will also roll out Haswell, a new 22-nm PC processor geared for a variety of systems including ultrabooks. Intel “hasn’t given up on Ultrabooks by any means,” despite sluggish market uptake to date, said Brookwood. “They are convinced ultrabooks represent a journey,” Brookwood said. “They haven’t been able to quite deliver all the features and form factors they wanted to yet, but they think Haswell will give them the muscle they need” and better than all-day battery life, he added. Intel is expected to show at CES a reference design using a Haswell chip that consumes less than 10W and fits into an Ultrabook as thin as an Apple iPad. Separately, Intel demoed its Medfield chip running in Android smartphones, outperforming Qualcomm and Nvidia chips in some cases while having similar battery life. “The problem Intel faces is they have no hope of the U.S. market due to their lack of LTE support--that forces them to focus just on Asia and Europe,” he said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356222816278</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 19:33:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356223442659-52</Id><Topic><Title>Reader BEWARE of Wallisweaver, he'll try to con you into thinking Intel can do no wrong</Title><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356213983553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 17:06:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got nothing?

Without the specs, it is hard to determine the manufacturing cost. The E5-26xx series is an LGA2011 2, 4, 6 or 8 core 32nm CPU. The tray pricing range is between $198 and $2057. The E5-24xx series is an LGA1356 4, 6 or 8 core 32nm CPU. The tray pricing range is between $188 and $1440. Xeon E5-2567W v2, is a 22nm Ivy Bridge EP. The specs and pricing is not set yet. Intel prices the new parts on top of the old ones. Theo Valich doesn't know the die size of either parts. Theo Valich doesn't even know what the packaging of either is.

There’s some variation on which node comes next; both GlobalFoundries and Intel are talking up 14nm; TSMC is implying a quick jump to 16nm. Will it work? Unknown. TSMC and GlobalFoundries both have excellent engineers, but FinFET is a difficult technology to deploy. Ramping it up more quickly than expected while simultaneously bringing up a new process may be more difficult than either company anticipates. Given the advantages Intel claims for the technology, it might’ve made more sense to ramp FinFET on an established node. One of the most significant demonstrations of what Intel thinks it’s getting out of 22nm FinFET is the company’s decision to revise Atom for an out-of-order architecture. 22nm Atom should close the gap with existing ARM CPUs and give Intel a substantial advantage. Overall, the situation looks like Intel holds the cards until GF and TSMC manage to revise their roadmaps for the sub-20nm market.

You call that volume production? Don't make me laugh. As far as "just scale it down", your ignorance of fabrication never fails to amuse. The problem with non-FinFET 20nm is that it just doesn't get the job done. It costs too much for too little improvement. The economics are bad, bad, bad. And this totally ignores the issue of whether the ARM foundries can produce it and when. It's taken TSMC forever to slowly ramp 28nm. 20nm is going to be harder and more complex.] "Why would they skip that and go straight to 16/14 nm FinFET?

[See note above on why they want to move directly to 14/16nm. Your estimate of when 20nm will come online is based on absolutely nothing. No one knows because it's so far out.
