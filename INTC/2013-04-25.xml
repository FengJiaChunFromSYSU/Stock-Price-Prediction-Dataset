Trilogy Systems Fate Bankrupt Founded 1980 Headquarters Cupertino, CA, USA Key people Gene Amdahl, Carl Amdahl, Clifford Madden Subsidiaries Elxsi Trilogy Systems Corporation was a computer systems company started in 1980. Originally called ACSYS, the company was founded by Gene Amdahl, his son Carl Amdahl and Clifford Madden. Flush with the success of his previous company, Amdahl Corporation, Gene Amdahl was able to raise $230 million for his new venture. Trilogy was the most well funded start-up company up till that point in Silicon Valley history. It had corporate support from Groupe Bull, Digital Equipment Corporation, Unisys, Sperry Rand and others. The plan was to use extremely advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques to build an IBM compatible mainframe computer that was both cheaper and more powerful than existing systems from IBM and Amdahl Corporation. An early Wafer-scale integration attempt by Trilogy Systems. These techniques included wafer scale integration (WSI), with the goal of producing a computer chip that was 2.5 inch on one side. At the time, computer chips of only 0.25 inch on a side could be reliably manufactured. This giant chip was to be connected to the rest of the system using a package with 1200 pins, an enormous number at the time. Previously, mainframe computers were built from hundreds of computer chips due to the size of standard computer chips. These computer systems were hampered through chip-to-chip communication which both slowed down performance as well consumed much power.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366863113993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 00:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366863685617-2</Id><Topic><Title>Tri-gate integration with embedded floating body memory cell using a high-K dual metal gate</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366860462017</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 23:27:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trilogy bought as far as I recall Lam dry etcher Autoetch 480 (designed (for the eighties) serial number 001 and 003, (approx $150k to 170k per tool) there was also a company wafer scale integration (WSI) that bought two etchers for 4 inch wafers.

The punch line is the last one and the key word is "MAY". You seem to be the one predicting doom for Intel. On a quite regular basis too. The article is forecasting "change" in server designs and with change there will be some winners and some losers.

And Intel gets that performance from a standard PowerVR SGX545. ============ I originally wanted to evaluate the technology in the W510, and discuss Intel's challenge to ARM. Can x86 CPUs compete in the tablet space? The answer is a resounding yes. Today's Atom offers performance that's competitive with the fastest platforms powering Android- and iOS-based devices, yielding comparable battery life. The SoC itself appears even faster and more responsive thanks to a custom set of drivers. As the next generation of ARM CPUs emerges, so too will we see the next iteration of Atoms. Intel currently employs 32 nm high-K lithography to manufacture Atom. But it has the ability to improve performance and efficiency even more as it transitions to 22 nm FinFET. If the company can introduce similar gains as what we saw shifting from the desktop Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge architectures, with more speed and lower power, it's going to change the low-power CPU marketplace. Intel just needs to find the right team to build the best hardware. Now, is it really any surprise that the company shut down its desktop motherboard division and tasked those engineers with creating boards for new devices? =============</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366901590810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 10:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366902134119-34</Id><Topic><Title>some TA on ARMH at 46 ? keeps moving on up..wow !!</Title><Username>repklikint</Username><Timestamp>1366900225345</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 10:30:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ask Waldo, he's the local expert on technical analysis for ARMH, LOL</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1366902134119</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 11:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366902161976-35</Id><Title>We won't see any major selling</Title><Msg>until after ex-dividend.

It feels like they are keeping a lower profile. One way Romit got out of his overly pessimistic rating without admitting an upgrade is back in 2011 when he REITERATED, said all his bad stuff and then quietly raised the target price. I suspect that will be how Covello will extract himself from his overly low target price. About the time you saw this action, there was a 10,000 MAY 18th $22 strike PUT trade. Someone bought MAY $22 puts and when they buy the puts, the OMM will short some shares to hedge any of the puts he will have to hold. It will not be a 1 for 1 short but he will likely do some. IMO, what you saw as the OMM hedging (shorting) shares to balance that 10,000 put trade.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366903177813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 11:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366903669685-39</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366816509289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:15:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ahhh, Wallisweaver sour grapes.

At this year’s Mobile World Congress, Intel touted its Atom Z2420 as being an ideal processor for smartphones in emerging markets and, in partnership with telecom operator Etisalat Misr, has brought this SoC to the Egyptian market with the launch of the E-20 Smartphone. The E-20 is powered by an Atom Z2420 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz, an Intel XMM 6265 modem that supports global roaming and HSPA+, a 3.5” touchscreen display, expandable memory, and a 5 MP camera that is capable of 1080p video recording. "Our new E-20 smartphone is yet another breakthrough for Etisalat Misr as a market leader in offering the latest technology to its customers," stated Saeed Al Hamli, Etisalat Misr CEO. He added, "We always strive to partner with the best, and this is why we chose Intel to provide this superior processor for our phone. We are optimistic about this partnership, and believe it will be fruitful for both of us." "We are delighted to partner with Etisalat Misr to bring [the] first smartphone with Intel Inside® to Egyptian consumers," said Mike Bell, vice president and general manager of Intel's Mobile and Communications Group. "The new handset will extend the rich capabilities and benefits of Intel technology to more smartphone users around the world and we believe that Egyptian consumers will welcome the overall value and functionality of the device." from Tom's Hardware</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366911592243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:39:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366911829386-65</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Launches the Atom Z2420 E-20 Smartphone in Egypt</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366911592243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:39:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brotherhood approved ??</Msg><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366911829386</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366912003687-66</Id><Topic><Title>Strategy Analytics: Microsoft's share of tablet market quadrupled after Windows 8 (to 7.5%)</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1366908508341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 12:48:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suspect the majority were Win8.

The intrinsic value of the CALL is 57 cents (market bid price - strike) The intrinsic value of the PUT is 42 cents (strike - market ask price) If I bought 1 of each, my cost would be 73 + 84 = $1.57 or a 57 cent premium over intrinsic value A couple of extreme examples .. 1. How does Intel shares trade if I submit an order to BUY 1,000,000 May $23 CALL contracts at 72 cents?? When Intel drops below the $23.58 price, the price on the CALL drops, the option market maker will BUY SHARES and sell me the MAY $23 option contracts. The OMM locks in his premium. The OMM has the Intel shares to supply to me (he bought them) and I have my option. The result is that when Intel drops, the OMM buys shares and satisfies my CALL order. THE EFFECT is when Intel price drops, the OMM is a buyer of shares. He provides a floor. 2. How does Intel shares trade if I submit an order to BUY 1,000,000 May $24 PUT contracts at 83 cents?? Think "just the opposite of the CALL". When Intel rise above the $23.58 price, the price on the PUT drops, the option market maker will SHORT SHARES and sell me the MAY $24 PUT option contracts. The OMM locks in his premium. The OMM has hedged the prospect of getting the Intel shares from me when the put is assigned and I have my option. The result is that when Intel share price rises, the OMM shorts shares and satisfies my PUT order. THE EFFECT is when Intel price rises, the OMM is a seller/shorter of shares. He provides a ceiling.

That is where the option leverage and therefore the premium is highest for both the PUT and CALL options. Normal selling or buying can chew through the bonds of that attraction. The blizzard of option buys/sells at different strike prices and months makes it fun for the OMM to get it right. If an ETF or buy comes in and drives up the price, the orders that controlled the price may lose their effect. IMO, the May 3rd weekly options opened up today and they are going to see some healthy volumes. They were not open yesterday. May 3rd is ex-dividend day so options can be owned on both sides of the dividend award and creates a headache for the OMM.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366916178232</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 14:56:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366916392054-81</Id><Topic><Title>Intel hits it out of the park on user experience</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366901590810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 10:53:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's more than seeing no reason why there couldn't wind up being a global army of Intel designs, you can bet on it.

Intel's credit ratings are mainly A1 or A2, per Moody's. However, if margins continue to compress and cash decline accelerates, we will consider a Medium-High rating. Intel's cash &amp; equivalents and investments totaled $17.3 at 1Q13. Intel's cash &amp; equivalents and investments totaled $18.8 billion at year-end 2012, reflecting $6.2 billion in debt issued in 4Q12 as well as strong cash flows. Year-end 2012 cash was up substantially from $10.5 billion at the end of 3Q12, which was down from $13.65 billion at the end of 2Q12; the cash decline primarily reflected the $3 billion equity investment in ASML. Cash &amp; equivalents were $14.8 billion at the end of 2011. Prior to the acquisitions of McAfee ($7.7 billion) and Infineon WLS ($1.4 billion), cash was $21.9 billion as of the end of 2010. Cash was $13.49 billion at the end of 2009, $1.8 billion at the end of 2008, and $10.0 billion at the end of 2007. Total debt was $13.2 billion at 1Q13. Total debt at the end of 2012 was $13.45 billion, as a result of $6.2 billion in debt issued in 4Q12. Total debt at the end of 3Q12 was $7.10 billion. Total debt at the end of 2011 was $7.3 billion, up from $2.16 billion at midyear 2011. On 9/15/11, Intel issued $5 billion in debt. Debt was $2.31 billion at the end of 2010, flat with midyear 2010 and up from $2.21 billion at year-end 2009. Cash flow from operations was $4 billion in 1Q13. Cash flow from operations was $18 billion in 2012. Cash flow from operations was $20.9 billion in 2011; $16.7 billion in 2010; and $11 billion in 2009. Intel repurchased $500 million of its shares in 1Q13. Share repurchases totaled $5.5 billion in 2012. Intel repurchased over $10 billion of its stock in 2011. In each quarter, Intel pays about $1 billion in dividends. Intel raised its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.21 per common share in May 2011, and to $0.225 per quarter in May 2012. The current rate implies an annualized payout of $0.90. Given strains on the balance sheet, we are not modeling dividend growth in 2014.

As a quick reminder, alongside that fourth-generation Intel Core processor there's a 13-inch 1080p display that detaches from the keyboard, and now we've been given a few important updates on the reference device, battery performance on Haswell and how Intel's reference design will transfer between tablet and Ultrabook mode.

Today, INTC drops after clearly having been more overbght than ARMH, and your brilliant post is well it was up 5 days in a row, absolute nonsense to be negative on ARMH because of a one day price drop, and be, as always and forever, bullish on INTC when it does the same. over and over and over again, you have exhibited a pattern of failing to capture gains and failing to gain any meaningful knowledge of technicals , a far more worthwhile and profitable study than the chip geek speak that you revel in. In almost 3 years you have managed to promote INTC at 24 in 2010 right before the drop to the 17's and, so far, managed a whopping gain that consists entirely of the dividends less .65, and a loss on a put of ARMH bght right under 44.00, as predicted, you'd fail to reap the gain way down there at 40, visions of sugar plums dancing through your head that ARMH would collapse. wrong way waldo.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1366935085809</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 20:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366936163977-131</Id><Title>Cheap May 25 call options gave it away</Title><Msg>They were selling for a nickel and that is a giveaway that the stock won't move up but will indeed move down.

You've been down on the stock since it was at 17.67. Who cares about history? You can't change it. It's only the future that matters. And no one knows less about what will happen than you. I have your posts to prove it. How many times did you say that Intel would never hit 24? It had to be hundreds and hundreds. And then the stock went to 29+ and you spent months in the fetal position.
