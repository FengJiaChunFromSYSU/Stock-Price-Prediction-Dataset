This paragraph is an extract from their review today on Acer Iconia W510 which is a must-read for all Intel longs: =============== Contrary to popular belief, driver problems aren’t what kept the first Atom Windows 8 tablets out of the market at launch. A bug (not related to power management) caught several months ago caused schedules to slip by about a month and a half. Depending on whose design the OEM followed (Intel’s or their own), the implementation of the fix could come quickly or would take a bit longer. In this case, Acer and Samsung found themselves on the right side of the fence. We’ve had Atom based Windows 8 tablets from both companies for weeks now. ====================</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1356095578344</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 08:12:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356097831533-23</Id><Topic><Title>Arm and cadence tape out 14nm fin-fet cortex a7</Title><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1356049656210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:27:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Taping out a low transistor count test chip. What does Samsung have ready for high volume manufacturing? ---- It's not a low transistor count test chip:) Although smaller that the A15, it's still a full blown CPU, and part of the latest generation that is going into phones today. The previous tape outs at 14nm have been the M series, which start as low as 12K transistors. As for high volume manufacturing, who knows?:) Samsung have just announced an $4 billion expansion for it's Austin fab - but that was reported for 28nm, not 14.

At best. Underestimating someone who reached the level that John Boehner has reached is risky. Your assumption that you understand the strategy being employed is rather presumptuous. There are few who know what the strategy. The current GOP/Republican Party is a coalition of a conservative Tea Party and more moderate traditional Republicans. They are trying to preserve a unified front. The money that normally flows all political parties is being diverted into the 501c PAC organizations who are assuming the real power of both parties. Donations to the 501c are tax deductable and the donations reduce the taxes of the donor. Very attractive. Donate to the PAC that reflects your view and get a tax deduction too. The Tea Party and its members are a symptom and a result long work by the social conservatives to embed their social ajenda into the platform. I would, however, prefer to discuss INTC on the INTC forum. A.

The Nov 29th numbers rolled off the RSI 14-day window. That was when INTC was moving up from the $19.30 to $20.00 area. When you averaged in yesterdays narrow range, the RSI drop was not a surprise. I was getting my RSI number from stockcharts and it reads 60 this AM. I just looked at my Schwab display and on the minute chart it says 41, on the 1yr daily chart is says 58. The Yahoo RSI from the technical analysis chart is in the 80s like yours. 80 seems high for a $1 move in a $20 stock. That is a 5% move on a low beta stock. The only point I was trying to make and no surprise to you is that: when the INTC representative charged with buying $6b of stock starts buying, he is a professional and is aware of these technical signals. If I were doing the buying, I would try to trip these technical triggers to get the chart watchers to sell/short shares that I could buy. A professional with a $6b charge card will distort the technical indicators. A simple point but if chart followers contiune to be successful following their strategies, then that is great. WIth $6b or money flow into INTC, the tilt on the indicators will be to appear overbought. thanks for the RSI's. Now I just have to figure out which RSI is correct and why all the differences.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356104613739</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 10:43:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356104925173-39</Id><Topic><Title>New report for Intel.</Title><Username>van.sitton</Username><Timestamp>1355765081849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 12:24:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>new update!</Msg><Username>kaylacampbell842</Username><Timestamp>1356104925173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 10:48:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356104976954-40</Id><Title>Looks like Apple going with TSMC dedicated fab</Title><Msg>slashgearDOTcom/tsmc-hunting-us-fab-site-makes-weak-its-not-for-apple-denial-21261914/ Project "Azalea" rumors swirling and TSMC recently breaking ground on new 20nm/16nm finFET ...all point to Apple going with TSMC</Msg><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1356104976954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 10:49:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356104989580-41</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Plan B (Bozo) Let us go past the jan 1 and then completely surrender.</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1356101495008</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 09:51:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe $500K.

Going lower will not succeed with them. As long as John Boehner works toward a Republican causus solution, there will be a stalemate and no solution. The Tea Party freshmen will not agree to any tax increases and the seem to feel fine with no agreement. No agreement and no debt limit increase will lead to a balanced budget in their opinion. They are single minded. On Jan 3rd when the House votes for a new Speaker, who will win the votes? Who will the Tea Party member vote for? Boehner or a different, more conservative candidate? If the Republicans split, who will the Democrats vote for? What if they vote for John Boehner in exchange for a vote on a compromise bill? One low probability scenario is the split of the Republican (ultra-conservative and conservative) caucus on this issue and a moderate deal that will churn the GOP. I am interested in the impact that sequestration will have on Eric Cantor's district. His northern VA district is funded by big government contracts. I suspect Eric will be moving a little left during this process.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356106978197</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 11:22:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356107032198-54</Id><Title>Head of NRA making powerful speach, shoved right up Liberal's #$%$</Title><Msg>We protect or money (banks) with armed guards, we protect sports stadiums with security, we protect Obama with armed security............yet we can't protect our kids.

The analysts may be wrong and AMD with their forecasts may be wrong and AMD might show a profit during one of these periods. But they have a product mix problem that will be tough to overcome. AMD does not have the resources to compete with both ARM and x86. They are battling either QCOM in the ARM camp or INTC in the x86. Not a pleasing battle. AMD has a very consistent record of failing on both the software and silicon sides. If you think you want to put money in AMD, go ahead. AMD is not RIMM.

Hsieh noted that even if Intel's ball grid array (BGA) packaging plans enter the desktop industry, the industry will continue to live on as motherboard makers will figure out how to handle and respond to the change.

On another mobile front, the x86 giant will show Haswell Ultrabooks at the Consumer Electronics Show and discuss a sub-10W variant. Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356124491489</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:14:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356124784610-114</Id><Title>THE "LOSS" OF "TONS" OF DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS AND STOCK VALUES ",MUST BE A LESSON !!</Title><Msg>America"s investors , regardless of their politics, must be made aware that elections have "consequences", we lose or gain depending upon the political views of our leaders, our president and our congress! in 2008 and again in 2012 , america elected the "most extreme leftist, the most anti- american, a "hater" of our constitution and our heritage, including our "christian faith" that has guided our destinity since our founding!!! america allowed all of our values, our ability to continue to have a "democratic republic",form of government.to be placed in extreme danger! americans for some ungodly reason decided to "dump" our tremendous history of our past, from the very beginning to the recent past. america decided to allow a "dicatator type , an unknown,with a very soiled past, from a foreign nation, with anything but a successful record of bel ieving in god, a christian god, the majority choice of americans! barack hussein obama, was not, is not, and will never be a postive force for the america,we have enjoyed, prospered under, and the america ,that became "the light of the world"," the city on a hill",a gift from god!! obama is not sitting in our white house as our "protector", "no", obama ,continues to dislike america!!!his beliefs since his "kenya days" still influence and control his anti- american policies and agenda! since ,2008,america has been in decline due to the influence of obama and then in 2009 ,until the present america failures have grown worse both in number and severity!!! this "destruction of america" will continue unless the majority of americans realize our "ungodly errors" in 2008 &amp; in 2012, and impeach this "evilness",known as barack hussein obama, "the american destroyer"!!! god bless america!! america is in grave danger!! allow america, to use the "powers granted within our constitution to "free america" from a political misfit, lacking the "godly knowledge and human compassion", to serve all americans as their president!! god bless america!!, free your people from destruction, and save america!!! your gift to all!</Msg><Username>bugman29102</Username><Timestamp>1356124784610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:19:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356124924638-115</Id><Title>Intel to Launch Four New Mobile Ivy Bridge Celerons in Q1 2013</Title><Msg>Intel is preparing the release of four new mobile Celeron processors based on its Ivy Bridge architecture.

With an increasingly shrinking market share, Moto is in desperate need of a big hit. Little is known about the phone, but this report suggests that it may have hit some supply chain obstacles already. Moto was potentially looking at flexible displays for this device, along with ceramic materials that would allow the phone to be more stress-resistant, offer different shapes, and new colors. They may have to re-think that strategy a bit. Other potential focuses include making the camera top notch, taking advantage of Viewdle (a recent acquisition of Motorola’s), and getting the phone out to the world in 2013. We’ve talked about this in the past, but Google has put together a special team at Motorola whose only goal is to create something mind-blowingly good, new, and never seen before. We would assume that this team is working on the X Phone. This report also mentioned that Motorola would create an “X Tablet” after the phone is done. And yep, we’re dying to hear your thoughts.

Clover Trail's graphics processing unit (GPU) is out-classed by most of the competition, including the iPad. "Compared to what's shipping in the latest iPads however, Clover Trail is horribly under-specced...based on what I've seen thus far it looks like the GPU here is a bit slower than what you get in a [Nvidia] Tegra 3," Anandtech said. And a lot slower than the GPU in the iPad 3 and 4 and even less powerful than the iPad Mini's GPU.

"[User interface] performance can be sluggish in desktop mode," Anandtech said, referring to the Windows 8 mode that resembles the traditional Windows 7 desktop. And about that "bug" that has delayed shipment of some Intel-based Windows 8 tablets? "Contrary to popular belief, driver problems aren't what kept the first Atom Windows 8 tablets out of the market at launch. A bug (not related to power management) caught several months ago caused schedules to slip by about a month and a half." Anandtech continues: "Depending on whose design the OEM followed (Intel's or their own), the implementation of the fix could come quickly or would take a bit longer." Shipments of tablets such as Lenovo's ThinkPad Tablet 2 and Dell's Latitude 10 have been delayed until January. An Intel representative acknowledged delays with the Clover Trail chip when contacted today by CNET but did not specify a reason for them.</Msg><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356126083004</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:41:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356126102941-121</Id><Topic><Title>I think we're going to lose some more on Monday too...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1356120420469</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 15:07:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monday is a shortened trading day, regular trading hours end at 1pm extended trading likely until 4pm.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1356126102941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:41:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356126148817-122</Id><Topic><Title>Atom chips are able to best Nvidia’s Tegra 3 in regards to both performance and power consumption</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356125796752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:36:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not all good news, though.

The affordable tablet plot will start to seriously thicken at CES 2013. After we just heard a near-confirmation about the upcoming super affordable 7-inch Asus ME172V tablet (albeit not a $99 one, but more likely to be a $129 tablet), now rumors add an Intel Atom-based 7 incher in the picture. The Asus ME371MG is said to bring Intel’s Atom Z2420 processor and a 7-inch 1280 x 800-pixel IPS screen into $199 to $249 territory (make this 199 to 249 euro for the Old Continent). The leak this time comes courtesy of Picasa, where an image snapped on the tablet’s 3-megapixel camera revealed more details about it. Basically, it is so similar to the Nexus 7, we could assume it is some kind of an Intel-based version of the Nexus. Here is a rundown through the rumored Asus ME371MG specifications •Processor: Intel Atom Z2420 clocked at 1.2GHz •Screen: 7-inch 1280 x 800-pixel IPS display •Operating system: Android 4.1 Jelly Bean •Memory: 1GB of RAM •Storage: 16GB •Connectivity: 3G, GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth •Camera: 3-megapixel camera The tablet could also come with a gold and silver covers, and at that price we might finally start to see more Intel mobile devices in our households. source: Notebookitalia.it</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356137294105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 19:48:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356139197027-136</Id><Title>Wouldn't Intel have warned by now?</Title><Msg>Doubt they'd warn the week of Christmas.</Msg><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356139197027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 20:19:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356139227653-137</Id><Topic><Title>Suggest you stop corresponding iwth Lucy Nuff and his aliases</Title><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1355186377633</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:39:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>up</Msg><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356139227653</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 20:20:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356140163430-138</Id><Topic><Title>Wouldn't Intel have warned by now?</Title><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1356139197027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 20:19:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When they warned over the Thailand hard drive flooding supply chain problem, the warning came on December 12th.

Intel is supposedly prepping the introduction of a next gen processor at CES 2013: the Bay Trail-T. The Bay Trail-T is rumored as a quad-core scheduled for a 2014 launch, though CES will see the series' debut plus info on what manufactures are building slates based off the Trail-T. A SoC sibling is also expected at the Vegas show. Dubbed the Valleyview-T, the chip could take on Nvidia's Tegra 3 and Qualcomm's S4. Look for long battery lives plus 22nm prowess, superior audio, boosted memory capacity and amped up graphics when used in conjunction with the Gen7 Intel GPU. There's even talk 3D video recording could be in the cards.

Though a number of Intel-powered Android phones came out in 2012, including the Lenovo K800 and Motorola RAZR i, none has hit the U.S. market. If Intel wants to be taken seriously in the smartphone space, it needs to find a vendor that's willing to release its hardware in the America. Expect to see at least one Atom-powered Android phone for the U.S. market appear at CES. Since Samsung makes all of its own CPUs now, the phone will likely come from LG, HTC or Motorola. Our money's on Motorola, because it has already shown a commitment to Intel's platform.

What would be Motorola's differentiating factor? If they come up with something as good as the next iPhone or Galaxy feature wise, they're probably not going to sell many of them because people will choose established players over them. While Intel transitions to 22nm, the others are transitioning to 28nm. Therefore with only a half node process difference, Intel probably wont have a significant performance advantage. At this late stage in the competition, it will probably be an uphill task for Motorola/Intel to get any market traction.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1356145889243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:11:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356146236985-149</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola (google) new X phone rumoured to be using intel CPUs</Title><Username>warmninja</Username><Timestamp>1356122053371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 15:34:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is already in full production at 22nm (tri-gate) as we speak!
