Intel also says it doesn't want to make ARM cores. That was the deduction drawn from Altera's comments, or rather lack of comments, when asked last week whether Intel would be making Altera FPGAs with ARM cores in them when Altera starts using Intel's 14nm finfet process in about three years time. The silence suggests that Intel is not inclined to make ARM-based chips. It's quite understandable that Intel wants to be the standard processor in mobile. But ARM is the standard processor for mobile. Why should the mobile world switch to a different standard processor? Only if Intel produces mobile SoCs so stunningly superior in performance to ARM-based SoCs that the mobile world thinks its worth making the effort to switch. Which Intel can't. And even if Intel could, would the mobile world want to adopt a sole-sourced standard processor? A wise man once said: "You only get one chance to screw the industry." Intel's had its chance. from Mannerisms by David Manners</Msg><Username>wallyweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366689790399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 00:03:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366690470974-2</Id><Title>Just like last year, will go to 29.00</Title><Msg>But this time, beyond.

Intel has a formidable lead in the semiconductor industry with three fabs tooled with 22 nm process nodes. The company will introduce "Bay Trail" processors for the tablet market, and "Merrifield" processors for smartphones during the holiday season in 2013. These mobile processors will be the first to be manufactured using the 22 nm process. This will give Intel a big edge over other mobile processor producers, such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA) and Mediatek, which can only make processors at the 28 nm node.

Revenue was down more than 30% from the prior-year quarter, and the company swung from non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 in last year's Q1 to this year's loss. AMD expects to continue losing money and bleeding cash in the current quarter, before (hopefully) returning to profitability in the second half of the year. However, its guidance for a return to profitability depends to a large extent on the popularity of new products like Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) expected Xbox 360 successor, as well as better customer acceptance of Windows 8. To put it another way, AMD's revival depends on things almost completely outside of the company's control. This does not sound like a good investment case to me.

[You must have read a different report than I did. I saw a one cent beat on earnings, 5 cents instead of 4 cents. How anyone can get excited about 4 cents in earnings on a $40 stock is a mystery to me. It's also a mystery why investors would focus on revenues rather than earnings. The revenue beat is meaningless. ARM is at the top of its game but the point would be this is the top and it's going to be downhill for here. Haswell and Bay Trail haven't even made landfall and Intel's tablet sales are doubling each quarter. ARM's revenue beat didn't do anything for earnings which signals shrinking margins. When the news hit last night the stock went up a mere 71 cents. So, how much of the difference between the 71 cents and the four bucks it's at now is manipulation I don't know. But it seems like a lot. It was up quite a bit in pre-trading and then dropping and then getting propped back up. The thought of anyone buying ARM at $44 with 4 cents of earnings makes me laugh out loud. This is just the best ever opportunity for ARM investors to get out at the top. ARM is like a deer that's been gut-shot. Just because we saw it run off into the trees doesn't mean it's going to live. I'm sticking with my January puts. I can't imagine the ARM bubble not bursting by then... ]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366730529746</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 11:22:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366730874165-70</Id><Topic><Title>Dead Money Here</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1366727859782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 10:37:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the market is looking six months ahead.

The stock is very overbought and near term for absolutely no other reason than short covering before dividend plays (or CEO news as if that even means anything without actions), after having reached recently huge short interest. It is irrational for intel to rally here so fast without any news and after mediocre earnings to begin with. I will enter a 3rd part and massive one if we continue and never drop from here at say 23.4-23.5. Then i expect 22-22.5 levels at the very least as the low point of the inevitable sell cycle. Even if this is a breakout i still expect the low point to be the prior recent trading barrier around 22. I am prepared to be wrong but when the stock reaches over 2sd so violently without anything fundamentally happening it always drops eventually. Do not confuse my long term bullish position on Intel that i see over 100 eventually (this is why i trade options and do not sell the core stock position, instead trying to increase it even with put profits). But near term this is a ridiculous move after this level already. All of the market is currently receiving mediocre earnings and refuses to sell and create some relaxation. It will potentially turn ugly if they continue to rally this here without a correction.

Would Apple let Intel's chips get ahead and provide a better solution to Apple's competitors (i.e. other OEMs) ...just to keep its "freedom"? ----- Apples SoC's are *completely* different from others in the market place. They are CPU light (in core # and in clock, but are still competitive) and are GPU heavy. They also include other IP blocks to support various functionality (such as Siri). All this would be lost of if they went for a 'generic' Intel design (or for that matter a generic QCOM design). Apples SoC is tightly woven into it's OS and user experience. Apple *can't * go for a generic design. As for TSMC, well, they have shown node after node they can deliver some of the best LP processes around (even compared to Intel).

What can Intel offer that Apple's own SoC can't?" First, I don't think that an Intel fabbed A-something is out of the question. Second, Intel can bring Apple the most cutting edge transistors in the industry, 22nm now and soon 14nm. Or they can go hit the streets with an on again off again supply of 28nm from TSMC. Apple has some larger issues however, my old Galaxy S2 got the Jellybean update and running stock it just smokes the iPhone in every possible way. I mean I'm telling you that with yesterday's news ARM hardware Jellybean is simply outstanding! On an Intel 22nm or 14nm processor it won't matter if iPhone is on 28nm it will be too late. Apple has made a reputation for promoting the user experience above specs and now that doesn't seem to be working for them anymore. This bringing a knife to a gunfight just doesn't work anymore. Their own customers see no real reason to upgrade to ho hum hardware. When the stock drops below book value I'll consider buying it.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366740795583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:13:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366740983981-130</Id><Topic><Title>Volume has been high for the last 5 sessions</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366739432350</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:50:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good theory, which means we're going back to $28</Msg><Username>scaredinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1366740983981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:16:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366741008638-131</Id><Topic><Title>Volume has been high for the last 5 sessions</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366739432350</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:50:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By the end of the year, I mean.</Msg><Username>scaredinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1366741008638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:16:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366741545551-132</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver blows ARMN call....by a mile..</Title><Username>repklikint</Username><Timestamp>1366736842781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:07:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dana, Dana, Dana - is there ever a day that goes by that you don't need your ego propped up?

What the mkt lost from 14.8 to 14.5 in a weeks time it has recouped most of it in one day. Even the sabre rattling of the N.

Slowing economy in the emerging mkts has had no effect on this mkt at all ALL BECAUSE OF QE3. With Uncle Ben printing 4BLN dollars a day that money has to find a home and the game goes on. Don't be surprised to see DOW 18K by Q3 and that when the fed is talking about cutting back QE3 a bit.

While the markets were at record highs, unemployment had not improved, economic growth was stagnant and most corporate earnings had little to do with an increase in sales and revenue and were based on moves like laying-off thousands of people and shedding non-performing assets. Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/188479/quotes/nls/gs GS +2.45% — one of those bullish outfits projecting enthusiasm — reversed its earlier upbeat message, saying that consumer spending is slowing down, which will likely have a negative impact on future growth. The significance is that most analysts and economists are coming to grips with the fact that the economic data doesn’t support stock-market valuations at these levels.

What economists and analysts failed to connect is the contrast between reality and the stock market — the low consumer spending, paltry economic growth, weak hiring by companies and reckless quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve while the stock market soared. So, let’s look at everything Goldman Sachs (and many others) m</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1366749852452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 16:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366749940056-167</Id><Title>U Need 2 Read This Pt2</Title><Msg>So, let’s look at everything Goldman Sachs (and many others) missed, and the chain of economic events. The importance of consumption on the overall economy should not be overlooked. While in the economic cycle, it is production that comes first, as it provides the income necessary for individuals to consume, it is ultimately consumption that completes the cycle by creating the demand. Despite repeated bailouts, programs, and interventions, economic growth remains mired at sub-par rates as consumers struggle in a low growth/high unemployment economy. Businesses, which have been pressured by poor sales, higher taxes and increased government regulations, have learned to do more with less. Higher productivity has led to less employment and higher levels of profits. The dark side of that equation is that less employment means higher competition for jobs which suppresses wage growth. Lower wage growth and incomes means less consumption, which reduces the aggregate end demand. In turn, lower demand for products and services puts businesses on the defensive to “do more with less” in order to protect profit margins. Wash, rinse and repeat. This is why deflationary economic environments are so greatly feared by the Fed as that relationship between production and consumption is incredibly difficult to break. I don’t believe that the current slowdown is just a “soft patch,” but is instead the end of the expansionary cycle that began in 2009. That belief is simply based on the fact that economies do not grow indefinitely but cycle between expansions and contractions. In the current economic environment, where the consumer is caught in a balance sheet deleveraging cycle, economic contractions occur more frequently than they do under more normal economic conditions. This is not an indictment of fiscal or monetary policies, but simply a statement about the cycles of an economy. So where does that leave us now and the remainder of 2013? At some point, despite the ongoing interventions by the Federal Reserve, the stock market will revert to the underlying fundamental story which has been slowly deteriorating over time. The question that remains to be answered is simply how long can the Fed’s artificial intervention programs continue to elevate asset prices? Unfortunately, no one really knows the answer. However, we do know that during “normal” economic contractions the markets correct on average by roughly 30%. Since the current elevation in asset prices has not been due to improving fundamentals but rather artificial inflation — it is likely the next correction in the markets, and the economy, will be anything but normal.

Haswell is the codename for the successor to Ivy Bridge architecture. Intel is expected to release 22nm CPUs based on Haswell around June 2013 according to leaked roadmaps. Current rumors have it that the Haswell GT3 will be the introduction point for 2.5D stacking and interposers. Semiaccurate [link] reports that Intel codename "Crystalwell" is not L4 cache on package but rather is GPU memory on an interposer. They indicate that the GT3 variants of Haswell will have 64MB of on-package memory connected through an ultra-wide bus. Reports were that Haswell needed lower memory power consumption, higher memory bandwidth, and memory capacity that DDR3 could not provide but wide IO TSV based memory stacks could. Based on recent reports from the Semi 3D summit where ST Ericsson’s Kimmich concluded that "although 3D TSV technology appears ready for mass production, wide IO technology is not yet a fit for mainstream smartphones. LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 will be used in this application due to better thermal performance and lower cost." [see IFTLE 134 “SEMI 3D European Summit – Isthe Wide IO Driver Dead ?”] IFTLE must ask whether these Haswell "requirements" can be met with the newly described LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 solutions, which do not use TSV technology.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366754549503</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 18:02:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366756299130-179</Id><Topic><Title>Intel GT3e Expected To Capture Lead In Integrated Graphics</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1366753484465</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 17:44:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The best graphics circuit is meaningless without corresponding drivers to operate it</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1366756299130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 18:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366756609986-180</Id><Title>Intel, angry turds, green pigs, and bios rootkits</Title><Msg>intel vpro bios rootkits for smartphones, tablets, and pc's helping the angry turds rule the world!!! extreme persistent technology that is 100% impossible to remove from your electronics device even reflashing your bios wont stop the angry turds from intercepting all of your communications because it reinstalls itself and no amount of virus detection or operating system reinstallion will defeat it. there is not a single virus program on the market that will detect a bios rootkit because its entirely outside of the operating system operating in the firmware which is so non-standard that its impossible to trust the thousands of variations. the extra 8 gigs eeprom hidden on your Asian cellphone fully loaded with corporate espionage software to steal all of your personal secrets and to blackmail you and destroy your company and transfer it to green pigs control. Angry turds also known as the Indian it mofia who's members have infiltrated high tech companies throughout the united states through a myriad of indian-owned staffing companies and malicious installation of bios rootkits on American's cellphones and laptops. They are referred to as angry because many of them use intimidation and fear tactics to maintain control of engineering and software projects. Often staring down at people with extremely angry eyes referred to as snake eyes in the high tech industry. Managers are afraid to fire them because they will get fired and added to their hit list that blacklists them from high tech employment thus they have no choice but to allow them to take over and run the entire company departments. angry turds is a play on words referring to the popular angry birds game where angry red birds hurl themselves at buildings and explode using their body's as suicidal weapons. angry turds are notorious for trying to destroying companies and project in the united states as a form of economic jihad to transfer technology and knowledge towards companies based outside the united s</Msg><Username>indiabill</Username><Timestamp>1366756609986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 18:36:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366756780471-181</Id><Topic><Title>armh over 41 again pre market</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1365684261925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 08:44:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice call #$%$, armh $46, you're an even bigger joke than I thought and that's hard to achieve.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1366756780471</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 18:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366758328056-182</Id><Title>Schwab servers still down...F Schwab</Title><Msg>what a dips$^t outfit Schwab is!</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1366758328056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 19:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366760870562-183</Id><Title>Tomorrow some Analyst will bad mouth Intel and Motley fool will</Title><Msg>write a bad article about Intel.

Intel also confirmed their projections for a record breaking 2013. And remember the excess capacity charges was a one time thing.

The International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS) is being held April 14-18, 2013 at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Resort &amp; Spa in Monterey, CA. At IRPS, Intel will present new research in a paper titled “Self-heat Reliability Considerations on Intel’s 22nm Tri-Gate Technology.” This work elaborates on various measurements to observe self-heating as well as the associated reliability implications, not only in the transistors, but the overlying metal lines. “The self-heating of the finFET can locally increase the temperature in the metal wires above, enhancing electromigration effects,” Larosa said.
