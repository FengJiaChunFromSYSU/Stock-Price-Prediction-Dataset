In October, 103 metro areas showed improvement, up from 99 in September, the most since the index was created a year ago, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) index released Thursday. "The fact that most markets are maintaining their spots on the improving list from month to month is an important indication that the recovery trend is solidifying," said David Crowe, NAHB's chief economist. "At the same time, overly tight credit conditions are certainly constraining consumers' ability to purchase homes as well as builders' ability to construct them." A separate report on Thursday provided additional evidence of the housing market's steady recovery as asking prices rose again in September and prices are up year-over-year in six of the seven swing states key to the presidential election, Trulia reported. Asking prices are up 2.5 percent nationally over last year and are up in 74 of the 100 largest metro areas. At this pace, prices will be up 4 percent this year, the first yearly price gain since 2006, Jed Kolko, Trulia's chief economist said in a blog post.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349446379671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:12:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349446764663-28</Id><Topic><Title>Do investors care Dividends?</Title><Username>mbislying</Username><Timestamp>1349361535074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:38:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Otellini is not Intel CEO material who should stay as a sales team leader.

With organizations of all sizes struggling to deal with the growing volume of data vital to their business, Intel is reaching out to small and midsize businesses with the Oct. 4 release of its Atom processor-based storage platform, formerly codenamed Milstead, featuring the company’s D2550 and D2500 Atom processors. Asustor, QNAP Systems, and Thecus have integrated into their AS 6 Series, TS-x69 Series and N5550 and N4800 NAS server storage appliances. Intel said additional companies would be integrating the platform into their storage solutions in the near future. "Turbo NAS showcases the potential of the graphics capability of the Intel Atom processor,” QNAP product manager Jason Hsu said in a statement. Content can be shared anytime across a broad selection of devices, including smartphones, tablets and notebooks, and accessed anywhere to create a personal cloud. In addition, the solution also supports multiple file transfer protocols so businesses can share data and content regardless of the operating system, including Microsoft Windows and Linux, and devices featuring the solution can also serve as centralized media platforms for storing various forms of media content and other data. "Intel's next-generation Atom processor provides an ideal solution for powering intelligent storage system designs that will act as a personal cloud inside the office or home, and will deliver better ways to store and access data," David Tuhy, general manager of Intel’s storage division, said in a statement. "With a range of systems designers on board, the Intel Atom processor-based storage solution raises the bar in how data is stored, managed and shared." Intel has also integrated security solutions from McAfee into the platform to help IT departments safeguard data from corruption and virus attacks. The platform also offers centralized data backup for additional security. Remote replication can provide additional copies of data, for recovery in the event of a breach, theft or loss of a device, a hard drive failure or other disaster. Businesses with video surveillance systems can attach up to two monitors to a single platform-based storage device and view up to four camera feeds boasting HD-quality clarity. Built-in hardware acceleration allows users to connect HDMI-ready displays and watch 1080p HD video, while the platform also boasts scalable input/output (I/O) connectivity, which supports four to six SATA drives with hot-plug capability of up to 14 USB ports as storage requirements increase. The platform also offers up to 4GB of main memory to facilitate fast response times. A June report from SMB security specialist Symantec found as online file sharing becomes increasingly common as a business practice, SMBs are more at risk than ever before and SMB employees are increasingly adopting unmanaged, personal-use online file sharing solutions without permission from IT. A staggering 71 percent of small businesses that suffer from a cyber-attack never recover. The loss of confidential or proprietary information and breach of confidential information were cited as top concerns of small business owners.</Msg><Username>getmeoutuhhere</Username><Timestamp>1349449388741</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349449505394-45</Id><Title>Romney now firmly ahead in the polls</Title><Msg>Nice jump in the polls.

"Unbelievable jobs numbers," tweeted former General Electric CEO Jack Welch. "These Chicago guys [the Obama campaign] will do anything ... can't debate so change numbers." On CNBC, Tea Party favorite Rick Santelli declared that "I told you they'd get it under 8 percent — they did!" Conservative commentator Monica Crowley tweeted about an "October surprise: 43 consecutive months of above 8% unemployment, &amp; 1 month before election, the rate miraculously drops to 7.8%. Ahem." Labor Secretary Hilda Solis has had a chance to respond to such talk: "I'm insulted when I hear that, because we have a very professional civil service," she said on CNBC. "I have the highest regard for our professionals that do the calculations at the (Bureau of Labor Statistics). They are trained economists." At another point she called the charges "ludicrous." Our colleagues at Planet Money have previously reported about the lengths BLS goes to in an effort to keep its work secret and away from outside influence. This isn't the last jobs report before the Nov. 6 election. October's figures are due on Nov. 2. Watch for more fireworks then.

One percent (1%) prefers some other candidate, and three percent (3%) are undecided. See daily tracking history. These results are based upon nightly interviews and reported on a three-day rolling average basis. As a result, only about one-third of the interviews for today’s update were conducted after the presidential debate. The single night of polling conducted after the debate did show some improvement for Romney, but it remains to be seen whether that will continue or if it was merely statistical noise.

Maybe some people need to realign their own expectations - all Intel needs to do is holding the course. 32 nm is "old" technology for Intel though it's probably better than expected.The semiaccurate guy Charlie might have a point - why push 32nm SoC hard? . Some details about the 22 nm Silvermont architecture have been leaked from China and were picked up by German website Computerbase.de. Silvermont's Valleyview processors will be available at the end of 2013 with up to four cores and clock speeds of 1.2 to 1.4 GHz clock speeds. The SoC will apparently include Gen 7 Ivy Bridge class graphics engines with four cores. The platform will support up to 8 GB DDR3L or LPDDR2 memory. The quad-core Valleyview processor will also introduce 1 MB shared L2 cache for each pair of cores. As part of the upcoming Bay Trail platform, Valleyview supposedly be offered in two packaging types and is likely to be offered in variety of applications and not just tablets and smartphones. Intel could be following Nvidia's lead and use Valleyview to compete in all mobile applications as well as emerging automotive and industrial fields. If Intel can take Valleyview's specs from a presentation to reality, it is clear that this is the Atom variant we have been waiting for since 2008, when Intel promised a capable SoC for the smartphone market.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1349460113484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349460746093-80</Id><Title>Don't buy INTC</Title><Msg>will be go lower</Msg><Username>vinhxle</Username><Timestamp>1349460746093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:12:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349461020024-81</Id><Topic><Title>Don't buy INTC</Title><Username>vinhxle</Username><Timestamp>1349460746093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:12:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he will stoop lower</Msg><Username>pumpwad</Username><Timestamp>1349461020024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:17:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349461214878-82</Id><Title>comparison of the razor i to the razor m</Title><Msg>(From theverge october 4 2012) . Our final benchmark test was SunSpider, a browser-based test that races to execute a predetermined set of JavaScript code. In the interest of fairness, we ran the tests on Chrome for Android rather than using the RAZR i’s preinstalled browser application. Although the RAZR i won this battle by a huge margin, Intel's always been good with browsers, and Chrome has just been updated to take advantage of its processors, so the results aren't surprising. We also checked out the battery life on both phones. This was another area of strength for Intel. In our standard battery test, which cycles through websites and videos with the screen set to 60 percent brightness, the RAZR M lasted seven hours and 22 minutes, while the RAZR i lasted a full eight hours and 42 minutes. Where the phones truly differ, however, is in standby time. The RAZR i managed to last 72 hours of regular use, including pushing email to two separate accounts, with 12 percent of its battery remaining. In contrast, the RAZR M will get you a full day's normal usage, but not much more. Both have strong battery life compared to many Android devices, but from our tests and experience, it’s clear that Intel’s chip is far more frugal with power than the dual-core Snapdragon S4.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1349461214878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349462456408-83</Id><Title>Is Romney hiding more $ overseas?</Title><Msg>Report coming</Msg><Username>yawnfestblink</Username><Timestamp>1349462456408</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:40:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349463018405-84</Id><Topic><Title>comparison of the razor i to the razor m</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1349461214878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Analysts underestimate the value of this product because it's not designed to be used with LTE, but LTE networks are still "under construction" in the U.S. and throughout most of the world.

Moreover, the best deals are available with 3G networks including T-Mobile's $30/mo package for unlimited data of about 8Mbps, unlimited text and 100 min/mo voice.

I don't think any money goes directly to Big Bird other than the PBS paying the Seaseme Workshop Group the broadcast fees for the shows.

It is reasonable to assume that it is 3X faster than A5 while maintaining the same battery life. But this is going to be a problem for rest of the ARM camp. They won't be able to match A6 performance easilty. This is where Intel has opportunity to step in. Then how much superb is A6? Let us do the maths. A6 shrinks to 32nm from 45nm in A5. That makes A6 1.4X fastener. A6 possibly has 1.5X more transistors. Since I don’t know exactly, assume 1.3X. Another 1.3X speed. 32nm enables A6 to run at 1.6X clock speed. Another 1.6X bump Total speed bump =1.4*1.3*1.6 = 2.9 So Just about 5% improvement from internal design efforts! Now 3X speed with same battery life? Does it mean 3X efficiency? No. Suppose you have got 2X faster car. It will get you to workplace 2X faster. But assuming same MPG and tank capacity, and you drive the new car for the same purpose, both old and new cars will last same number of days between tank fillings. No doubt, 3X speed will improve user experience. Similar move to 32/28nm by rest of the ARM camp will reap them similar benefits. But this is a comfort zone for Intel, not for the ARM camp. With recent Razr Vs Razr i comparison, I feel 32nm Intel is outperforming 28nm Snapdragon, though it may still have some shortcomings that will be overcome in few months. Not only the node size, but the maturity and quality of process matters.</Msg><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1349481319567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349481657311-116</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street doesn't buy the employment numbers</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1349466456683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:47:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the most idiotic remarks I have ever seen.

Or so it seems. Countless companies are building servers with ultra-low-power ARM processors, hoping to unseat Intel as the undisputed king of the server chips. Companies like Cavium and Calxeda are hoping that servers based on the same chip architecture at the heart of your cellphone will one day compete with Intel-based servers on speed — while consuming far less power. In the server world, power is money. Lots of money. But there’s at least one thing holding back the ARM insurgency. Applications written for today’s Intel servers won’t necessarily run on ARM chips. The Intel x86 standard has been around for decades, and many companies rely on software written for this architecture. Enter Elbrus Technologies. The Moscow-based startup is building a secret weapon for these ARM upstarts: an efficient emulator for running x86 applications on ARM. The software is currently in “alpha” testing stage, and CEO Anatoly Konukhov claims it can run x86 code about 40 percent as efficiently as it runs on good old x86 hardware. But the company hopes to have a working product ready for public testing by 2013, and by the end of 2014, he says, it will reach 80 percent efficiency. “We believe that 2014 will be the year of ARM actively invading server market,” Konukhov says, “and it will be a perfect time to enter x86 emulation market.” He says that right now, there are only a handful of companies working on ARM servers, so the market for emulation is still pretty small. But he says that some businesses are very interested in the cost savings of running ARM, and that many of them will need to emulate proprietary x86-only software when they make the leap. His company has big ambitions, but the engineering team has a history of developing efficient x86 emulators. Elbrus was founded in 2010 by employees of MCST — the company behind the Russian computer system also called Elbrus. In 2012, MCST and the Russian investment fund Skolkovo invested $1.3 million into the new Elbrus Technologies. At MCST, the startup team was part of the Binary Translation Department building x86 emulators for the Russian microprocessor E2K. According to Konukhov, their emulator performed 85 percent as well as native code. They also took part in a joint project with Intel to develop an x86 translator for Intel’s Itanium chip that achieved 90 percent of native performance. Konukhov says that MCST has published 46 journal articles on binary translation, and that the company has several USA patents in the field. Elbrus Technology’s secret sauce is its binary translator with multiple layers of hand-tuned optimization. And all the translations are handled in memory to speed up the process, with the translator itself taking up just 1MB of memory. Although the goal is to reach 80 percent of the performance of native x86, Knukhov says stability is more important. “Our marketing research clearly shows that most vendors and users are interested in functionality and stability rather then performance,” he says. “It is possible for us to release our solution without fully reaching performance goals and enhancing it afterwards.” In the meantime, they’re working with ARM hardware makers and are seeking more partners to give them chips to develop against. Engineers from the company will present at the ARM TechCon event in Santa Clara, California, from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1.</Msg><Username>the_competitor</Username><Timestamp>1349485560095</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349486598032-122</Id><Topic><Title>TIRED OF OBAMA?
