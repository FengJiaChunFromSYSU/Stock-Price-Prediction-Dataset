IBM can give them the reciepe but the foundries are still going to have to operate the equipment. In your opinion, will the volume ramp be faster, slower or about the same as TSMC 28nm? ----- I think it's too early to tell. TSMC 28nm ramp is also confusing to monitor as there are several different versions, each with their own set of issues. You then also have individual design issues. Samsung's process is probably the one to watch as they'll likely be focusing on specific SoC's (their own) so they may have a time to market advantage as they don't need to support multiple designs in flight. ---- Another question, how do you see the royalty stream wars to play out ---- Interesting question. My understanding (and I could be wrong) is that QCOM royalty stream is for high level stuff ( the protocols), not for specific low down patents that supports the protocols. Basically, it's the overall package that generates the royalties.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363595485941</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 04:31:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363606031624-10</Id><Topic><Title>Reading news on other boards that the futures are tanking bad and there's big trouble in Europe...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1363569254270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 21:14:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess if INTC slides back to the around $20 range, I'll look at it as a buying opportunity then... was just curious as I really don't understand it all...

And yet there were a couple of showstoppers in Barcelona, as well as a few surprises that we didn’t and still don’t know if to call pleasant or on the contrary. The 7-inch Asus Fonepad definitely falls in the surprises category, being one of the most intriguing and bizarre devices introduced in 2013 so far. The thing is marketed basically as an (uncomfortable) supersized phone and on top of it all has an Intel processor “inside”. But if you thought Intel was going to be focusing more on tabs starting now, you thought wrong. Instead, the Fonepad will probably be filed under experiments, while a new more comfortably sized phone made by Asus is headed our way come next summer. That’s according to Digitimes, who quotes sources “from the upstream supply chain”. Said sources told the online publication the new Asus-Intel device will adopt a 5 to 5.5-inch display and pack an Atom Z2580 (aka Clover Trail+) processor. If it all proves legit, the phone will follow on the footsteps of the Lenovo K900, expected out in China in April and soon after in the rest of the world. Of course, we have no words on pricing yet for the Asus device, but one thing is clear – Intel has big plans for 2013’s smartphone market and is no longer content with sitting on the sidelines and expecting the right moment to get in the game. androidauthorityDOTcom/asus-intel-smartphone-nexus-7-follow-up-rumors-173152/</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363612750596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 09:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363612836640-16</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have it already.

(TSMC), and United Microelectronics have all made it clear that they plan to pursue the technology. They aim to introduce FinFETs at the 14-nanometer-manufacturing-process node—a step, more or less, behind Intel’s 22-nm introduction.   To get there, both GlobalFoundries and TSMC have revealed they’ll take a half step. They will replace planar transistors with a denser array of FinFETs, but they won’t advance the manufacturing process used to build the wiring that connects the devices on the “back end” layers of the chip. As a result, although there will be more transistors in any given area, a good number of them won’t be connected and therefore can’t be used. The chips won’t be much smaller than the 20-nm generation, which is going into production now. That means the foundries won’t be able to create more of them on a single wafer to reduce costs spectrumDOTieeeDOTorg/semiconductors/devices/foundries-rush-3d-transistors/?utm_source=techalert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=010313</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363615227978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 10:00:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363615384857-20</Id><Title>ARM Greater China to enjoy double-digit shipment growth across several product lines</Title><Msg>ARM's Greater China president Allen Wu expects the company's shipments of products such as application processors, embedded applications and micro controller units (MCU) in the Greater China region to enjoy double-digit growths in 2013. Wu pointed out that ARM's global market share rose from 17% in 2007 to 32% in 2012 and the Asia Pacific market including the Greater China region contributed 51% of the company's revenues in 2012. The contribution will have a chance to rise higher in the future, Wu added. In 2017, ARM expects global application processor shipments to reach four billion units, embedded application shipments 14 billion, and MCU shipments 23 billion.

I can't disagree with you at all. But the one thing I learned from you is that Intel is already one of ARMH's largest customers so this breech actually happened many years ago. Of course you present it like this is a bad thing for Intel. Yes, forging lasting long term business relationships with large ARM customers is a horrible thing. And of course Intel would never dare dream of suggesting about a million ways to improve on the ARM design to these large customers because their army of R&amp;D engineers are resting on their laurels. And retaining large portions of the profit that won't go to TSMC or other foundries is a bad thing for Intel as well. Arguably it's most of the profit because the royalty for the ARM design is measured in pennies per unit. Intel will sweep in and take away premium dollars from the ARM foundries and companies like NVidia. When the foundries aren't getting demand for cutting edge technology that will be a good thing for TSMC? The president of ARMH kinda knew this was the future when he started talking about the "internet of things." He was trying to imagine a world where his foundries could find demand for old nodes in significant enough volume to make up for the loss cutting edge foundry business they would experience in the future.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1363620759542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363621143787-46</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Server Hype</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363553406731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 16:50:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Of course you present it like this is a bad thing for Intel.

Q1 Intel lower forecasts are know and baked into the current price. If you are talking about Q2 forecasts that Intel will make public next month, then those are your speculation.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1363629496256</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363629895352-68</Id><Topic><Title>Intel can go from 1% to 10% for smartphone market by end of 2013</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363614234439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 09:43:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, you are the taking the "wait til next year," approach.

Tom's Hardware was able to get its hands on a pre-production version of the Core i7-4770K, which will supplant the i7-3770K at the head of Intel's desktop lineup. The new model is similar to its Ivy-based predecessor, with four cores, Hyper-Threading support, and 8MB of L3 cache. Intel hasn't bumped up the chip's base or Turbo clock speeds, although the peak speed of the built-in GPU has been increased by 100MHz. Haswell's integrated graphics processor is new, of course, but the i7-4770K doesn't have a full-fat implementation of it. None of the desktop-bound versions do, in fact. The desktop lineup listed at Tom's is limited to "GT2" graphics, which has half as many ALUs as the GT3 version that will be available on some of Haswell's mobile incarnations. Tom's tested the Core i7-4770K against its counterparts in the Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge families, and the results are mostly what we expected. In application tests, the difference in performance between Haswell and Ivy is about the same as the delta between Ivy and Sandy. Most gains are in the 7-13% range, which isn't too shabby considering clock speeds have remained steady. The Haswell machine was also running with 17% less memory bandwidth than its peers; the system was using 1600MHz DDR memory like the others, but there's apparently some platform tuning that needs to be done. In some instances, the Core i7-4770K is much faster than the 3770K. Haswell adds support for AVX2 and FMA3 instructions, and those deliver sizable gains in Sandra's Mandelbrot-based Multimedia benchmark, where integer performance is up by nearly a factor of two. The 4770K's L1 cache bandwidth has also increased by almost 2X versus the 3770K.

Though notebook and PC demands have been slowing this quarter, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is in line with its revenue guidance of $12.7 billion, says Macquarie Equity Research. Macquarie analyst Shawn Webster estimates the chip maker to earn 43 cents in the first quarter of this year, compared to the consensus of 42 cents. Analysts said their checks have shown weak component orders quarter to date, particularly due to weaker desktop chip orders from Europe. Macquarie’s Taiwan-based analyst Andrew Chang said he has lowered his first quarter forecasts for notebook ODMs, though motherboard sales remains on expected lines. Then why do they expect Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to perform better? Macquarie said there was a significant under-shipping in the third and fourth quarter of the last year that has created the biggest microprocessor inventory burn since the Credit Crisis. This inventory burn will allow Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to ship at better than expected rates. Shawn Webster, senior analyst at Macquarie expects Intel’s second quarter growth to be 2 percent QoQ. However, analysts are expecting a profit margin decline in the second quarter, while the second half of this year should see better margins due to improved revenues and lower factory costs. Macquarie said that there will be a deficit in chip supply chain for the entire year if PC end market contracts by 1.3 percent YoY as estimated by IDC. Shawn Webster’s model shows that the supply chain microprocessor deficit will decline from 3.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year to 12.8 million in the fourth quarter of this year. Webster further said that the current forecasts can easily accommodate the decline in PC market because</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1363635836501</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:43:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363638250681-83</Id><Title>Warning time for Intc is over.

No reason not to. Second, inventories were probably very low, so suppliers could have rebuilt inventories without it showing in sales. An important thing here is the lag. Intel gets paid when chips go into production at the suppliers, not when the suppliers sell them. Third, we could see some bump from Haswell. We have gotten word that suppliers already have some inventory. There might therefore be 2-3 weeks of Haswell sales in Q1. The other thing is that Q1 is always less seasonally than Q4. So we would expect to see a drop off. So we re talking about the increase in the drop-off rather than the total of the drop-off. The headline is totally misleading - for obvious reasons. I don't see the net dncrease as a big deal. I don't see a miss and I don't see bad guidance because suppliers are definitely going to want Haswell. How's that?

Digitimes claims that Asus is planning to go mainstream market with this phone. The publication’s supply chain sources predict the launch in June at the earliest; however we can always see delays. Asus is planning to take on high-end phablets with this upcoming Intel device. According to the report, this phone will feature a 5.5-inch display, which will land it in the phablet segment. Lenovo’s first Clover Trail+ phone Ideaphone K900 also uses a 5.5-inch display and set to be released in China next month. Other features of this upcoming Asus device are not clear at the moment, but given the June launch, we can at least expect to see Jelly Bean, if not Key Lime Pie which will also be announced in June at Google I/O 2013. To remind you, Asus had announced its first Intel-powered tablet device FonePad at MWC last month, which will go on sale beginning this month in select markets for $249. Asus FonePad runs on entry-level Intel Atom Z2420 processor and packs 7-inch display, Android 4.1, 1GB RAM, 3MP rear camera, 1.2MP front camera, 8/16GB of internal storage, and microSD card slot.

Suffice it to say that Intel plans to move the x86 architecture processors, the Core and Atom series onto tablets and smart phones competitive with ARM in every way: performance, power consumption and form factor. With devices such as the HP Elitepad 900 and the Microsoft Surface Pro, it's already starting to happen, and the arrival of Fourth Gen (Haswell) Core processors will further Intel's market penetration with even lighter, thinner tablets that are fully Windows 8 Pro capable. by Mark Hibben</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363648276896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 19:11:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363649440985-103</Id><Title>Short Disappointment is Palpable</Title><Msg>Got a good laugh at the expense of the Intel shorts today.

Over the past two years the company has developed more than a dozen data-intensive projects that have bolstered both its operational efficiency and bottom line. According to Ron Kasabian, general manager of big data solutions for Intel's data center group, these ongoing efforts have resulted in millions of dollars of cost savings. "We started the year before last, realizing we had an opportunity to leverage data that's floating around the enterprise today, (data) we weren't dealing with," Kasabian told InformationWeek in a phone interview. This predictive analytics process, implemented on a single line of Intel Core processors in 2012, allowed Intel to save $3 million in manufacturing costs. In 2013-14, Intel expects to extend the process to more chip lines and save an additional $30 million, the company said. Data-intensive processes also help Intel detect failures in its manufacturing line, which is a highly automated environment. "A lot of what we're doing is pulling log files out of manufacturing and test machines," said Kasabian. "Across our entire factory network, we're talking about 5 terabytes an hour. So it's very big volume." By capturing and analyzing this information, Intel can determine when a specific step in one of its manufacturing processes starts to deviate from normal tolerances. Big data benefits Intel's security efforts too. The company says its big data platform can process 200 billion server events, and provide early warning of security threats within 30 minutes.
