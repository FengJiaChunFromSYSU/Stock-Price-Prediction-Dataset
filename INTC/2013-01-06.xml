Intel's gross margin was 63%. Intel has 2012 revenues of about $55b. If you make an assumption that the incremental Intel margin is 38%, which 10% lower than TSM, then what would the Intel revenue be if they doubled their revenue?? Won't the blended margin of Intel (63% current and new 38%) be 50.5%? Intel revenues would go from $55b to $110b and Intel gross profits would go from $34b to $55b? There would be some impact in the product mix but the positive impact of new products would outweigh that.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357448928406</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 00:08:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357448967826-2</Id><Topic><Title>Woo Hoo more about Lenovo and Merrifield !!!

If this is case, there's a case to be made for an larger screen version with Intel inside. 1) It seems the larger screen ( 4") phones are getting popular so Intel needs to get into this category 2) According to reports, it looks like Intel's next smartphone SoC will be far superior to anything arm-based ones. This means, Apple will have no choice but to use Intel just to be on even level with other phones that will be using it. 3) Apple can split the fab between tsmc and Intel.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357449647006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 00:20:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357449897423-4</Id><Topic><Title>The iWatch Could Be The First Step In Apple's Plan To Kill The iPhone</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357445195261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:06:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you 2 are dumber than a box of rocks.I mean that.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357449897423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 00:24:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357453619664-5</Id><Title>Samsung Chromebox with Celeron inside</Title><Msg>maxdioDOTcom/samsung-announced-new-series-chromebox-for-300/</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357453619664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 01:26:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357454595066-6</Id><Title>Fabless-Foundry Model Under Stress</Title><Msg>Fabless-Foundry Model Under Stress By Mark LaPedus The semiconductor roadmap was once a smooth and straightforward path, but chipmakers face a bumpy and challenging ride as they migrate to the 20nm node and beyond.

MojoKid writes "New leaked info from Intel sheds light on how the company's 2014 platforms will challenge ARM products in the ultra light, low power market. At present, the company's efforts in the segment are anchored by Cedar Trail, the 32nm dual-core platform that launched a year ago. To date, all of Intel's platform updates for Atom have focused on lowering power consumption and ramping SoC integration rather than focusing on performance — but Bay Trail will change that. Bay Trail moves Atom to a quad-core, 22nm, out-of-order design. It significantly accelerates the CPU core with burst modes of up to 2.7GHz, and it'll be the first Atom to feature Intel's own graphics processor instead of a licensed core from Imagination Technologies."</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357501308339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:41:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357501466997-42</Id><Title>New MAC's coming with ARMH chips inside, OH NO INTC</Title><Msg>New MAC's coming with ARMH chips inside, OH NO INTC</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357501466997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:44:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357501478112-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama gets more money from Wealthy so he can keep spending</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357500086962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:21:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that be communist bastion Russia.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357501478112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:44:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357501501898-44</Id><Topic><Title>Woo Hoo more about Lenovo and Merrifield !!!

Expect more news on Intel's powerful fabrication plans for 2013. Meanwhile expect no news or bad news on ARMs fabrication roadmap for 2013. ARM 20nm planar promises to be difficult, expensive and slow ramping in addition to providing limited improvements in performance and power efficiency. ARM has until June to produce 20nm in volume or suffer the competitive consequences. There is little chance they will have volume production this year, much less by June. The prospects for ARM 20nm are so dim that they are considering an almost impossible two process node jump to FinFET and 14/16nm fabrication. Of course, we don't expect to hear any news on ARM fabrication at CES but there should be plenty of good news about Intel's stellar 2013 fabrication roadmap. Expect to hear about the latest Intel smartphone or perhaps smartphones with big LTE and US market updates. Expect to hear about the latest Intel tablet efforts including the Surface Pro, which has been eagerly anticipated after the dismal performance and lukewarm reception of the ARM Surface RT. Expect to hear more on Intel's virtual cable TV efforts as they attempt to crack this important market by being the first to offer a la carte channel selection. Hopefully we will hear more about the Apple/Intel iWatch plans and what perhaps is Apple's view of a transition from the smartphone to the next evolution of mobile communications. Intel has invested billions in focusing strongly on reduction of power consumption while addressing performance at the same time. Intel has come to both play and win. This week Intel will provide much anticipated detail on the traction they plan to achieve in mobility, computing and entertainment in 2013.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357502208479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:56:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357502276060-48</Id><Title>Not time to buy INTC, INSIDERS still dumping maybe after earnings will get the bottom in INTC</Title><Msg>Not time to buy INTC, INSIDERS still dumping maybe after earnings will get the bottom in INTC.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357502276060</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:57:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357502494400-49</Id><Topic><Title>New MAC's coming with ARMH chips inside, OH NO INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357501466997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:44:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just a suggestion. You really do need to get a life. What? You cannot get out because of health? OK Then spend your time in a more useful and stimulating way. Watch great movies. Get on line and watch a movie from China--2046. You will like it. It is beautiful the way the movies here used to be shot. Do you like to watch NBA games? Try betting a couple and maybe you mind find you have a talent for that and it is more entertaining then here. I mean this Intel board is DEAD now. If you can get out, you really should get out to California. It is beautiful. Go North of San Francisco up the coast. Then drive over the coastal mountain range into the Mt Shasta area to see a beautiful volcano covered with snow. You can drive down to lake Tahoe and do some gambling or simply enjoy the entertainment. People all around you and it can be fun at night. You can meet a friend there. What--You are rich but angry? OK---If you are hetero--meet a beautiful woman and love her. If you are gay--meet your lover and do the same. Same thing love is. Get a dog and a cat. By the way---NOBODY know what will happen in tech in the next 4 years. It is crazy. Just put a little of your money on all sides and when the winner shows up--move it all over to the winners. Being in Love is the cure you know. 99% of men do not need the blue pills to get it hard but simply need to be in love. Intel---it is still all about phone chips. if Intel fails there, Intel loses. But if it wins, the stock will see 100.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1357502494400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 15:01:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357502520156-50</Id><Topic><Title>The Week Ahead</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357502208479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:56:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should I "expect" $30 this week?

They didn't just say processor, they stated new processor platform.

The industrial design won't change much, according to a report from the Taiwanese site. One of the first MacBook Air rumors of the season alludes to internal changes but few external tweaks. A fresh report from the not-always-reliable Taipei-based Digitimes claims the "industrial design will not see any major changes" in 2013. Apple introduced the accentuated wedge aesthetic in late 2010 (see photo above), so about a year and a half will have transpired if new MBAs are introduced in the first half of 2013. The report makes no mention of displays, but that's an area of intense focus for Apple. The high end of the MacBook Pro line now sports Retina displays with edge-to-edge glass versus the wide metal bezel on the non-Retina Airs. And there has been little, if any, chatter in the Asia supply chain so far about Retina-equipped MBAs. But one thing is certain -- a new chip platform, which Digitimes does mention. Intel is expected to introduce its fourth generation Core "Haswell" processor at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. That processor should make its way into new MacBooks by midyear. Haswell is all about better power efficiency. So, Apple could feasibly squeeze Haswell into the same or slightly thinner design with longer battery life. Haswell is also expected to include a graphics processing unit (GPU) that delivers a bigger jump in performance compared with past generations of Core processors.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357504991022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 15:43:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357505030918-69</Id><Title>intel powered adult toys ?</Title><Msg>folks you cant not make this stuff up.

First, there is a perception that the foundries are falling further behind Intel. The chip giant rolled out finFETs at 22nm and is offering the technology to select foundry customers. Intel plans to begin ramping up its 14nm finFET process by the fourth quarter of 2013. Some chipmakers have been openly critical about the 20nm foundry planar process, saying the technology puts the industry behind the traditional performance curve. “I know some customers want more,” acknowledged Morris Chang, chairman and chief executive of TSMC, in a recent conference call. So, at 20nm and beyond, chipmakers are weighing their options and exploring the trade-offs. “There will be customers that will skip 20nm to get to (finFETs),” Chang said. “I think there will be customers that will be light on one (process technology) and heavy on another.” The benefits of finFETs are clear, but the industry is finally coming to grips with the challenges associated with the transistor technology. Cost, patterning and variation are just a few of the issues. The complexity will require more and deeper collaboration between foundries and their customers. “The challenge for us is to work across the ecosystem with our partners and have earlier tapeouts that are fully debugged and tested,” said Gregg Bartlett, senior vice president and chief technology officer at GlobalFoundries.

As Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann stated in a recent research note seen by Forbes, the company could be heading for “a potential gross margin nightmare.” With the increasing popularity of lower-margin chips and rising competition from ARM in the microprocessor market, Intel could see its margins fall from the mid-60 percent range to the 50-percent range in the next two years. But as the demand for PCs continues to decline, it is important for Intel to be able to tap into the market for mobile devices. Gartner, a leading information technology research company, announced in October that worldwide PC shipments totaled 87.5 million units in the third quarter, representing an 8.3 percent decline from a year earlier. IDC, another research firm, also showed that shipments fell more than 8 percent in the most recent three month period. It is the largest drop for the industry since at least 2001. Taking into account the components of our CHEAT SHEET investing framework, Intel is a STAY AWAY until shares can stabilize and the company increases its exposure to non-PC products.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357527980997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:06:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357528830926-95</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo gets to that all important 699$ Ultrabook pricepoint</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357523142422</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 20:45:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>still way way too high for a lap top that is slightly thinner and slightly lighter.

This ASP includes all Intel CPU, including servers. When someone exaggerates a commonly accepted number by double, there is not much else that can be trusted from that source. What they say may be right or wrong but it is more likely to be disinformation than true. Intel is selling Atom 32nm CPU for as low as $47 from their tray price list. Since you can put twice the die on a 22nm wafer, the product cost is lower by about 50%. IDC is predicting a flat PC volumes in 2012 compared to 2011 and then increases of ~5% through the end of their forecast period. Hardly dead. IDC probably has a better idea of what is happening than you. At least I trust them more than I do you your math following you Intel ASP error. QCOM will not use Intel. Apple might but unlikely, IMO. Samsung, same as Apple. Intel will likely do what they did to the PC market by putting new players into the market.

Expect more news on Intel's powerful fabrication plans for 2013. Meanwhile expect no news or bad news on ARMs fabrication roadmap for 2013. ARM 20nm planar promises to be difficult, expensive and slow ramping in addition to providing limited improvements in performance and power efficiency. ARM has until June to produce 20nm in volume or suffer the competitive consequences. There is little chance they will have volume production this year, much less by June. The prospects for ARM 20nm are so dim that they are considering an almost impossible two process node jump to FinFET and 14/16nm fabrication. Of course, we don't expect to hear any news on ARM fabrication at CES but there should be plenty of good news about Intel's stellar 2013 fabrication roadmap. Expect to hear about the latest Intel smartphone or perhaps smartphones with big LTE and US market updates. Expect to hear about the latest Intel tablet efforts including the Surface Pro, which has been eagerly anticipated after the dismal performance and lukewarm reception of the ARM Surface RT. Expect to hear more on Intel's virtual cable TV efforts as they attempt to crack this important market by being the first to offer a la carte channel selection. Hopefully we will hear more about the Apple/Intel iWatch plans and what perhaps is Apple's view of a transition from the smartphone to the next evolution of mobile communications. Intel has invested billions in focusing strongly on reduction of power consumption while addressing performance at the same time. Intel has come to both play and win. This week Intel will provide much anticipated detail on the traction they plan to achieve in mobility, computing and entertainment in 2013.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357530079861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:41:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357530139627-100</Id><Topic><Title>Here's why the margin and price myth will be busted</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357414241255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I spent 20 years marketing Intel Semi's and I know their previous game plan.

Intel worst case, bad, ugly margin NIGHTMARE would be if the Intel margin dropped to the same level that TSM has today. TSM margin is 48%. TSM PE ratio is 17.4. INTC PE ratio is 9.2. I expect that Intel will at least cram the whole phone or whole tablet logic into 1 package and then sell that part for value and there will be a number of companies who will want a share of the smartphone and tablet markets. Intel will put them into the market and make them successful. They will sell the transistors and fill the fabs. There will 4 players: Samsung, Apple, QCOM and Intel. The market is pricing in a collapse in Intel revenue and margins. If it happens, Intel will probably have to slow down the dividend increases. If it doesn't the analysts will eventually have to face their error.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357530626474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:50:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357530643301-104</Id><Topic><Title>Coming Up</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357530079861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:41:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't believe it folks, lies, lies, lies.

To date, Apple has been using Imagination Technologies GPU for iDevices, but that could all change in 2013 if ARM's new Mali GPU delivers on its promises of delivering greater power and a revolutionary new data compression technology called ASTC (Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression). Steve Steele, product manager of ARM's media processing division stated that "From the consumer's point of view it's going to mean better battery life and higher image quality." He went on to state that you'll "be able to download games faster, and it's also been designed to be more efficient at uncompressing data once it's on your device." Yet as tempting as it may be for Apple to make the switch, one has to remember that Apple is still a shareholder in Imagination Technologies that currently develops the PowerVR GPU that's powering today's iPad. Logic says that Apple will pass on this next generation GPU from ARM, but technology in the fast lane could sometimes throw in a surprise of two along the way – and so it's not a sure thing until it is. Only time will tell.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357530730491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:52:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357531233532-106</Id><Topic><Title>Imagination 'Rogue' GPUs to demo at CES</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357530595977</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:49:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mobile chips have numerous advantages: they're far cheaper to produce, they produce far less heat, and the whole low power PC platform is still about 2-3x the average power usage of a ARM-based platform.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357531233532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 23:00:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357531307615-107</Id><Topic><Title>Jerry Blown used to post as LT Steve</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357519726774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 19:48:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Definitely a Blowhard.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357531307615</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 23:01:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357531427164-108</Id><Topic><Title>Here's why the margin and price myth will be busted</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357414241255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I spent 20 years marketing Intel Semi's and I know their previous game plan." If so, then you might look at the Intel-Lenovo relationship. Intel is not going to have to "create" new players with cash. The difference today is that companies are cash flush and looking for new ways of generating revenue. They can buy the QCOM parts or Samsung parts or work with an eager supplier (Intel) who wants them to be successful. "Not just bashing Intel but being realistic about the game plan and its side effects" You have used the $30 SoC vs. $200 ASP for Intel chips several times. If you have the 20 year experience that you say, then you are intentionally misrepresenting the facts that even the negative analysts have calculated for Intel ASPs. Why are you misrepresenting the Intel ASP's by 2x ??? My only conclustion is that your are "bashing".
