But a leading credit-rating agency has publicly disputed that report, with an analysis that suggests external factors, including Hurricane Sandy, strongly affected early sales. At the end of November, NPD garnered a few headlines with data suggesting that Windows 8 was struggling in the marketplace. (Sample from right here at ZDNet: "Windows 8 off to a slow start with consumers in month one, says NPD.") Now a leading credit-rating agency has taken issue with those numbers. Fitch Ratings, which is headquartered in New York and London, took the unusual step of publicly disputing the NPD data in a research report: NPD PC Data May Not be Indicative of Windows 8 Demand Fitch Ratings-New York-05 December 2012: Data indicating that U.S. retail sales of Microsoft-based PCs declined 21% year over year in the four weeks ended Nov. 17, 2012 does not provide an accurate view of demand for Windows 8, according to Fitch Ratings. The NPD Group data period actually starts five days before the launch of Windows 8 and includes one-off constraints, such as Hurricane Sandy and significant discounts on existing Windows 7 inventory, both of which reduced demand for PCs, particularly those with Windows 8. The research report noted that Hurricane Sandy had an "adverse effect on PC demand" during the study period, noting that other retail sectors were hard hit as well: Retail consumer spending overall, particularly for discretionary items such as PCs, was materially affected for at least several days following the storm, which hit just three days after the introduction of Windows 8. Aggregate same-store sales growth of only 1.6% for 17 large retailers in November, nearly 52% below analyst growth expectations, shows the storm's effects continued through the month. The folks at Fitch should be painfully aware of Sandy's impact, as their New York City headquarters office was closed for a month in the wake of the storm and only reopened on November 29. NPD's report suggested consumers were snapping up "excess inventory" of Windows 7 PCs, the Fitch report said, with many of those PCs containing "an older Intel processor (Sandy Bridge) and lower graphics capabilities." There might be a silver lining for anyone watching Microsoft's Windows 8 performance, says Fitch. The ratings firm notes that the PC industry has "a strong pipeline of announced, but yet to be released PC products, particularly those with touchscreens." If that analysis sounds familiar, well, perhaps it's because you read something very similar here earlier this week. How are Windows 8 sales? It's still too early to tell.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357884354802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:05:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357886461914-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why is ARMH stock outperforming INTC so badly??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357838146159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 12:15:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Wallisweaver It's not 76 anymore (P/E ratio).

However, most of the media attention focused areas like its quad-core Bay Trail processors aimed at tablets and its advancements in the power efficiency of Ivy Bridge chips. While those are big storylines, senior Fool tech analyst Eric Bleeker says he was also intrigued by the Lexington platform. That's a processor dedicated toward emerging-market sales, which is intriguing, as it shows Intel's willingness to attack all mobile processor segments, including lower-end processors where margins are thin and battles for market share are fierce. Eric believes this is an indication of how seriously Intel is looking to disrupt ARM-based players in all areas of the smartphone world.

Tofel Summary: U.S. consumers have one less Windows RT tablet to choose: Samsung has decided not to sell its Ativ Tab, citing weak demand for Windows RT and a lack of product understanding by consumers. That’s OK, the Ativ with full Windows 8 and Intel’s Atom is $599. Samsung won’t be selling its Microsoft Windows RT tablet, the Ativ Tab, in the U.S., citing weak demand and challenges to achieve its target price. The company confirmed those plans with CNET, suggesting that it could re-evaluate its decision in the future. The company does offer two Windows 8 tablets in the Ativ line, however, so this decision is more likely to impact Qualcomm more than Microsoft. I consider this development to be a small win for Intel because it means that Samsung’s Windows 8 tablets for the U.S. market will run solely on Intel chips. Qualcomm, which has been very successful developing the chips that power many smartphones and tablets, is Microsoft’s partner for Windows RT, a version of Windows specifically designed for ARM-based chips. Intel Atom Z2760After speaking with Intel this week at the Consumer Electronics show, I’m not too surprised by Samsung’s choice. Intel’s Atom Z2760 chip is reportedly on par with Qualcomm’s chips when it comes to power efficiency and, in some cases, outperforms them based on AnandTech’s recent chip comparison. In a quick check, I saw that Samsung’s Ativ Smart PC with Intel Atom and 64 GB of storage can be had for $599 on Amazon. And Dell’s Latitude 10 Essentials Windows 8 slate with the same Atom chip and 32 GB is now down to $499. Microsoft’s own Surface RT tablet with Qualcomm processor starts at the same $499 and includes 32 GB of storage. Choose a 64 GB Surface RT device, and you’ll pay $699. That price does include a keyboard cover, however. Regardless, consumers can choose a tablet with the full version of Windows 8 that’s fully compatible with old Windows applications for about the same price as a Windows RT slate. Samsung knows this and must figure: Why bother with the RT version? And in terms of battery life, I’m told by Intel that the new Atom Z2760 is expected to get around 10 hours of run-time on a single charge, or the same as a Windows RT device with Qualcomm’s chips. Again, with little difference in performance and run-time, why wouldn’t consumers choose Windows 8 over Windows RT?</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357887166453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:52:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357888184076-7</Id><Topic><Title>One less Windows RT choice in US: So long Samsung Ativ Tab</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357887166453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:52:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A review of the Intel version from Amazon: Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T (Tablet Only) by Samsung Price: $599.99 5.0 out of 5 stars Exceeded My Expectations October 28, 2012 By Jrhea Style Name:Without Keyboard As an owner of tablets before the ipad and all 3 ipad variations including the "new" ipad, I have always struggled to get rid of that feeling of it either being too cumbersome for use(pre-ipads), or just a toy with few cool uses(ipads). I think with this tablet, I have finally found what I am looking for. I am so happy with it, I am actually writing the first review I have ever done for a product. Ability to hook up common usb peripherals and use them? Check - external DVD, USB stick were a breeze to use and install programs (.iso of software CD's, etc). Flawless, and convenient. Ability to use the programs I have already purchased for my home machine? Check - Office 2010, adobe photoshop, etc - they all worked without issue. I just can't emphasize how nice this is to finally have in a tablet. I even put world of warcraft on for the heck of it - just because I could. Ability to expand through a Micro SD card? Check - bought a 64GB class 10 card and have Apps installed on it (yes, you can install apps to the microSD card) as well as videos, games, MP3's and pictures. Very handy, doesn't fill the O/S drive with unnecessary items. Great Screen? Check - even coming from a retina ipad user. Bright, vivid display with good sharp resolution. The auto brightness is a tad harsh at times, but that can be adjusted in the power settings. Great battery? Check - hours and hours of play each day for the last two days, and the remaining battery life frankly blew me away each night (60%+ available). This is through installing programs, playing games, watching videos, surfing the web (can't count the number of times my son looped that gangum style song on you tube!?!). Very impressed with battery life for a full featured machine. Windows 8? Not as bad as I thought. I was anticipating a train wreck that would take me a long time to get used to. It is well done and feels good on the tablet. Not sure I am up for putting it on my home machine yet, but on the tablet, it really goes a long ways to make it the experience it is. Also, Samsung includes a program if you use the "SW Updater" that puts the start button functionality basically back on your desktop. Samsung did a nice job with the pen that you get with the tablet as well - that thing is handy in OneNote, it can even read my terrible handwriting. When you have to bounce to the desktop, it is also a nice feature to be able to use the pen and click, drag, right-click. Not necessary, but nice none the less. Processor Speed? Again, not as bad as I thought. I almost didn't buy it when I saw "atom". Perhaps intel should change the name, because this processor actually performs well. It seemed sluggish for the first few hours, but after that it has really been peppy. Perhaps there were some things installing in the background, or maybe uninstalling Norton bloatware did it, but the performance of the Atom processor has exceeded my expectations. I think the build quality of the tablet is very nice - good clean edges, great sounding speakers that point toward you, well placed inputs on the edges. As far as "feel" of the materials, I find it very similar to my wife's Galaxy S3. It is lighter than I expected for the size, but the size poses issues I mention below (non-standard - nothing fits it). Negatives? No docking station in stock anywhere - I mean I have tried all over. No Cases and covers available for it yet. I am currently using a $12 sleeve I bought at a discount retailer (actually fits nice, made by merkury) that will have to hold me over until I find something real. The charger for it is like a laptop charger that plugs into the wall (has a mini brick). I don't see any Car adapters for it available, and would guess it will be expensive as you can't seem to use a common USB type charger for it. Overall, those few negatives aside which time may fix, I love this thing. More than I expected. Thanks Samsung and Microsoft for finally making the tablet I have been waiting for.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357888184076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 02:09:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357888372398-8</Id><Topic><Title>One less Windows RT choice in US: So long Samsung Ativ Tab</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357887166453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:52:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like Intel is finally cracking the tablet market.

As I posted before: both INTC and AMD used "older" (depreciated) equipment in the past to manufacture state of the art NOR flash. There are a lot of talking heads that are fairly green - they know very little about semiconductors but manage somehow to get a job writing for a living about semiconductors. variable cost: probably 80% a function of yields - so it is possible for Intel to manufacture (certain) SoCs at very low cost. Now if you have an MBA you would know about "fictive" depreciation : Primäre Kostenart, die den betriebsbedingten Wertverzehr des abnutzbaren Anlagevermögens umfaßt. Eindeutiger wäre die Bezeichnung Abschreibungskosten (siehe Kalkulatorische Kosten). Abschreibungsbasis ist zumeist der Wiederbeschaffungswert der betrachteten Periode. Als Nutzungsdauer wird eine betriebsindividuelle, wirtschaftliche Nutzungsdauer unterstellt, die unabhängig von handels- und steuerrechtlichen Vorschriften ist. Ziel ist es in erster Linie, den in einer Periode anfallenden Wertverzehr zu erfassen. Bei Fehleinschätzungen der Nutzungsdauer weicht die Summe der Periodenabschreibungen daher vom Wiederbeschaffungswert ab. Zur Planung der kalkulatorischen Abschreibungen gibt es zahlreiche Näherungsverfahren, die auch eine Kostenauflösung zulassen. Das in der Grenzplankostenrechnung am häufigsten eingesetzte Verfahren ist das "Verfahren der gebrochenen kalkulatorischen Abschreibung". Hierbei wird zusätzlich eine (hypothetische) Nutzungsdauer bei reinem Zeitverschleiß geschätzt. Die hieraus resultierenden Abschreibungsbeträge werden als fixe Kosten betrachtet. Die Kontrolle kalkulatorischer Abschreibungen ist nur eingeschränkt möglich, da der tatsächliche Wertverzehr einer Periode (Istkosten) nicht ermittelt werden kann. Hilfsweise wird für die Istkosten der Wert der Sollkosten angenommen...... Kalkulatorische Abschreibung ist ein Begriff aus der Kosten- und Leistungsrechnung. Im Unterschied zur bilanziellen Abschreibung wird bei der kalkulatorischen Abschreibung nur der Verbrauchsanteil während der geplanten Nutzungsdauer eingerechnet. Ein zu erwartender Verkaufserlös bleibt unberücksichtigt. Es werden jedoch gestiegene Wiederbeschaffungskosten eines Artikel bzw. eines vergleichbaren Anlagegutes als so genannte Opportunitätskosten in die Abschreibung eingerechnet.

I have never heard or seen a rating agency offer clarification like this. Never. Fitch Wire 05 Dec 2012 3:25 PM NPD PC Data May Not be Indicative of Windows 8 Demand Fitch Ratings-New York-05 December 2012: Data indicating that U.S. retail sales of Microsoft-based PCs declined 21% year over year in the four weeks ended Nov. 17, 2012 does not provide an accurate view of demand for Windows 8, according to Fitch Ratings. The NPD Group data period actually starts five days before the launch of Windows 8 and includes one-off constraints, such as Hurricane Sandy and significant discounts on existing Windows 7 inventory, both of which reduced demand for PCs, particularly those with Windows 8. Five days, or nearly 20% of NPD's evaluation period, excluded any sales of Windows 8 PCs since it was not available until Oct. 26, 2012. Furthermore, PC demand in those five days was particularly depressed, as consumers postponed PC purchases ahead of the imminent release of Windows 8. A strong pipeline of announced, but yet to be released PC products, particularly those with touchscreens, also contributed to weak PC demand in this period. Hurricane Sandy also had an adverse effect on PC demand during NPD's study. Retail consumer spending overall, particularly for discretionary items such as PCs, was materially affected for at least several days following the storm, which hit just three days after the introduction of Windows 8. Aggregate same-store sales growth of only 1.6% for 17 large retailers in November, nearly 52% below analyst growth expectations, shows the storm's effects continued through the month. Significant discounts on excess inventory of Windows 7 PCs, many containing an older Intel processor (Sandy Bridge) and lower graphics capabilities, also cut into demand. We believe the excess inventory and five days of unavailability in NPD's study contributed to Windows 8 accounting for only 58% of total unit sales in the four weeks after its launch compared with 83% for Windows 7 in the four weeks after its launch. Microsoft reportedly sold 40 million licenses for Windows 8 since its release on October 26, 2012, approximately in line with Window 7 in its first month of availability. Microsoft did not disclose what percentage of Windows 8 licenses were upgrades versus those sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for use in new PCs.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357905903577</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:05:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357906104116-12</Id><Title>First benchmark results of Intel-powered Lenovo K900 are off the charts!</Title><Msg>Article from AndroidAuthority. The Lenovo K900 is shaping up nicely as a premier high end smartphone. First benchmark results of Intel-powered Lenovo K900 are off the charts by Adrian Diaconescu on Jan 11, 2013 While Intel started out slowly in the Android world, powering only entry-level devices during 2012, we suspected that one of these days the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker will be looking to step things up. And when Lenovo showed us the humongous 5.5-inch IdeaPhone K900 at CES, we stopped asking “when” and started wondering “how much”. It was obvious this was going to be the first state of the art high-end Android device to rock an Intel CPU and we knew it was coming soon, but we still had no idea how much snappier the new Clover Trail+ platform would prove compared with the company’s previous efforts. Now however we’re starting to form an idea, and we’ll tell you this – it’s beyond our wildest dreams and ARM’s darkest nightmares. Ready for it? Well, it seems that the Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 with “Intel Inside” has scored a whopping 27,154 points in an AnTuTu benchmark test performed by Tech Authors and a slightly lower 25,481 in a similar test conducted by GSM Insider. For those unfamiliar with this particular benchmark, AnTuTu is a tool that measures several aspects of a device’s hardware performance and speed, including the memory, CPU integer, CPU floating point, 2D and 3D graphics and SD card reading and writing. After doing this, it crunches all the numbers and comes up with a total score, which in this case is above 25,000 points. But let’s see how some of the competition ranks in the same benchmark test. What’s everyone’s go-to “phablet” nowadays, the Galaxy Note 2? Well, as it happens, the big guy running on Sammy’s awesome Exynos 4412 quad-core platform can only achieve scores of between 13,000 and 15,000 points in AnTuTu. Okay, maybe that’s not a fair comparison, as Lenovo’s 5.5-incher is due out in a few months, when the Note 2 will already be a dated “beast”. How about if we put the K900 head to head with HTC’s Droid DNA, the world’s first 1080p phone and one of the first to come rocking Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU? I’m afraid the DNA is not serious competition for Lenovo’s Intel-powered fellow either, also scoring in the 13,000-14,000 range. So, the K900 has theoretically almost double the speed of these two super-phones while having a processor with half the number of cores? It certainly appears so, though before getting too ahead of ourselves we have to note a couple of things. First off, we have no way to know if these benchmark results are legit. They are after all easy to manipulate or fabricate from scratch, so food for thought, okay? Also, in all fairness, the S4 Pro, like the Exynos 4412, is last year’s news. Hence, a much fairer duel would be that between this new SoC from Intel, Samsung’s 8-core processor, Nvidia’s Tegra 4 and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800, a comparison we aren’t able to perform just yet. Until we’ll do that though, it’s becoming more and more obvious that Intel is serious about Android and that ARM is in for a fight if it wants to keep its supremacy. Do you guys agree? Are you excited about Lenovo’s K900? Do you think the leaked benchmark results are real?</Msg><Username>rehsab33</Username><Timestamp>1357906104116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:08:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357909218162-13</Id><Topic><Title>First benchmark results of Intel-powered Lenovo K900 are off the charts!</Title><Username>rehsab33</Username><Timestamp>1357906104116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:08:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gsminsiderDOTcom/2013/01/lenovo-ideaphone-k900-benchmark-result.html</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357909218162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:00:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357910368214-14</Id><Topic><Title>One less Windows RT choice in US: So long Samsung Ativ Tab</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357887166453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:52:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope Samsung (with reference to RT cancellation) is the canary in the coal mine.

For the US that number was between 1.7 and 2.2%. • Electricity used in US data centers in 2010 was significantly lower than predicted by the EPA’s 2007 report to Congress on data centers. That result reflected this study’s reduced electricity growth rates compared to earlier estimates, which were driven mainly by a lower server installed base than was earlier predicted rather than the efficiency improvements anticipated in the report to Congress. • While Google is a high profile user of computer servers, less than 1% of electricity used by data centers worldwide was attributable to that company’s data center operations. In summary, the rapid rates of growth in data center electricity use that prevailed from 2000 to 2005 slowed significantly from 2005 to 2010, yielding total electricity use by data centers in 2010 of about 1.3% of all electricity use for the world, and 2% of all electricity use for the US.

The issues will hopefully disappear in the future as the Fab 8 in Malta, New York State is doing some test wafers at 20nm and 14nm. However, we were surprised to learn from AMD and people close to the matter that the company is making both of its 28nm Temash and Kabini APUs at TSMC. They are both expected in Q2 2013, probably around Computex time, or early June 2013. GlobalFoundries is expected to design some 20nm and 14nm for AMD and let’s hope that both AMD and GlobalFoundries will have better luck with 20nm products. We met several AMD executives at CES and they told us that with 32nm Richland, 28nm Temash and Kabini, things should start to look better for the company. Basically it looks like 2013 will be a much better year for AMD, which is not a surprise as it could hardly do worse than it did in 2012 and this is the general feeling of many AMD executives as well as some major partners.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1357917159605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:12:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357917383828-21</Id><Title>Intel Corporation (INTC) Expectations Low, Capabilities High: MKM</Title><Msg>Intel Corporation (INTC) Expectations Low, Capabilities High: MKM January 10, 2013 By Lennox Yieke .

The Y-Series Ivy Bridge range was formally released at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada this week. Intel claims that it offers power consumption of just seven watts - still much higher than competing microprocessors designed by ARM, but considerably more efficient than past Intel microprocessor lines. The current line of Ivy Bridge microprocessors consume 1#$%$ as measured in terms of actual thermal design power metrics, and Intel is claiming that its new Y-Series Ivy Bridge microprocessors has knocked 10 watts off this figure - implying that the company is fast catching up with ARM in terms of power consumption. However, while claiming clock speeds of up to 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) for its top-of-the-range Core i7 Ivy Bridge microprocessors, the lower power consumption can only be achieved by considerably stepping down the clock speeds of these parts and using a different metric. Its entry-level Pentium 2129Y microprocessor boasts a clock speed of just 1.1GHz and lacks hyper-threading and a "turbo mode". It can achieve power consumption of 10 watts in thermal design power, but #$%$ in Intel's new metric - "scenario design power", which Intel claims is a real-world measure of the average power the microprocessor will consume in ordinary usage. On a like-for-like basis, the Y-Series Ivy Bridge parts boast power consumption of 13 watts in thermal design power, just four watts more efficient than the current Ivy Bridge range. An in-depth examination by tech' site ArsTechnica concluded: "Intel has saved power in its new Y-series CPUs in the least surprising way possible - not through improvements to the 22 nanometre manufacturing process or aggressive processor binning, but through clock speed reductions and some fancy marketing footwork." Intel's claims are significant because it is facing growing pressure from mobile devices - both tablet computers and smartphones - while demand for desktop PCs and laptops is falling, according to figures for the fourth quarter of 2012. One of the driving forces behind the sale of tablet computers and smartphones is price, partly due to the use of non-wintel hardware and software. ARM-based microprocessors will typically sell for less than one-tenth of the average price of an Intel i-series microprocessor, while the Android operating system is free.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357917915398</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:25:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357917945840-23</Id><Topic><Title>Intel accused of misleading Ivy Bridge figures</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357917915398</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:25:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is 22nm just marketing hype?</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357917945840</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357917961527-24</Id><Title>East says?

It is Intel vs all the other companies who hate Intel) Clearly this and clearly that and we will do this and that and 50% marketshare and clearly. Of course, companies do not give a rat's about where they buy their chip as long as the chip makes money for them. Thus we see AMD in a slow but sure death spiral. Now about ARMH. Yes---a huge advantage it has. BUT--not where it counts. The advantage of being first is a huge advantage but it never ever holds up on its own. Yeah--where is your Netscape people? How about your Blackberry? That cassette player is great. Armh is only as good as its last product in comparison to the last Intel chip. As soon as Intel has a vastly superior chip, and it will soon, the 95% market share the blowhard from ARM is repeating will be laughable and gone. Stiff upper lip and all. Yeah sure, Intel is no threat and that must be why all you ARM fanboys are over on the Intel board posting endlessly.

IBM surprises with 22nm details at IEDM By #$%$ James Monday afternoon at the 2012 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting, IBM discussed their 22nm SOI high-performance technology [1], aimed at servers and high-end SoC products. To an extent, this is an extension of the 32nm process, using epitaxial SiGe for the PMOS channels and stress, and dual-stress liners for both NMOS and PMOS strain. However, there were a couple of surprises buried in there -- at least for me! The first surprise was that this is a gate-first process, contrary to the announcements made by the Common Platform group that the 20nm class processes would be gate-last. The difference seems to be that this technology IS aimed at high performance servers and their support devices, not consumer products, and this is IBM's process for its high-end products, so they are sticking with the proven formula and pushing it to the next level....</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357918041768</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:27:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357918303644-26</Id><Topic><Title>Intel accused of misleading Ivy Bridge figures</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357917915398</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:25:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you finally were able to dig this one up - LOL - what a loser you are</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357918303644</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:31:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357918688091-27</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe it's time to sell East short</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357916927324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:08:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will used for their Risc server processor Power 8.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357918688091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:38:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357918845043-28</Id><Topic><Title>Intel accused of misleading Ivy Bridge figures</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357917915398</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:25:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since Intel and ArsTechnica explains the power savings method in such detail, how is it misleading?

All Intel did was (it appears) to lower the MAXIMUM DYNAMIC FREQUENCY SCALING on the part. There may be some other testing or such but I doubt it. It is just a new Intel CPU SKU that is guaranteed to operate at 5W. It is pretty funny that the ARM advocates think this is such a big problem other than Intel has a CPU that can be operated within a 5W envelop. "Dynamic frequency scaling (also known as CPU throttling) is a technique in computer architecture whereby the frequency of a microprocessor can be automatically adjusted "on the fly," either to conserve power or to reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip. Dynamic frequency scaling is commonly used in laptops and other mobile devices, where energy comes from a battery and thus is limited. It is also used in quiet computing settings and to decrease energy and cooling costs for lightly loaded machines. Less heat output, in turn, allows the system cooling fans to be throttled down or turned off, reducing noise levels and further decreasing power consumption. It is also used for reducing heat in insufficiently cooled systems when the temperature reaches a certain threshold, such as in poorly cooled overclocked systems."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357923022010</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:50:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357923183679-49</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Kills RT Tablet Plans</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1357879006377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 23:36:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ubuntu does work well with Intel but Ubuntu has compromised its reputation with its commercial interests and Amazon relationship.

The 1.1 GHz Pentium 2129Y dual-core with no hyper-threading and half the cache is obviously the best yielding sku and would have been thrown away in the old days for being too slow but it's going to look #$%$ hot against ARM's best lol !

The seven watt Ivy Bridge part is a game changer. Samsung's killing off its ARM based RT product line signals the end of ARM for Windows devices. The Intel based smartphone by Lenovo is a major win. Intel is challenging ARM across every segment of its business including a low cost part for emerging markets. Intel continues to advance ultrabooks, convertibles and a range of new and exciting high performance long battery life portables that delivers full Windows compatibility. On the server front Intel continues to deny ARM a meaningful entry into the market. Intel also prepares to enter a new market with its video server device in conjunction with Comcast. The critical feature of this product is that any new Intel powered devices will be able to access premium content without having to have a separate cable decoder. This means consumers can also get their premium channels on their Intel ultrabooks, tablets, or smartphones. Once that video server goes into a house it makes a strong case to make all the other electronic devices Intel based. And then their is Haswell and all the new products scheduled for delivery the second half of the year.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1357935325279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:15:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357935889926-84</Id><Topic><Title>CES Success</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357932594611</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 14:29:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel was successful in convincing everyone that they are basically a buggy whip manufacturer with only super-skinny notebook computers in their stable and with no presence in mobile.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357935889926</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:24:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357936708065-85</Id><Topic><Title>Fudds Give Back 13 Percent</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357849118390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 15:18:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now 14.3 percent...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357936708065</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:38:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357936972765-86</Id><Title>$25.21 or higher</Title><Msg>Come to papa.</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1357936972765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:42:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357936979149-87</Id><Topic><Title>Fudds Give Back 13 Percent</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357849118390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 15:18:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pity Waldo didn't sell way up there at 29.00 plus, gave up, so far, over 7.00, more than 24 percent, far more than the bounce shortly to take it to oversold levels.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1357936979149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:42:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357937947717-88</Id><Topic><Title>GloFlo</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357934735018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:05:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read their news releases and quotes very closely.

A sure sign of desperation. 20nm shrinks are apparently the only sure things in Foundry World and that will give them 20% more performance or 20% lower power but at higher cost. 20% of anything is not going to suddenly transform a 4W 1.7 GHz A15 into a proper mobile processor, it will need a a proper 14nm FinFET process at least but probably more like 10nm FinFET. I can see these guys doing endless architectural tweaks and new steppings at 20nm to eke out improvements just like AMD does now. The 2.7 GHz Baytrail is going to lay some serious blows on the 1.7 GHz A15. For those of us who have followed the x86 wars over decades know how this story ends in the end (AMD going from $42 to $2 is one example) but this severe level of competition is all new to the ARM guys who are used to a monopoly and just trundling along at their own pace.

"We believe...detachables are fundamentally different," Adam King, Intel's director of notebook marketing, told Cnet, referring to laptop designs with displays which can be removed from the base to become standalone tablets. "The point of differentiation is that the processor is...behind the glass. Detachables we think of as a tablet first. Because when you take it out of the base, it better be a pretty good tablet or the user is going to be disappointed. If you're going behind the glass, you need the Y processor." He referred to Microsoft's forthcoming Surface Pro tablet as a good example of the kind of device suitable for a Y series chip. "Getting it behind the glass is more challenging because you want a thin design there and you've got all of the heat coming from the LCD so it's much more thermally challenging to put it behind glass (than under the keyboard)." King also described the new power rating for its Y chips, which he admitted required "more context". "TDP is designed to light up as much of the [chip] as possible. The reality is that 99.9 percent of users will never actually stress their system to that level. So there's actually a big margin of safety built into TDP." "For the devices that we're targeting, as they move to more content-consumption (tablet-use) workloads, it doesn't make sense anymore to just give guidance to our OEMs on that extreme-set-point TDP definition. SDP is a workload that represents a more mainstream workload. For the Y processor line we'll talk about SDP because that's really the primary design point that makes sense for the kind of devices that use those processors." SDP will now only be applied to Y series chips including future Haswell processors. TDP, meanwhile, will continue to be utilized more for U and M series processors that require more power.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357940250901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:37:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357940715826-95</Id><Topic><Title>GloFlo</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357934735018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:05:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GloFo calls it 14xm.

Rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) are watching closely, but other players in the market have a lot at stake too. Finnish giant Nokia (NYSE: NOK) and chip titan Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stand to gain tremendously if there is a shift in the current state of mobile. It all begins with the current subsidy-based model. For instance, every subsidized iPhone sold on contract by AT&amp;T costs the telecom company $450, one of the key factors in the contract-based structure. Without subsidies, pay as you go becomes a more attractive option and takes away a major cash outflow at the beginning of a contract cycle. In T-Mobile’s case, the company has announced it will soon carry Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) flagship device, the iPhone, but also intends to cut the two-year contract and with it, subsidized prices. The shift from subsidies comes with a $70 unlimited everything plan, which the company hopes will reverse the current exodus from their network. T-Mobile has struggled to compete with AT&amp;T and Verizon this year, primarily because they have fallen behind in the endless network upgrade cycle. The big question is whether Americans are willing to pay more for their phones upfront for a potentially cheaper, contract free experience. If T-Mobile’s move is well received, one could expect Verizon and AT&amp;T to quickly follow suit, which may affect the prices of smartphones. Currently price isn’t a major point of competition (in the US) for smartphones, however once subsidies are removed it could spark a price war. There is already some evidence that in the absence of subsidies cheaper phones prevail. For example, IDC predicts Android will continue holding the number one spot for mobile operating systems due partly to the availability of cheaper devices in developing countries. Given that these are also countries that do not typically subsidize smartphones, it does support the argument that price matters. This week Nokia announced better than expected sales of its Lumia line, a bright-spot in what has been a rough few years for the company. While a lot is being said about the sales volume, the more interesting factor is how aggressively priced Lumias were during the period in question. The flagship models were priced aggressively from the start, debuting at the $100 price mark usually reserved for last year’s model and during the holidays were also discounted heavily. The point is, as you would expect, price plays a role. Confirming this is IDC’s argument that Apple’s iOS will continue to lag behind Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android OS until Apple begins to offer a cheaper iPhone. The company has also seen increased penetration in areas where they’ve offered last year’s model at a discount. Interestingly, this week there was a report from Digitimes (quickly corroborated by WSJ and other news outlets) indicating Apple was indeed exploring a cheaper iPhone for emerging markets. While this is obviously a play designed to help expand their presence in emerging markets, a cheaper iPhone could also come into play stateside should subsidies vanish. It would give Apple another option and perhaps offset potential market share loss if consumers are forced to pay the full retail price. Intel, however, is taking the opposite route. Since the company has yet to gain mobile traction in the US, they’ve turned their focus to low-cost but powerful mobile chips to gain a foothold in emerging markets. As it stands, the chip-manufacturer has seven smartphones in the global market, all designed to be competitive but relatively low-cost. Should T-Mobile’s move to strike subsidies catch on, it may present an opportunity for Intel to finally grab a piece of the US mobile market. Additionally, given the company’s expertise in chip fabrication and overall scale, if smartphone manufacturers are forced to compete on price the company may also pick up new foundry customers. Ultimately the biggest winner could be Nokia. Until being dethroned by Korean giant Samsung, the company excelled at producing low-cost mobile phones that dominated the global market. The company missed the shift to smartphones, but still has the expertise to compete, particularly if there is a shift to lower cost smartphones. As pointed out above the company has already demonstrated a willingness to compete on price and has a significant amount of experience as a low-cost producer. Also worth noting is though they are currently tied to Microsoft and its operating system, at CES they announced an openness to other opportunities in the future. A shift in the smartphone market that moves towards Nokia’s strengths could be what helps the company finally get back on solid footing. Regardless of how things play out in the near term, two things are certain: Subsidies will eventually disappear and the mobile landscape will change in response. When the changes do come, companies prepared to compete on price will likely be the victors and are worth keeping an eye on.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1357950470539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 19:27:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357951369669-113</Id><Title>Intel's Goliath dominates David (RT, etc) at CES</Title><Msg>Intel’s Goliath dominates David at CESBy Matt Smith Don’t let Intel’s comparatively quiet CES fool you, it was still one of the biggest winners of the show. There are few narratives tech journalists love more than a good David-and-Goliath story. Many of today’s most important technologies and companies were born from humble beginnings before growing into the giants we know today. The Internet was the baby of dedicated researches, Apple grew out of a garage, and Google was founded by a pair of graduate students. Technology wouldn’t be where it is today without the power of new technology that seems to spring from nowhere to overthrow the existing establishment. But sometimes Goliath is too smart to kill with a slingshot. Such is the case with Intel. Though lacking major announcements, the world’s largest chip manufacturer looks as buff and clever as ever. The last half-decade has thrown two problems at Intel. First, the company was caught by the rise of mobile with its pants down and had nothing to offer while that market took off. Second, the company’s traditional market has stalled and prices have dropped. Both issues are dire – failing to address either could cause Intel to enter a death spiral. Yet it hasn’t. Though the company’s 2012 earnings failed to exceed its record-setting 2011 figures, the company continues to turn a strong profit with one of the best gross margins in the industry. Intel’s products in the PC market solidly defeat those from AMD on nearly every level, sales of high-margin ultrabooks are slowly but steadily increasing, and the company’s fabs remain the most advanced in the world. Influence is one reason for Intel’s resilience. Amid its CES 2013 announcements the company slipped in a bomb – ultrabooks based on Intel’s 4th generation processors will require touch and Intel Wireless Display. The company tried last year to wrestle power from hardware manufactures with the ultrabook, but no one was sure if the OEMs would roll over. They have. Companies like Acer and Toshiba happily informed us that they plan to add touch to all thin-and-light laptops to make sure they qualify for the ultrabook label. That is a big win for Intel. If the company can decide what features exist in consumer laptops, it also can make sure those features help the company’s bottom line. OEMs can be nudged towards extras that require or run best on Intel hardware. The company will have to worry less about the pace of innovation because it can dictate what innovation will be. Intel’s incredible ability to engineer new architectures has also helped to keep the company strong. Though initially slow to react to the mobile revolution, the company has responded with blistering speed. Last year’s CES saw the introduction of an x86 reference platform for mobile, which successfully attracted a number of hardware partners throughout 2012. Intel has reinforced that endeavor with a road-map that includes two product lines aimed directly at smartphones and tablets. That’s only one fork of Intel’s attack. The other comes from the traditional Core products that have successfully dropped to a power envelop of 13 watts (Intel claimed #$%$ but the company also changed its measurement metric). We’ll likely see a further reduction in power with the release of Haswell later this year. If you’re unconvinced by specifications, take a look at the products. Lenovo’s ThinkPad Helix, which is powered by a Core i5 or i7 processor, weighs 1.8 pounds in tablet mode. Other detachable ultrabooks are similarly light. Products like this will compel consumers to ask why they should buy an ARM tablet if their Windows convertible can fill the same role. Perhaps the best evidence in favor of Intel’s strength in mobile is Windows RT’s no-show at CES. We expected to see a fair number of devices with the new operating system. Instead there was deafening silence. Hardware OEMs repeatedly boasted that their tablets run “full Windows” rather than the stripped-down RT. New technology can create a wave of creative destruction. That wave is unstoppable – but it can be delayed or channeled. Intel has successfully leveraged its influence over the last year to keep its mainstream computing products relevant while the company invests in technology for the mobile market. Should Intel manage to also become a significant force in mobile, well, that’s game over. No competitor has the resources necessary to compete with Intel’s blistering product cadence once it has established a foothold. CES 2013 demonstrated that Intel remains influential and is making major advancements in its only area of weakness. Don’t let the lack of a headline-grabbing new architecture full you. This was a strong show for the company, and the year will likely follow suite.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1357951369669</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 19:42:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357953106118-114</Id><Topic><Title>Everyone will follow Samsung and dump Windows RT now.

The giant chip maker dominates the PC and server markets, but is now trying to push its way into a mobile market dominated by chips designed by ARM and sold by partners such as Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics and Nvidia. At CES—where those ARM partners as well as x86 rival Advanced Micro Devices also made news—Intel showed off upcoming low-power Atom platforms and plans to make inroads into the value smartphone business in emerging markets. It also showed off more Atom systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for tablets, new and forthcoming Core chips for tablets, and convertible systems that consume as little as #$%$ and fourth-generation Core processors—formerly dubbed "Haswell"—for Ultrabooks. The chips all promise greater performance and power efficiency, both critical factors in the smartphone and tablet markets. "The best of Intel is coming to a mobile device near you," said Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of Intel's PC Client Group. During their press conference Jan. 7, Intel officials also demonstrated some upcoming capabilities tied to the company's Perceptual Computing initiative, designed to enable computers to more readily recognize faces and understand human gestures.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1357957036514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 21:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357957130631-122</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH new 52-week high today AGAIN !!!</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357948456120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 18:54:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who buys at that level. you? just remember intel plans to flood the market with cheap chips at all levels by next year.</Msg><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1357957130631</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 21:18:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357957796585-123</Id><Title>Wallis: RE: shorting ARMH</Title><Msg>Did you specifically look into any good short plays on ARMH?
