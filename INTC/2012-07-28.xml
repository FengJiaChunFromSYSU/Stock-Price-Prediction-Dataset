Whatever new innovations come out in the flagship phones of Apple are soon available on Android at commodity price points. Over time, you would expect smart-phone volumes to grow exponentially and their features sets to be driven more by full-featured reference designs than cutting edge flagships. In such a scenario, Intel, with its eye-popping lead in manufacturing, is bound to supply most of the silicon.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1343451305000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 00:55:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343452572000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel presents new smart-phone chips, partnership with ZTE</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343412055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree but disappointed that we are still a half year away from this stock appreciating, and that is only if global conditions improve.

What would have been wrong with a RISC variant added and kept separate from the x86 side. Mips could have been picked up for a buck .09 a share in 2009 and 4 bucks in fall of 2011.

Intel shrinks along with tri-gate, will crush Arm. Apple, samsung, and the other phone makers have NO loyalty to any chip or company. They simply want to stay on top of the food chain in order to make profits. To do that, they will always choose the best performing chips for their smart phones and that will very soon clearly be Intel chips. Your talk about all standing against Intel is comical. It is the same thing that we heard from AMD fanboys in the past. AMDers would say virtual gorilla. Everyone against Intel was the yell from AMD. But of course, when Intel crushed AMD in the performance area all those companies dumped on AMD and went to Intel. After all, the consumer buys the products and in the end, they are the boss. Intel will be so so far ahead in performance soon, that it will make Arm based chips irrelevant. All major players will either jump to Intel chips in their smart phones or be crushed in that smart phone market by competitors. Just the way it is. Arm is a fantastic short by the way.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343488091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343488878000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Intel presents new smart-phone chips, partnership with ZTE</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343412055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uh... yeah.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1343488878000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:21:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343489036000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Intel presents new smart-phone chips, partnership with ZTE</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1343412055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt; Hmmm... what if Microsoft had picked a different CPU instead of x86... &lt; What's your point?

This from the British press...] [I don't know that calling Britain "a second-rate, semi-degenerate nation" (just because they didn't want their Olympic games trashed) a wining election year strategy...] But this is not just personal. Romney stumbled in London because he has little apparent interest in the world beyond America's shores. This week he gave his first major foreign policy speech in nine months. Unlike both Obama and John McCain in 2008, his campaign has no senior foreign policy staffer. He had a spokesman on international affairs who left after just two weeks, reportedly because he was not allowed to talk to the media. When Romney has offered a view, it has been either confused, undiplomatic or both. Witness his branding of Russia – whose co-operation the US needs – as the US's "No 1 geopolitical foe". In this, Romney is fully in step with the party he now leads. For today's Republican party is characterised by a kind of bellicose ignorance towards the rest of the world, contemptuous of Obama's attempts to show respect to foreigners, crudely aggressive towards those deemed the US's enemies, uninterested in its friends. Take the response of Romney's allies to the London debacle, his surrogates professing that "we're not worried about overseas headlines", while one media cheerleader dismissed Cameron as "limp-wristed" and Britain as "a second-rate, semi-degenerate nation". This, remember, is the party that slammed John Kerry for the crime of speaking French. Its antics, like those of the man it has chosen for the presidency, would be funny were the Republican party not aspiring to hold an office that is still mighty and, for the rest of the world, deadly serious. http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/britain-easy-date-mitt-romney-mess</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343501130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 14:45:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343501312000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Deadly Serious</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343501130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 14:45:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another political post from a hypocrite (typical Liberal trait) that said there was no place for Politics on this board.

Many of the fundraisers, a group of top Romney supporters that includes casino executive Sheldon Adelson, traveled from the U.S. to join the campaign for tomorrow’s event at the King David Hotel. The price to attend: A donation of $50,000 or having raised $100,000 for the campaign, according to an invitation obtained by Bloomberg News. Previously, the Romney campaign had agreed to let the media into all fundraising events at public venues. In Israel, the campaign plans to bar the press, aide Rick Gorka said. President Barack Obama allows reporter coverage of his fundraisers at public venues. At events in private homes, a pool of reporters can listen to his opening remarks before they are ushered out. Romney has been overheard by reporters making political statements to donors in private that he doesn’t repeat in public.

A report out of China's First Financial Daily indicates that Apple will delay the iPhone 5 because of a shortage of 28 nanometer chips.

Its heavy demand for components often drive suppliers to operate at full capacity. Partners must meet Apple's tough demands or risk losing a major buyer; its production chain consists of 156 companies. This means any single supplier that fails to pull its weight can undermine the entire production chain, said the daily. The shortage of high-end chips could affect the supply of smartphones produced by Chinese brands Xiaomi and 360, as they also rely on Qualcomm for 28nm chips. The postponement of the iPhone 5 launch will give Apple's lead rivals — HTC and Samsung — a much-needed reprieve, as their phones won't have to compete with the iPhone 5 head-on. http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120726000117&amp;cid=1206&amp;MainCatID=12</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1343514413000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 18:26:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343514584000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Apple iPhone 5 delay, chip worries surface (again)</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1343514226000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 18:23:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If this is true, Apple is hurting.
