I have one desktop on XP and my new desktop in Win 7. I purposely avoided Win 8 because it was new and a new OS is not something I want to deal with. My XP machine is still great for internet and word processing. Personally, I plan to have a 3 screens. A desktop for real work and games, a tablet for couch-based reading (new/books), and a phone. How is 3 screens powered by INTC worse than buying 1, even if "margins will be cannibalized." February next year, I plan to have a Win 8 tablet and phone. The Apple ecosystem is too restrictive for me, I have an iPhone. And with WiDi, my TV becomes screen #4. The analysts need to start counting screens, not traditional computers. Three screens is better than one.

In a recent Google infomercial (also known as the movie The Internship), the main characters, played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, lose their jobs as wristwatch salesmen because “everything is computerized now.” In desperation, they do the only logical thing, which is to try out for Google internships. That idea was as unlikely to succeed as it was unrealistic. (The only less realistic thing about the movie was its depiction of a Google phone tech support help line.) Instead, our bumbling heroes should have stuck it out in the wristwatch racket, because watches are about to come back in a major way. And, yes, everything is computerized now. But the wristwatch is doomed, right? After all, nobody wears watches anymore. Who in their right mind would sell a wristwatch that connects to the Internet, providing the user with notifications, incoming chat and social messages and possibly runs apps? Nobody, really, except for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, Samsung, LG and at least a dozen international startups.

The conventional impulse has been for everyone to wait for rumored or announced smartwatches from the tech giants. Yes, the rumors and accompanying factoids (such as patents) are plausible. Intel’s CTO Justin Rattner said this week that Intel is working on “novel display devices” that live on your wristand feed you smartphone information. Rumors persist that Intel could be working with Apple on their rumored iWatch. Google’s Android group is reportedly working on a smartwatch, presumably one that takes advantage of service infrastructure from the company’s Glass project. Samsung executive VP Lee Young Hee confirmed in March that the company is “working very hard” to produce a smartwatch. The Korea Times reported in March that tech giant LG is also working on a smartwatch, as well as a competitor to Google Glass. Another report emerging in April says that former Microsoft Xbox and Kinect team members had already built a prototype Microsoft smartwatchthat connects to the company’s Surface tablet. If the idea of a Microsoft smartwatch sounds unlikely, you should know that Microsoft pioneered the concept back in the 1990s. I personally owned a Timex Datalink watch, co-developed by Microsoft, which magically synchronized with a PC when you held it up to the screen and ran the sync app. Flashing on-screen lights transmitted the data. So, yes, it appears likely that pretty much every major company that makes consumer electronics is working furiously on the development of a smartwatch. But the world isn’t waiting. Sony doesn’t just have a rumored or announced smartwatch, they’ve already shipped one, open-sourced it and announced a second version.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372307429160</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 00:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372307597597-5</Id><Topic><Title>The Smartwatch Revolution Isn't Waiting</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372307357406</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 00:29:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you were thinking that the smartphone revolution isn’t going to happen, this column should change your opinion.

If you look at the past 12 months, several substantial things have changed. The short interest in Intel is at near record highs. Intel is buying back shares and reducing the share float. That means that 1 share buys more of the company. Intel has just introduced a new product line (Haswell) that has market disrupting low power, high performance. Intel has just introduced a family of 60-core CPUs (PHI) that are the foundation of the HPC supercomputer market.

If they have they would be all over the street. #2. 20nm is a talking point right now, though it's been taped out as you have said there have been no leaked benchmarks.

It must be at least a good two years away if not longer before a functioning prototype is ready. I know TSMC must be putting on it's best gameface, letting people know that 20nm is almost here and 16nm is next year. As far as having the right product (14nm finfet) right now (or the soonest possible) at the right price that will be Intel. Welcome to the new era of the semiconductor industry where empty promises and vaporware don't go as far as they did two years ago.

During Antoine Leblond’s developer address during the keynote (around the 48 minute mark), he used a Surface Pro machine to preview new Visual Studio development tools on power consumption. At face value, this information isn’t particularly shocking. However, when he revealed a demo app’s power consumption, Visual Studio claimed that the app would last 9.17 hours (that’s 9 hours and 10 minutes) on battery- a feat that the current Surface Pro would definitely not be able to achieve with current estimates. Though battery estimates have never been an exact science, this number is definitely out of the realm of possibility for the Surface Pro, which can at most last for a paltry 4 hours. The Surface RT, despite stellar battery life, is definitely not equipped to run Visual Studio. This estimate leads me to believe that Microsoft just teased the new Surface Pro with Haswell, right in plain sight. I’ll update this post accordingly should I receive anymore information.

It uses 18 million per day. But by 2020 it will produce between 13 and 15 million per day and use 11 million per day. Thus America will become an oil exporter and then take into account Canada and Mexico and North America will supply huge exports to the North American economy. What? You do not care about Canada and Mexico? Well you should because they are number 1 and 2 as buyers of American exports and when they are richer--they buy more. 3) Dow likely to ride this good news much much higher to 20,000 or more by 2020. 4) Two extraordinarily expensive and stupid wars are coming to an end and America will save huge amounts on military spending and come very close to balancing the budget in a given year by 2018.

That would be a 40-year high for the U.S. and just below Saudi Arabia's output of 11.6 million barrels.

Sue, who also has an Outperform rating on shares of Intel, and a $29 price target, sees the chip giant’s newest, and forthcoming, Atom chips for mobile devices finally “ready for prime time” as the company makes gains in power efficiency after losing out for years to Qualcomm and other chip makers using rival designs from ARM Holdings (ARMH). “The myth of ARM’s power advantage may dissolve quickly, perhaps even before Intel pushes Atom to leading edge,” writes Sue: Expect Intel’s Atom-based mobile processors to become increasingly adopted in the marketplace, driven by improving performance/power dynamics, and ahead of upcoming Silvermont (22nm tri-gate, late 2013) and Airmont (14nm, 2014) launches with LTE enablement. Intel’s win with Saltwell’s Clover Trail+ (32nm) on Samsung [Electronics's (005930KS) 10" Galaxy Tab 3 affirms the strides in mobile that the company has made [...] Intel believes that its dual-core Silvermont offers between 1.4x and 2.1x the performance at 1.6x to 3.1x lower power vs. select quad-core ARM solutions. We await third-party performance reviews in order to have more conviction on the metrics Intel has presented. Nevertheless, the significant improvements in power and performance should allow Intel to become increasingly competitive in the mobile ecosystem. Intel’s Silvermont joins ARM’s Cortex A15 in terms of delivering out-of-order execution. The impact for Intel is some loss of notebook revenue, as that market cools, but ultimately growth in Intel’s combined notebook and tablet/smartphone revenue: The Semis team’s analysis suggests that Intel’s combined notebook (performance processors) and smartphone/tablet (Ato</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1372360050069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 15:07:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372360065705-96</Id><Topic><Title>Best way to make a woman happy?</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1372352961991</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:09:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does your kid know that you're a shady stock pumper and an angry Liberal?

WinTel is going to be ramping up...] Upcoming Intel processors are expected to become popular in mobile devices and more than offset a decline in notebook chip sales, RBC Capital analyst Mark Sue said in a research report Thursday. Sue said the improved performance and power dynamics of new versions of Intel's Atom line of processors should help it increase its market share in the mobile market. An indication of that is the recent win with Samsung, which is using Intel's Clover Trail chip in a version of its Galaxy Tab 3, as IBD reported. RBC expects sales of Atom chips in the mobile category to jump to $3.7 billion in 2016, from just $380 million this year. Intel plans to ship a newer version of its Atom processor, the Silvermont, in late 2013, followed by Airmont in 2014. Intel will gain in the market where Qualcomm (QCOM) and licensees of ARM Holdings (ARMH) have dominated. "The market is growing and there are ample opportunities for Qualcomm to gain an incremental footprint," Sue said. Qualcomm customers include most all of the major smartphone makers, including Samsung and Apple (AAPL). Besides that, Qualcomm has a royalty business on its mobile technologies that provides about 75% of its earnings. "Customers typically want choice when it comes to smartphones and tablet computers, and it was inevitable that Intel and others would get some design wins," wrote Sue. Smartphone sales are expected to rise 26% this year to 870 million units worldwide. That pace is expected to slow as the smartphone market becomes increasingly saturated, but there will still be opportunities for Intel, the report said. The increased commoditization of the mobile market "allows inroads for Intel, as they benefit from growth in mainstream product categories where price and performance are required to win," Sue wrote.

On Silvermont, Haswell, Computex, Mac upgrades, product releases and the Samsung deal. This will likely translate into larger orders and shipments. And probably already has. I would expect an increase in guidance as the second half of the year is looking much better now with back-to-school and holiday sales. With 14nm FinFET production a mere six months away I would expect it to start to affect the equation even for the nimrods on Wall Street. I expect a moderate beat and improved guidance. The newest dynamic is on the Microsoft front. We can expect better than anticipated growth in Windows 8/8.1 adoption. Two factors will be of major import: 1.) Dual boot. This is going to be a huge driver going forward, allowing Android applications to supplement full Windows capabilities. 2.) The XP upgrade wave. This wave will really ramp up in the next six months. The tablet news is going to be solid and improving. Better performance and longer battery life. A vast array of form factors. It's already fun, exciting and entertaining and it's going to consistently get better over the next year. Intel is going to be a major force in tablets. The economic recover is definitely going to help. Things continue to improve. This earnings call should confirm what we already know.

INTC could well be far below 19 in 3 years, or it could be at 40.00.
