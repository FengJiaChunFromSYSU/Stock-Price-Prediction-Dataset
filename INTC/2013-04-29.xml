Conveniently, while Cook offered a little hint about Apple's product roadmap, he may have left out one important detail. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is as tied in with the Apple supply chain as anyone, says Apple may update its MacBook computers at its Worldwide Developer Conference event in June. Kuo previously didn't expect a refresh at the event, and given Cook's comments on the earnings call it didn't seem like Apple would be offering anything new until the September/October timeframe. Yet in the research note, Kuo said the new MacBooks will get Intel's (INTC_) Haswell processors, which should give them better battery life as well as a performance boost. Kuo also noted that Apple may be announcing a lower-cost iPad mini to compete with cheap Android tablets, with the price in the $199 to $249 range.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1367241925820</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:25:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367242689523-4</Id><Topic><Title>Galaxy S4 on Geekbench (Exynos 5 Octa)</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1367092100198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:48:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Geekbench INTEGER tests are heavily weighted (75%) to compression/decompress and encryption/decryption codes.

Seymore writes that Intel has about 90% share of Windows-based tablets, versus chips based on ARM Holdings (ARMH) technology. Of course, the vast majority of overall tablet shipments are from Apple (AAPL) and vendors using Google‘s (GOOG) Android operating system, which all use ARM-based chips. blogsDOTbarronsDOTcom/techtraderdaily/2013/04/29/this-morning-iphone-speculation-monday-intel-in-tablets-q10-good-vibes/?mod=yahoobarrons</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1367247537492</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:58:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367248736195-15</Id><Topic><Title>Time to sell off</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1367245228543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:20:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is going higher.

Spreadsheet driven analysts and most journalist simply don't have the technical wherewithal to understand how Intel's advantages gives it the ability to come from behind and ultimately dominate the most profitable segments of mobile. The cues the finance folks understand haven't yet arrived. They will join the party after several quarters of double digit growth in mobile and they'll think there were prescient for doing it. So look at it this way, your EE, Math or physical sciences degree gave you over a year advantage in technology investing. Oh one clarification. Intel is not a "monopoly". For legal &amp; regulatory purposes they are considered to have "dominant market share".

But ARM is the standard processor for mobile. Why should the mobile world switch to a different standard processor? Only if Intel produces mobile SoCs so stunningly superior in performance to ARM-based SoCs that the mobile world thinks its worth making the effort to switch. Which Intel can't. And even if Intel could, would the mobile world want to adopt a sole-sourced standard processor? A wise man once said: "You only get one chance to screw the industry."

What any veteran of the semi industry should know is that vendors look for a competitive edge wherever they can get it. The advantage products like Haswell gives vendors isn't just superior speed and battery life compared to anything ARM makes, it's also the ability to run every OS and give the consumer and business customer access to whatever software ecosystem they want, when they want. Intel doesn't want 100% of the mobile industry, it only wants the most profitable segments.

Overall tablet shipments are likely to be relatively flat q/q (iOS down sharply) which implies significant market share gains for Intel [...] Intel now offers a complete line of SoCs to address both the Win8 and Android markets and product competitiveness will continue to improve as the company brings new SoCs and basebands to market 2H13. Baytrail (2H13) should be a compelling product as it uniquely offers support for both Android and Win8 enabling tablet OEMs to simplify their platform designs and hit price points as low as $200. We note Intel had essentially no presence in tablets in 2012 and therefore any presence in 2013/14 yields share gains and a revenue generator to at least partially offset weakness in the traditional PC market. We continue to believe INTC’s ability to profitability address these next-generation computing form factors (tablets, convertibles etc) is underestimated by investors.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1367265216171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 15:53:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367265458166-104</Id><Topic><Title>Gay Flumoxed aliases</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1367264549961</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 15:42:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Give me your address and I'll mail you a loaf in a shoe box.

Yes--Kenny sucked most of the time but that time he hit one out of the park. So Intel sucked for 13 years now. That is an undeniable fact. OK--not sucked if you consider the Div but it has been below good for sure. But now---oh now--it is in the first inning of one great game which will see all the Intel fans forgive it.

And yet, both Intel and AMD reported “March quarter sales that were close to original guidance,” he writes, and “both guided to sequential sales growth in the June quarter,” with 2.5% growth projected by Intel, and 2% projected by AMD. Wong thinks some of the drop in PC market estimates can be explained by the demise of the Netbook computers of yore, a view that has been offered by IDC and Gartner themselves, at times. He points to a 7% decline in Intel’s client computing segment last quarter, but a 5% rise in average selling prices, given the lower prices on Netbooks. Wong thinks investors hold too dim a view of traditional personal computing, and of Intel’s chips: In our view, the investment community is appropriately excited about the tremendous explosion computing that is sweeping the globe. However, we think that many investors incorrectly conclude that the growth potential associated with this is limited to smartphones and tablets, driven by ARM-based processors. Consumers and businesses are increasingly connected electronically, and this is facilitated by a broad range of computing devices, including smartphones, tablets, notebooks, desktops, and servers. Hardware and software improvements are enabling fully fledged notebooks to approach tablets in turn-on time, battery life, and weight, while offering substantially more capability.

Covello As a general securities representative with Tullett Liberty Securities, Inc. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 15A(g)(2) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ORDER APPROVING APPLICATION FOR RELIEF FROM A STATUTORY DISQUALIFICATION Daniel V. Covello is subject to a statutory disqualification as the result of an Order Instituting Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions ("Bar Order") dated April 5, 1984, in which he was barred from being associated with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or investment company, with the proviso that after 12 months, he could reapply for association with the appropriate self-regulatory organization.1 On the same day, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Mr. Covello had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and permanently enjoined Mr. Covello from violating Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 of the Exchange Act. Also, this same court convicted Mr. Covello of one count of conspiracy and of one count of charging violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The bar stemmed from Mr. Covello's activities in 1981 and 1982. According to the Bar Order, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") found that Mr. Covello violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by trading while in the possession of material non-public information and knowing or having reason to know or acting in reckless disregard of the fact that the information had been obtained through misappropriation, by a breach of fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or through other wrongful acts. In August 1985, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., ("NYSE") filed a Rule 19h-1 notice about the proposed association of Mr. Covello as a bond trader and special limited partner with Mabon Nugent &amp; #$%$ September 13, 1985, the Commission issued an Order ("1985 Order of Approval") consenting to this proposed association. In April 1986, the NYSE filed another notice to approve Mr. Covello as an Allied Member of the NYSE and a general partner of the same firm. On May 27, 1986, the Commission approved that notice. In January 1992, the NYSE filed a notification approving Mr. Covello's association as a general securities representative, bond trader, and special limited partner, again with the same firm. On February 21, 1992, the Commission acknowledged this notification. In April 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") filed a notification with the Commission approving Mr. Covello to become associated with Patriot Securities, L.P. ("Patriot"), as a general securities representative. Patriot is the predecessor to Tullett Liberty Securities, Inc. ("Tullett"). NASD now proposes to continue Mr. Covello's association as a general securities representative with Tullett, but with less frequent supervision then the 1985 Order of Approval. Under this proposal, Mr. Covello will continue to work out of Tullett's home office as a broker of corporate debt securities. Mr. Covello will be compensated with an annual salary plus a quarterly discretionary bonus. NASD has filed an application pursuant to Rule 19h-1 under the Exchange Act on behalf of Mr. Covello seeking an order declaring that, notwithstanding the statutory disqualification, the Commission: 1.Will not institute proceedings pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4), 15(b)(6), 19(h)(2), or 19(h)(3) of the Exchange Act solely on the basis of Mr. Covello's position as a general securities representative at Tullett; and 2.Will not direct NASD to bar the proposed association, as provided in Section 15A(g)(2) of the Exchange Act. In its application, NASD made numerous representations regarding Mr. Covello's proposed association, including the following: 1.Mr. Covello has been in compliance with the terms of his 1985 Order of Approval since it was entered. 2.Tullett's predecessor became a member of NASD in April 1991. Tullett acts as an interdealer broker of corporate debt, US Government securities, mortgage-backed securities, and emerging-market debt. Tullett does not trade as a proprietary trader. Tullett's main office is in New York, New York. 3.Tullett proposes to continue to employ Mr. Covello as a general securities representative, but with less frequent supervision than the 1985 Order of Approval. Under the NASD proposal, Mr. Covello will continue to work out of Tullett's home office as a broker of corporate debt securities. Specifically, Mr. Covello's activities will be limited to the brokering of fixed income transactions with institutional clients in which Tullett is acting in its capacity as an interdealer broker. Mr. Covello will be compensated with an annual salary plus a quarterly discretionary bonus. 4.Mr. Charles Watson will be the primary, responsible supervisor for Mr. Covello. Mr. Watson has been in the securities industry since 1975 and has been a general securities principal since 1995. Mr. Watson has been a desk head at Tullett since 1996. Currently, Mr. Watson is Mr. Covello's desk head. Mr. Watson has no disciplinary or regulatory history. 5.Mr. Watson will perform a quarterly review of Mr. Covello's overall business activities. 6.Mr. Watson will perform a quarterly review of Mr. Covello's trading activity. This review will be evidenced by Mr. Watson initialing a quarterly activity report. 7.Mr. Watson will perform a quarterly review of Mr. Covello's commission runs. 8.Mr. Watson will perform a quarterly compliance review of Mr. Covello for compliance with regulatory procedures and Tullett policies. 9.Mr. Covello will have no supervisory duties. 10.Any personal accounts held by Mr. Covello or any of his immediate family members will be subject to a monthly compliance review. Copies of confirmations and statements generated by those brokerage accounts will be sent directly to Tullett. 11.Mr. Covello will work out of the same office as Mr. Watson, at the same trading desk. 12.Tullett represents that, in addition to this above-mentioned quarterly review, Mr. Covello's activities will also be subject to a daily review as part of Tullett's supervision of its corporate bond business. The daily record of the trading activity of the desk where Mr. Covello will be working indicates the brokers involved in each transaction; each broker's activity can be readily identified and reviewed accordingly. The record of the daily trading activity for Mr. Covello's desk is in the form of a blotter consisting of all trades done for the day by the broker on the desk. All details of each transaction are contained in the blotter. Each trade on the blotter denotes whether a buy or sell, amount, price, security, cusip, trade date, settlement date, commission, counterparty, and the broker handling the trade. The daily review is evidenced by Mr. Watson initialing a daily compliance worksheet. Mr. Watson does not initial each trade by trade but rather initials the daily compliance worksheet. 13.Apart from the disqualifying events, Mr. Covello has had no other disciplinary problems either before or after those events. 14.Mr. Covello meets all applicable requirements for the proposed employment. The Commission staff, in the exercise of delegated authority (17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(4)), has reviewed the instant application and the record before NASD and, relying on the representations made by Tullett with respect to the supervision of Mr. Covello and the conditions placed on his employment,2 has concluded that it is appropriate for the Commission to approve the application for Mr. Covello's association with Tullett as a general securities representative. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that said application of NASD on behalf of Mr. Covello be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1367275890190</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:51:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367275928606-131</Id><Topic><Title>JAMES CAVELLO IS RIGHT</Title><Username>philip_914</Username><Timestamp>1367275383889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:43:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His price targets have been wrong for years, you get all you deserve for listening to him and any of the Vampire Squid employees who clearly are not working for you but themselves only.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1367275928606</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367277250766-132</Id><Topic><Title>The after market big volume trades</Title><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1367269615677</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 17:06:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somebody is sopping up a boat load of excess cheap shares.

Their first FinFET processes won’t reach volume production until 2015, three years after Intel’s FinFETs made their revolutionary debut. Second, the foundries’ FinFETs will first appear in “14nm” or “16nm” processes that essentially add the three-dimensional transistors to previous-generation 20nm technology, achieving worthwhile gains in speed and power but relatively little improvement in logic density. And third, lithography costs are expected to jump dramatically after the 28nm node, potentially deterring many chip companies from moving beyond 28nm for quite a while. Adds Halfhill, chip tools are running into their own obstacles that will hamper the move forward: Furthermore, potential breakthrough technologies that the industry has eagerly anticipated for several years—such as extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and carbon nanotubes—are still far beyond the reach of today’s chip designers. Even if a new design’s release date is five years out, designers must settle for relatively conventional fabrication technology. Consequently, today’s 28nm processes will probably be longer-lived than previous generations. And chip designers will feel more pressure to extract performance from architectural innovations instead of relying on the heretofore steady accruals of Moore’s Law.

There was Deutsche Bank‘s Ross Seymore writing about the probable rise in the company’s share of tablet computer microprocessors; and there was Wells Fargo‘s David Wong writing that investors don’t fully understand the promise in Intel’s broad line of chips. And from venerable technology newsletter Microprocessor Report, come two intriguing technical articles today discussing some of the technology advantages of the chip giant. The first article is by the Report’s Jag Bolaria, who notes that Intel has become more aggressive with low-power chips for so-called “micro-servers” in order to compete with forthcoming designs from licensees of ARM Holdings‘s (ARMH) instruction set architecture. New chips built on the “Haswell” design, such as the “E3-1200,” can cut the “thermal design power” of server operations by as much as 25%, writes Bolaria, “to a new low of 13 watts.” In addition, there will be new versions of low-power chips based on Intel’s “Atom” family, including “Briarwood,” that follows on the previous “Centerton,” with more capabilities for PCIe and RAID systems, and “Avoton,” a successor to Centerton, which will be built in the next process technology, at 22-nanometer, using the “Silvermount” microarchitecture. There’s also something called “Rangeley” that will be an embedded processor similar to Avoton, but focused on things such as network routers. Bolaria offers that Intel has a lead on competitors such as Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but winners will to some extent be determined by what system builders such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) decide to do: Avoton is about one quarter ahead of AppliedMicro’s X-Gene and a year ahead of AMD’s ARM-based server processor. Calxeda is shipping ARM server processors today, but they use 32-bit CPUs, whereas most server customers specify 64 bits.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367279768711</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 19:56:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367279857130-138</Id><Title>Intel set to wow Computex Taipei attendees</Title><Msg>Intel is set to reveal its fourth-generation core processor at the Computex Taipei conference in June. The Haswell processor is expected to offer advances in graphics performance, but that’s not its most anticipated feature. Haswell is primarily about better battery life.

About 90% contain Intel chips. Intel also says that in Q2, tablet sales using Intel chips will double. So close to about 6 million tablets could be sold using Intel chips, most of which for now will be with Windows 8 OS. How good are these numbers for Windows, most of which are using Intel chips? Looking at Windows alone, we are looking at about 3 million units in Q1. Let's look at Apple's iPad numbers in its 1st quarter of release. There was huge excitement at that time and Apple's iPad had hardly any competition. Their sales at that time were 3.27 million units. During their second quarter of release, they sold about 4.19 million units. That's about 28% growth sequentially. But Intel is talking about doubling sales sequentially. And, this time, Intel and Microsoft have plenty of competition from ARM and Google respectively. So it looks like, even with the greater challenges in competition, the Wintel growth numbers look much better than the great Apple iPad. Alot better! Yet the Bay Trail Atom processor is not even out yet. For Intel it looks even better since they work with Google as well.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1367280733685</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:12:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367281555408-140</Id><Title>Android Authority: Asus and Acer are launching new Chromebooks in the second half of 2013</Title><Msg>According to the rumors, 2013 is the year Google focuses on the desktop. Although Chrome OS has been chugging along mildly, it has yet to set the world on fire.

The publication also says that Google will be ramping up its advertising for Chrome OS at the same time. Acer has already made a Chromebook, one that proved so popular that at one time it accounted for 5-10% of Acer’s American computer shipments. However, it appears that interest died down soon after, prompting Acer to reconsider its support of Chrome OS: Now however, Acer has changed its tune and is rumoured to be planning to release a new 11.6-inch Chromebook in July, specifically targeting students. Asustek, which hasn’t entered the Chrome OS market as of yet, is also gearing up to release its own Chromebook in the second half of the year, according to the same sources. Prior Chromebook vendors Samsung, HP and Lenovo would also be releasing Chromebooks in the future: Google is also cooperating with players including Samsung, Asustek, HP and Acer for Androidbooks. The sources believe that through the cooperation over both Chromebooks and Androidbooks, it will heap strong pressure on Microsoft, forcing the software giant to take a more cautious approach when making strategies for licensing fees or entering the hardware business.

Also, this annuity guarantees a minimum 4% compounded annualized return, and if interest rates go up, the interest rate goes up accordingly on the annuity. I know it seems really conservative, but looking over the equity landscape, most dividend paying stocks are so high right now, their dividends are under 4%. If interest rates rise, which they will someday, then these stocks will fall, and my annuity will raise its interest rate along with the prime rate increase. What does board think?

This year we’ve seen some interesting hybrid laptop / tablet concepts and designs from both AMD and Intel. Engadget was able to get a hands-on look at the latter company’s “North Cape” reference design at an Intel’s recent “Intel's Innovation Future Showcase” in London. “North Cape” is, of course, powered by an Intel “Haswell” processor and features a 13” FHD (1920 x 1080) display that when detached from the keyboard dock shrinks to a more “hand friendly” 11.6” capacitive screen that will “ignore your grip along the sides of the screen.” Intel reckons that this will enable users to get the widescreen real estate they require for standard laptop use, along with a “tablet that won’t stutter as you handle it.” It is also worth noting that detaching the screen from the keyboard can be done with one hand and involves pressing a button on the screen’s top edge that activates an electrical catch that connects the two parts of the device. Since the reference model wasn’t able to charge at the event, Engadget was not able to see any of the aforementioned features in action, but were able to get an “early glimpse of battery performance” and reported that you can expect up to 10 hours of battery life in tablet mode, which is extended by a further 3 hours with device’s keyboard battery. There’s still no information as to when “North Cape” will be arriving to market or at what price, but we expect further information to be revealed at Computex, which is taking place in Taipei from June 4 to June 8.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1367287684744</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:08:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367288463179-148</Id><Title>AAPL to buy INTC?</Title><Msg>Interesting article on guardian.co.uk: http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/29/apple-buy-intel</Msg><Username>geoff_spicoli</Username><Timestamp>1367288463179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367289004858-149</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL to buy INTC?</Title><Username>geoff_spicoli</Username><Timestamp>1367288463179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:21:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it can't get any dumber than that</Msg><Username>imbluesclues</Username><Timestamp>1367289004858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:30:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367290668262-150</Id><Topic><Title>Intel with Ipad, Android and Windows will own the tablet world by the end of next year.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1367284672082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 21:17:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think they can really take all 20,000 tablet customers?

(INTC), the world’s largest semiconductor maker, promoted Brian Krzanich to chief operating officer, elevating a possible successor to Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini. Krzanich, 51, had been senior vice president in charge of worldwide manufacturing, Santa Clara, California-based Intel said in a statement today. The stock closed at a more than four- year high, bolstered by upbeat results released yesterday. Brian Krzanich, seen here as vice-president of Intel, has been promoted to chief operating officer. Photographer: Hoang Dinh Nam/AFP/Getty Images .Intel has appointed CEOs from within the company since its founding in 1968, and Otellini and his two predecessors held the COO title before taking the top job. In his new role, Krzanich will retain oversight of manufacturing, while taking on responsibility for information technology and human resources. “Are they grooming him to be the next CEO?” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. “If history is any guide, yes.” Wang also said, “I wouldn’t jump to that conclusion just yet.” Under Intel bylaws, Otellini, 61, can continue to serve as CEO until May 2016, when he’ll reach the company’s mandatory retirement age, said Laura Anderson, a spokeswoman. Today’s promotion isn’t related to CEO succession planning, and the company continues to develop a deep bench of executive talent, she said. Intel rose 2.9 percent to $26.38 today in New York, the highest closing since Dec. 31, 2007. The stock has climbed 26 percent in the last 12 months. Barrett, Grove Otellini served as chief operating officer under his predecessor, Craig Barrett, who himself filled that role under Andy Grove. Grove also served as COO, a position that has been vacant since Otellini became CEO in 2005. Krzanich is taking on responsibilities held by Chief Administrative Officer Andy Bryant, who -- as previously announced -- is becoming chairman of the board, Intel said.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1367293775903</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 23:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367293810160-159</Id><Topic><Title>January 2012 article about promotion of Intel COO.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1367293775903</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 23:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>part 2, Intel typically moves senior managers into different roles to give them broader experience and test their ability to handle new challenges. That’s probably what Intel is doing with Krzanich, said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC. “I’ll bet he’s going to have to prove himself,” said Gauna, who has a “market outperform” rating on Intel and is based in San Francisco. “It doesn’t force their hand at this juncture.” Chemistry Major Krzanich has been with Intel since 1982, when he joined the company after graduating from San Jose State University with a degree in chemistry. Intel yesterday announced it would boost spending this year on equipment and facilities to $12.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million. The company says its ability to produce microprocessors with the most advanced technology is a key advantage. Krzanich has played a central role in implementing new production techniques, according to his company profile. Intel announced the management rearrangement a day after releasing a forecast for first-quarter revenue that may exceed analysts’ predictions. The promotions “recognize outstanding performance” and will occur in the coming 30 days, Intel said. The company also named Dadi Perlmutter as chief product officer. Kirk Skaugen, a vice president in charge of Intel’s data-center business, will lead the personal-computer chip business. He succeeds Mooly Eden, who is moving back to his native Israel, at his request, Intel said.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1367293810160</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 23:50:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
