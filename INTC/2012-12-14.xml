You mentioned the PC refresh. One thing that is not mentioned (or maybe it is, but I miss it) is that in 2011, I believe, there were tax incentives to buy pc's. Like many recent programs it robbed sales from the future (2012). The media bashes pc's as being down 21%, and they were, but only in the US. The 2012 fall off in non-US pc's was far less than the US. And, of course, Europe and Asia were having tough economic times in 2012. So, long story short, Stacy Smith is probably right talking about better times for the pc area. The media likes to bash though.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1355463411953</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 00:36:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355467300300-2</Id><Title>DRAM stocks close sharply higher on product price rebound 2012/12/13 17:12:32</Title><Msg>do your own DD</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1355467300300</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 01:41:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355471611222-3</Id><Topic><Title>AMD is exiting x86 market</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355415180362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:13:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Intel has many options to allow for second sourcing or fabrication of all or part of its chip family."

A couple of years ago, Intel partnered LG to deliver a smartphone, which never moved beyond the prototype stage. Lava stepped up to the cause and its XOLO X900 helped the chip maker enter the lucrative mobile market. Although the phone wasn't a commercial success, but it gave a breakthrough nonetheless. The handset's Rs 22,000 price tag was one of the main reasons for its low adaptation rate. Hopefully, the newly launched XOLO A800 priced at Rs 12,000 shouldn't have a problem attracting consumers. This smartphone is powered by dual-core 1 GHz CPU, and 512 MB of RAM. It comes with an 8 mp rear and VGA front camera. Its 4.5" IPS screen has pixel dimensions of 960x540. The dual-SIM (GSM) handset runs Android 4.0 out of the box. The detailed list of features is as follows: 1 GHz dual-core processor, 512 MB of RAM. Android 4.0 (ICS).

And yet, the three-cell, 4,850mAh battery lasts hours longer than bigger touchscreen Windows 8 systems with similar internals. Specifically, we got seven hours and 13 minutes of runtime after looping a video off the local disk with WiFi on and the brightness fixed at 65 percent. The next runner-up in our list is the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13, and if you look at the numbers, it wasn't even a close contest: it managed just five and a half hours in the same test, even though it probably has room for a larger-capacity battery than the W700. It only gets worse from there: we've seen touchscreen Windows 8 systems that barely cracked four hours. The W700 looks even more impressive when you compare it to lighter-weight, ARM-powered tablets. You wouldn't expect that to be the case -- this really isn't a fair fight -- but in fact the difference in battery life isn't as drastic as you'd imagine, especially if you take into account tablets that offer merely average endurance. The ASUS Transformer Pad TF300, for instance, lasts only about an hour longer than the W700; the Nexus 10 edges out the W700 by a mere 13 minutes. We'll admit, the Nexus 10 offers skimpy battery life (we complained about it in our initial review). But here's the thing: we don't know of another Core i5 tablet that can even come close. Take the Surface Pro, for instance: it's expected to last half as long as the Surface for Windows RT -- i.e., about four and a half hours in our rundown test. If that's true, then the W700's battery life would seem that much more exceptional: after all, the W700 and the Surface Pro are close cousins, at least as far as key specs go. It's incredible, then, that the W700's battery life is more typical of a low-powered ARM device.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1355501491503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 11:11:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355501816719-25</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy capitulates, says buy INTEL</Title><Username>lucifer_numbnuts</Username><Timestamp>1317740904000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-10-04 11:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at the loser down on his knees giving up and bowing to Intel.

Part of the reason for the speculation has revolved around Apple. Intel already makes processors for the Mac; but iPhones and iPads use a proprietary ARM-based processor that has been produced for Apple by Samsung. Given the frosty relationship between Apple and Samsung, the scuttlebutt is that Apple has been looking for alternatives â and that the options might include Intel. The issue that always comes up when this idea surfaces is that a move into the foundry business would come at the cost of lower gross margins â making microprocessors is an inherently more profitable activity than manufacturing parts for others. But Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer took a closer look at this issue, and makes a case in a research note issued this morning that there are reasons to think it would be a smart move for Intel to move into contract manufacturing with Apple as a customer. âMooreâs Law â smaller, faster and cheaper â has been the cornerstone of tech economics for 40 year,â he notes. âIt is our view that technical, financial and scale issues are driving towards a last-man-standing advantage for Intel relative to Mooreâs Law and that Intel will leverage that advantage not only in its core business but increasingly as a specialized foundry.â Pitzer notes that Intel Foundry Services (IFS) already has three small, privately held customers â Acrhnoix (which makes FPGAs, field programmable gate arrays), Tabula (programmable logic devices) and Netronome (which makes network processors.) But he says there are a number of other potential customers, including not only Apple but also Cisco, Altera and Xilinx. âTo date IFS has remained mostly a niche effort, but we would argue that as Intelâs manufacturing lead continues to widen at 14nm and especially at 450mm, IFS will become a more meaningful driver of top and bottom line performance,â he writes. âInvestors worry about the impact to corporate profitability from foundry business, especially relative to an Intel and Apple relationship. On the surface, Intelâs MPU ASPs of $120 versus the Apple ASP of $20-$25, Intelâs corporate gross margin of 60-65% versus TSMCâs at 45-50% and Intelâs cost/wafer of $10,500-$11,500 versus leading edge wafers at TSMC at $5,000-$5,500 would all suggest that any entry into foundry would be margin dilutive with little bottom line impact.â But he adds: âWe disagree.â Pitzer writes that he looked at the impact of a foundry relationship between Intel and Apple using ARM chips âand concludes that the profitability profile is much better than the consensus view.â His view: If Intel were to produce 100% of Appleâs demand at 14 nm the company generate an extra $5.8 billion in revenue, 47% gross margins (which is below the 60%-65% of the core business) but with operating margins of 35%, above the core of 28%-32%.

Intel is closely working on several technologies that will help us to use wearable and portable computers in the near future. Wearable computers are small electronic devices that can be worn above or beneath clothing. This technology was intended for general as well as special purpose IT. Wearable computers are gaining traction. Today, they are primarily being used out in the field where other computer devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones hinder a workers ability to record data and perform other duties. There are new examples of wearable computers popping up every day. Sony Ericcson, for example, recently unveiled its new SmartWatch, an Android based smartphone watch which can utilize Google Play apps like Twitter and Facebook. According to Electronista, the market for wearable computers is expected to hit $1.5 billion in revenues by 2014. If Intel could capture just a piece of this market, it could see a significant boost in its bottom line. Intel will begin to mass produce tiny chips that can be used in wearable computers, as early as a few years. Wearable and portable computing have wide ranging market scope and almost all market and industrial sectors will begin to adopt Intel's new technology. This will lead to increased sales of Intel's chips and processors, resulting in increased profits and revenue. This will boost Intel's share value in the long-term. Intel is working on chips that will make it possible to bring "portable computers" to consumer market in less than two to five years. Intel is working on computer chips smaller than their low-voltage Atom processors used in phones and tablets, which can be used to power 'wearable computers'. The chips may have less than half or even a quarter the size of an atom chip. To help reduce the size and power of these small chips, they will not have instruction sets typically found on a microprocessor. The future of computing and microchips lies in wearable technology. Wearable computers have extensive use in the army, medicine, mining, oil and gas and just about anywhere it is not possible for humans to work safely. With the touch of a finger, pictures and videos can be transferred unchanged from a computer to any smooth surface like that of a bowl, table, or wall. Intel will need to bring wearable technology to mass consumers as soon as possible, as the competition will only grow robust. The U.S. military is expected to spend a lot more money on landmine removal, on research into bionic arms and limbs and also on clothing for marines that can act as information processors. When Intel will launch its tiny processors and chips, U.S. military will be the first client to order these tiny chips by the hundreds of thousands. My point is, wearable technology and portable computing have huge potentials that may change the way we understand computers, Internet and information processing. Certainly, Intel is at the forefront of this research and development. All this will translate to increased revenue for Intel, as manufacturers and organizations across healthcare, security, military and energy sectors will depend on Intel for its tiny chips. Intel wants to make it possible to display images of any type on any surface, said Manny Vara, senior technology evangelist at Intel. A system that changes the way we interact with things and makes the images more interactive, according to Vara. Researchers have demonstrated technology, which is still in development, at the European Conference on Research and Innovation Intel in Barcelona last month. Vara demonstrated the project, called "Display without Borders", with a laptop computer, a Microsoft Connect sensor and a projector. At the beginning Vara expects the technology to be used in homes to show pictures and video, Vara also said he expected it to be useful for businesses, allowing workers to collaborate more easily in a meeting, for example. In time, more uses of this technology will be developed. If Intel succeeds in developing the "wearable computers" in the short term, this will be a revolution in how people communicate. Moreover, by being the first company to develop this type of product, its profits would be astronomical, because who would not want to be connected in a way simpler than a smartphone?</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355509537279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 13:25:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355509620650-55</Id><Topic><Title>20 kids shot?

Consequently, Intel has a market cap of $102 billion and an enterprise value of $97 billion. With a profit margin of 22.13%, an operating margin of 30% and revenue of $53.75 billion, Intel is a very powerful company with great benefits for investors. I strongly believe that those numbers will increase when Intel's tiny chips for wearable and portable computers are launched in the mass market. Although the market in general is bearish, Intel is having a great growth in developing countries. Intel is one stock that we cannot ignore solely because of the amount of interest that ordinary consumers, government establishments, research organizations, consumer goods manufacturers and the military have in wearable and portable computing. The ramifications of Intel's tiny chips are going to be profound and the company will see a vertical growth in terms of profit and revenue. This is one reason why Intel's stock will continue to be a great long-term investment in the years to come.</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355512941070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:22:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355512953174-60</Id><Title>Tick Tock Tick Tock-----shorts will be blown up soon.</Title><Msg>Apple Intel deal.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey5</Username><Timestamp>1355512953174</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:22:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355512982098-61</Id><Topic><Title>Why is our society so full iof hate?</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1355507757328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 12:55:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Drugs.</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355512982098</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:23:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355513294492-62</Id><Topic><Title>Why is our society so full iof hate?</Title><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1355507757328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 12:55:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes you are so correct.

Yet the news might not be all that bad considering that Mobile China's shift to TD-LTE may not take as long as some analysts are claiming. In our latest IDF report that we posted in September titled "Intel's Next Wave: Transparent Computing," we covered a fascinating segment which revealed how Intel has been working with Mobile China since 2009 in a revolutionary new wireless infrastructure called C-RAN. Our September report stated that "In China, Intel is working on this next generation C-RAN with China Mobile Research Institute, the largest wireless service provider in the world with more than 680 million subscribers. They currently have about a million base stations throughout China. Their goal is to have roughly one third of these base stations upgraded to 4G LTE. Such a huge undertaking would have hit the company's bottom line if it weren't for Intel's next generation wireless infrastructure solution based on C-RAN." If you have a moment, you should check out more information about this revolutionary new wireless system in our September report that could provide you with greater details. With Mobile China having a third of their base stations rapidly converting to the new C-RAN model, it will open up the TD-LTE market to a whopping 233 million subscribers. That's roughly double the number of US market subscribers clocking in at close to 120 million for 2012. It's a large enough market that could see Apple on board with Mobile China sooner rather than later. This is a factor that the Asian analysts haven't considered and one that could make the world of difference in the timing of Apple being able to increase their sales in China dramatically.</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355517123022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:32:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355517227340-79</Id><Title>Can anybody makes sense of this article?

It was a dramatic contrast to the scenes at the iPhone 4S launch in January when an angry crowd pelted the store in Beijing with eggs and fights broke out between would-be touts aiming to resell new phones. On Friday there was one person waiting at Apple's store in Shanghai's financial district before it opened. But the lack of queues may have been down to the online lottery scheme introduced by Apple to prevent a repeat of January's chaos. It used the same method earlier this month for the launch of its iPad mini, and enforced a two-per-person limit. Although the company has 300,000 pre-orders for the phone from China Unicom, one of the three big mobile providers, and will also sell it through mobile company China Telecom, it has still not sealed a deal with China Mobile, the biggest player with 703 million users of whom 79m are 3G (ie smartphone) users. Despite years of talks, the two sides have disagreed on revenue splits and business models. That means Apple is unable to increase its shipments there as fast as the market for smartphones is growing. There are already 290 million smartphone users and that is forecast to double in the next 12 months. Nokia's shares rose earlier this month after it tied up a deal to sell its Lumia smartphones through China Mobile. Even so, China Mobile announced in March that an estimated 15 million people use iPhones on its network, despite their being incompatible with its data services. More broadly, But Apple and Nokia are struggling in the face of competition from devices powered by versions of Google's Android software: those make up roughly 90% of the smartphones sold in China, although many connect to Chinese services rather than Google's. "In absolute terms, this (iPhone 5) launch will certainly result in strong sales for Apple in China. However, in relative terms, I don't believe it will move the needle enough in market share," Shiv Putcha, a Mumbai-based analyst at Ovum, a global technology consultant, told the Reuters news agency. Peter Misek of Jefferies said he was lowering his iPhone shipment estimates for the first quarter of 2013 by 5m to 48m, on the basis that the company was cutting orders to suppliers. He also cut his estimates for the company's gross margins by 2 percentage points, to 40%. He said it was unclear how much the snowy weather and requirement to pre-order were factors in the small queues. That seems to have helped push down Apple shares, which have lost a quarter of their value since hitting an all-time high of $705.07 on 21 September. Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Research, told clients in a research note that he didn't expect the iPhone 5 to do as well in China as the iPhone 4S. The brokerage cuts its price target for Apple's stock to $700, substantially down from $780, on the expectation of lower iPhone and iPad shipments in the first quarter of 2013.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1355524676158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 17:37:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355525471404-102</Id><Title>Ireland still set for FinFETs, says Intel exec</Title><Msg>Interesting read, especially the comments section between chipmonk and author eetimesDOTcom/electronics-news/4403409/Ireland-still-set-for-FinFETs--says-Intel-exec</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355525471404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 17:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355525784759-103</Id><Topic><Title>Ireland still set for FinFETs, says Intel exec</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355525471404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 17:51:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>comment at bottom...chipmonk sugggests that Intel sent 600 staffs from FAB 24 site home early because, they are shifting from CPU to SoCs, so it takes time to make this change.

By Sascha Segan September 15, 2012 11:30am EST Can Intel Fix Apple's Problems? Fortunately, across the street from the iPhone event, I saw a potential solution. Intel's Developer Forum was going on just across the street from Apple this week. Up on the second floor, the company was showing off the four relatively lackluster Intel phones so far, as well as a modem technology that could really change things. Intel's XMM6260 modem, which has been in the market for a while, uses a single power amplifier for multiple bands, and it can be extended in software to support as many bands as necessary. It doesn't support LTE or CDMA, which is part of why we haven't seen it in many U.S. products. But the point here, an Intel engineer told me, is that the company will be able to put an unlimited number of bands on a single LTE modem, possibly as soon as late next year. Intel's modems will be able to mate with processors from Samsung, Nvidia, TI, and others. Apple used its modems up until 2010, when it switched over to Qualcomm in part to get Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Modems are only half of the solution, though. Dermot O'Shea, co-founder of antenna firm Taoglas, said antenna design gets difficult when you're covering such a wide range of frequencies. Active antennas for smartphones, which have just started to hit the market this year, can adapt to different bands without being huge, although they add to the cost and complexity of smartphones. We're likely to see more of them next year. Between active antennas and multi-frequency power amplifiers, it looks like phone makers are starting to get their hands around the riot of LTE frequencies; they're just not there yet. Maybe we'll see them in the iPhone 7.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1355531660163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 19:34:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355532418449-108</Id><Topic><Title>How big of an oppurtunity is China Mobile for Intel?</Title><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355517467238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:37:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Intel Brand is VERY BIG and very well known in China.
