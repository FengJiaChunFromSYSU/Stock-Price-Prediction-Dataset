Shim noted that based on his supply chain checks, preparation for this device appears to be ramping up, from the display panel’s specifications, touch module and mass production schedule. He did not mention any possible specifications aside from the screen size, but chances are Intel will be the company behind the 7.5-inch Surface’s processor. Recently, Intel had hinted at its new Atom processors powering a new generation of budget-priced tablets, so we could be seeing Microsoft opt for an Intel Atom processor and Windows 8 out of the box." gadgetinsidersDOTcom/microsoft-rumored-to-be-launching-midrange-7-5-inch-tablet-to-challenge-ipad-mini-galaxy-note-8-0/1209617/</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367988410351</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 00:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367989498302-4</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Rumored to Be Launching Midrange 7.5-Inch Tablet to Challenge iPad Mini, Galaxy Note 8.0</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367988410351</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 00:46:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes perfect sense for Microsoft to launch a Wintel tablet like this.

According to Seton’s Chief Information Officer Dr. Stephen Landry, the school has ordered 2,000 units of the Helix for “for all incoming students, freshmen and transfer and all juniors, except those in the Mac program.” After all, according to Landry, this Lenovo convertible PC was chosen as the official computer by the school to make it easier to troubleshoot technical problems, as well as to ensure that no one had to pay more than the other for a computer. The model that SHU students and staffers will be toting around campus has an 11.6-inch, 1920-by-1080 pixel multi-touch display that you can detach to use as a tablet or snap into a keyboard dock to use as a laptop. The screen can be docked facing out so you can use it to give a presentation to a small group without requiring a fancy hinge design. Under its screen is a low-voltage Intel i5-3317U processor that you’d find in Ultrabooks, as well as 4GB RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. It also comes with a digitizer pen, as well as a keyboard dock with the iconic red trackpointer and an extra battery pack that gives the convertible PC 10 hours of battery life over all (there is another battery inside the tablet/screen). It comes preloaded with Windows 8. digitaltrendsDOTcom/computing/lenovo-thinkpad-helix-starts-shipping-seton-hall-university-gets-first-batch/</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367990580767</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 01:23:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367991616818-7</Id><Title>The Upcoming Intel Media Box Could Be the Gateway to 4K</Title><Msg>Add in 4K capability and you’ve got all the TV you want in to a device ready for the future of video. It’ll do all of this using one HDMI port and the broadband connection you already pay for. Intel declined to comment, but its plan to shove TV through your ISP’s tubes will give a whole lot of people a viable alternative to the cable TV provider monopolizing their local market. Plus, thanks to the newly ratified HEVC (h.265) codec, those tubes can handle 60fps 4K transmissions. The new codec brings the size of a 4K transmission down from 45-50Mbps to 10Mbps. According to the networking gurus at Western Digital, you should be able to sustain that speed with a 20Mbps account. Although it might be awhile before networks start broadcasting and streaming 4K content, sources familiar with the situation say they are testing 4K broadcasts. Netflix is watching how 4K evolves according to a Stuff interview with Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos on May 1. Chief product officer Neil Hunt told the Verge that streaming will be the best way to get 4K video and it should appear with in a year or two. What’s more, it hopes to have House of Cards encoded in 4K later this year. The dirty little secret in all of this, of course, is the fact you need an absolutely ginormous TV for any of this to matter. Unless you’re starting at a screen bigger than 60 inches, you’re just not going to notice the improved resolution. That said, if you absolutely, positively must have the very best resolution and you’ve got the screen (and budget) to make it worthwhile, a box that supports 4K should be on your wish list. Whether you need it or not, 4K content is coming. Intel is in the position to lead the transition. It has the technology, it just needs to bring it together. wiredDOTcom/gadgetlab/2013/05/intel_4k_box/ [Go ahead merlot_1, bash it.

Although the Galaxy S 4 managed to throttle in one of our tests, the device never felt all that warm to the touch. We could be seeing some of the same aggressively set thermal governors that we saw back with the Nexus 4. It's also worth pointing out that we're simply in an era of pushing the limits of just how fast you can go at 28nm LP in many of these smartphones. The mobile SoC vendors also need to do a better job of power management, enabling controlled bursting to these high frequency states vs. sustaining the higher frequencies until there's a serious enough thermal issue that the CPU cores have to throttle themselves significantly."</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368002972040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 04:49:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368004497515-10</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo ThinkPad Helix starts shipping, Seton Hall University gets first batch</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1367990580767</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 01:23:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From TheStreetDOTcom Chris Ciaccia -Technology Reporter "The vast majority of the apps and software that run on iPhones, iPads, Galaxy phones, and other devices all are built off ARM-based intellectual property, so to change from that technology to Silvermont is an enormous task.

Since Yahoo does not allow for links, here are some key snippets. - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has been trying to get its processors into the mainstream mobile market ever since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined the company’s offerings when manufacturing the original iPhone. The firm, which has for years specialized in beating its competitors on power alone, has been unable to provide chips with the right balance of power consumption and processing clout. The new Atom has been designed to finally beat the problems the company has had in this area. The processor utilizes the company’s 22nm architecture, and will come in four flavors: Bay Trail: A quad-core chipset for tablets that will be come out in time for Q4; Avoton: A chip for microservers, to be available some time in 2013; Rangeley: A chip for routers and other small devices; and Merrifield which is the firm’s low power smart phone offering, due in 2014. - So, does this guy have a valid point ?</Msg><Username>tex7779</Username><Timestamp>1368017881453</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368017902907-50</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Brings Silvermont to Mobile Competition vs. ARM</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367944776857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good info thank you</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368017902907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368017968996-51</Id><Topic><Title>Silvermont: Intel's promise to power phones and tablets you'd actually want</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367941797590</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silvermont = game changer</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368017968996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368018042619-52</Id><Topic><Title>Intel’s Latest “Silvermont” Platform To Offer 3 Times Performance at 1/5th the Power</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367939311932</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:08:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is a game changing product for sure</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368018042619</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368018138348-53</Id><Topic><Title>Microsemi</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367944836555</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:40:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is not going after select customers anymore, they want any non chip competitor to foundry for</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368018138348</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:02:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368018169898-54</Id><Topic><Title>The Deal: Intel's McAfee Buys Helsinki's Stonesoft for European Expansion</Title><Username>passing.cloud7</Username><Timestamp>1367945960504</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:59:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good deal</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368018169898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:02:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368018316482-55</Id><Title>WARNING TO SHORTS: INTC PUSHING HIGHER THIS WEEK</Title><Msg>$40 BY END OF YEAR</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368018316482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:05:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368018516057-56</Id><Title>Deep inside Intel's new ARM killer: Silvermont</Title><Msg>Now that Intel has created an implementation of the Tri-Gate transistor technology specifically designed for low-power system-on-chip (SoC) use – and not just using the Tri-Gate process it employs for big boys such as Core and Xeon – it's ready to rumble. Tri-Gate has a number of significant advantages over tried-and-true planar transistors, but the one that's of particular significance to Silvermont is that when it's coupled with clever power management, Tri-Gate can be used to create chips that exhibit an exceptionally wide dynamic range – meaning that they can be turned waaay down to low power when performance needs aren't great, then cranked back up when heavy lifting is required. This wide dynamic range, Kuttanna said, obviates the need for what ARM has dubbed a big.LITTLE architecture, in which a low-power core handles low-performance tasks, then hands off processing to a more powerful core – or cores – when the need arises for more oomph. "In our case," he said, "because of the combination of architecture techniques as well as the process technology, we don't really need to do that. We can go up and down the range and cover the entire performance range." In addition, he said, Silvermont doesn't need to crank up its power as high as some of those competitors to achieve the same amount of performance. Or, as Perlmutter put it more succinctly, "We do big and small in one shot." Intel Silvermont Atom processor architecture: dynamic-range comparison with big.LITTLE architecture Intel claims Silvermont makes 'big.LITTLE' architectures unnecessary (click to enlarge) Equally important is the fact that a wide dynamic range allows for a seamless transition from low-power, low-performance operation to high-power, high-performance operation without the need to hand off processing between core types. "That requires the state that you have been operating on in one of the cores to be transferred between the two cores," Kuttanna said. "That requires extra time.

Think Cortex M0 and such. Intel would have no issue building those because they don't compete at all with Intel's core computing market. The issue arises if Intel were to build the higher performance ARM-based cores in SoC implementations for direct competitors. Think Qualcomm/Nvidia/Apple. These guys are selling chips that compete with Intel's, either directly in the merchant vendor model, or indirectly as Apple is vertically integrated. Intel won't build Apple's chips because then it would give the iPhone a huge advantage in battery life/speed, and as a result Intel would sell fewer of its own merchant chips in competitive devices since the iPhone would be so good.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368018644922</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:10:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368019113041-58</Id><Title>dip, baby dip</Title><Msg>this overbght puppy needs to work off the excess</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1368019113041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:18:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368019536788-59</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf: Intel Drops An Atomic Bomb On ARM's 'Abomination'</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367878857308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and that bomb has pushed armh over 49.00, leaving waldo's put from 44.00 severely underwater, with barely a gain from holding INTC since 24.00 3 years ago. still hasn't learned</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1368019536788</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:25:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368019639064-60</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf: Intel Drops An Atomic Bomb On ARM's 'Abomination'</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367878857308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WILL YOU #$%$ WITH THE wallis attack moron</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368019639064</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368019679534-61</Id><Topic><Title>dip, baby dip</Title><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1368019113041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:18:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get lost shorty...INTC going higher...$40 eoy</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368019679534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:27:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368019873005-62</Id><Topic><Title>Has anyone seen the hatchet job on ValueTalk by Paul Shea yesterday ?</Title><Username>tex7779</Username><Timestamp>1368017881453</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:58:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you could post links with the "dot" replaced by the word "dot".

If Clover Trail killed WindowsRT then Avoton has just killed the ARM micro-server market also at birth too. Also the premium tablet/phone market too looks tied up by Silvermont too at least on the cpu front . So WTH is all this phantom ARM growth actually going to come from ? Must be one of the worst priced stocks in the market along with the Amazons and Linkedins.

I've seen this kind of thing too often with stocks going too high and too low. Once you admit and say that a stock's price is irrational, you also remove any possible ceiling limitations. If ARMH can reach $50, then it can reach $100. "That's impossible!" No, it isn't. There are no laws to irrationality. I have a friend who started collecting t-shirts. The other day he showed up with 30 t-shirts he bought that day. "This is crazy." I said, and he assured me he was peaking out on buying t-shirts. Then he bought 150 t-shirts a couple of days later. Crazy people (who can be completely sane otherwise) don't care what the price of ARMH is if they want to own it, and participate in the warm fuzzy glow it gives them. Right now, the crazy people who bought it at $45 are elated and could very well be buying more, and the ones who held back at $45 are now forcing themselves to take the plunge. And crazy people create other crazy people. It's contagious. There is no way to predict when a bubble stock will end. Overvaluation is never enough. Having said all that, I do think the shorts have a chance to make some money.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1368028181080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:49:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368028211432-143</Id><Title>I hope ARMH keeps running up.

Altera. I very much regret Altera's decision to work on the 14-nanometer with Intel even though the financial impact is relatively small and Altera remains a major and valued partner of TSMC's. We have gained many customers in the last few years but I really hate to lose even a part of an old one. We want them all, really. I regret it and because of this, we have thoroughly critiqued ourselves. If there was a thing like an investigative commission on what happened, we had it. And there were, in fact, many reasons why it happened and we have taken them to heart. And it's a lesson to us and I don't think that we -- at least, we'll try our very best not to let similar kinds of things happen again. Now -- but I just want to emphasize that Altera remains a major and valued partner of ours and I say this with Altera's concurrence. Now Intel as a competitor. I noted Intel's yesterday's analyst call, in which they said they have now gone from crawl to walk and then will go on to run and that's all very beautiful in metaphor. And then they also raised several conditions or several criteria -- 3 criteria but there's really nothing new in those and they have said those before. And I still view Intel as a selective picker among customers. As a foundry competitor, they will pick their targets and so on. And I don't view them as a general competitor because they have already said, through the 3 criteria that they used, they have already said themselves that they will not be a general or front [indiscernible] competitor. But they are a very serious competitor to our customers. I mean that, really, I would say, applies even greater pressure on us than they as -- than Intel as a direct foundry competitor. They are a very serious competitor to our customers. Our customers rely on us. That is very serious pressure and we respond to that pressure, of course. We respond to that pressure. Yes.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1368028413817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368028589390-146</Id><Topic><Title>The Truth about ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368023974537</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:39:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clover Trail had help killing RT;) The second MS allowed the legacy UI into RT without full functionality, it was doomed. As for Avoton and micro servers, much too soon to tell. It's certainly knocked the performance/watt to touch (on a CPU basis) but the ARM based solutions still have higher integration on the SoC (fabrics etc). As for growth, a big chuck of of it has little to to with Intel's core markets (micro controllers etc) but whether that is enough to justify the price is another question.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1368028589390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:56:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368028645981-147</Id><Topic><Title>Upgraded to strong stock?</Title><Username>w_monique49</Username><Timestamp>1368026121784</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:15:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for the advice guys, i will certainly make absolutely sure to do so.</Msg><Username>tysha.henry90</Username><Timestamp>1368028645981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:57:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368029443828-148</Id><Title>Silvermont vs A57</Title><Msg>By my estimations of what is currently known about both it will need an A57 on a FinFET process (14/16nm on a 20nm backend) to come close to 22nm Silvermont in *both* peak performance *and* performance/power with a matching of just performance with a 20nm planar A57.

My reason of reckoning of the mkts heading south is that the stock buybacks are gonna disappear at these levels hence there will be plenty of stocks out there since the supply demand ratio is now 1:1. What is pushing higher besides the Fed is that the Japanese easing, the liquidity provided by their fed out there is so great that the Japanese mkts cannot absorb it and hence its flowing into our mkts but for how long this can go on is anyones guess but for now even though all of the indexes point to an uptrend the stocks are way overbought. So the question is if the mkts will correct cause the S&amp;P is up already 15 percent YTD, how much more can it go????</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1368031327184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368031425464-166</Id><Topic><Title>I Think The Mkts Will</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1368031327184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:42:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear Mother Theresa, you've blogged this #$%$ since DOW 11,000.

I just talk about the general mkts, I don't discuss intel unless I specifically mention it by name. Intel is a triple by year 2016-2017 I have no doubts on it and I accumulate on any dips. The scary part is that all these mkt anals are now back to the race course calling for DOW 18k and 20k, all of a sudden everyone has turned bullish and that is scary. Besides the mkts treat all the bad news as good news as then the fed will keep printing and all the good news as good news and keeps on going but what happens when the fed rings the first shot about increasing rates which it will pretty soon as it is expected to raise rates from now near zero to 2-1/4 by year end as the bankers claim. have a nice day bro.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1368032436345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:00:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368032622801-169</Id><Topic><Title>Silvermont vs A57</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368029443828</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:10:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For any given performance level, Intel will have a smaller die size, implying a better cost structure.

ARM investors need excessively high rates or repetition: By my estimations of what is currently known about both it will need an A57 on a FinFET process (14/16nm on a 20nm backend) to come close to 22nm Silvermont in *both* peak performance *and* performance/power with a matching of just performance with a 20nm planar A57. We are not going to see FinFET A57s until 2015 at the earliest. Intel just took a 1-year full and a 2-year partial lead in ultra-mobile ! Of course Airmont will be here next year and the Airmont Tock the following year so these leads could be maintained going forward.

Right now, I have as many people working on Windows 8 tablets as I have on Android phones… the way for us to succeed is to focus – through close collaboration with Google on Android, and Microsoft on Windows 8.” Who knows whether Intel is actually telling the truth, though, or whether that’s just political posturing to keep the Wintel alliance healthy. We would be very surprised if Intel didn’t have some x86 Android tablets in its R&amp;D labs. Silvermont could be very exciting in the smartphone space, however. While Medfield wasn’t the fastest SoC on the block, it was fast enough – and as we’ve already noted, performance isn’t everything. Silvermont will be much faster than Medfield, while consuming less power. At this point we can’t say if Silvermont will beat the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A-series SoCs, but it will almost certainly be fast enough to power a flagship smartphone, while hopefully not breaking the battery bank. With Intel’s continued work on x86 Android, it now seems fairly certain that this will be the year that an Intel-powered smartphone finally arrives in the US market. If that phone is a success, Intel will finally have a mobile beachhead – and it will be then, and only then, that ARM will finally experience the big guns of Intel’s manufacturing mastery and promise to release a new Atom core every 12 month</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1368035735156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368036643531-184</Id><Topic><Title>The Truth about ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368023974537</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:39:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>one thing for sure, INTC investors from 24 in 2010 sure don't have significant profits, but anyone who bght ARMH back then sure does, 10 to 49.99, and the tax liability alone would exceed the gains the buy and hold INTC from 24 in 2010 has, including dividends. waldo should be buying more puts if he's so convinced ARMH is gonna crash. most overbght stocks, read INTC and ARMH alike, ease back, but they don't always fall apart.

That's why a manufacturing guy is now in charge - B.K. was probably accountable in the past for Intel's cost structure. GF and TSMC combined capex is on the order of $ 14.4 billion - put this into perspective to: 1.) Intel capex 2.) to TSMC/GF revenue from advanced technology 3.) put Intel capex into perspective to Intel revenue from advanced technology - one Intel pundit "got it" - he figured TSMC has to spend 3 times more than Intel die size should be competitive - when ARM foundries move from planar to FinFet they will stick with 20nm backend design rules - they will get some shrink out of it but it will be marginal.

We feel that even ahead of a more compelling leading-edge 14nm line-up in 2014, (as) Intel is today receiving a lot of interest from OEMs. There has been feedback from our handset ecosystem checks suggesting that Intel's 2014 ultra-mobile platform may be their best yet. This is especially encouraging given that the expectation on Intel’s success in ultra-mobile is very low.” Intel Takes On ARM With 22nm Atom Chip giant also bolsters security software line ----------------------- By Mark LaPedus Intel Corp. this week took two steps to boost its efforts within its two key markets: microprocessors and security software. Taking another shot to displace ARM Holdings in the mobile, tablet and other markets, Intel rolled out its new and long-awaited microarchitecture for its Atom processor line. And in another move, McAfee, a subsidiary of Intel, signed a definitive agreement to acquire Stonesoft Oyj, a developer of network firewall products, for approximately $389 million in cash. On the processor front, Intel rolled out Silvermont. The technology is an umbrella microarchitecture that will serve as the foundation for a number of new Atom processors, based on its 22nm tri-gate transistor architecture. The previous versions of the Atom processor line are based on its 32nm planar technology. With Silvermont, Intel takes the process lead in the markets addressed by ARM and its technology partners, many of which are still ramping up 28nm planar chips. The Silvermont-based processor lines include the following product codenames: Bay Trail, Merrifield, Avoton and Rangeley. Bay Trail is geared for tablets, Merrifield is aimed for smartphones, Avoton is targeted for microservers, a</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1368045584964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:39:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368047034201-213</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Takes On ARM With 22nm Atom</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1368045584964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:39:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know when I finally realized that ARM may now finally be in trouble with Intel?

The architecture in question is from the flagship 20nm Volcanic Islands chip “Hawaii” featuring 4096 stream processors. That’s almost double to what we get in today’s flagship Radeon HD 7970 GHz edition GPU. AMD hasn’t taken such a big leap since Radeon HD 5870 which double the stream processor count to 1600 compared to 800 SPs on the Radeon HD 4870. The switch from AMD’s VLIW4 (HD 6000 series) to GCN 1.0/1.1 (HD 7000) was more of a die shrink from 40nm to 28nm, but if this architecture shot holds any truth then AMD would not only be shrinking the die down to 20nm but also bring radical changes to the whole architecture.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1368048676688</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368048727281-218</Id><Topic><Title>WOW:AMD 20nm Volcanic Islands “Hawaii” Architecture Leaked?</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1368048676688</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:31:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 4096 stream processors would be arranged in 16 SPUs (Stream processor modules), each holding 64 processors split into 4 Compute modules and would feature 4 ACE (Asynchronous Compute Engines) units which accept data and pass it over to the SPUs for processing. The Volcanic Islands “Hawaii” chip would comes with 256 Texture mapping units or TMU and 64 ROPS (Raster operation Units). The most intresting thing about the architecture is that AMD would use a 512-bit memory bus instead of the 384-bit on current HD 7900 series parts which would allow for higher native VRAMs of 4 GB. In addition to the main parallel compute module (PCM), the Hawaii chip would also feature 8 SPMs (Serial processing modules) which allows for parallel computing and could be a dedicated HSA module. There’s alot more information that can be seen on the architecture shot but unfortunately most of it is blurred due to the picture being of lower resolution. We advise our readers to take the above posted information with a grain of salt since this could just be wishful thinking by the user or made up by him. Only time would tell whether this is the real deal or not. But we do have the slight bit of details that now confirm the existence of Volcanic Islands and their launch by the end of 2013 so stay tune for more news as soon as its available.

The new Atom chips based upon 22nm Silvermont designs will yet again be pitted against ARM processors in the target market of mobile processors. Silvermont designs will power the Merrifield (smartphone) and Bay Trail (tablet) SoCs. However this time Chipzilla might have more of a chance against the ARM artillery supplied Qualcomm, Nvidia, Apple, and Samsung. According to Intel, the Silvermont architecture can deliver a choice of “approximately 3x more peak performance or the same performance at approximately 5x lower power over the current-generation Intel® Atom™ processor core”. That is indeed a significant improvement. As well as design tweaks the Silvermont SoCs benefit from a shrinking of production process scale from 32nm used in the current generation of Atom SoCs, down to the 22nm Fin FET process with 3D transistors. Intel isn’t just taking aim at ARM in mobiles and tablets, there are other sizable markets such as microservers, network infrastructure, storage and other market segments including entry laptops and in-vehicle infotainment where Intel fancies its new chips will be employed. The new chips offer “industry-leading performance-per-watt efficiency” according to Intel. What is more the chip is very flexible for system designers in its scalability as “the highly balanced design brings increased support for a wider dynamic range and seamlessly scales up and down in performance and power efficiency”. Reading through Intel’s promotional launch literature and looking though the slides it may seem that Intel will be able to finally crack the mobile market.

So future Windows 8 and Windows Blue-based tablets powered by Intel's revamped mobile chips could provide a lift for Microsoft and its hardware partners. Analysts are upbeat about Intel's new mobile chip design due later this year. That means a much-needed boost for Windows 8 tablets -- where many of those chips will land. Imagine this: an ultraslim, light tablet with roughly twice the performance of any Atom-based Windows 8 tablet on the market now. (And that's the full version of Windows, not Windows RT.) That could happen in the second half of this year. So think of Windows Blue (or Windows 8.1) products similar to Samsung's 0.38-inch thick ATIV Smart PC 500T Tablet or Dell's 0.4-inch thick Latitude 10 with new Intel quad-core "Bay Trail" processors based on the overhauled Atom micro-architecture. And smaller tablets, like Acer's rumored 8-inch tablet, should ultimately benefit too.

"We suspect that Intel's Silvermont [micro-architecture] will provide better performance metrics than even ARM's vaunted Cortex A15...Expected to appear in tablets in [the second half 2013] and smartphones in [the first half 2014], Silvermont also has the distinction of being the first mobile chips (from any vendor) to benefit from tri-gate [3D] transistors...And like ARM's Cortex A15 core, Silvermont is a fully out-of-order architecture, a feature heretofore not present in Atom solutions...We view Silvermont as the basic building block for Intel's future mobile architectures." RBC Capital Markets' Doug Freedman: More balanced and responsive systems. "Intel has stated improved performance per watt, with Silvermont operating at 3x peak performance or at same performance at 5x lower power vs. current Atom core...Intel highlighted a more efficient out-of-order execution pipeline that drives a more balanced and responsive system...Intel's architecture allows for fast switching between high [performance] and low [performance] states..." Anandtech's Anand Shimpi: 2x performance claims valid. "First of all, based on what I've seen and heard from third parties working on Baytrail designs -- the performance claims of being 2x the speed of Clovertrail (current Atom) are valid. Compared to the two [ARM] Cortex A15 designs I've tested (Exynos 5250, dual-core A15 @ 1.7GHz and Exynos 5410 quad-core A15 @ 1.6GHz), quad-core Silvermont also comes out way ahead.

"Intel's architecture allows for fast switching between high [performance] and low [performance] states...however, we acknowledge that Intel is battling market skepticism in low-power vs. ARM." Freedman's comment suggests that many analysts and probably most ARM supporters don't actually believe what Intel claims to have achieved in performance &amp; power efficiency is even possible. The idea that Intel is just making this stuff up is incomprehensible, particularly since the data will be verified independently, and some already has. However, the view that analysts are still in disbelief about Intel's advances shows how much they accepted Warren East's claim that Intel would never rival ARM's designs in power efficiency. The larger market is stunned and in a state of denial and disbelief. This may take weeks or months but when the data is irrefutable there will be a tsunami-sized market response to what happened this week.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1368068852404</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:07:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368069087896-257</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's next generation A7 processor to be produced by Intel?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1368065033282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 22:03:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A low-cost budget iPhone with Lexington is a possibility</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1368069087896</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:11:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368069353120-258</Id><Topic><Title>Intel chip gives new hope for Windows 8 tablets</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368064057258</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 21:47:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great find!!!</Msg><Username>jnsnyu88</Username><Timestamp>1368069353120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368071696577-259</Id><Topic><Title>ashraf the idiot</Title><Username>henrya1228</Username><Timestamp>1367931417750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:56:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One?
