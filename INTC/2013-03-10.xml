The president of Samsung's memory chip division, Jun #$%$-soo, had a lot of negative comments about Microsoft in a meeting with reporters. The Korea Times transcribed his quotes. First, he said the obvious: "The global PC industry is steadily shrinking despite the launch of Windows 8." Then he added this: "I think the Windows 8 system is no better than the previous Windows Vista platform." Vista is considered to be one of the biggest disasters for Microsoft. It's not good for a partner to compare the new Windows to Vista. He then added even more: "MS’s rollout of its Windows Surface tablet is seeing lackluster demand ... Meanwhile, previous vigorous pitches by Intel and MS for thinner ultra-books simply failed and I believe that’s mostly because of the less-competitive Windows platform." This wouldn't be so bad if it were just one guy talking. But, he's just the latest to pile on. Executives at Asus, Acer, and Fujitsu have all had bad things to say about the state of Windows. A big part of the problem is that the PC market is contracting as users buy smartphones and tablets instead of new PCs. Smartphones and tablets don't replace PCs, but they act as good-enough substitutes, negating the need for an immediate PC purchase. If you have an iPad for couch computing, it's okay to have a five-year-old PC for limited heavy computing. However, Windows is supposed to solve this problem by working on tablets. If it's not solving the problem, it's bad for Microsoft.</Msg><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362937143059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:39:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362937224458-26</Id><Topic><Title>Thoughts on this Samsung article regarding MS Surface</Title><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362937143059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:39:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coming from Samsung, these comments are particularly damaging.

What they want delivered are more efficient ways to run the big data centers that make their businesses work. And that could translate into big things for Austin chip startup Calxeda Inc., which makes low-power servers that fit the bill for the changes companies like Facebook Inc. are pushing. Clout in the data center industry is quickly shifting to big players -- like Facebook -- that can buy thousands of servers at once. Facebook in January unveiled a project called "Group Hug," in which competing technology providers agreed to create server "motherboards" that could be quickly plugged into its data centers. The social media company also helped create a technology group called the Open Compute Platform to help drive the computer industry toward more lower-cost and interchangeable components that can be plugged into data centers. Facebook spent more than $600 million on data centers and equipment inside them in 2011 and expected to spend another $500 million in 2012. Four chipmakers signed on to the "Group Hug" project, including Intel Corp., the largest and richest semiconductor company and the dominant supplier of server technology. Joining Intel on the project was Austin's Calxeda, which has just over 100 employees and is only a few years removed from the Austin Technology Incubator. "The guys who write the checks set the rules," said Karl Freund, Calxeda's vice president for marketing, in explaining Facebook's ability to make "Group Hug" a reality. "For players like us, this project should level the playing field and lower the cost of entry for large-scale data center customers who want to evaluate and deploy our technology."

Why the investment rush Because the world's big Internet companies are expected to invest heavily to keep up with expanding usage of the Internet, most of which will be driven by new mobile devices. The Oppenheimer &amp; Co. securities firm estimated last year that the market for processor chips in new low-power will grow at a combined rate of about 95 percent a year between 2011 and 2016. Oppenheimer expects that market will b e $4.5 billion in size by 2016. But Calxeda started attacking the problem from the day it was started in 2008. It has been shipping its first-generation of low-power server technology, called Energy Core 1000, since last fall. And it expects to begin producing a more powerful second generation, nicknamed "Midway," before the end of this year. A third generation, nicknamed "Lago," is due out next year and it will be the first to feature full 64-bit performance, which has become the standard for most servers. Sixty-four bit refers to the amount of data that the server can process at any given instant. The company is hiring rapidly. It had 60 workers last summer, about double that in late February and it expects to employ close to 200 by the end of this year. Most of the engineering hardware and software development goes on at company headquarters on North MoPac Boulevard, but Calxeda also has set up a branch office in Silicon Valley and two smaller branches in Taiwan and Beijing. Some of the company's more routine chip development work gets handed off to outsourcing firms, while Calxeda's engineers concentrate on key hardware and software work to make their system chips more efficient and easier to manage. Asia is where much of the action is likely to be located in the new market because that is where the Internet usage is growing the fastest.

"The new end users are household names in China," Freund said. "They are building more stuff there and they are building it faster. And they are more willing to try new stuff." Most companies planning to develop ARM-based server technology are waiting until next year to introduce their first products. That is when ARM will have its first 64-bit processing cores ready to be used in products by its partner companies. Calxeda decided to move first to develop two earlier generations of 32-bit chips both to gain valuable engineering experience and to learn more about what their potential customers really want. "They get a first-mover advantage," Moorhead said. "They can tune their offering. The more time you are working with customers, the higher the likelihood that you will get some of their business if things go well. You become the entrenched vendor." The market is far too new to call anyone an entrenched vendor yet. But Calxeda seems to be gaining traction. It has about 100 customers evaluating its first-generation chips and it has been working with Hewlett-Packard Co. -- a big server supplier -- on a low-power development platform that HP calls "Project Moonshot." Industry writer and gadfly Charlie Demerjian predicted two years ago that Facebook might be among the first big customers for Calxeda's technology. Neither company has confirmed that forecast. "We deliver higher density," Freund said recently. "And they (Facebook) are interested in the concept." The Austin company has laid the technical foundation for its products and now it is gearing up for a faster pace of product development. "The learning experience (on a first generation of products) is incredibly valuable," Freund said. "It allows us to be more competitive and it gives us incumbency. "This is the model the ARM server market will see for the next five years," he said.

From wallstcheatsheet [ARM longs and Intel shorts obviously head into the week nervous after having had their heads handed to them in a basket last week. The ARM crowd is looking for a posting point and really not finding any. The kind of positive ARM news that will support its massive P/E is nonexistent. The fact that they are trying to hype the server angle is a clear sign that they are substantially out of ammo. They won't touch the fabrication issue with a 50-foot pole. In the meantime Intel is getting massively positive spin from the foundry, Altera, Apple, iWatch, Haswell and FinFET areas. The possibility of another big Intel deal looms large and provides significant additional risk for ARM longs and Intel shorts.

I can see that. His success at Samsung in the memory division is based on increasing revenue and profits of the memory division. That is tough in a flat PC volume environment. He needs to rationalize what is happening to his division's performance. The PC treadmill has been disrupted and it will take some time to settle out and assign winners and losers. I think there are too many players and some consolidation is in the future. Last year ..... Samsung are pushing Intel to launch DDR4 ahead of its 2014 release date Apr 17, 2012 7:24 am By: Anthony Garreffa "Just a couple of weeks ago we were talking about Intel bringing DDR4 into the market by 2014, but Samsung Electronics thinks this is too far away and are trying to talk Intel into launching its DDR4 memory supporting server platforms ahead of the 2014 release dates. Inside sources are saying that Samsung are concerned that making DDR3 chips are now unprofitable due to low prices. " At the moment, only Samsung and Hynix Semiconductors have completed the development of DDR4 products and are readying for the transition to the next-generation of memory standards. At the moment, the memory market is quite shaky thanks to the near collapse of one of the biggest manufacturers, Elpida. It's said that the early release of DDR4 should restabilize the market. If DDR4 is pushed quicker, it would put Samsung in a very lucrative position, where they'd sit at the top spot in the channel. Memory industry standards body, the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, is scheduled to publish the DDR4 standard, which is said to bring a big advancement in performance with reduced power consumption when compared to previous generations of memory, sometime in mid-2012.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362943095294</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 15:18:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362945217267-36</Id><Title>Lenovo K900 with Intel Clover Trail+ CPU is smoking fast</Title><Msg>[Wow, lots of positive Intel buzz on the Lenovo K900!] Derek RossFeb 25, 2013 (edited) - Public Dam(n), Lenovo K900 with Intel Clover Trail+ CPU is smoking fast How fast?

Not only is the Samsung Galaxy S4 all set to be unveiled in New York, we have just received word that XOLO is about to announce something it calls, “the Fastest Smartphone Ever”. The mystery device will be announced on March 14 in Goa. XOLO has sent out invites to the media with that curious heading, along with some hints about the SoC. The mysterious device, of which we get a small glimpse in the invite, will be powered by an Intel processor. We're guessing this is likely to be an Intel Clover Trail+ CPU, which was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month. Clover Trail+ will be released in three versions: the 2.0GHz Z2580, the 1.6GHz Z2560, and the 1.2GHz Z2520. Each version includes two PowerVR SGX 544MP2 GPUs, which should result in a large performance boost. The graphics engine uses a core that can scale up to 533MHz using boost mode to further augment graphics performance. All three versions support full HD resolutions up to 1900 x 1200 pixels, and have HSPA+ 42Mbps modems. We have found XOLO phones to have decent build quality and they are generally sturdier than other low-cost smartphones. The choice of materials and the finish is also more premium. Let’s hope that the trend continues for this upcoming smartphone. We will be bringing you all the coverage from the XOLO launch next week.

Instead, it will be XOLO that will be announcing a new Intel-powered smartphone that will evidently be the fastest smartphone ever in Goa, India on Thursday. XOLO has sent out media invites, according to Tech2, for an event in Goa, India to show off a new Intel smartphone that it’s calling the “Fastest Smartphone Ever.” The company does not specify what the invite is for but the company’s homepage is teasing something called Mission ‘X’, complete with a countdown to the launch event.

Think again...] Intel's new "Haswell" chip design is just around the corner. But we're already getting a peek at finished products, courtesy of a German PC vendor. High-end laptops with Intel's upcoming fourth-generation Core series of chips appeared on DevilTech's site, according to Heise online. Unannounced Intel silicon in those rigs includes quad-core Core i7s, such as the 4800MQ and 4900MQ. And speaking of leaks, Haswell chips are actually up for pre-order on some online retailers. For those who follow Intel chip rollouts closely, the chipmaker usually debuts quad-core mobile chips first and then follows up with more conventional laptop silicon, then, a bit later, the most power-efficient variants. Haswell is a brand new microarchitecture that is expected to be announced formally in June. Compared with third-generation Ivy Bridge processors, Haswell will boast a much faster graphics processing unit (GPU) and slightly faster central processing unit (CPU). Intel has said in the past that Haswell is the company's first mainstream system-on-a-chip because it integrates most of a PC's core processing functions on one chip.

In addition, Intel's MIMD architecture Larabee was never going to rival a SIMD architecture solution for generic graphics acceleration, but the MIMD architecture makes it a very good candidate for general purpose HPC. A number of Intel's staff including its CTO have extensive experience in parallel computing and HPC and would have been more qualified to position Larabee's suitability to specific markets.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1362947010286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 16:23:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362948059078-42</Id><Topic><Title>Gelsinger as Intel next CEO would be GREAT</Title><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362879851893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 20:44:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At this juncture, Intel is more a beggar than a chooser.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1362948059078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 16:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362954539477-43</Id><Topic><Title>INTC to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>almeda.mosley</Username><Timestamp>1362591601010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:40:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>hellerdaniel168</Username><Timestamp>1362954539477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 18:28:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362959061864-44</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>After six consecutive sessions of gains, stocks are a little over extended.

For the S&amp;P 500, watch for resistance near 1565, its all-time closing high, followed by 1576, its all-time intraday high. Technically, trends are clearly up. However, the technical indicators of the major indexes have yet to catch up with the move up in prices, suggesting the current leg of the rally hasn't been as strong as the one from the beginning of the year to mid February. Besides, this year's market move continues to closely track that of last year.
