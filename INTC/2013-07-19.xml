They look at that and say that they can have one architectural design, one set of products and use both operating systems. So it's a unique feature that we are able to provide. It's more been in focus by Intel of actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products in there. You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail. Haswell on the Core side and Bay Trail on the Atom side really being designed for those ultra-mobile products. We talked about Haswell producing the first stainless Core products out there in the market in any kind of real volume.

The Bernstein report cautioned investors not to get too lost in the various benchmark reports, all of which have their limitations, and none of which fully reflect the overall user experience of a wireless device. But it noted that its analysts showed that “the risk x86 represents for the ARM camp is underestimated,” and could spell risks for stocks in this space. However, regarding Qualcomm, the Bernstein report said potential gains from Intel in the mobile space is a risk, “but a manageable one,” noting several other areas of strength for the company. “Intel’s Atom roadmap may indeed make their products more attractive in the tablet/low end notebook market, but a market where Qualcomm’s presence is, today, relatively small,” Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein noted. “Additionally, Qualcomm’s strength in radios (as far ahead on that point as Intel is on process technology) and other cellular technology provide a significant barrier to others in the handset space.”</Msg><Username>intelreport</Username><Timestamp>1374213902225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 02:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374215741172-18</Id><Topic><Title>x86 advantage</Title><Username>intelreport</Username><Timestamp>1374211369681</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 01:22:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If BYOD concept gets traction, 2-in-1 (Android+Windows) devices may find attraction from the employee community.

I don’t know if it is gaining traction. Until few months ago I used to see a handful of people with iPads at workplace regularly. Now I see iPads at workplace less frequently. Windows+Android devices may trigger renewed interest in BYOD concept. Though I don't think consumers will want to frequently switch between Windows and Android at home. I tend to agree that Windows may be too big for a tablet form factor. This also means that iOS and Android will have to stay small to be usable on tablet FF.

I was pretty confident that nothing would happen for Q2 and we will know about Q2 in the next couple of days. Historically, the BOD has announced that the dividend would be increased before the actual declaration of the dividend by a month or so. The BOD will not know what Q3 looks like in Sept to follow that path. Interestingly, the Intel $1.75b 2009 and $932m 2005 convertible notes have a clause that says that dividends paid on the stock in excess of the rate at the time would lower the conversion price. In effect, if Intel distributes more of the company as dividends, they would adjust the conversion. If Intel raises the dividend, that lowers the conversion price on 78.8m shares faster below $22.20 and 31.5m more shares down from $29.53. Intel created 110.3m shares that they encourage to be shorted to protect capital.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1374243525996</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:18:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374243577677-95</Id><Title>TSMC</Title><Msg>The Intel threat IS real - sure margins will initially impacted but Intel will continue to reduce cost by shrinking.

All this exuberance will fold once the bonds yields starts to rise.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1374244831109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:40:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374244839254-107</Id><Title>Anybody listen to the TSMC call?</Title><Msg>Did anybody listen to the TSMC call?

Cable TV operators will be most subject to buyout rumors, but Cable TV tech vendors are well positioned to receive the largest valuation premiums! Video on Demand (VOD) technology revolutionized cable TV this past decade. A Brean Capital analyst issued an important research note this past December about VOD delivery company Seachange (SEAC). Brean said, "because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." Concurrent (CCUR) is truly the world's new technology leader of today's biggest areas of MSO investment! CCUR recently overtook SEAC for the #1 VOD market share. CCUR also has the #1 largest market shares of start-over/look-back services and Big Data Analytics solutions. CCUR is investing heavily to grow a major share of the booming multi-screen CDN market! CCUR recently signed HUGE new CDN deals with Time Warner Cable and Virgin Media in the UK! The new industry consolidation wave is here! SEAC surpassed its previous 52-week high of $12.10 on Monday and reached a new 52-week high on Wednesday of $12.72. SEAC closed yesterday at $12.58 with a market cap of $412mm, cash of $114.23mm, and an enterprise value of $297.77 million or 1.91X revenue of $156.11mm! CCUR at $7.80 has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.73 and needs to rise to $16.35 to trade at SEAC's multiple of 1.91! CCUR's gross margins of 58.2% exceed SEAC's margins of 51.6%. CCUR has grown its operating margin from 1.3% in 4Q2012, to 2.7% in 1Q2013, to 5.3% in 2Q2013, and to 7.3% in 3Q2013. CCUR's 3Q GAAP EPS of $0.11 was up 175% YOY! CCUR just raised its dividend by 100%, which bodes extremely well for their 10-K filing next month! CCUR pays the industry's highest dividend yield of 6.2%!</Msg><Username>frankf4u489</Username><Timestamp>1374245832209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374245868605-125</Id><Topic><Title>INTC's really starting to drop, Man look at all the sellers</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1374245386154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:49:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very astute timing.

Nut Shell has responded to the rumors, stating that Intel will provide a portion of the funds for marketing the phone, but did not reveal how much Intel would contribute, stating only that the RMB 50 mln figure was inaccurate.

Freedom from Intel and AMD's x86 processors? Sanctity from traditional Windows malware? How dreamy. But the honeymoon is over, and reality ain't happy with the frivolous romp. Thursday, Microsoft announced that it took an accounting hit to the tune of nearly $1 billion—yes, with a B—thanks to the steep discount it had to apply to the millions of Surface RT tablets lying around unsold.

By all accounts, the Surface RT was the star of the Windows RT show. In fact, stats from AdDuplex consistently showed it as the best-selling Windows 8/RT device period—but that doesn't mean it sold well from a pure numbers standpoint. After Microsoft moved a reported 900,000 Surface RT tablets alone in the fourth quarter of 2012, IDC reported that all Windows RT tablets combined only managed to ship 200,000 units in the first quarter of this year. Yep, the Surface RT is sinking fast. That's bad. Nope, that's horrible. But while Surface RT is the juggernaut when it comes to ARM-powered Windows slates, it's not the elephant in the room. That distinction goes to just how fervently third-party manufacturers are avoiding Windows RT. Lenovo's Windows RT hybrid is gone, replaced by a Windows 8 model. Many of the biggest names in PCs have taken a pass on the operating system: HP, Samsung, Acer, and Toshiba all respectfully (or not-so-respectfully) bowed out of this particular race. Even some tentative early supporters are starting to pull back. Lenovo unceremoniously dumped the RT-sporting IdeaPad Yoga 11 this past Wednesday, mere weeks after launching the IdeaPad Yoga 11S, which took the original Yoga 11's superb physical design and imbued it with an Intel Core processor and the full-blown version of Windows 8. The few Windows RT tablets left are all getting steep price cuts, from the Surface RT to the Dell XPS 10 to the Asus VivoTab RT.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374263009233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374263028136-242</Id><Title>First leg of massive buy signal</Title><Msg>First buy at aug 23 calls at 0.4 in for the first part of a massive buy signal. Next entry at 22.5 then 22 then let it fail if it doesnt materialize. But i do think the price is good to enter similar to last time a few days ago that was good for a move to 24.4. Even if we are in a declining pattern i still see24 easily as the next top at least. Buy now or miss a massive chance for a cool reversal in trend that typically happens when they have all convinced you its dead money. Intel is at a critical long term transition point here not very different than Apple or IBM in the past before they redefined themselves. Intel trading is not about timing the long term breakout. Intel trading is about recognizing that it has a significant chance to do a move to 100 eventually and a smaller chance to collapse as company and the only thing that matters is to position yourself for that development by trading the buy and sell signals and over time improving the core long shares position. That core position has a cost basis for even drip investors of less than 20 with all dividends paid last 12 years. The stock is terribly undervalued in that sense, the sense of potential hidden explosive empire redevelopment. Play 50% cash at all times and the other 50% a mix of stock core position and money used for buying calls or puts at signals and then the profits or losses redistributed back to cash &amp; core shares . That way you never care to time the move to 30 or 40 or 60 that eventually will happen over 60%of the time vs the crash to 10 or whatever, when the management gets its head out of the long term unimaginative #$%$ and declares to the world that intel is now against EVERYONE including apple and will start developing its own products directly like apple and Google have done only much better because it controls the science &amp; technology and the others dont at such scale or performance. The need for the planet for exponentially increasing computing is not ending.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1374263028136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263098392-243</Id><Topic><Title>Making 100k a year trading!</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368346134909</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 04:08:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GHFN</Msg><Username>jesse.43260</Username><Timestamp>1374263098392</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:44:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263099514-244</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft should yank Windows RT for Windows RT's own good</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374262918829</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd: 2 And who can blame the manufacturers for fleeing? Windows RT simply isn't a compelling option right now. It doesn't run classic desktop programs, only modern-style Windows apps—and the Windows Store still doesn't have anywhere near a full catalog of apps, despite recently hitting the 100,000 app milestone. There are still glaring Windows Store no-shows. Major software developers have been as slow to support Windows RT as hardware manufactuers. Windows 8.1 will make the modern UI more useable, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still so new and different. The mixture of “different” and “no apps” isn't one destined for stardom. Take a chill pill "But wait!" you shout at your monitor, no doubt shaking your fist. "You just argued that Windows RT is crucial for the Windows ecosystem even if its sales stink, Brad!" I did! And it is! But here's the thing: Windows RT's mere existence is the boon, not the tablets themselves. Windows RT is important, but actually selling Windows RT hardware is not. The threat of ARM infiltration prodded Intel and AMD into creating much more energy efficient x86 processors, and tablets running on Clover Trail+ chips now offer full desktop software compatibility with all-day-plus battery life. Clover Trail's impending successor, Bay Trail, promises just-as-long endurance with much better performance, while Intel's flagship "Haswell" Core PC processors were built with a focus on energy efficiency. The availability of long-lasting, fully backwards compatible Windows 8 slates puts an even bigger damper on Windows RT's prospects.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374263099514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:44:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263167625-245</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft should yank Windows RT for Windows RT's own good</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374262918829</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd: 3 Likewise, ARM support is now baked into the modern UI, right alongside x86 compatibility. Any modern-style app will run on both types of processor just fine. Meanwhile, the modern UI and apps run on the Windows Runtime application architecture, a variant of which also powers Windows Phone. Microsoft makes no bones about the fact that Live Tiles are its future, a dedication driven home by CEO Steve Ballmer's decision to unify all OS development within a single division under the One Microsoft umbrella. The biggest benefits Microsoft gained from Windows RT—ARM integration and better power efficiency—occurred at its genesis, not from its day-to-day sales (or lack thereof). Time out Microsoft's all-in, but Windows RT needs a time out. All this points to one thing: Microsoft should call time-out for Windows RT. Microsoft definitely needed to create Windows RT. The company was on the verge of missing the tablet train completely. It needed to keep Intel honest while broadening its technical horizons to embrace ARM. The Surface RT was the first Microsoft-made PC. I could go on. But now that the creation is done, it's time to pull back and let the concoction bake. Windows RT doesn't make sense right now. Nobody wants it. Intel's latest mobile processors rock battery life that rivals the endurance of ARM chips. The modern UI is still in its infancy, and Windows RT's entire existence revolves around an app store that's still relatively barren. Meanwhile, reports of high Surface RT return rates abound. The headlines are filled with articles about billion-dollar Surface RT write-offs and manufacturers fleeing the OS. Nothing good is being said about Windows RT. The brand—and the very concept of using the modern UI as an exclusive computing interface—is being damaged irreparably, and for what? Windows RT tablets aren't selling, and from a strategic standpoint, Microsoft has nothing to gain by letting the horror show continue.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374263167625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263200667-246</Id><Topic><Title>OH NO now there talking a tax payer bailout for Detroit, Just great</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1374253780660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:09:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we have to bail the brothers out. they need our money. we voted for a brother president and he's going to take care of the Detroit folks.

If Microsoft blazes the trail and lets the Surface RT fade away, third-party manufacturers will follow suit. And rather than being a disaster, a lack of available hardware would only give Windows RT room to grow, as odd as that may sound. The vocal complaints about the OS's neutered nature would cease, as it wouldn't be in the limelight. But that doesn't mean Windows RT development would stop. Far from it! Since the modern UI is also found in Windows 8 proper, its wrinkles would continue to be smoothed out over time. More importantly, the Windows Store will continue to fill with apps that work on ARM and x86 processors alike, especially once a critical mass of PC users inevitably upgrade to Windows 8. Time could heal Windows RT's early wounds. After the modern UI and the Windows Store have a few years to blossom, Microsoft could reintroduce Windows RT in a much more viable form than it is today—one less conducive to complaints and returns. And, until then, Microsoft could stop swirling fruitless billions down the drain.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374263235660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:47:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374263364245-248</Id><Title>was it the bottom today</Title><Msg>i think so imho</Msg><Username>jake_718</Username><Timestamp>1374263364245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263551227-249</Id><Topic><Title>was it the bottom today</Title><Username>jake_718</Username><Timestamp>1374263364245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:49:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll tell you if it was next year</Msg><Username>angstromatic</Username><Timestamp>1374263551227</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:52:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263920168-250</Id><Topic><Title>AMD Tumbles as Gaming Profits Expected to Disappoint</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1374262180331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:29:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"However, margins for next generation gaming counsels are on the low side.

In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation.

The worst part about this guy is he immediately ready to degrade you, call you insults if you don't agree with him or at least take a similar view on his analysis. Plus, he loves to call investors "pumpers" when this is exactly what does all the time right along with bashing-he fits into these message boards. He also embraces posters here that are well known bashers and liars as long as they are against the stock he is negative on or doesn't like. I can tell right off by the title of articles that it's him before I even read it, which I seldom do. I already know what to expect just the Nvidia article and the "Red Flag" one regarding AMD.

I am at all time highs in my accounts :) I still can get out of this dog with a profit too :) I even owned INTCW, I love Intel, I wish I could make big $ on Intel, I loved Andy Grove, it hurts to see Intel flounder but what do you want me to do, lie like you? In 100% seriousness, I honestly feel if they don't get into another line of business, they will have to cut their dividend in 2014 or 2015. Sad but honest. If i were going to open an account for 1 of my children, I would not suggest they buy INTC and I remember when the nasdaq went as INTC went. Truly sad days these last 13 years for Intel. For those who remember Grove, he was an awesome leader and those were awesome times. I recall INTC rising 8 points a day at times. I would rather have INTC up but it is very entertaining to watch lucy_nuff eat you alive here for 3 years now. You put in hours and hours and are just wrong wrong wrong. You have been wrong for 3 years that I have seen and it is just a crack up. You want to call me gramps or geezer or whatever yet I am at least 8 years younger than you :) The only advantage you have is Lucy seems to like amd and I admit i do own some of amd but amd is maybe the biggest POS on wallstreet. How amd has stayed in business is beyond me. I will use that loser to offset gains 1 day no doubt.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1374277794550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:49:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374277978667-309</Id><Title>Microsoft's $900 Million ARM Blunder</Title><Msg>Yesterday, Microsoft took a $900 million charge against earnings to account for a drop in the value of its remaining Surface RT inventory.

Almost all of my Intel buying was below a share price of $17. So, when you talk about me losing money or having been wrong for three years, I can only laugh at you. I bought and held with only occasional transactions thereafter. I saw absolutely no reason not to hold once FinFET was announced. I can clearly remember Intel hitting $17.67 and thinking that Lucy had to give up his bearishness at that point. But because of his psychological dysfunction he didn't then and he never will. He's not a smart man - he's an emotionally disturbed man. It's Lucy and you who have been wrong ever since. Your egos are so tiny though that you have had to make up your own incorrect versions of my purchases. More laughs. ]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374280799957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 20:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374280936539-313</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's $900 Million ARM Blunder</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374277978667</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:52:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What about the blunder of Intel acquiring McAfee for $7.7B ?"
