This caused GM for last 3 quarters to drop below 60% and resulted in the lower-than-usual earnings. Starting this quarter, GM will be back to normal (above 60%) and Intel is expected to earn $0.65 (Q3) and $0.74 (Q4) (See article by Russ Fischer). This means we should see plenty of ANALyst upgrades coming after earnings release next Wednesday (current estimate for Q3 is $0.50). Compare Intel to Cisco, which has EPS of $1.75 to Intel's $2.00. Which out of these two companies will more likely double in revenue in the next couple of years? Intel is taking major market share in the tablet market this year with Bay Trail, and smartphone market next year with Merrifield. Intel is also going into other markets such as SSD, wearable devices, foundry, Intel TV set-top box, etc. On top of this, expect Intel's server market to grow in double digits and tradition computer markets start growing again with Haswell/Broadwell introduction. Cisco stock price currently at $25.16 while INTC is at $23.13. I think Intel is extremely undervalued here.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373429646873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373429809458-6</Id><Topic><Title>Would some clueless clone please answer the question.

They could machine-gun knowledge and information instead of smack and yadda, yadda, yadda something about the past. Whoever has the best information wins. It won't be the shills. They don't have any information. The analysts stock-in-trade is misinformation. Those who buy it deserve their fate. The war ended with Intel's release of volume production of FinFET. A remarkable achievement of monumental proportions. Since then we've just been watching it play out. Intel has FinFET. ARM doesn't. And won't for so long that it won't matter if and when they do. The tipping point has been reached and the ARM era draws to a close faster and faster. ARM dropped again today after having been propped up by 2 bucks since it's 14 buck plummet. Wall Street did its best to adjust for its bad judgment on both ARM and Intel. But now it's all about earnings. In general expectations for earnings season are extremely low. I expect positive surprises. Especially on guidance.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373431522219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373432015934-8</Id><Topic><Title>WHATS GOING ON?????</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368550155862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:49:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NRTY</Msg><Username>david_roth212</Username><Timestamp>1373432015934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373432144249-9</Id><Topic><Title>Who is right?</Title><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1373422983077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 22:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stocks are like poker.

The digital revolution is only in the third inning, in my estimate. The demand for speed/power as it plays against bandwidth efficiency changes the evolving landscape.

Many that argue that the PC is dead assume declining 1H sales are purely from lack of demand and fail to recognize the negative impact Microsoft's failed Win8 launch had on traditional PC sales as well as other factors including the economy and product cycle. 2. The fallacy with the PC cannibalization argument is that for substitution to occur the tablet owner would no longer need their notebook. Very few people are able to trade their desktop/notebook for a tablet and accomplish the same tasks. Even most of the new Windows tablets are 32 bit and not able to substitute for tasks requiring a 64 bit system. Unless one has a 64 bit Haswell tablet (which produces the same net revenue to Intel as a notebook) it isn't going to replace a notebook. 3. The analyst's last complaint about Intel's financial future was his concern for Intel's server market three years out but he gave no reason why Intel's profits would be threatened in that space. The Evercore guy was just repeating reworked variations of existing FUD while ignoring important forces influencing the industry.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1373461173694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 08:59:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373461305330-38</Id><Title>The talking heads mouthing off aren't short....</Title><Msg>.........they want to buy Intel as low as possible.

Inventory for the back-to-school season of 2013 are 30-40% lower than those in previous years, according to sources from channel retailers. The sources pointed out that mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, are still more attractive to consumers than notebooks, causing many retailers to compete through price cuts; however, this can only result in profit declines and impact the industry as a whole. Currently, new notebook models have about a 20-30% price gap compared to older models, and the percentage may break 30% during the back-to-school season. Intel puts OEM-use Haswell CPUs in retail channels Monica Chen, Taipei; Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 10 July 2013] As PC vendors' procurements of Haswell CPUs, including Core i5 and Core i7, have been far short of original expectations, Intel has released the processors for retail sale in the DIY market at prices US$20-30 lower than corresponding DIY retail prices, which has put the market in disorder, according to Taiwan-based retail channels. Intel declined to comment. Since PC vendors are not seeing a rise in consumer demand for the third quarter, the traditional peak season, while they still have high Ivy Bridge inventories, most of them have cut their Haswell-based PC projects despite Intel offering cheaper Haswell processors. To prevent CPU inventories from impacting its second wave of CPU shipment plans in July and August, Intel has dumped stock into retail channels worldwide, causing significant damage to channel distributors, which still have high CPU inventories, the sources noted.

Here is the bear case as I understand it: 1. Folks are no longer going to be buying many PC's. The PC is dying and preference being tablets and small devices. This is INTC biggest market and they make a lot of money here. This equals less profits for them. 2. INTC continues to have to spend more and more money on equipment to keep ahead of other vendors (CAPEX) otherwise they risk falling behind. 3. Even if INTC manages to get into tablets and phones (bears doubt they will win much market share) the profit margin is much less then the PC. The Evergreen Analyst essentially gives this same bear case, although I didn't hear him mention CAPEX which seems to be more of a GS thing. You will see the GS analyst very obsessed with this every quarterly report. The bear case that the Evergreen analyst is nothing new and he really is just restating an old bear script that I laid out for you above. Now I could give you a bunch of reasons why the bear case is incorrect but the point of my post is to say that the bear case is getting pretty tired and they have to keep refreshing their arguments but they are basically the same.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1373464621119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373464642787-97</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is extremely cheap right now</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373429646873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:14:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great great post</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373464642787</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:57:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373464716608-98</Id><Topic><Title>Imminent and Tragic Death of ARMH and QCOM....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1373420378744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 21:39:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agree</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373464716608</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:58:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373464767979-99</Id><Title>haswell not selling well</Title><Msg>as the masses migrate to google chromebooks, ipads and whatnots. windows is in slow decline ARM chips from QUALCOMM are cheap and that's what the masses want, cheap. look for intc to break below 20 sooner rather than later. hope that helps. have a nice day.</Msg><Username>zillionaire_investor</Username><Timestamp>1373464767979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373464816023-100</Id><Topic><Title>Refresh Cycle For Servers Is Three Years....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1373417107875</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 20:45:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>make sense to me</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373464816023</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373464861818-101</Id><Title>Might As Well Relax</Title><Msg>All about earnings now...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373464861818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373464935934-102</Id><Topic><Title>Might As Well Relax</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373464861818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll hold you to it.</Msg><Username>agamemnus_0</Username><Timestamp>1373464935934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:02:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373464942137-103</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia Does The Right Thing, Ditches Windows RT</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373427883001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nokia tablet with Bay Trail and a "special" keyboard cover, will be a major competitor in the tablet market</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373464942137</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:02:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373465026990-104</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation Has Big Plans For Asia</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373416250102</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 20:30:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds great</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373465026990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373465027610-105</Id><Title>"Apple's Haswell-powered 15" MacBook Pro revealed in benchmark test"</Title><Msg>"A system appearing to be Apple's next-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, featuring a quad-core Haswell processor clocked at 2.4 gigahertz, has appeared in an online benchmark test. The Geekbench result for a machine identified as "AAPLJ45,1" was spotted on Tuesday by MacRumors. The test machine features 16 gigabytes of RAM and was spotted running OS X 10.9 Mavericks Build 13A2052. The machine earned a Geekbench score of 12,497, which is comparable with current-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro models. It's likely that any MacBook Pros with Haswell would see improvements in battery life rather than horsepower, as already seen in the new Haswell-equipped MacBook Air models. The CPU found in the assumed pre-release MacBook Pro is an Intel Core i7-4950HQ. Intel's latest-generation Core i7 mobile chips feature Iris 5200 graphics. The Iris moniker launched by Intel this year is a way for the chipmaker to differentiate its premium integrated graphics from the traditional "Intel HD" solution. Iris 5200 is Intel's top-of-the-line GPU option, intended to compete with Nvidia's GeForce GT 650M, a discrete GPU currently found in the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro. Last month, Geekbench tests also revealed what appears to be a next-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel's Haswell. That system, which featured a Core i5-4258U processor clocked at 2.4 gigahertz, earned a score of 7,140." source: appleinsider</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1373465027610</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373465321670-106</Id><Topic><Title>This is my favorite quote from Paul Otellini re: TMSC and 22nm and smaller production</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372898201500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:36:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is an interesting story floating on the web about "copying exactly". Intel likes to get one fab up and running with an acceptable yield and then they exactly copy that fab somewhere else. In this case, the initial fab was in Oregon and the exact copy fab was in Chandler, Arizona. When they say "exact copy", they mean it. The paint, the outfits, the gloves --- everything is exactly copied. No matter what they did, they couldn't get the Chandler fab to match the yield of the Oregon fab. Then someone decided that the dry air of Chandler didn't "copy exactly" the moist air of Oregon. In Oregon, they dehumidify before the air enters the fab. So, to duplicate this, they first humidified the air going into the Chandler fab and then dehumidified it. Voila, the yields now matched. The culprit was the dehumidifying process which alters the air's chemistry very slightly. It doesn't just take out the moisture but somehow takes out a slight bit of another element. I'm sure I've butchered this story to some extent so it is worth tracking down. The question this poses --- If Chandler has a problem copying Oregon, then how can TSMC copy Intel? If "copying exactly" becomes more essential as we travel down the nodes, and even two fabs with the same leadership and full cooperation and shared information have trouble matching each other, how-in-hell is the rest of the world outside of Intel going to ride their coattails?</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1373465321670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373465331163-107</Id><Topic><Title>EVERYONE READ ARTICLE "Intel: Second Quarter And Second Half 2013"</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1373289027627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 09:10:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Russ Fisher's article is on Seeking Alpha.

I think the drop in GM was due to a ramp of 14nm, as you suggested and 450 MM wafers. This was a one time deal. The manufacturing efficiency will improve GM going forward and this was implied in the last CC at the end of the quarter but the GS analyst kept trying to argue with Stacy and I think some folks missed this. In any case, I am expecting 60% GM this quarter and if you do the math you see that the analyst estimates are too low.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1373465795261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373465982406-110</Id><Topic><Title>Might As Well Relax</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373464861818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, given the drop meaningfully below 24, may as well keep riding it down and hoping for a bounce. one thing for certain, not one of your pump filled posts has helped the price.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1373465982406</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373466070703-111</Id><Topic><Title>Might As Well Relax</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373464861818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, you should relax now and stop pumping as it clearly hasn't worked.

Death knell sounding for Microsoft's Windows RT The death knell is sounding for Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows RT operating system. But will the Redmond, Wash.-based software company give up or keep performing CPR on it? Launched eight months ago with Microsoft's Surface tablets, Windows RT was touted as the first version of Windows written to run on low-power ARM (ARMH)-based processors. However, Windows RT can only run specially written programs, so software made for Windows PCs is not compatible with it. And the number of Windows RT software apps remains limited. Intel (INTC) has since launched its "Clover Trail" Atom system-on-a-chip, which can provide battery life comparable to that of ARM chips. And Clover Trail chips can power tablets running full versions of Windows, making Windows RT irrelevant. Later this year, Intel will launch its "Bay Trail" Atom chips, which promise even better performance and battery life. Now, Nokia (NOK) reportedly has canceled plans to come out with a Windows RT tablet, opting to make a full Windows tablet instead, the Verge reported Tuesday. Nokia has been a die-hard supporter of Microsoft's mobile software, going all in on Windows Phone for its smartphones. So if it is bailing on Windows RT, the future can't be too bright for the fledgling operating system.

Buy and large, corporations still buy PC's in large numbers. I think a bad economy over the past year has made PC sales look worse then they actually are. Many orgs like ours put off purchases as the economy soured so this was at least as much an economic event as it was a structural PC sales event. Now our org is buying desktop computers with a vengeance. With the economy improving I expect PC sales to perk up. The problem with the analysts they have fooled themselves and others into believing that it is mostly a structural shift from PC to portable devices and that may be true to some degree but I think the shift is pretty exaggerated.

Acer has upgraded its M5 Series family of notebooks with a system that is powered by Intel’s new “Haswell” chips, and it appears that Lenovo may not be far behind. Acer officials on July 9 unveiled the Aspire M5-583P-6428, which includes Intel’s fourth-generation Core i5 processor and the chip maker’s Wireless Display (WiDi) technology. In addition, the new notebook has an improved sound system. For its part, Lenovo reportedly is preparing to release a new notebook, the ThinkPad T440s Ultrabook, which also will be powered by a Haswell chip. The company—the world’s second-largest PC maker, behind Hewlett-Packard—is building out a page on its Website featuring the T440s, and the partial page has been seen by such tech sites as Liliputing and Endgadget.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373503289876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 20:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373503329092-300</Id><Topic><Title>Acer, Lenovo unvail Haswell</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373503289876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 20:41:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel officials had been talking about the company’s Haswell architecture for months, leading up to its launch at the Computex 2013 show in June. At the time, a range of system OEMs—including HP, Dell and Lenovo—said PCs and Ultrabooks with the new chips were on the way. The 22-nanometer Haswell architecture promise greater performance and power efficiency than the current “Ivy Bridge” offerings, and significantly improved graphics capabilities. Intel officials targeted the first of the Haswell chips not only at traditional notebooks, but also emerging form factors, such as Ultrabooks as well as hybrids and convertibles, which can be used as either laptops or tablets. Haswell is part of a larger planned rollout of products that Intel officials hope will give the company greater traction in the booming mobile device space, where most tablets and smartphones are powered by systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) designed by ARM and made by such partners as Samsung, Qualcomm and Nvidia. Acer’s new laptop is designed to give customers a good package of features in a cost-effective form, according to Scott Ledterman, vice president of U.S. consumers sales for the company. “It’s a compelling solution for those wanting the latest and greatest features without breaking the bank,” Ledterman said in a statement. The Acer notebook is less than an inch thin, offers a new metal chassis with what company officials called “clean, modern lines,” and a “soft touch” finish on the bottom, which they said makes it easier to hold and carry. It includes a backlit keyboard to make it easier to type in dim lighting, and a high-definition, 15.6-inch touch-screen display.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373503329092</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 20:42:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373503379218-301</Id><Topic><Title>Acer, Lenovo unvail Haswell</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373503289876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 20:41:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It brings 8GB of memory, a 500GB hard drive, and a PowerSmart battery that offers up to 6.5 hours of battery life and can last up to four years.

The Aspire M5-583P-6428 is available now at Best Buy stores in the United States, starting at $699.99.

Near-term traders are looking for the equity to continue this momentum over the next week and a half, targeting a move back above $24. Nearly 15,000 July 24 calls have gone off for a VWAP of $0.17. Implied volatility has jumped 2.2 percentage points, suggesting that some of these calls are being purchased. Based on the VWAP, the expectation is for INTC to rise 4.4% from its current perch at $23.16 to land above breakeven at $24.17. However, calls have been in order in INTC's options pits of late. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the stock's 10-day call/put volume ratio of 2.24 ranks higher than 82% of similar readings taken in the past year. In other words calls have been bought to open over puts at an accelerated clip in recent weeks.
