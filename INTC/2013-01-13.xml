I am not suggesting that anything is amiss but I will feel more comfortable when the results are official. There is a 13min Youtube video about a Huawei published result that will give you an idea of some of the lengths that companies will go to get a higher score. The Huawei phone had been tested with class libraries that had been optimized for benchmarks. At 11:33 into the video, they show the contents of the libaries and they point out specialized code for a number of routines that they imply are "overtuned". Interestingly, you can see other words in this list of tuned codes. One that was interesting benchmark word was "coremark" in the middle of the screen. If they were running overtuned codes for AnTuTu, then might they be doing the same for other benchmarks. Google for more information: Huawei Honor 2 cheating to get higher score in AnTuTu Benchmark AGAIN, I am not suggesting anything wrong.

Their days are certainly numbered. TI cuts 1,700 jobs in OMAP shift Dylan McGrath 11/14/2012 6:50 PM EST SAN FRANCISCO—Texas Instruments Inc. said Wednesday (Nov. 14) it will cut about 1,700 jobs worldwide as part of a previously disclosed plan to re-target R&amp;D for its OMAP product line at the embedded systems market, away from smartphones and tablets. Executives from TI (Dallas) said in September that the company would shift its R&amp;D investment on the OMAP applications processor to focus on the embedded market, where they said the product line has an opportunity to capture a greater share of what it estimates to be an $18 billion market. The announcement that TI would refocus OMAP caught many off guard because the product had notched a number of high-profile design wins. But analysts, particularly Will Strauss of Forward Concepts, said the trend in smartphones is toward integration of the applications processor and baseband processor—a trend TI can't keep up with because it began phasing out its baseband technology years ago. At the time, TI also noted that Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.—which together dominate the smartphone and tablet markets—design their own applications processors, leaving less of an available market for OMAP to compete in.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358066027378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 03:33:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358067271608-8</Id><Title>CES 2013: 5 Dumbest Ideas</Title><Msg>iPotty The iPotty is a training toilet onto which parents can attach an iPad.

Posted January 13, 2013. The Microsoft Surface Pro tablet is set to release in "late January" -- can we have a specific day already?? -- and the anticipation is running high, something Microsoft needs after the mild reaction to Windows 8 and lame PC sales for 2012. But don't we already have a Surface tablet? Well yes, but the $500 Surface RT running the ARM-based Windows RT doesn't have the horsepower of the upcoming Surface Pro. Not that it needs it. Surface RT is designed not to run any Windows legacy desktop software such as Photoshop and Outlook. It's essentially an app store-based consumption device in the same vein as the iPad, just with more ports. The Surface Pro is a whole lot more. David Pogue of the New York Times gave the Surface Pro a mostly glowing first impressions review -- he only had an hour or so with it – applauding it as a speedy multi-touch tablet with all the specs of a PC that can run all legacy Windows desktop software. It comes with the Professional version of Windows 8 so it's directed at enterprises and SMBs. And what really makes the Surface the Surface is the snap-on keyboard cover, whether it’s the flat, clothy Touch Cover ($120) or the more authentic Type Cover ($130). Microsoft Surface Pro Indeed the Surface Pro does shake up the tablet vs. laptop debate, and is something bold and new. However, the argument that the Surface Pro can replace both a tablet and a PC at once does not hold much water. Why? It's mostly because of the Pro's high price, but also its inability to satisfy what people have come to love about the modern tablet and the modern ultrabook. It's trying to be two conflicting things at once, and there's no strong evidence that tech-savvy users even want their tablet and laptop to be mashed up in the same device, although that does seem convenient on the, um, surface. The tablet-craving public has fallen hard for super-lightweight devices with 10-hour battery life and app stores where you will always find the app you're looking for. You can put a tablet in your coat pocket or a slim bag. Android, and more so iOS on the iPad, have been dominating the tablet market. And the iPad is increasingly finding its way into enterprises as IT departments figure out ways to make it work as a business device. The Surface Pro, on the other hand, will only have four hours of battery life due to its power-consuming Intel Core i5 processor and will be expensive at $899 for 64GB and $999 for 128GB – and that's not including the $100-plus keyboard-cover. Also, compared to the small and sleek tablet form factor of the 7.9-inch iPad Minis and 7-inch Kindle Fires, the Surface Pro is too big for brisk tablet-like portability at 10.6 inches. On top of that, the Windows Store is still lacking in app quantity and quality compared to Android and iOS -- although it is growing. Microsoft Surface Pro Pricing Not in Touch With Reality Windows 8 Can't Afford to Fail Like Vista The Surface also stumbles as a laptop/ultrabook replacement for business users. Most workers will need to use the "Desktop" mode of the two-headed Windows 8 much of the time. Yet multi-touch on a standard desktop UI simply Does. Not. Work. Desktop apps and traditional browsers were not designed for touch navigation unless you want to use your pinky finger and be consistently frustrated. So for the Surface desktop UI to be useful for productivity you would need the Touch or Type Cover and a mouse. A business user would need the Office 2013 suite, which you would also have to buy because it does not come free on the Surface Pro. And let's face it, most business users are going to need more than 64GB, so the more expensive 128GB version is preferable. Before you know it you're paying about $1,200 for the Surface Pro. For $200 or $300 less you could buy a sleek Windows 8 touchscreen ultrabook or hybrid from the likes of HP, Sony or Toshiba with a bigger screen, much more storage, an actual keyboard and better battery life. Maybe Microsoft should have just designed the Surface Pro as an actual ultrabook; it doesn't have the specs of any tablet I've ever seen so marketing it as a tablet feels false. I don't mean to cut down the Surface Pro before it's even released. It certainly merits a chance to win over businesses and consumers and it might have the flexibility to change user behavior. But don't be surprised if the Surface Pro ends up stuck in purgatory because it tried to solve too many problems at once.</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1358100953787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:15:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358101861678-16</Id><Title>I think the dell Latitude will sell a lot of units.

The first laptop I owned was a ThinkPad T20, and the next one may very likely be the ThinkPad Helix which Lenovo unveiled at CES 2013. In a sea of touch-inspired Windows 8 hardware, it’s the first ultrabook convertible with a form factor that gets everything right. The Lenovo Thinkpad Helix The first batch of Windows 8 ultrabooks get high marks for their inspired designs, but aren’t quite flexible enough to truly be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) solutions. Lenovo’s own IdeaPad Yoga came close, but the sensation of feeling the keyboard underneath your fingers when transformed into tablet mode was slightly jarring. Dell‘s XPS 12 solved that problem with its clever rotating hinge design, but I wanted the ability to remove the tablet display entirely from both of those products. Final Review: Dell XPS 12 Convertible Ultrabook Jason Evangelho Jason Evangelho Contributor Enter the ThinkPad Helix with its “rip and flip” design. Aside from its pedigree of simply being a ThinkPad (I will forever prefer that red TrackPoint to any other pointing device, and their keyboards are exceptional), it improves on the Yoga by boasting a detachable keyboard dock. The 11.6″ display can then be removed and used as a standalone tablet with 1920 x 1080 resolution. The dock interface also allows the Helix to enter “Stand Mode” and collapse all the way down on top of the keyboard — covering it, which was my sole complaint with the IdeaPad Yoga. A Lenovo rep demonstrates the Thinkpad Helix A Lenovo rep demonstrates the Thinkpad Helix | Photo: Jason Evangelho Aside from its versatility, the Helix has plenty going for it in the specs department. It has mini DisplayPort and mini-HDMI out to satisfy both business users and home consumers. It will ship with 3rd generation Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processors and up to a 256GB SSD (Solid State Drive). Connectivity seems guaranteed with 3G, 4G, or 4G LTE SIM card slots. The Helix even includes NFC and a digitizer pen that supports Windows 8 gestures and converts your handwritten notes into digital text. Combined battery usage is rated at 10 hours — 5 hours from the tablet battery, and an additional 5 with the keyboard dock. Aside from the tech specs, the ThinkPad Helix packs in all of the security and manageability features one expects from Lenovo, and even though the company seems to be marketing this toward business users, the Helix hits every checkbox on my wishlist for a reliable productivity and writing machine. The ThinkPad Helix should launch sometime in February at an entry MSRP of $1499.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1358108832287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 15:27:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358109386955-23</Id><Title>Stop the presses an Article about Intel's superior Fabrication</Title><Msg>Will Its Google Partnership Save this Chip Maker? By Doug Ehrman January 11, 2013 Let's revisit an ongoing catalyst from the reinvigoration of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) . About this time last year, Intel and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) announced a non-exclusive multiyear strategic relationship to push Intel atom chips in Android-based smartphones. Fast forwarding to the fall, when Google's Motorola Mobility announced the release of the Razr line of devices. The U.S. version, the Motorola Droid Razr M, would get the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) snapdragon chip, and the Droid Razr I that would be sold overseas would carry Intel hardware. At the time of the Droid Razr release, it was speculated that Intel would look to roll out a 4G LTE chip in early 2013 that was more capable of competing with the Qualcomm chips. LTE capabilities made the decision an easy one for Motorola on the U.S. devices, where this functionality is critical. By Christmas, DIGITIMES was reporting that Intel was planning the release of a brand-new smartphone platform in an effort to compete more directly with both Qualcomm and ARM Holdings on design. As Intel continues to press hard on the smartphone and mobile markets, the shares that were down nearly 16% in 2012 look like a solid value and a buy for your portfolio. Focus on Android When you consider the dominance of the Android operating system on a global basis, the decision by Intel to forge a close relationship with Google makes a lot of sense. According to research firm IDC, Android commands an impressive 68.3% of the global smartphone market as of 2012. This compares to 18.8% for Apple's iOS and 2.06% for Windows-based phones. While this lead is expected to drop to 63.8% by 2016, even with iOS ticking up to 19.1% by that time, Android is the top player. Android's importance, particularly outside of the U.S. where the LTE capability is less important at this point, should allow Intel to continue to build market share. Travis McCourt of Raymond James explains that "there are parts of the world where a smartphone is simply a touch screen with an effective web browser, and in those parts of the world, Android is dominating." The fact that the Intel x86 architecture is becoming an increasingly viable and competitive option for smartphone makers should make a big difference for the company heading into this year. Indications point to significant efforts from both Intel and Google to make this a reality, and illustrate the depth of the growing relationship between the two firms. A slow start While the lack of a LTE option from Intel (to date) has led to a slow start for chipzilla in the smartphone arena, it is achieving critical strategic events. The inclusion of the company's Medfield chip in the Razr I may have failed to produce "huge shipment volumes," but it provided Intel with a solid base upon which to build. The company needed to show that it had a system on a chip that was capable of competing with ARM, and the chip was successful in establishing this in the marketplace. You may recall the skepticism with which the entire Android platform was initially viewed when it was first introduced. Google demonstrated then, as it may demonstrate with its partnership with Intel, that steadily building a presence in the market is a more successful approach that shooting to unseat the top contender out of the gate. ARM designs -- particularly those put together in collaboration with Apple -- and Qualcomm Snapdragon LTE-integrated chips are leading the way, but Intel should not be overlooked. One of the critical areas of differentiation that may allow Intel to get meaningfully into this fight is the company's expertise and talent in fabrication. Where Qualcomm and NVIDIA must each rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for fabrication, Intel is a runaway leader in this department. Qualcomm's reliance on a partner for its fabrication needs caused it significant problems last year. Both companies, plus Apple, had pushed the manufacturer to allot dedicated fabrication plants to each company's respective efforts; these requests were refused. In a recent speech at the Consumer Electronics Show, Qualcomm's president and COO, Steve Mollenkopf, said he does not expect shortage issues to repeat, but it is an area to pay attention to moving forward. Overall, Intel's close working relationship with Google has already been a positive catalyst for the chip maker in its efforts to become significant in the smartphone market. If Intel is able release a viable LTE option this year, maybe even having it included in the rumored Google X-Phone, the company should become a serious contender in the space. Given this effort, as well as Intel's diversified talents, the stock is a buy in my eyes for your portfolio for 2013.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1358109386955</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 15:36:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358118938714-24</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft exec doesn't rule out Intel-based Windows Phones</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1358030704303</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:45:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An Intel based phone with Windows is a given. It may or may not be made by Microsoft. It will most likely happen when Intel hits 14nm because Intel's performance trajectory will permit a smartphone to run legacy Windows apps with native x86 performance. Legacy Windows apps may run inside a virtual machine on the smartphone for ultimate portability and that will make sense when the smartphone carries as much horsepower as today's tablet or laptop. With WiGiG and other high speed interfaces one can plug take their desktop, their apps and their files with them and easily connect into keyboards, large monitors and accessories.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358118938714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:15:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358120230167-25</Id><Title>Lenovo K900 - Need this tall, skinny hottie in my pants</Title><Msg>Something tells me that Intel is going to announce the most unbelievable Motorola phone to ever be seen at Mobile World Congress. +++++++++++++++++++++++++ Lenovo K900 Hands-On: This Tall, Skinny Hottie Needs to Get In My Pants Mario Aguilar The Lenovo K900 is a big phone, yes, but it's a designy big phone. It's handsome, skinny, and slick like the finest smartphones ever made. We never thought we would be into a 5.5-inch phone until the K900's brushed metal back landed in our hands. This phone is all about the hardware. The unibody construction is completely smooth and flat, unlike other large, long phones. In fact, Lenovo says that at just 6.9mm thick, it's the thinnest in its class. It weighs just 5.7 ounces. The Full HD, 400ppi screen is amazingly satisfying. As you can see in the images, the IPS display blends beautifully with the black bezel. On the reverse, the back panel is totally without bumps, which is impressive on such a slim construction. Not even the camera pokes out. (Speaking of the camera: it shoots with a 13-megapixel Sony Exmor sensor and has a super fast f/1.8 lens.) The K900 runs an Intel Atom z2580 processor, and it was wasn't final so we don't know anything about performance. Sadly, we don't even know what operating system the phone will run, let alone when I'll be able to see if it fits into my skinny pants. In fact, if Lenovo's previous Intel-based handset is any indication, we may never see the K900 stateside; as last year's K800, Lenovo has so far only announced plans to sell the handset in China, starting this April.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358120230167</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:37:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358122246503-26</Id><Title>Q4 computer sale 2% lower than the expedition</Title><Msg>How will this impact INTC Q4 sales and Q1 forecast?</Msg><Username>gh0613</Username><Timestamp>1358122246503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 19:10:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358122794470-27</Id><Topic><Title>Q4 computer sale 2% lower than the expedition</Title><Username>gh0613</Username><Timestamp>1358122246503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 19:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOOK OUT BELOW!!!</Msg><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1358122794470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 19:19:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358127198755-28</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's North Cape Haswell detachable reference design video</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1358031755493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:02:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get it out soon enough before my son breaks his Sandy Bridge laptop?</Msg><Username>only_paper_money</Username><Timestamp>1358127198755</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 20:33:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358127812060-29</Id><Topic><Title>Q4 computer sale 2% lower than the expedition</Title><Username>gh0613</Username><Timestamp>1358122246503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 19:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How will this impact INTC Q4 sales and Q1 forecast?"

Cool...] Intel released its first Next Unit of Computing system last year, and it seems that the 4 x 4-inch computer was enough of a success that Intel is ready to introduce new models. The Tech Report managed to talk to Intel on the CES show floor, and the x86 chip-maker is planning as many as three new models for release later this year. Intel is reportedly planning a cheaper model as well as two higher-performance models. The former is a NUC system that switches out the current-generation’s Core i3-3217U processor for a cheaper Celeron 847 chip. While the Core i3-3217U is a dual core part with HyperThreading clocked at 1.8GHz. It is a 22nm, 17W part with 3MB of cache. On the other hand, the Intel Celeron 847 CPU that will allegedly be at the heart of the next NUC is an older 32nm chip with two physical cores, no HyperThreading, 2MB of cache, and a clockspeed of 1.1GHz. It does retain the same 17W TDP, but it is an older and slower part (and cheaper as a result). This new NUC is said to be available for around $220 with a Thunderbolt port or $190 without Thunderbolt. That makes it as much as $100 cheaper than the current-generation NUC that we reviewed in December 2012. In addition to the Celeron-powered model, Intel is also ramping up the performance with a Core-i5 powered NUC due in April 2013. There is no word on pricing but it should be available for purchase sometime in April 2013. It will have USB 3.0, triple monitor, and vPro support. The article in question was not clear on whether the Core i5 NUC will keep the Thunderbolt port in addition to USB 3.0 or if it will simply be swapped out. One concern I have is heat as the Core i5 chip will be faster and run hotter than the Core i3-3217U. With the current generation NUC, there were issues of heat that caused the system to hard lock during large file transfers over the network. Granted that particular issue is thought to be caused from heat generated by the NIC and SSD heat causing a component to overheat, but any new/additional heat (like that of a faster CPU) in the same NUC form factor may be problematic. Here’s hoping that Intel has found a way to resolve the overheating issue with the new 2013 models. Finally, Intel is reportedly also planning to release a Haswell-powered processor in Q4 of this year. IT seems that Intel is preparing a trifecta of NUCs aimed at lower cost, higher performance, and higher efficiency (Haswell) respectively.

Below is an astute assessment of the server/data center potential...] *** Of 2011's operating income, 25% came from the DCG while the remaining came from the PC Client Group. However, if by 2016 Intel can double the business, even if all other segments remain flat (which is an entirely unrealistic assumption), then total operating income will grow by 25% by 2016 from 2011 levels. Conclusion Do not overlook the growth in the server room, in the cloud, in storage, and in networking that we will see at Intel. Keep in mind that Intel has an operating segment that is, quite frankly, a superstar. Ultimately, I expect Intel to continue to grow for the foreseeable future on both the top and bottom lines, and I expect the dividend to be raised, if anything. This growth does not include any potential win in the "Atom" space (tablets, smartphones, etc.), nor does it account for growth in the PC space or even the software/services division.
