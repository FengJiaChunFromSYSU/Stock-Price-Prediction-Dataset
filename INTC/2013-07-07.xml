In addition to retaining the celebrated characteristics of the previous model, the new S7 Ultrabook has improved battery life for all-day computing, a refined electroluminescent (EL) backlit keyboard for more natural typing, and 2nd generation Acer TwinAir cooling with less fan noise. In addition, it is equipped with wireless display (WiDi) technology for big-screen entertainment and productivity. “We designed the S7 to be the best touch Ultrabook in the world, bar none,” said Jim Wong, Acer Corporate President. “We listened carefully to users to find substantial ways to make it even better.” The re-engineered S7 delivers improved battery life of up to 7 hours, a 33% increase from its predecessor. Its new light-sensing EL backlit keyboard is also refined, with a deeper keystroke for more natural and comfortable typing. Plus, thanks to 2nd generation Acer TwinAir cooling technology, the noise at maximum load is more than 20% lower than the previous S7, keeping the system quiet and cool. Acer's new S7supports Intel WiDi technology, which allows users to extend their laptop screen to a TV or big screen without a cable. With this feature, S7 users can stream video on their living room screen and open a new window on their computer and to work, bringing a new dimension to multitasking. The Aspire S7-392 features Acer’s first 10-point touch WQHD display will also be available on the S7, with IPS technology squeezing a very impressive 2,560x1,440 resolution into a 13.3-inch screen. In addition, IPS technology shows consistent and accurate colors at viewing angles up to 170 degrees. Taking advantage of the touch benefits offered by Windows 8, the touch-enabled screen on the S7 can be opened a full 180°, and the image orientation reversed with a simple hotkey combination for easy touch-and-show sharing.</Msg><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373203766684</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373203782364-8</Id><Topic><Title>Acer's Flagship Ultrabook updated</Title><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373203766684</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This new S7 packs powerful technologies, including dual-array microphones and Acer's proprietary Purified Voice technology, which enhances speech performance and reduces noise for voice recognition and VOIP applications, making voice communication crystal clear. Moreover, it is powered by a 4th generation Intel Core processor and a RAID 0 solid state drive for fast wakeup and read/write times, as well as quietness. The S7 Ultrabook remains impressively slim and light, measuring only 12.9 mm thin and weighing 1.3 kg. It is constructed from premium materials and features a dual-torque, T-shape hinge frame design to ensure wobble-free touch use. Its Gorilla® Glass 2 surface is smooth to the touch, beautiful and thin, yet strong, scratch resistant, and easy to clean. The new S7 features a unibody design made from a single block of aluminum using a process that saves energy and material; the result is an ultra-thin chassis that is super tough and roadworthy.</Msg><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373203782364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373203946318-9</Id><Topic><Title>Merrifield will dominate smartphones the same way Bay Trail dominate tablets</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373179299666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 02:41:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, nice attempt at a spin there shorty.

They really aren't all the same. Most use the Sanforce controllers. The controllers need the firmware upgraded from time to time. This is where you really see the differences between them. Some of the Corsair SSD's need a huge work around in order to put the new firmware on it. OCZ is much better but requires backups and specialized Linux boot disks to run the updates Intel drives are simply the best. They have simply superior software that monitors the drive and can apply firmware updates within Windows. It monitors the drives health and runs TRIM on a regular basis. I am running a pair in RAID stripped. Flawless thus far. One thing about SSD drives that you need to keep in mind is that performance really suffers when its nearly full. Sometimes its best to backup the drive and then copy the data back over. If it's a Windows C drive it's often best to give a fresh install of Windows, especially if the C drive is very full. The 530 looks like a great drive, but just about any other Intel SSD drive is also great..

They do see the new Intel chips and are impressed. Yet they see Intel forever locked out of the tablet and phone markets. No matter say they that Intel makes better chips along as Apple, Samsung, and the others do not use them in phones and Tablets. Of course these were the same people saying that Intel could never ever make chips that would be able to cut power usage to the low levels needed. Now that Intel has done so, they simply say too late and Apple will not and neither will Samsung. But this is why in the end, the shorts will be made to look completely out of touch and mistaken in their beliefs. Thank you backpacker--"bacbacker • 9 hours ago Flag0 users liked this posts users disliked this posts 0 Reply When actual benchmarks comes in, it will be much more than 40%.At Intel's Silvermont presentation in May, Intel said Bay Trail will have "twice the performance at the same power level or 4.3x less power at the same performance" against *future* competition (this would include the snapdragon 800). I expect Bay Trail devices to be close to 2x better than snapdragon 800 devices when they arrive in a couple of months." Samsung has announced it is using Intel in Tablets. I say the Samsung phone could soon come after this but this is just speculation so I will stick to the Tablet win. This win is huge for Intel and will likely lead to the vast majority of Tablet makers using Intel CPUs. It is the shrink to 14nm along with the Intel Trigate that will put Intel in a place to completely take over as the leader of Phone and tablet chips. Then comes the shrink to 10 nm in 2015 which will end Arm based chips as a provider of high and mid level phones. So this is why I think the thought of the shorts that Intel is dead and on retreat is completely out of touch with reality.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1373212891617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 12:01:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373213644971-49</Id><Title>Way to go Goldman.

Just a clever way to make a simple "reiteration" sound worse. GS James Covello has a target price of $16 for Intel. $24 - $16 is 34%. This is not a surprise nor anything new. Covello has been down on Intel for over 2 years. GS lowered their target for Intel on Dec 3, 2012. Intel closed at $19.54 with adjusted close of $19.15 (that dividend stuff). Oooops. The GS original SELL rating by Covello occurred on May 19, 2011, when Intel closed at $23.88 which is adjusted close of $22.20. What Do These Downgrades Mean for Intel? By Meghan Foley December 01, 2012 This week, Goldman Sachs analysts maintained a Sell rating on the stock and lowered their price target from $20 per share to $16 per share. As the StreetInsider reported on Thursday, the Sell rating was based on “cyclical concerns” rather than a belief that personal computer industry is dying. Analysts at Sachs are worried that Intel has too much inventory on hand for current PC sales projections, which show a decline this year for the first time in a decade. If the company continues to have surplus inventory, Goldman Sachs expects margins to decrease for the next couple quarters.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373217045637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 13:10:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373217393205-58</Id><Title>Goldman Warns: We're Losing Our Rear-Ends On Our Intel Short Positions.

According to Skaugen, entry-level 2-in-1s should start at $400, while touch-enabled laptops are expected to start around $300, and both should be available around the holiday season.

We have had a large number of developments that have indicated and supported the conclusion that the ARM era is over but it's nice to get some hard facts. The Bay Trail performance results are the strongest indicator yet that Intel's mobility strategy has gotten enough traction to move past ARM in the marketplace. Given the strength of Intel's roadmap and pipeline, it is amazing that anyone would contest the end of the ARM era. There are, of course, the big Wall Street analysts but their motive in doing so is clear.

Mr. Murtazin has been very public about his possession of unauthorised Nokia property.

We have asked Mr. Murtazin for the return of all Nokia property in his possession. As he has declined to reply, we asked the Russian authorities to assist us. To be clear, we have no issue with individuals voicing their opinions about our company and our products. At Nokia, we pride ourselves on being an open and transparent company.

Essentially, these companies design and build devices for the major players such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Dell (DELL), Toshiba, and others and then these big names simply stamp their name on the device and sell it. The same thing will happen as tablets continue to become mainstream and continue to ship in high volume. Sure, Apple (AAPL) may have the largest individual tablet in terms of sales, but the overall tablet market will have a diverse range of products from countless vendors, all designed and built by Taiwan's ODMs. So, why does this matter? Simple. At Mobile World Congress, Intel made the following announcement: Intel is currently working with Compal*, ECS*, Pegatron*, Quanta*, and Wistron* to accelerate 'Bay Trail' tablets to the market. This means that every major ODM -- each of which has years of experience working with Intel on notebook, desktop, and server products -- will now be designing and building Intel-based tablets en masse. While the customers of these ODMs aren't exactly keen to go pre-announcing these new tablets while they still have current inventory to sell (and the big selling season is during the holiday rush anyway), those of us who paid attention at the recent Computex trade show saw a glimpse into the potential designs that these ODMs may be supplying to the big customers in time for the holiday launch.

Now, rather than tell you about them, I'd much prefer to show you. It's an iPad With Retina -- and Windows 8 Would you look at that? It's an iPad-like device (retina display included) that packs an Intel Bay Trail processor and runs Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 8. This device is from an ODM called CZC, and this firm is looking to sell this design to OEMs who want to bring it to market. Pretty nifty, right? Now the market segment of folks who wanted an iPad but really wanted the ability to run full Windows 8 is satisfied. Hey, Look, It's a Surface RT -- Except Better Many people said that they would love to buy a device that is as thin and as light as the Surface RT, but with the ability to run full Windows programs like on the Surface Pro (without the price tag of a Core processor). Looks like those customers now get their wishes: Ta-da! It's a Surface clone but running Intel's upcoming Bay Trail Atom. This means that it can run all of the programs that a Surface Pro can run, but it's going to offer all of the advantages that the RT model did in terms of weight/size. Another set of customers satisfied.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373241980018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 20:06:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373242045669-89</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Yes, It Will Take Over Tablets</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373241906365</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 20:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part III: Full Windows 8 in Your Hand? Well, we all know that the 7"-8" tablet market is growing like a weed, particularly as these devices are convenient to carry around, they're usually inexpensive, and they're becoming more fully featured. Well, it looks like with Bay Trail, Intel will be enabling its partners to put the entire Windows 8 platform into the palm of its customers' hands. The possibilities here are staggering; everybody can now have a full Windows 8 PC with a quad core, super fast Bay Trail for probably somewhere in the range of $200-$300, complete with Office. Will this be powerful enough to replace a high performance laptop or desktop? No, but when it comes to users for whom the iPad is dangerously close to "good enough," having a full Windows 8 system for the same price as an iPad is a compelling enough alternative to shift market and wallet share back in Intel's favor. Pretty nifty, right? More to Come There's a lot more coming, particularly as we get closer to the holiday selling season. No tablet vendor today really wants to make its current products look obsolete, so you will not see actual announcements that confirm this thesis until the device vendors are ready to sell the devices. Further note that Bay Trail will run Android just as well, so expect to see some nice designs running Android at the launch also. For Intel investors, understanding where the market is going (the market flooded with tablets from all of the major OEMs/ODMs) is much more important than looking at the landscape today. While Intel winning the iPad would be nice, it's simply not necessary for Intel to succeed wildly in this space. Intel will be detailing Bay Trail at the HotChips conference in August. This gives us a clue as to the time frame of the actual chip and design win announcements. Stay tuned.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373242045669</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 20:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373242985723-90</Id><Title>Coming Up</Title><Msg>Septermber 10-12: IDF 13 in San Francisco Every IDF Intel gets a boost and ARM gets thumped up as Intel provides more granularity on its roadmap and pipeline.

The ARM fans have their points and the things they post have made me stop and think. I don't mind being told I am wrong, as long a you can point out why. Ask my wife, I am frequently wrong. I think we need to consider how we treat people with opposing POV Think about Nenni. Though most people think he's space cadet TSMC pumper at least he has the nerve to come on here as himself and speak his mind. My view is let the haters hate on Intel. In the big picture they are meaningless. But people who talk trash about other people on here don't add to the conversation. Going forward I don't wish to add to that. worthless drama. The point is that how we treat others is indicative of how we perceive ourselves. As for the trolls on here, we have at least one, maybe as many as a few. These are powerless, meaningless people. Lets try to ignore them because what then need more than anything is an audience. Picking fights online makes them feel big because they can't do it in reality. They enjoy knowing that they've gotten under your skin. I love it when people get into heated debates on here. It's like having a favorite sports team and sparing with someone who is just as passionate about their team.

You have stated on more than one occasion that you will continue this potentially illegal behavior until people on this board start to post in a manner that you find to be acceptable. Your posting has become so offensive than I automatically just click on the abuse button in the hope that Yahoo will someday actually apply some standard of decent board behavior. And now you are off attacking someone else. You are the last guy in this country who would know what law-abiding behavior is. You exhibit all the traits of an online serial stalker.

So GM for last 3 quarters were as follows: 58%, 56% and 58% (estimate for Q2). Intel also said that by Q3, margins will be back to normal ( 60%). They also guided margins for 2013 to be 60%. This means Q3 and Q4's margins will average at least 63%. Revenue was guided for single digit growth, so will be at least $54 billion. This means revenue for Q3 and Q4 will average over $14.3 billion each. For comparison, in Q3 2011, Intel's revenue was $14.2 billion and GM was 63.4%. For that quarter, Intel earned $0.65. This is $0.15 above the current Q3 estimate!</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1373251089811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 22:38:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373251185194-125</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Yes, It Will Take Over Tablets</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373241906365</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 20:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bay Trail will have 2x times the performance of the snapdragon 800 (best of arm).

I will love to forward the one from last week that said you weren't religious. Be sure to include your name because I need to associate your online persona to your name. Think of how good you're going to look! You can tell them all about me and the noble crusade of good versus evil you've waged in the name of Jesus. Damn, I'm nearly crying, its so beautiful. That is, until they read some of the stuff you've written. When they've seen you carrying on like an eight grade girl, well, I'm sure it will raise some questions. I guess after all these years you thought you could get away with this forever. You felt that you can pick on people and call them names, and degrade them and yet you honestly believes that Jesus loves you? Honestly, is this Christianity? Do you honestly believe that because Jesus forgives you can do whatever the hell you want? Of all the stupid things you've done on here the most stupid is trying to pass yourself off as a Christian. The Christians I know don't live in fear of their online worlds and real life ever meeting. They take what the bible says as a way of leading their lives . You treat Christianity like an enema for your soul. I love that you're a Christian troll, trolling in the name of Jesus. I can't wait to hear you explain that one to your friends and family. They will tell you that they hate trolls and please leave Jesus out of it. Trust me, all the Christians on here cringe every time you bring up Jesus. So, please, by all means, bring it up constantly. Whatever you can do to make yourself more hated on here I'm all for!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373255220490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 23:47:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373255678631-143</Id><Topic><Title>vinnie_bagodonilz = intel_fanboy = LI Steve</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1373215144976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 12:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks Vinnie but sometimes I like tormenting small animals.
