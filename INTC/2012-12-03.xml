By David Shamah for Tel Aviv Tech | December 3, 2012 -- 12:05 GMT (04:05 PST) We're used to seeing the term 'Intel Inside' on a host of products – but could the Intel nameplate become a common sight on the outside of a product? In light of comments by Mooly Eden, Intel SVP and president of Intel Israel, it seems to be a prospect that's within the realm of possibility. "Today it is about more than the processor," Eden told an event in Tel Aviv last week. "It's more about a system and a usage model." Mooly Eden (Credit: Intel) Eden made the comments during a question and answer session that covered a wide range of topics, including Intel's activities in Israel, new products and technologies, and – the elephant in the Intel room these days – who will lead the company after the departure of Paul Otellini next year. Unsurprisingly, Eden didn't reveal who the leading candidate to take the top job might be, and dispelled rumours of specific names flying around online. "It's the job of the board of directors to make this decision and I am sure they will make the right one. They are already discussing the choices." Candidates from inside and outside the company are being considered, and of course Intel insiders are the most likely to be chosen. "Dadi [Intel SVP David Perlmutter]," who is Israeli, "is definitely a candidate," said Eden, to the cheers of the hometown crowd. But it was Eden's response to questions about Intel's plans in the mobile space that gave a more concrete hint to where the company's future may lie. "What are you planning to do about this?" asked an audience member, holding up an iPhone. "I've got the answer right here," Eden responded without missing a beat, as he whipped out a Motorola RAZRi device - among the first, but by no means last, smartphone to use Intel chips. So far, there are half a dozen Intel Inside smartphones, available in Europe and India - but expect to see a lot more in the coming months. "We are at least a year ahead of everyone else in the mobile space in processors and chips," said Eden. "If we can't grab a significant share of the market, it will be our own fault." 'Usage model' But Intel may be planning to go even further. "Today it's more about an overall system, a usage model," Eden said. "The tech culture in Israel has grown to be able to provide solutions for systems." Eden did not elaborate on what he meant by a "usage model," but the term has been bandied about by a number of companies, and could well refer to the hardware/software/cloud/marketing strategy popularised by Apple, in which users are locked into an 'ecosystem' controlled by the company. Read this A junior Silicon Valley: Microsoft Israel on start-ups, security and Steve Ballmer Read more If it's a model Intel is considering, it would be following in the footsteps of Microsoft. Traditionally primarily a software company, Microsoft has recently ramped up its hardware business, alongside its ongoing cloud and app store efforts. Microsoft has come to terms with the need to go for the "usage model", and is working on expanding its offerings. On his recent visit to Israel, Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said that "until now Microsoft has been about software, but now we have to look at devices. A lot of innovative technology is going to be delivered in devices, and a lot of that technology, regardless of the front end, is going to be a cloud service." This is the future of tech, said Ballmer, "and we aim to be in the forefront of this transition". If Intel has made a similar commitment, Eden did not specifically mention it. But it appears that Intel is planning to go beyond its current offerings, embracing new opportunities. The proof? In a side conversation, Eden mentioned that the company is planning a new device (I was asked not to reveal what kind of device, but it's definitely innovative and is far outside the company's usual suite of offerings) to which it is putting the finishing touches (the SDK is apparently already available to select developers). It's a consumer-oriented device, being developed at Intel Israel R&amp;D centre in Haifa, and will be unveiled at the CES trade show early next year. And the device will be a new one for Intel, so it may not be subject to deals the company has with manufacturers that already sell Intel-powered laptops and ultrabooks. Will this be the firm's first opportunity to introduce an 'Intel Outside' product?</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354543400301</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:03:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354543527590-18</Id><Topic><Title>And if Apple or Intel announce they won't be working together?</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1354543093545</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:58:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you sit on your fat can &amp; post fear mongering posts all day?

"Apple has a history of getting way too cocky for their own good--giving the entire industry the finger and making everything proprietary once they taste success. Without the switch to x86, we wouldn't even be having this conversation about Apple; it was the best decision the company ever made. If they switch all their products to a secret, blackbox custom ARM-derivative architecture, it's back to the PPC days of limited software, slower speeds and zero multiboot options. ARM may be good for power consumption on small devices, but x86 is mandatory for a real computery computer." "And to be honest, what the hell is wrong with some of you people? Why would you want Intel out of the Mac? Intel makes the best consumer CPU's in the world, hands down. There is ZERO competition, isn't Apple all about providing the best user experience? Intel CPU's give the Mac desktop and Laptops tons of performance, great battery life, and compatibility with multiplate OS's, if Apple replaced intel CPU's with some ****** in house ARM chip.

Second, i think the brokerage firms would notice the missing payment and would follow up. After all, they need to allocate the dividends to all their holders, as they are the holder of record of most stocks in their firm ("street name")... and they need to know whether to report "in iieu" payments. Their true dividends come from the company itself; I can't even imagine how they get other payments... other than true "in lieu" payments when THEY lent the shares. So prob'ly, if they think they have true shares, they will notice a shortage as they allocate them to the beneficial holders... maybe they contact the company, etc., at which time I would think the whole scheme would get exposed. I think having a naked short position is MOST vulnerable to exposure across a dividend for just this reason.</Msg><Username>bdsolomon</Username><Timestamp>1354545633377</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:40:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354545720279-27</Id><Title>RBC Capital Markets - Doug Freeman</Title><Msg>He's been around the block a few times..good analyst.

They're not some no-name benchmark off the street that would publish dubious numbers about such a reputed brand glibly. These numbers are consistent with the original numbers that came out for Medfield when Anandtech compared it with some of the other phones at the time and it came out middle of the pack. It seems to me, someone has influenced the benchmark creators into creating benchmarks that are heavy on Javascript and these have been favoring the Intel chips. That's why all these Intel obsessed technical commentators have started tooting Intel's horn on how they've suddenly caught up on power/performance. Otherwise, there's no change in the chip from the origional Medfield to the Razr i 2GHz version except for the clock and that is obviously at the expense of battery life. The Razr i for the record has a 40% bigger battery than the iPhone 5.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1354556451591</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:40:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354556642548-62</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola RAZR I finally is on Geekbench</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354554597279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:09:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yikes.....Marsavian can't spin that !

I just decided to point out the 10m share spike in Intel fails to deliver over the ex-dividend day and see if there was any problem.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1354556977180</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:49:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354557040435-66</Id><Topic><Title>INTC way undervalued</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354549531235</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 10:45:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you back out net cash CSCO looks like as good a buy or better than INTC.

The bulk of my holdings are in Intel; so I think I'm okay; but don't want to invest right now only to see it go lower - as many predict on the board. I think we are going to have a "real winner" here in Intel; but there are go guarantees. This market does seem manipulated. However the individual investors are aways the last to know. The "big boys" sway things as the like. We all know that. Sometimes "buy and hold" is the best thing to do and don't worry about the swings in price. However, my main concern as this stock as gone from $29 to $19 in what seems a heartbeat. When it reaches $20 - down we go away.

It's clear what happened. Blacks, hispanics and some white people put this loser back in the office. I'm of the mind if someone does a TERRIBLE job you need to replace them. Supervisor, manager, director and even President. That's the way it should be. It's no longer that way. It all depend on what you believe and with some the color of your skin. The point is we all have to live with it. It's stupid and it will come back to haunt America. If you voted for Obama to prove you're not racist the first time and you voted for Obama again the second time because you don't think he had time to screw things up even more then it's on you. Personally it's all good with me because when people ask me if I'm better off than I was four years ago I have to respond YES....I've bought 3 rent houses in forclosure for pennies on the dollar and I would love to pick up more on the cheap thanks to the economy. Just wish Barney Frank was coming back. The Dodd-Frank bill was what got it all started thanks to the compassionate Dems. I can easily see myself retiring in the next fout years thanks to the Dems.

There is a chance the new chips will be efficient enough to use in tablets, and let’s not forget that Microsoft is already using an Ivy chip in the Surface Pro. Intel is apparently trying to fill the gap between power efficient Z-series Atoms, which trade performance for efficiency, and proper Ivy-based processors with plenty of oomph for discerning consumers. Of course, the new chips have applications far beyond tablets, as they could end up in ultrabooks and other ultraportable devices. If Windows 8 tablets take off next year, power efficient Ivy Bridge parts could be in high demand.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1354582790961</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:59:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354582973404-139</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola RAZR I finally is on Geekbench</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1354554597279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:09:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where's Marsavian? lol</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1354582973404</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 20:02:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354586647408-140</Id><Topic><Title>re-INTEL WILL SEE A $18 HANDLE NEXT WEEK</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354582547953</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:55:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Handle?

By Sebastian Anthony on December 3, 2012 at 1:32 pm For me, though, the biggest giveaway that Freedman’s sources are incorrect is that tidbit about Intel forcing Apple to move its iPad to x86. It certainly makes sense from Intel’s perspective, which is desperately trying to break into the mobile market — now with Clover Trail, which is fairly exciting, and next year with Bay Trail, which will probably blow the doors off everything else on the market. I’m not sure if I can picture Apple splitting its iOS platform into two different architectures, though, just to get into bed with Intel. Maybe that’s the only option, though, if Apple really wants to drop Samsung and TSMC doesn’t have the capacity.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1354586763428</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 21:06:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354586869397-142</Id><Title>Did anybody get divident?</Title><Msg>According to INTEL website, the payout should be on 12/01/2012.

Either Apple moves iOS to x86 for both iPhone and iPad together or they don't. If Apple doesn't want to and only wants Intel's foundry service then would Intel do it with only 'the possibility' that this may open the door for Intel to have their x86 chips inside down the road? hmmm</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1354591185383</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 22:19:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354591392650-146</Id><Topic><Title>This guy doubts Apple and Intel, but says Bay Trail will probably be a show stopper for the market</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1354586763428</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 21:06:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Haswell will launch first half of 2013 (per last earnings conference call).
