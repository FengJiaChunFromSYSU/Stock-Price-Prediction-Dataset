In essence this is a question of money and judgement. Obviously the shorting is being driven by some of Wall Street's largest firms so let's conclude that they have deep pockets. So, what is really needed is an epiphany on Wall Street in which they correctly conclude that they have substantially mismanaged their evaluations of Intel's technology, manufacturing, fabrication, roadmap and pipeline. This is indeed the case. Shorts need to realize that they aren't ever going to get their money back and should really consider not throwing more good money after bad. That epiphany has already happened with ARM.

While I think that the new form factor is very interesting, I am also very pleased that Apple isn't letting up on the focus on performance, as the machine sports two top-of-the-line AMD (AMD) FirePro cards in addition to the top-of-the-line Xeon part. The Mac Pro was long overdue for an upgrade, and this certainly brings the machine up to speed. Isn't it funny, though, that Apple's most innovative products at WWDC weren't ARM based? Sure, iOS got an upgrade, but that's a pure software update. iOS finally brings us multitasking (Android has supported this forever) and the UI becomes prettier/sleeker. We did not get an announcement of a 20nm Apple A7, nor did we see Apple talk up an A6X based MacBook Air. Apple isn't stupid, and the company knows firsthand how painful it can be on the market segment share side of things to lag in performance and performance/watt, and in anything requiring serious horsepower -- from a MacBook Air to a Mac Pro -- Intel is the clear leader. Conclusion As I look at articles all over the web, I see authors tripping over themselves now to hype up Intel, when just six months ago these same individuals were claiming that ARM would take over the world and Intel's fabs would fill up with cobwebs. Well, the storm of nonsense is over, and it seems that all is once again right in the world. Apple's "A-series" chips were developed simply because no other vendor had a chip worthy of Apple's iOS products, but at the higher end, Intel is untouchable, and if Intel can produce a MacBook Air class chip with massive CPU and GPU performance and still allow for 10 hours of battery life, then a high end iPad with a "Core" processor inside is just a "tick" away.

Haswell is Intel’s new generation of Core computer processors – an entire new generation of chips poised to replace the long-running Ivy Bridge range. Intel claims Haswell is a giant stride up from its predecessor. It comes in desktop and mobile flavours, but it's the mobile ones that could shift the balance in the tablet and laptop power struggle. Seriously. That sounds serious. Tell me the good stuff. Where to start? Possibly their finest trait is power management. Haswell chips can shut down for nanoseconds between tasks, saving power even in the moments between you tapping keys on a keyboard. This means Haswell-toting laptops and tablets offer 50 percent more battery life than Ivy Bridge devices when in use, and around three times more in standby. Apple reckons its new 13in MacBook Air will keep its Haswell silicon juiced for up to 12 hours. haswell laptop ces 2012 The low power use makes them cooler, so you won’t get a Microsoft Surface Pro situation where two fans are required to stop the thing melting.

There are interesting changes ahead as Altera moves all its FPGAs to a new generation. When FPGA companies move multiple families to a new generation, there is often an attempt to rationalize processes across different device types. But Chris Balough, who serves as Altera's senior director of SoC product marketing, said that there was a reason for using TSMC as a foundry for Arria 10, while relying on Intel for Stratix 10: optimizing device characteristics for a given market. Arria will be used in applications where a careful balance must be made among real estate, performance, and cost, while Stratix 10 is for the type of application needing high-end RISC processing and transceivers operating up to 56 Gbits/sec. Altera is committed to ARM for the Arria 10 family, utilizing a dual-core, 1.5-GHz Cortex-A9. Arria's on-chip hard-coded ARM supports parallel operations using OpenCL. But the company is slightly cagey about its plans for the Stratix 10. Balough said Altera is weighing all the newest multicore offerings from ARM carefully, but also is considering high-end RISC architectures with which the company has experience. That might include Intel's Atom, which Altera has reference-sold, or new spinoffs from Atom, though Balough would not confirm or deny that possibility. Arria 10 already has design elements available in the Quartus II EDA suite for early customers, and initial devices will be available in early 2014. The Arria 10 family will be 15 percent faster than the current high-end Stratix V, while consuming 40 percent less power than Arria V.

Four years into the upswing, the economy isn’t seeing many of the excesses that often presage the start of contractions. Inflation is slowing, not quickening. Household debt is shrinking, not expanding. The labor market is slack, not tight. Pent-up demand also bodes well for the longevity of the recovery, which has averaged annual growth of about 2 percent since its start in June 2009. Confronted by elevated unemployment and a depressed housing market, Americans put off forming families, buying homes and acquiring cars. Now, with house prices rising and payrolls expanding more rapidly, their behavior is changing. “The current expansion can continue another four to five years,” said Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who’s a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research committee that determines when recessions begin and end. That would make this upswing the second longest on record, behind only the 10-year period that spanned the 1990s. The average since the end of World War II is just shy of five years, at 58 months. Reflecting the slow, steady pace of the recovery, payrolls rose 175,000 last month, in line with the average over the past year, Labor Department figures released on June 7 showed.

When someone buys an app, Apple gets 30% of that revenue and the developer gets 70%. Cook is saying that the developers' 70% share was a total of $10 billion. Of course, that means the total revenues from the app store was about $14.3 billion and Apple kept $4.3 billion of that. The reason Cook said Apple "paid" developers is because, of course, it is Apple that collects the entire purchase price from customers on the app store from which Apple "pays" the developer 70% of what they collect. Apple is not spending $10 billion "paying" developers, Apple is making $4.2 billion collecting their 30% cut of the revenues.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1370961326644</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370961401438-59</Id><Topic><Title>she fights. she finishes green today. she sends a clear signal of strength.</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370958620582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:50:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>best of luck. i've got jan 30s and 40s bought in May. looking for good multiples on the tiny amount i allocate to extreme risk.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1370961401438</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370961516521-60</Id><Topic><Title>Ready to roll over</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1370960204393</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:16:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was talking about you douche nozzle!

Haswell is Intel’s new generation of Core computer processors – an entire new generation of chips poised to replace the long-running Ivy Bridge range. Intel claims Haswell is a giant stride up from its predecessor. It comes in desktop and mobile flavours, but it's the mobile ones that could shift the balance in the tablet and laptop power struggle. Seriously. That sounds serious. Tell me the good stuff. Where to start? Possibly their finest trait is power management. Haswell chips can shut down for nanoseconds between tasks, saving power even in the moments between you tapping keys on a keyboard. This means Haswell-toting laptops and tablets offer 50 percent more battery life than Ivy Bridge devices when in use, and around three times more in standby. Apple reckons its new 13in MacBook Air will keep its Haswell silicon juiced for up to 12 hours. Intel's Bay Trail Atom processors are due by the end of the year – and Intel plans to sell them into US$300 devices – traditionally the stalking ground of Qualcomm and other ARM-based silicon makers. One way or another, Intel's coming back in a big way this year. And we're excited about the possibilities.

First off, the new iPhone will be released in September just as it was last year. How is it "aging" when it is only nine months old? New devices are released once a year. The last iPhone was released in September 2012. The last iPads were released in October 2012. The new ones will be released in September and October of 2013 one year later, on schedule. Second, this was a developer conference and not about hardware. The MacBook AIr was shown because it was well timed with Haswell's official release. But this was about OS X and iOS 7. Anybody who expected a new iPhone 5S was misinformed for the reasons I state above AND because Cook has said repeatedly that the big product releases wil begin in the "Fall." Finally, and most importantly, Apple will be adopting Intel processor in their iOS devices starting with the iPad. It may happen this year, but I think it is more likely to happen in 2014 after Intel has moved from the 22nm Haswell to the 14nm Broadwell. At 14nm, the Broadwell processors will enable iPads to run full x86 architecture software (OS X and maybe even booting Windows as on the Mac) as well as current iOS and software all in a small, thin, lightweight, device with, at least, 10 hours of batter life and NO FAN. In other words, like the MS Surface Pro, but much better This is all good news for both Intel and Apple.

A user interface codenamed Obsidian, for one thing, and it’s been captured on video. It may also be headed to Intel-powered Android devices in the future. Like pretty much every mobile OS redesign (including iOS7, by all accounts), Intel’s Tizen skin is flat and square. Obsidian is a bit like a blend of Windows Phone and Android’s Holo theme. There are no skeumorphic bits to be found, at least not in the video or screenshots that were leaked to Ars Technica. For the most part, the interface is simply a different aesthetic. There are, however, a pair of interesting functionality tweaks. The first is the peek panel. It’s an area at the bottom of the screen that apps can use to display minimal controls or data. The settings app displays checkboxes that toggle airplane mode or WiFi, data, and bluetooth connections individually. Other apps could use the peek panel to perform tasks like sharing content on social networks. Second is the way that Obsidian lets you know an app needs your attention. The square icons rotate 45 degrees (like the phone app on the left). A diamond in a field of squares is pretty easy to spot, though things may get more confusing when the screen is full of apps that update regularly. Tizen and Obsidian also look like they’ll be able to display interconnected events — like calls and text messages from the same contact — visually. Why would Intel bother building a mobile UI? It could be an added incentive for OEMs to use an Intel SoC in their devices. If Intel can deliver an attractive UI that’s highly optimized for its processors it could save OEMs a lot of time and effort — which could be shifted to other areas of the smartphone and tablet development process.

So instead of 6 hours of HD video playback, for instance, you can get away with a full 9.

Last year the iPhone5 came out and people didn't have a problem getting them. The iPad mini went on backorder which led to strong first quarter sales this year. As far as the iOS7 and Mavericks, there were a lot of nice new features that I'm sure loyal Apple fans will appreciate. I do have to disagree with you on the timing of new iOS products. I distinctly recall the the iPad2 was announced not at CES, but a few weeks later at their own press conference in January or early February. At the time it was released in March, to a huge, and I do mean huge backorder. By the holiday season they were in stock and sold well. I wasn't sure about these dates so I looked them up. iPhone 3GS introduced June 8, 2009. The iPhone 4 introduced June 7, 2010. Iphone 4s was introduced October 11th, 2011. iPhone 5. iPhone 5 was introduced September 12, 2012. The iPad mini was announced a couple weeks earlier. What difference does it make? Look at the pattern. Apple needs products ready for customers to buy for the holiday season. Going from first quarter to forth quarter product introductions is simply a very bad idea. What this does is stock the shelves with last year's technology during he holiday season. For tablets this is the worst because the bulk of the sales of tablets occurs in the forth quarter. It seems that Apple is priming their client base with a lackluster year in hardware by highlighting the user experience. Nobody has ever waited five hours in line for a new Apple OS. People want hardware. When it came to the iPad very few people realized that the tablet actually came out ten years earlier from Microsoft. But, more people are able to associate Pandora, Last Pass and, Microsoft 360 and Google's Android with what Apple presented yesterday. It came off looking like they copied someone else's book report and tried to give the same presentation. Google is a developers platform? Yes, for Apple.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370964563645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:29:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370964705586-86</Id><Topic><Title>Intel® Solid-State Drive Data Center S3500 Series delivers next-generation performance</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370963703371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A five year warranty near the $1 per Gigabyte threshold is very attractive.

Eastern Europe is great in summer. Do you like it down and dirty? Try living in Bangkok for the summer in the Sukhumvit Soi 8 area. What? You are gaye you say? No matter--so are half the Thai men. You like Big women--then go to Eastern Europe as I said. Me? I like the beach in California and the mountains there too. But really--Intel is going to go up or down, that is for sure but it is really up to things beyond the control of even Intel. The Macro-economics of the world will drive the American Dow to 20,000 if things continue as is. America will no longer being importing ANY oil from outside of North America in just 2 years now. By 2020, less than 10% of the oil used in America will be imported. It is possible that exports of oil will begin thereafter. This is worth 2% to the GDP. Oh well--Good luck but shorting Intel is likely a very dangerous play now so be careful.

Finally! AMD has some design wins and is well positioned in game consoles and now Apple. They just have to build and ship the parts. AMD is losing money. AMD has lost money for several years. AMD is bleeding cash. AMD has successfully snatched failure from the jaws of victory a number of times in succession. This time it will probably be different. You can compare your selections and your risk tolerance against my selections and my risk tolerance but it will mean absolutely nothing. I would not buy AMD because I would not be comfortable with it. If you want to invest in AMD, I think that is perfectly OK. But, for me. No thanks. If you want to bash Intel and pump AMD, I think your time could be used for better things.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370965714237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:48:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370965841669-93</Id><Title>Another V</Title><Msg>We are seeing lots of "V"s these days where Wall Street tries to beat the stock down, fails and it moves immediately back up as the big firm boys get their heads handed to them in a basket.

Two other factors have further squeezed global memory module supplies, the report said. First, Apple Inc. has bought up nearly 50 percent of the NAND production capacity of other major memory module makers SK Hynix, Toshiba and SanDisk capacity, as the U.S. consumer electronics giant will launch new models of its iconic iPhone and iPad in the second half of the year. Apple has also sucked up 80 percent of Elpida Memory Inc.'s mobile DRAM production capacity, the report said. Second, NAND production lines of major U.S. memory module manufacturers Micron Technology Inc. and Intel Corp. have all been used to produce their own brand-name SSDs, according to the report. The magnitude-6.3 earthquake that struck Taiwan Sunday might drive DRAM prices up even further because major Taiwan-based memory module makers such as Rexchip, Winbond, Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories reported silicon wafer damage problems after the quake, the report noted.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1370967832849</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 12:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370968119031-101</Id><Topic><Title>Did you remember to Sell your INTC on the RIP and Get some AMD on the DIP.

If ARM made a processor that delivered enough speed emulating x86 Apple could replace the x86 chip with an ARM and move closer to the goal of a single architecture goal across all platforms. But ARM has nothing that can realistically compete for either the MacBook Air or MAC Pro, hence ARM will not be Apple's single architecture solution. In short, ARM has made no progress displacing Intel in any Apple product. However, as we know Intel is the uncontested supplier of Apple's top end CPUs and now offers SoC's with superior performance and power efficiency and may displace ARM in future models of iPads and iPhones. And remember, Intel already pushed out Motorola and PowerPC at Apple.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1370971994231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 13:33:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370972212298-110</Id><Title>AAPL using INTC chips is not new , But AAPL using AMD chips is a NEW TIHING and big for AMD</Title><Msg>AAPL using INTC chips is not new , But AAPL using AMD chips is a NEW TIHING and big for AMD</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1370972212298</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 13:36:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370972356625-111</Id><Topic><Title>itakebackmyapology = backbay_bstn</Title><Username>iheartdaddy</Username><Timestamp>1370961066310</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:31:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uh, so you are saying I post as Itakebackmyapology and then respond to my own posts making myself look like an idiot.

The movements in the past three sessions were still within the range of an oversold bounce. On one hand, rising bond yields are likely to push more money into equities, giving support to stock prices. On the other hand, tapering talks, coupled with economic data which paints a slow growth picture, would keep resistance on price gains.

But that was NEVER going to happen and the people who suggested that was possible were fools. There was and is no chance that Apple stops using Intel processors in Macs. In fact, if you think about it, since 2006, Apple has been Intel's best and most loyal customer for x86 processors. Only Apple uses nothing but Intel processors in their computers. HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc. all use AMD processors in addition to Intel. Not only that, but Apple uses only Intel's high-end processors: Core i%, i7, and i9 and Xeon. In contrast, other OEMs use low-margin chips like Centrino. I'm not sure where this idea comes from that Apple is not loyal to Intel and could, at any time, switch away such as to ARM, but the history does not support that notion. So that is what I mean when I say that Apple using Hawell in the new MacBook Air is not really surprising or indicative of anything. In fact, Apple has always been among the first to put Intel's new generation of processors into production machines. Even the first Macs with Intel processors were among the first (maybe the very first) computers using Intel's then new Core processor. There was no chance that they would not use Haswell not only in the MacBook Air, but it will soon be used in updates to other Macs.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1370975952513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 14:39:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370976163005-125</Id><Topic><Title>Did you remember to Sell your INTC on the RIP and Get some AMD on the DIP.

The JUNE $26 looks like buying now at 6 cents, based on the larger BID size, The JULY $27 looks like selling now at 17 cents, based on the larger ASK size. The open interest in the JUNE $26 is 64k so they are below the open interest. It looks like someone is rolling UP a covered call by a $1 with a CREDIT of about 10 cents. You normally roll options to keep shares from being assigned. So, is the action bullish or bearish? I would think that there was a good chance for it to expire worthless. If I try the same transactions but move the strike prices down by $1, a buy of June $25 at 33/34 cents and a sell of the July $26.36/37 cents, the difference is only 3 or 4 cents. For the other way JUNE $27 2/3 cents and JULY $28 7/8 cents. for a net of 6 cents. Interesting. If he rolls UP today he gets 10 cents per share. If INTC price were to go UP or DOWN by $1, his roll UP would net him less.

I'm not sure if it matters, but iPad mini was announced in October, after the iPhone 5, along with the 4th generation iPad. I agree that they want products for the Holiday Season. The Holiday Season starts in late-November, so releasing new products in September and October is well timed. That way, everything is recently updated just before their biggest quarter. The difficulty is making sure they can ramp production so they do not have shortages like they did in 2012. I'm sure that has been a major priority for the this year. As I said, I fully expect refreshes of all iOS devices in September and October just as they did in 2012 (iPods, iPhone, iPad, and iPad Mini) not only because they did so last year, but mostly because Tim Cook has said several times that big product releases will start in the "Fall." He has said that at least three times, but nobody seems to believe him. Regarding iOS 7, as you said, people will not wait in line for it, but they will for the new devices that will be loaded with iOS 7. And by the way, they said iOS will be available to the public "the Fall" which is also consistent with the new iPhone and iPads being released in September and October. They are not going to start selling new iPhones and iPads with iOS 6 and then upgrade them a month or two later.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1370976675222</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 14:51:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370977557862-127</Id><Title>Have yall read this</Title><Msg>.. New Math Makes It Easier to Lower Unemployment CNBCBy Jeff Cox | CNBC – 2 hours 17 minutes ago... . @cnbc on Twitter.. . . Email Recommend 2 Tweet Print ... . . Related Content. . .John Moore | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesView Photo. John Moore | Getty Images News | Getty Images .. . . Conventional wisdom usually dies hard, but one long-held axiom relating to unemployment may be ready for the graveyard. For years, economists have accepted 150,000 as the benchmark number of new jobs needed every month to keep the jobless rate level. Anything above that was supposed to lower the rate, while anything below added to the closely followed headline number. Not so anymore, according to the Chicago branch of the Federal Reserve . Central bank researchers, in fact, say that because of various factors that number now will be closer to 80,000. (Read More: Housing Grows, Hiring Slow, Sequester Hits: Fed ) Moreover, a paper the Fed recently released on the issue maintains that the number will continue to fall, and at a fairly rapid pace, all the way down to 35,000 by 2016. "The projected slowdown is based on 1) a continuing decline in trend labor force participation attributable to the aging of the baby boomer generation and 2) a lower level of projected population growth going forward," Daniel Aaronson, vice president and director of microeconomic research, and Scott Brave, senior business economist, said in the research paper. "The Census Bureau projects a significant slowdown in population growth from the 1 percent-1.25 percent rate that prevailed for the two decades prior to the most recent recession," they added. If correct, the conclusion has important implications for those trying to gauge the nation's economic health-and in particular the highly influential central bank. (Read More: For Some, Fed Can Start Tapering NOW ) The Fed has pegged a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as critical to when it will begin normalizing its target funds rate from its current status near zero. The rate also will play a role in determining when the Fed will curtail the third phase of its quantitative easing program, in which it is buying $85 billion a month in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. A scaling back of QE3 has been met with trepidation from the financial markets, with talk of a "taper" triggering stock market volatility and a rise in interest rates. The Aaronson and Brave projections are based on the complicated formula the Labor Department uses to calculate the unemployment rate, and factors in what it considers to be "trend unemployment" over the course of time. (Read More: The New American Dream: Part-Time Job, Apartment ) They estimated that 2012 saw trend growth miss by 6 million, or 4 percent, and would require growth of 195,000 jobs per month to close the gap by 2016. "Employment growth has been well short of trend since 2008, opening up a large gap between trend and actual payroll employment," they said. "We expect this gap to slowly narrow as a result of above-trend growth in economic activity over the next few years." Reviewing the research, Goldman Sachs said that if it is correct that would mean the Fed would hit its 6.5 percent target by mid-to-late 2014 if the economy averages 200,000 jobs per month. The Labor Department estimated that May saw 175,000 gains in May, with the jobless rate rising to 7.6 percent. (Read More: No Swoon: Job Creation Continues, Rate Up to 7.6% ) However, Jan Hatzius, Goldman's senior economist, takes issue with the Chicago Fed's findings, charging that they rely on assumptions about a declining participation rate that may not materialize. Hatzius believes the actual job creation needed to lower the unemployment rate is "significantly higher" than the 80,000 Fed estimate. Assuming that the participation rate stays even, that would require 130,000-140,000 jobs a month, he said. "This is not a technical detail," Hatzius said in a note. "If the actual participation rate is currently below trend but is likely to converge to trend over time, the pace of job growth will need to be materially above 80,000 per month to keep the unemployment rate stable, at least over the next few years." -By CNBC's Jeff Cox.

Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (WFC) sold $41.4 million of callable seven-year notes tied to Intel Corp. (INTC), the largest such offering since January 2011. The securities, issued June 5, yield 34.633 times the stock price of the company and can be redeemed by the bank any time after July 12, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank didn’t charge a fee for distribution. The stock would have to rise almost 17 percent from its value at the time of sale to $28.88 to return $1,000, which was the principal amount. Intel may increase its market share in the mobile and tablet market to 30 percent at the end of 2014 from about 5 percent now, said Kevin Cassidy, a Washington-based analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. “The manufacturing technology advantage that they have is going to get Intel products designed into more mobile products,” he said. The brokerage lowered its 12-month target price of Santa Clara, California-based Intel to $28 from $33 on Oct. 17. Shares of Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, rose 21 percent this year to $25.01 as of the close of trading yesterday.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370978619205</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370978628026-131</Id><Title>OT; Huge Fun and Profit with RAYS Small Float,Oversold with Shorts being squeezed$$....</Title><Msg>BIG Money will be made$$$</Msg><Username>steveboonlertheidbrider</Username><Timestamp>1370978628026</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:23:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370980045792-132</Id><Topic><Title>Apple:Writing on the wall for ARM</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370894779478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 16:06:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The thing that troubles me about Apple focusing too much on the experience is that I truly believe we're in the era of hardware. I love Intel as much if not more than anybody else on this board. That being said it was unfortunately ARM that got the ball rolling over the past five years. But they set the pace that they couldn't keep up with. Haswell is the first sign from Intel that they are positioned to pick up the pace and move the hardware era forward. Apple has some hard decisions to make, do they go full Intel? What are the ramifications of running one more year with ARM? The much larger issue is at some point iOS and OS/X will merge. The dream is one fluid user experience from phone, tablet to laptop and desktop. If they can pull this off as well as they pull off the user experience in the rest of their lineup it will be as big a deal as a new iProduct. I'm sure they have learned some lessons from Microsoft as to how to not do this.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370980045792</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370980075336-133</Id><Topic><Title>Did you remember to Sell your INTC on the RIP and Get some AMD on the DIP.

That does not mean they are not focused on hardware. Just look at the MacBook AIr with 12 -hour battery life or all the changes to the Mac Pro. Look at the iMac with its hybrid SDD HDD system. Look at their unibody aluminum product "shells," still the best in the world and unmatched. Just because Apple cares about "experience" does not mean they do not care about hardware. To the contrary, the best hardware enables the experience. I expect that Apple will go "full Intel" including iOS devices. They do not have to do so this year because Intel's Atom processors are not yet clearly better than Apple's (presumably) A7 ARM-based processor and Haswell at 22nm is not quite ideal for a true "tablet" with no fan and 10+ hour battery life. But 2014 will be different. Broadwell at 14nm will be usable in an iPad with no fan and very thin and light with 10+ hour battery life and Atom processors will be better than ARM and will be adopted for smaller iOS devices. I feel very confident that Apple and Intel are working on this transition as we speak and have been for a while. Of course, it is kept secret as always. I don't know if iOS and OS X will merge, but I hope they do not. I have an iPad and a MacBook Pro. I would not want to use iOS on my Mac or vice versa. OS X Lion added "iOS-like" features in the form of "Launchpad" which fills the screen with big icons to launch apps. I don't like it on my Mac and I rarely use it. I don't want may 27-inch external monitor connected to my Mac filled with big, square icons as if it was a giant iPad. It is true that each type of device calls for a different type of UI. Even the idea of touch screens on notebooks and desktops seems odd. With a tablet or phone, you are holding it in your hand, so touching the screen makes sense and is natural and easy. But sitting in front of my 27-inch monitor, my hands are on the keyboard and mouse, why would I want to touch the screen?</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1370981082074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 16:04:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370981131000-139</Id><Title>Bernstein says Intel to Underperform, price target 18</Title><Msg>How can they be so negligent?

Considering that we had a pullback today (not a big one [only down $0.30/1.20%], but a pullback nonetheless), I decided to look up some official textbook-style as-close-to-fact-as-it-gets statements on a low volume pullbacks and what they can indicate in an effort to solidify (or reject) my belief that a slight pullback on low volume is good for longs in the grand scheme of things as it is a sign of relative strength. Long story short, Investopedia basically confirms that today's price action for Intel is practically a textbook case of a "low volume pullback". Please look up "low volume pullback" for yourself on investopedia if you feel the need. (Pasted Below) Do as you wish, but I'm going with the academic approach on this investment and taking today as a confirmation that our uptrend with Intel is far from over. I'm been told many times before that trading emotionally can get you into a lot of trouble as hedge funds, computer trading programs, etc. are structured around taking advantage of those that trade on emotion. That said, I think that this textbook verification is enough for me to stay long on INTC. The following is the Investopedia definition of "Low Volume Pullback": "Definition of 'Low Volume Pullback' A technical correction toward an area of support that occurs on lower-than-average volume. The low volume is a signal to traders that the trend is not reversing and that it is only the weak longs looking to lock in a quick profit. Frequent moves that occur in the opposite direction of a trend, which are accompanied by low volume, are normal fluctuations and generally deemed to be insignificant. On the other hand, a large spike in volume in the opposite direction of the trend could be used to signal that the smart money is starting to look for the exits and that the trend is getting ready to reverse."</Msg><Username>booman587</Username><Timestamp>1370983454825</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 16:44:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370983628370-147</Id><Topic><Title>Wells Fargo Sells Biggest Note Tied to Intel Since January 2011</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1370978619205</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:23:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you know what this is? 8-)</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370983628370</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 16:47:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370985061226-148</Id><Title>Some Analyst bad mouth the pig today? or Mr Weaver didn't pump enough</Title><Msg>Which one caused this stock drop.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s price target has been raised by a report from Jefferies, from $24 to $27, expecting a potential upside in the second half of the year. The report based their judgment on the following points: •Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is getting more aggressive in pricing of Windows 8 and Office. •The new and improved offering from chip maker, Clover Trail and Bay Trail, are gaining popularity. •Intel’s Clover Trail was used in Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, which reduces the chip maker’s dependence on windows platform. The report believes that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will be a leading semiconductor manufacturing process in 3-to-5 years helping the chip maker to become a leading supplier of handset MPU’s. Earlier, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) believed that PC market is price inelastic. This helped other platforms (ARM + IOS or Android) to take advantage in the faster growing lower end segment. However, this is changing now, and both companies are now refocusing on growth segment. From Computex The recent Computex helped the analyst to confirm on two points. First, Intel’s ATOM-based Clover Trail is gaining popularity in tablet like devices, and its Bay Trail processors will be a good fit for Notebooks and convertibles, primarily due to their enhanced battery life. Second, the software giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is offering big discount, as much as 70 percent, on a combined package of Windows 8 and Office for devices with sub-11 inch screens. The report believes this could help the company to boost the growth. Intel chips were used in the Samsung’s Android-driven Galaxy Tab 3, as per the report this fact reflects that, in the long term Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will “be one of the leading suppliers of MPU’s into mobile computing form factors.”</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370996219190</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 20:16:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370996246357-162</Id><Topic><Title>Jeffries &amp; Co. raised Intel price target.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1370996219190</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 20:16:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The price target from Jefferies is based on the following conditions: •PC MPU and server MPU grow by 3 percent in 2013. •Intel’s Haswell, Clovertrail, Baytrail and Merrifield products are available as per the schedule.

I know that Intel sells some set top equipment but they have been involved with that for some time. I think that is profitable. If you know more than the rumors, then you are probably in a better position to answer your own question. Since you do not know, how about a rumor, speculation answer of $42,384.62.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371008980978</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 23:49:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371009543405-174</Id><Title>Intel could win the smartphone race</Title><Msg>ABI Research reports that Intel’s latest dual core smartphone processor, Atom Clover Trail+ Z2580, sets the bar for both high performance and low current drain in smartphones. It outperformed the nearest competition (Samsung S4 and Nexus 7 and 10) in ABI Research’s benchmark testing of the new Lenovo K900 smartphone, powered by Intel’s XMM6360 modem chipset and Z2580 dual core, hyper threading application processor and integrated PowerVR SGX 544 graphics processor (GPU). Jim Mielke, VP of engineering at ABI research, notes: “The benchmarks were impressive but the real surprise was the current consumption recorded during the benchmarks; the new processor not only outperformed the competition in performance but it did so with up to half the current drain.” Intel stood out with only 0.85A of average current versus 1.38A for the Samsung Exynos Octa, and 1.79A for the Qualcomm APQ8064T.
