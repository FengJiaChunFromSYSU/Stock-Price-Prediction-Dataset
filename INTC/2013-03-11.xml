It was only time when they would announce or launch the next XOLO series phone; taunted to be the fastest Smart phone in world. The choice of launch date coincides with Samsung Galaxy S4 launch; March 14th. XOLO has taken extra precautions for not letting the fizz out before the launch in Goa. The device has been kept under wraps mysteriously, just allowing a peek glimpse of device to all who received the official invite; there by building more curiosity. Soon the technology world was buzzing, as to what this device would look like, what are the additional features, improvement from predecessors and what line of processors would it use to be the fastest Smartphone. The clear winner in choice of processor in the phone was Clover Trail + CPU. It is supposedly a successor of Midfield line of processors, with an added core to improve the performance and graphics of the phone drastically.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362986041508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 03:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362986341620-5</Id><Topic><Title>Betting on 24.12 by May</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362965689420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 21:34:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big Intel news on Thursday should keep the buzz going strong...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362986341620</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 03:19:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362986699035-6</Id><Topic><Title>intc_daily</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1362983612662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 02:33:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>isn't it way past your bedtime!!!</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonutz</Username><Timestamp>1362986699035</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 03:24:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362993177866-7</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>carl.hand</Username><Timestamp>1362392578308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:22:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good</Msg><Username>melkrach</Username><Timestamp>1362993177866</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 05:12:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362993923872-8</Id><Topic><Title>Gelsinger as Intel next CEO would be GREAT</Title><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362879851893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 20:44:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brightsideofnewsDOTcom/news/2009/9/18/pat-gelsinger-left-intel-because-of-larrabee-fiasco.aspx 'Last week, we learned that Patrick P. Gelsinger will leave Intel for EMC and tried to find out the reason for the move. From one side, the move had perfect sense. Pat was one of Andy Groove's men, and Paul Otellini did his best to surround himself with his aces, thus the choice of Sean Maloney was logical. But the underlying issue wasn't that Pat was "Andy Groove's men", the issue was the war with nVidia and under-delivering on Larrabee. As we all know, Larrabee project has been problematic at best. Intel start hyping up Larrabee long before it was ready, and the project broke all deadlines. We read through roadmaps and watched Larrabee slip not by quarters, but by years. After we saw roadmaps for introduction of Larrabee pushed back all the way to 2011, and hearing that a lot of key industry analysts are dismayed at Intel - Pat's maneuvering capability was cut to a single corner. A lot of people we talked to were disappointed at Intel "starting a war with nVidia without a product to compete", and after hearing statements such as "Intel is a chip company, not a PowerPoint company", it was clear to us that Intel seriously "screwed the pooch" on this one. We learned about the estimated cost of Larrabee project, and if there wasn't for best-selling Core 2 series, this project would seriously undermine Intel's ability to compete. To conclude this article - Larrabee was Gelsinger's baby, project got seriously messed up and somebody had to pay the bill.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362993923872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 05:25:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362994236642-9</Id><Topic><Title>Smartphone’s War Is Brewing, Intel’s XOLO Next Phone Can Be The Winner</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362986041508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 03:14:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>judging from the early photos that phone looks like it was designed by the politburo.</Msg><Username>aye_corumba</Username><Timestamp>1362994236642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 05:30:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362995477890-10</Id><Topic><Title>Smartphone’s War Is Brewing, Intel’s XOLO Next Phone Can Be The Winner</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362986041508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 03:14:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is India and Lava is a second rate player in India.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1362995477890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 05:51:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362995916315-11</Id><Topic><Title>Gelsinger as Intel next CEO would be GREAT</Title><Username>intc_daily</Username><Timestamp>1362879851893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 20:44:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the magazine's opinion.

Now look at them, stock mired in the 20s for the rest of eternity and can't even sell a cell phone.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1363010875426</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 10:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363011191523-36</Id><Topic><Title>INTC NOT to be featured on Mad Money</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1362912942358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 06:55:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>duhhhh....</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363011191523</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 10:13:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363011342758-37</Id><Topic><Title>More Intel chips for ZTE</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363010206701</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"hyperthreading, dual-core processor which they think will double computer performance, triple in graphic performance while still maintaining a competitive battery life" The many Lucy's can't read posts like this one...too many syllables, too many words.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363011342758</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 10:15:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363011556686-38</Id><Topic><Title>Fastest phone somewhere in India to launch Thursday</Title><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362966644339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 21:50:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Catholic country.

Intel has always expected employees to give 150% and make whatever sacrifices are necessary in their scchedules and personal life to achieve the improbable in an impossible amount of time. The atmosphere encourages dissent and conflict. Even the the "ranking &amp; rating" process employees go through is known internally as "ranting and raving". Screaming matches are common and surviving in this environment requires having a thick skin. The suicide rate of Intel employess has always been alarmingly high. The "disagree &amp; commit" approach - with a heavy emphasis on disagree - is a legacy of the "Grove" era.

Although HP will have the strongest on-month shipment growth among the top-5 notebook brands in March, the US company's shipments will still fall behind those of Lenovo in the first quarter, losing its leading position to the China-based vendor. Lenovo's shipments will enjoy a 10% growth on month in March, while Dell is expected to suffer a drop. Since most suppliers of upstream components, especially touch panels which are suffering shortages, still give supply priorities based on a vendors' shipment market share, if they do not push their shipment volumes, brand vendors have a higher chance of falling behind competitors. In the second quarter, HP is expected to enjoy a sequential shipment growth of 33%, Asustek 41%, Toshiba 42%, Lenovo 20%, Dell 19% and Acer 10%.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1363016473592</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363016868114-59</Id><Topic><Title>Next conference call</Title><Username>typea1948</Username><Timestamp>1363008292148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 09:24:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All TW companies report monthly sales data - that can give you some idea.

With a 5.5-inch 1080p display and Intel Clover Trail+ processor, it will launch as arguably the best-specced Android phone to run an Atom CPU. Adding to the appeal is an all-metal design that feels solid, looks classy, and remains svelte in hand. The bad news is that we are unlikely to see the phone in too many regions outside of China. The good news is that we now have a release date. The K900 is currently in production and slotted for an April 17th release, according to MyDrivers. Pricing is said to start around 2999 yuan, or about $480. That pricing is in line with other recent high-end Chinese releases. The K900 offers a few compelling reasons for those living outside the US to consider importing the handset. The cost might ultimately outweigh the benefit, but the latest from Lenovo offers a glimpse of where the company is going. phandroidDOTcom/2013/03/11/lenovo-k900-release-date/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1363017814718</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363018529376-61</Id><Title>I think big sell-off here</Title><Msg>We are so over bought on nothing. contractors getting laid off here.

They ran DOEs on the process and once the process was qualified they would not make any changes. It can be very difficult to make the hardware identical to produce the same process results.

His reply was that it did not leave a good taste in his mouth. Nevertheless it was not rejected and the door that remained open just a crack is likely to swing open for Qualcomm, the premier mobile silicon supplier in whom both Apple and Samsung are dependent, to win the Mobile Market. The hinge of fate rests in the hands of Andy Bryant, Chairman of Intel, who would need to EOL the Atom and the acquired Infineon baseband group to eliminate the competitive wall that would lead to not just a true Fab filling but would redraw the geopolitical map of the semiconductor industry. With Intel pouring another $13B of CapEx into its expanded 14nm footprint, there are only two possibilities that make sense: Qualcomm and Apple (the latter is now focused on TSMC). A marriage of Qualcomm baseband with Intel 14nm process technology could result in a scenario that would be a remake of Intel's 1990s Pentium Dynasty. The trend in the mobile industry for Samsung and Apple is to continue down the path of increased verticality. The Baseband Ecosystem maintains the high ground in tablets and smartphones and soon it will be a standard feature in x86 ultrabooks. Intel bought Infineon’s baseband group to complete the platform needed to compete in the broader mobile market. However, their efforts are still markedly behind that of Qualcomm and others. Bryant can continue the forced march with little to show or abandon the effort that blocks Qualcomm’s entry into the Fabs.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363019975563-67</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An article recently mentioned that Apple has hired a team of over 100 ex TI Engineers in Israel to create WiFi and Bluetooth solutions.

The aggressiveness of Apple and Samsung in designing the key platform components while elbowing out other Fabless vendors at the Foundry has to be making Qualcomm nervous. The $25B+ in Qualcomm’s bank account leads all mobile players, except Apple. What if the cash is not enough of a cushion to prevent Apple or Samsung from hiring or buying the assets of Qualcomm’s competitors? If you think it unlikely, then one just has to review the staggering opportunity outlined above.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019975563</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363020013895-68</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Under the Andy Bryant Regime, All product groups must now come clean on their true ROI of existing and new products. Atom processors fall way below the line of pulling their weight for a company that by next January will have spent $36B on Capex in the past three years. All of this to drive towards 22nm and 14nm dominance. In contrast to Atom, the Xeon and Ivy Bridge more than any other digital IC, except FPGAs, are delivering on a heavy positive cash flow. However, the dilemma in play is that mobile will be at least an order of magnitude larger than x86 powered PCs and the number of Fabs will matter in the end game. The idea that a fast growing market could be on an accelerating path towards consolidation seems at odds with the concept that a rising tide lifts all boats. It took more than 50 years for the American auto industry to consolidate and yet the new mobile industry and the entire supply base may do so in less than 8 years from the time of the first iPhone introduction. It is in Apple and Samsung's interest to accelerate the trend.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363020013895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363020039418-69</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Juxtaposed to the Samsung and Apple vertical supply chain is the also heavily capitalized Fabs of Samsung, TSMC and Intel who race to be the ultimate winner at the leading edge, where all mobile silicon goes to maximize performance/watt while minimizing quiescent current. Intel's leadership in the pre-mobile days was based on the x86 processor lock required for Windows and its process lead. The silicon supremacy shift away from processors and to the baseband and wireless infrastructure occurred faster than most imagined and the Intel acquisition of Infineon has proved to be too late in the game to help x86 Atoms make a dent in the market. Now that the multi-billion unit, 4G enabled train has left the station, Intel has to catch up with its only true weapon and that is 14nm. Should Andy Bryant be able to sign a Foundry agreement with Qualcomm and redirect Intel’s massive design resources, there would be benefits in a number of areas for both companies. For Qualcomm, the ability to leverage Intel’s lower cost and much lower power 14nm would remove the competitive threats of Broadcom, nVidia, Mediatek and others. Samsung and Apple would have to think twice of continuing with their own internal wireless and baseband developments as Qualcomm moves into the mid range and low end markets at generous margins. The profit pool that would arise for Intel and Qualcomm would be staggering but it requires Intel give up its desire to own the chip inside the smartphone.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363020039418</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363020067929-70</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In return for enabling Qualcomm to clear the field, Intel would take a giant step towards rebalancing its Fabs relative to Samsung and TSMC in the mobile market. This move, with Qualcomm’s increased TAM exposure at the expense of its rivals, would be the equivalent of moving more than one Fab loading from TSMC over to Intel’s side of the ledger. For Intel the legacy x86 and Data Center business will still require some leading edge capacity, however a larger and larger percentage of processors will shift to a longer tail business model now that AMD competition has melted away. Intel will initiate other long tail fab deals, of which the 14nm Altera one is a perfect example. The outcries from the former Otellini regime will be huge as the Atom and Infineon groups fight to remain relevant. The math is simple for Bryant. A $15 Atom processor at 5-10% or even 20% share in the smartphone market doesn’t come close to the revenue and margins that are available by opening up the Foundry to Qualcomm. Legacy Intel and Windows will remain together from tablets to PCs and servers as Win RT on ARM fades quickly into the sunset. By the end of 2013, I can envision a scenario where the partnership of Intel and Qualcomm is announced and the surprise to most is that they are no longer competitors at the platform level.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363020067929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363020123426-71</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The tremors that will ripple through the semiconductor industry on an Intel – Qualcomm partnership will destabilize much of the mobile market and over time be seen as greater in magnitude than any other single event, including IBM’s selection of Intel’s 8088 for the original PC that sent Motorola packing. Qualcomm building products at Intel will lay low their wireless peers while Samsung and Apple take time to reconsider if their internal efforts are effectively moot. Intel’s ability to finally monetize its leading edge process will force Wall St. analysts to reconsider their valuation metrics. Beyond this though are additional second order derivatives acting as forcing functions. Will Apple consider a partnership at Intel so that they can develop the equivalent of a Snapdragon with their own ARM processor integrated with Qualcomm’s baseband? For those of us who have watched the Semiconductor paint dry during the post Y2K decade, it is very interesting to consider what changes may occur as 14nm rolls out.

Now the question is what does Intel have to offer for iWatch. Intel is known for heavy duty processors which consume more power. So Apple did not think Intel chips were fit for their iPhones and iPads. So it is crazy to think that Intels ‘power hungry’ chips of good for iWatch. Further, iWatch is not going to be a significant product either for Apple or for Intel. I think that something BIG is going on under the dial. iWatch may be just a trial, experiment and excuse before going Intel in a big way.</Msg><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1363021352547</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 13:02:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363021473975-79</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surprise Surprise on charlie!

The reports also forecast that TSMC could face increasing price reduction pressure for products using 28 nanometer technologies as two companies -- Qualcomm and MediaTek -- have begun placing such orders with rival company GlobalFoundries. Meanwhile, the reports said three foundry rivals -- TSMC, Samsung and Intel -- would share Apple Inc.'s orders for its next-generation processor, possibly known as A7. United Evening News: According to Daiwa, TSMC's major customer Gualcomm and Taiwan's leading handset chip designer MediaTek have placed 28nm orders with TSMC rival GlobalFoundries. Such moves may force TSMC to lower its products prices, Daiwa said. Moreover, it said, United Microelectronics Corp., the world's second largest chip foundry after TSMC, is expected to begin providing 28 nm products from Q3 this year, a development that could add up to price cut pressure on TSMC. On the widely watched developments in Apple's next-generation of chipset or processor A7, Daiwa forecast that Samsung may dominate 50 percent of A7 orders, TSMC gets 40 percent, and Intel secures the remaining 10 percent. Late last month, TSMC's longtime client Altera struck a deal with Intel to collaborate in moving to 14 nm production. The Intel-Altera deal marked an end to TSMC's 20-year dominance as the U.S.-based phone-network processors maker's sole foundry service supplier.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363029700388</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 15:21:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363030001405-108</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be waiting for more great news to come.</Msg><Username>overdilifreda</Username><Timestamp>1363030001405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 15:26:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363032154738-109</Id><Topic><Title>Talk of the Day -- TSMC, Samsung, Intel to share Apple's A7 orders</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363029700388</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 15:21:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please elaborate on the last sentence of this "report" The Intel-Altera deal marked an end to TSMC's 20-year dominance as the U.S.-based phone-network processors maker's sole foundry service supplier.</Msg><Username>dachmeister4u</Username><Timestamp>1363032154738</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:02:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363032415237-110</Id><Topic><Title>INTC to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>almeda.mosley</Username><Timestamp>1362591601010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:40:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !!!</Msg><Username>ellison_johnnie</Username><Timestamp>1363032415237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:06:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363032578337-111</Id><Topic><Title>- - Research Firm DOWNGRADES TO SELL (EXCLUSIVE REPORT) - -</Title><Username>logan87anderson</Username><Timestamp>1363015385977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this report</Msg><Username>collinsmick840</Username><Timestamp>1363032578337</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:09:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363033580969-112</Id><Topic><Title>INTC NOT to be featured on Mad Money</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1362912942358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 06:55:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ho ho ho...ha ha ha....</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363033580969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363034317713-113</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>carl.hand</Username><Timestamp>1362392578308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:22:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome</Msg><Username>kevinking935</Username><Timestamp>1363034317713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:38:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363034337653-114</Id><Title>short interes increases by 8m shares</Title><Msg>from 208m back up to 216m shares from 2/15 to 2/28 9 trading days and shorted 8m shares.

There is no word on the official pricing, but unofficial estimates suggest that the phone will be priced in the range of 2,999 yuan ($483, INR 26,221). Lenovo K990 is the only smartphone that we official know comes with Intel Atom Z2580 Clover Trail+ processor. There is anticipation that XOLO will introduce a Clover Trail+ powered smartphone on March 14, but that is yet to be official confirmed. K990 features 2GHz dual-core processor, 5.5-inch 1080p display, 13MP rear camera, 2GB RAM, 16GB of internal storage, microSD card slot, and Android 4.2. All these features come in just 6.9 mm thin stainless steel alloy plus polycarbonate body. The smartphone will be offered in multiple colours including Copper, Silver, and Grey. If the rumoured pricing is correct, these are some impressive specs for the given price. There is still word on exact broader release of the phone in other markets, but Lenovo had hinted that other regional markets should also get the phone soon after China release.

I won't dismiss it that quickly. I'm just looking at the Capex expenditure and the history of Intel and I know that this isn't a company that likes to gamble. To throw untold billions of dollars at Capex means that when they looked into their crystal ball and saw their future there was something in it that made them want to throw tons of money at it. No matter which way you slice it the threat of ARMH overtaking Intel has to be managed and then eliminated once and for all. Currently it doesn't seem that Intel has the death nail SoC for to fight off ARM though you never know what they will come up with. Perhaps they will blindside the market. If not it will take a strategic partnership(s) to slow down ARM node changes at the FABS. Though it's interesting that the article points out how $20 savings in production could spell out billions in revenue the real threat is a clearly superior change in innovation that consumers perceive. A phone that only needs to be charged once a week with bluetooth and GPS that can always be left on or a phone that can pick up cell and data in current dead zones are things that may help consumers seek out Intel based phones in the future. By the end of next summer I fully expect some jaw dropping announcement from Intel that will justify the Capex. Will it be a new killer innovation from Intel? Will it be a partnership with Apple and or Qualcom? Will it be all three?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1363050527106</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 21:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363053098370-131</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Intel Buzz</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363025357492</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 14:09:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- New CEO announcement - Haswell introduction - Phone with Clover Trail+ and XMM 7160 chip for LTE 4G support - Web TV service + set-top box with Industry-wide support - Bay Trail products available for holiday shopping season - New MacBooks and Mac Air products (with Intel inside) introductions - iPhone with Bay Trail deal? - iPad with Bay Trail deal? - New Apple 'MacPad' introduction? - Deal with Google/Motorola? - Deal with Microsoft for Windows Phone OS support? - Phones (with Intel inside) with Tizen OS introduction? - Smart TV with integrated Intel Web TV service introduction? - Movie Rental service added with Web TV service to compete against Netflix? - New DVR feature with Web TV service to kill Tivo? - Broadwell specs start to leak? - TSMC delays 20nm/14nm rollout? ...</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363053098370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 21:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363056282606-132</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Intel Buzz</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363025357492</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 14:09:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- Surface Pro 2 introduction - Surface Pro with Clover Trail+/Bay Trail - Windows RT EOL - Google Chromebook with Clover Trail+/Bay Trail - Phones with Bay Trail with integrated LTE 4G - Phones, tablets and PCs with integrated Web TV service - Intel set-top box contains WiDi technology - Intel WiDi allows PC gaming to enter the living room to compete against xbox, Nintendo, playstation - Intel Web TV service becomes hub for games, software, tv apps, along with movies and shows - Phones with Intel inside running full version of Windows 8 OS (this is coming sooner than you think) - Phones running full version of Mac OS (Intel inside) - Phones running full version of Linux (Intel inside)</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363056282606</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 22:44:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363056661567-133</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm just looking at the Capex expenditure and the history of Intel and I know that this isn't a company that likes to gamble. There seems to be a perception that Intel is spending capex out of proportion. Covello always does it BUT he never provides a comparision to TSMC or TSMC, Samsung and Glofo combined. A couple weeks ago WW posted a blurb from Wells Fargo analyst who pointed out that TSMC capex relative to TSMC sales from advanced technology is about 150% compared to Intel 50% (perhaps WW can repost the article). Here some facts not tea leafs about TSMC capex some headlines from TSMC - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has raised its planned capital expenditure for 2012 to between $8 billion and $8.5 ... TSMC to increase capex by 25% in 2013: that implies $10.5 billion compared to $11 billion (Intel) The ARM foundries TSMC, Samsung and Gloflo outspent Intel combined on absolute $ base by a wide margin because they realize Intel is breathing down their necks. They thought Intel would not make such fast progress in reducing power and that's why they are in panic mode to catch up. Intels SoC have an incredible advantage costwise compared to TSMC - Intel can leverage all the CPU units , share learning and R&amp;D towards SoC units. By now Intel has processed millions of 22nm CPU wafers that use very similar process and toolsets. Bohr said both SoC and CPU can be run side by side and all the learning from CPU manufacturing can be applied to SoC manufacturing. Intel made a $4 billion equity investment in litho - supposedly QCOM and Apple each offered TSMC $1 billion each to secure wafer supply! That's half of what Intel invested in to litho</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363056661567</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 22:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363058086423-134</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a total B S of an article. Atom is already beating anything from arm in both performance and power. Bay Trail will put arm SoC to shame. PO already said by MWC 2014, we will see Intel SoC with integrated Infineon baseband. My guess is the XMM line will be to license out to phone makers who want an alternative to qcom's...XMM and Infineon tech will merge and Intel have a baseband that is just as competive and qcom's...and with their technology process lead, will soon be superior.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363058086423</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 23:14:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363058326369-135</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm and Intel Dynasty Scenario at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363019931741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>semi_equip_junkie, great info...thanks</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363058326369</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 23:18:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363060670799-136</Id><Title>Intel Corporation got featured and the said run and SELL big big problems</Title><Msg>Intel Corporation got featured and the said run and SELL big big problems</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1363060670799</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 23:57:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
