You have to rely on the qualitative sense that ARM presently dominates a high-growth industry; yet the aspect of backlog shows it can have variances. It would be best for conservative investors to avoid ARM because you are speculating on very high growth being sustained and at some point there will be a share-price debacle, which only needs a downgrade in the P/E multiple rather than much change in the growth rate.

It won't be surprising to see more pullbacks in the near term ahead of the long weekend. Expect buyers to step in on the pullbacks which would keep the uptrend started last November intact. For the S&amp;P 500, watch for support near 1600. For the Russell 2000 (982.26), the 1000 level has become a troubling resistance. The continuing failure at that level suggests that the market is up for more pullbacks or sideway consolidation.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369294036190</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 03:27:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369295501877-10</Id><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Msg>Look at the tell signs on both the NASDAQ/NYSE. What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1369295501877</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 03:51:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369297691259-11</Id><Topic><Title>wallis</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369292850676</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 03:07:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok now i see it down over 5 percent.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1369297691259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 04:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369297862942-12</Id><Topic><Title>Trade Idea: Short ARM Holdings on Samsung design loss</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369269228137</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:33:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>putting this out for the young and inexperienced is just a bad idea.

It wasn't just today's fall which caused me to sell. I did some more research last night on the Samsung 'rumour', which seems fairly well substantiated. What surprises me is that it's taken this - a rumour of an actual product - to bring on fears of Intel. As I've mentioned in past posts, I think that's going to come thick and fast - the Samsung tablet rumour is for a current generation Atom; if there's truth in Intel's claims for the next-gen, they won't just be competitive for tablets, they'll be compelling.... I may sell even a bit more; I'd expect to buy back in at some point - ARM is still a great company - but currently I'd be thinking more 600p than 800p to buy back in.

I have real time Schwab, cboe, option monster, .... I don't think much of volume below 10,000 contracts in a MONTH/STRIKE. 10k or above in a strike is worth poking around for anything that appears complimentary. I usually sell naked ATM put options after a big sell off. Hold them until they drop 50% to 75% and close them out. I like the time value leaking into my pocket than out of my pocket. I rarely go long. I do have some long ARMH puts that are now well in the green. IMO, Intel will trade with the market but have an elevated RSI when compared to the market because there is a very high (historically) short interest that was selling 1m shares per day. The chartists might even confuse the elevated RSI as OVERBOUGHT. The shorting seems to have subsided but we will know more on 5/24 when short interest through 5/15 is released.

Also you are missing the bigger picture as what really happened was that PowerPC (the older generations) lost to x86 and Intel make the best x86 processors. The mystique of the console is over, anyone can see that it will now be no more than a lower medium range spec PC and can pick a better spec PC if they want a better gaming experience and a better spec usually means an Intel chip. Another benefit of consoles all going x86 is that PCs will get all the latest games as a side benefit. AMD will do the donkey work but Intel will benefit the most.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1369328817851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 13:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369328954966-78</Id><Topic><Title>WOW did I read it right INTC lost to AMD for both, The new Xbox 1 and the New playstation 4, WOW thats not good for INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1369327845407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:50:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD will always be the little brother.

AMD already said that the console chips will be lower margin than their already low margin x86 business. AMD is giving away a lot of cpu, gpu, memory for probably no more than $60. That's because they need to to guarantee a floor under their volume. Intel as the premier x86 vendor is guaranteed any volume it likes as it has the performance lead and can price point how it likes so it does not need console business.

"Intel’s partnership with a rising Samsung at the time is nothing short of genius. The company may find itself a win if Tizen takes off as this would lend more clout to Intel’s Atom processor in the mobile space. If Tizen doesn’t take off, Intel is also going after the Android market with its x86 processors being used in a number of Android phones, mostly in overseas markets." [Note that this guy is calling Otellini a genius...] More Evidence of Samsung Defecting On the chip-side, Samsung may be slowly welcoming its new friend, Intel, into the fold. Though Samsung had historically used ARM chipsets, the latest Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 benchmarks that are leaked ahead of the tablet’s formal debut suggest that Intel’s Clover Trail Atom CPU is inside. Even more impressive, the dual-core processor is said to be keeping pace with quad-core ARM chips with comparable performance to the Snapdragon 600 from Qualcomm and Samsung’s own Exynos 5 Octa. This is impressive, and Samsung could be giving Intel a much needed lift in credibility in the Android space if the benchmarks are true. Samsung likely would still be tied to ARM for some of its products, so a full exit would be unlikely. However, given the strength of Samsung and the potential for Tizen to be a successful alternative to Android, ARM should have some concerns over the strategic partnership between rival Intel and its partner Samsung. Given Intel’s historical partnership with Microsoft in the Windows computing era had given the two the nickname of WinTel, can we have a Sam-Tel v. And-ARM in the post-PC era?

Four-junction solar cell achieves 43.6% efficiency 05/22/2013 Soitec announced the PV industry’s first four-junction solar cell device, which works under concentrated sunlight, achieving 43.6 percent efficiency as confirmed by the Fraunhofer ISE Calibration Laboratory. This measurement was achieved at a concentration level of 319 (319 suns). The new cell has demonstrated more than 43 percent energy-generating efficiency over a concentration range between 250 and 500. Today’s triple-junction solar cells used in commercial concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules in real-world applications are approaching their physical limits in converting sunlight into renewable energy. The four- junction cell is designed to increase the conversion efficiency of commercial CPV systems to the highest level ever achieved by any photovoltaic technology. It uses two dual-junction sub cells grown on different III-V compound materials, which allows optimal band-gap combinations tailored to capture a broader range of the solar spectrum. This maximizes energy-generating efficiency. Soitec leveraged its proprietary semiconductor-bonding (Smart Stacking) and layer-transfer (Smart Cut) technologies, which have been used in volume production by the global semiconductor industry for decades, to successfully stack non-lattice-matched materials while also raising the possibility of re-using expensive materials. The new cell was developed in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Freiburg, Germany, and the Helmholtz-Zentrum für Materialien und Energie in Berlin, which developed and deposited III-V epitaxial layers on new base materials as well as fabricating and characterizing the device.

Now thanks to partnership with Nokia Siemens Networks it’s finally getting its chance. At CTIA Wireless Thursday, NSN and Intel said they have begun jointly building a mobile edge computing architecture that would put applications servers at every cell site. The partnership is an extension of NSN’s Liquid Applications strategy, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress with IBM. The idea is to transform the radio access network from a mere delivery network to one that hosts content and services. Such an architecture would not only put video and content closer to mobile subscribers, but it would make such Liquid Apps much more network-aware apps ... At the heart of Liquid Apps is an application server utilizing Intel’s Crystal Forest platform for network infrastructure and a boatload of Xeon silicon. Those servers would perform the localized processing and content storage as well as maintain a constant collaborative link with the radio base station. gigaomDOTcom/2013/05/23/nokia-siemens-invites-intel-into-the-guts-of-the-mobile-network/</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369336044370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:07:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369336289857-104</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL WIN: Nokia Siemens invites Intel into the guts of the mobile network</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369336044370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:07:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel just keeps on winning.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369336289857</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:11:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369336384062-105</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Holdings Should Brace Itself for Potential Samsung Exit</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369335749665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:02:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh my, ARMH back near the highs of the day, did you buy another put at the low of the day?</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1369336384062</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369336923648-106</Id><Title>It's All Coming Together for Intel</Title><Msg>And falling apart for ARM.

Shares in the blue-chip technology company lost 55p, or 5.2pc, to 995p, bringing their total fall since Tuesday, when ARM held an investor day, to 9.2pc. The catalyst for the decline was a downgrade to “neutral” from “outperform” by Exane analysts, who reckoned that the company’s “ability to continue beating market expectations is now limited”. Worries over growing competition from Intel have hurt ARM shares this week. The Exane experts added fuel to that fire, arguing that the US giant’s Silvermont platform – a new design for one of its flagship chips – “could mark the end of ARM’s monopoly on smartphones and especially on tablets”. They added that the British group’s chances of cracking the PC and servers market “remain slim and its revenue opportunities are limited”. ARM, on what was a poor day for equities worldwide, ended the session as the second-heaviest faller in the FTSE 100. telegraphDOTcoDOTuk/finance/markets/10077153/ARM-shares-slip-on-Intel-concernsDOThtml [ARMH heading down much lower IMO, will not cover until it's under $40]</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369337464368</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:31:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369337876839-109</Id><Title>Good time to add/buy INTC here 24.0x, IMO</Title><Msg>INTC has been in this range the last 2 weeks, and will have nothing but good news to come.

Intel is all set to produce the first chips on the 14 nm node in 2014, while TSMC might get to the 20 nm node by end of 2013. Samsung's 28nm chip production is still lagging far behind rival TSMC, industry observers believe. Samsung currently makes the majority of its advanced chips for 32nm chip contracts placed by Apple, the observers said. Samsung's 28nm chip output remains limited due to insufficient yield rates, in contrast to TSMC's 28nm chip production that already reached commercial levels, the observers noted. TSMC, which does not provide 32nm process technology, has said that the company would triple production and revenues from 28nm wafers in 2013 compared with 2012. The foundry set a record capex of US$9.5-10 billion for 2013, also stepping up efforts to bring 20nm capacity online. There are doubts whether TSMC or others will be able to get to 20 nm by 2013, as they do not have the process and manufacturing expertise of Intel. If these foundries fail to make the necessary technology advancements, then Intel will sweep the mobile devices market with its Atom chips. ARM stock will crater dramatically if this happens. Intel does not allow foundry services for chips made using the ARM architecture, even though its factory utilization was just 50% during the 4th quarter of 2012.

Morgan Stanley (MS) recommending shorting the shares on almost exactly the same reasons that have fueled my thesis (valuation, Intel threat, ASP erosion in smartphone space, etc.), which may have sparked this initial drop. However, I believe that we are now about to see a fundamental shift in sentiment that will do some very serious damage to ARM's multiple.
