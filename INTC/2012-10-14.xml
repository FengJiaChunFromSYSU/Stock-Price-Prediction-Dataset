The higher the volumes, the lower priced end of the market you're feeding which would further drive down prices." I was looking at the IHS estimated costs of the iPhone 5 and they have the costs broken out. They have: $17.50 for "Processor" $34.00 for wireless section - BB/RF/PA Qualcomm MDM9615 + RTR8600 + Front end (assumed) $5.00 for BTv4.0 + Dual Band Wireless-N $8.50 for Power Management $10.45 for 1gb LPDDR2 DRAM $10.40/$20.80/$41.60 for NAND Flash (16/32/64GB) If your assumption about the Intel offering being similar to todays SoC is true, then your $20 number seems in the ball park and maybe a little high. I was thought that Intel was targeting a higher level of SoC integration which would put more of the "S" on the "C". It is not easy to decypher the ambigious "marketing speak".</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350220224942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:10:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350220362292-10</Id><Topic><Title>Intel has bottomed and death of PC overhyped</Title><Username>bull_no_bear</Username><Timestamp>1350172137846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 19:48:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Small businesses may use tablets for marketing or product/service selection but most business requiring budget reports, excel spreadsheets, quick books, business reporting etc. cannot use a tablet.

Samsung doesn't seem to understand that having to charge the battery every couple days is annoying - and that's without even using the internet, so people who do that with it probably have to charge it every day. And there's things like when someone texts me, it doesn't vibrate or make any sound. Even with the phone in my hand, I can't tell when someone texts me until I randomly check if someone has. When I have to put in numbers when making a call, like putting in the password to check my voicemail, the screen blacks out in less than a second. So I have to shake the phone to show the screen, then have less than a second to put in a number. Then I have to shake the phone again to show the screen and hopefully put the next number in before it blacks out. More than half the time it blacks out before I can put a number in.

Analysts and desperate broke losers are trying to steal your shares - they want in and were hopping mad jealous that they missed the run to 29. Intel may be Cisco's foundry David Manners Friday 21 September 2012 01:00 Intel is talking to Cisco about becoming its foundry, says investment bank Piper Jaffray. According to the bankers, the deal could be worth $1bn a year to Intel. Cisco would be Intel's fourth announced foundry partner but by far the biggest. The other three announced partners, and there are said to be other unannounced partners, are Achronix, Tabula and Netronome. Netronome is a network processor company from Santa Clara, California Intel's home town, with whom Intel has been working for five years on development but onlt signed up for foundry services earlier this year. Under the agreement, Netronome also gets to use Intel's own EDA tools. Achronix and Tabula are FPGA companies. Achronix was the first, signing up for Intel foundry in 2010. ementation at the next node. And it would seem that the step up to high-performance Intel silicon could make sense for a networking equipment and chip company that is likely to bring all its own intellectual property and IP cores to the design process. And who was it that mentioned the possibility of a billion-dollar Intel foundry deal to the assembled executives at the IEF? It was non-other than John Lofton Holt, chairman and founder of Intel foundry user Achronix. In the dim and distant past (2004) Cisco used IBM as a foundry supplier of its chips. But a billion dollars does make you stop and think. Even though it may be spread over several years a billion dollars is a significant amount of other foundries' lunch that Intel would be eating.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1350248721400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:05:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350249028796-48</Id><Title>"Temporary hit to PC sales as customers wait for a new version of Windows"</Title><Msg>Long Intel Short AMD: Best Way to Play Chipmakers By Matt Doiron Published: October 14, 2012 at 4:22 pm Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NYSE:AMD) had more bad news for investors this month as the company revised its sales estimates for the third quarter of the year. AMD’s management now believes that sales were down 10% from the second quarter of 2012, when previously they had expected a decrease in the range of 1%. Considering that Q2 2012 revenues were down 10% from Q2 2011, the company is saying that the decline of its business has been getting sharper rather than moderating. The stock price fell over 10% on the day of the announcement, so it is down by about half year to date. We can see a number of factors behind the fall in sales: lower PC demand as consumers increasingly shift to tablets, increasing difficulty keeping up with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in the chip market, and a temporary hit to PC sales as consumers wait for a new version of Windows. When revenue declined 10% in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s last quarterly report compared to a year earlier, earnings fell 39% in response (from $61 million to $39 million, with earnings per share falling from 8 cents to 5 cents). Applying that same relationship to the q/q decline the company is announcing, earnings for the third quarter would have come in at $24 million, and quarterly EPS would be 3 cents. That compares poorly with the 15 cents per share it earned in the third quarter of last year; in addition, annualizing a 3 cent per share quarter generates a P/E of 24 after the stock’s decline today to a market cap of $2 billion. Analyst estimates, pre-announcement, imply a forward P/E of 9. Hedge funds generally didn’t have very large positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. at the end of June. D.E. Shaw, a large hedge fund named after its billionaire founder, had increased the size of its position during the second quarter to 5.1 million shares but this was in fact a small amount of exposure for the fund (see where D.E. Shaw had more of its funds invested in). The largest position recorded in our database of 13F filings belonged to Kerr Nielson’s Platinum Asset Management. Platinum had owned 22 million shares of AMD but it had cut its stake by 5% over the course of the quarter; it is possible that the fund sold more shares at considerably higher prices than where the stock is currently trading. Research more buying and selling activity from Platinum Asset Management. We’ve mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) as AMD’s leading competitor, though the tech giant is in many other markets as well. Intel- whose market capitalization is just over $100 billion- trades at 9 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings estimates. Obviously there is an expectation here that Intel’s business is in decline as well, even if it is not as sharp as AMD’s; certainly a weakening PC market would hit the larger company as well. However, INTC’s revenue and earnings in the second quarter of 2012 were both within 5% of the same figures for Q2 2011, and there is a 4.1% dividend yield to boot, which should give investors a little more confidence. Read further analysis of Intel. AMD can also be compared to additional tech giant International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) as well as to component manufacturers NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). IBM’s business has also been about flat compared to a year ago, and we think that its valuation multiples (trailing and forward P/Es of 15 and 12, respectively) are roughly accurate in reflecting a stable business with a modest 1.7% dividend yield. Nvidia and Micron have forward P/Es of 12 and 9, which are premiums to where AMD trades even though these companies are likely in about as big trouble. Their reports for the second quarter show that Nvidia’s revenues were narrowly up versus a year earlier, earnings were down 22%; Micron’s revenues fell 8% and the company is actually unprofitable on a trailing basis. We don’t think that these two peers are much more attractive than AMD. AMD’s most recent reports seem to demonstrate that the combination of industry dynamics and competition from Intel- we’re not yet sure which is playing the bigger role- is having a severe effect on its business. We would stay out of the stock, but if Intel can remain stable it might actually be a good value. A long position in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and a short position in Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NYSE:AMD) might be the best way to play these stocks.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1350249028796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350249431418-49</Id><Title>14nm Skylake, successor to Haswell coming as New "Fab 42" goes online in 2013</Title><Msg>IDF: Intel expects 14nm to be ready by the end of 2013 Skylake seems likely to arrive in Q2 2014 By Lawrence Latif Thu Sep 13 2012, 04:39 idf-logo-san-francisco-intel SAN FRANCISCO: CHIPMAKER Intel thinks its 14nm process node will be ready for production by the end of 2013. As Intel is maturing its 22nm Tri-gate process node to produce its Haswell processor line, Mark Bohr, director of its process architecture and integration said the firm's 14nm process node is in "full development" status. Bohr said the company will have its 14nm process node ready for production by the end of 2013. Intel's 14nm CPU and system-on-chip (SoC) process nodes, internally known as P1272 and P1273, respectively, will initially see the light of day in Intel's D1X fab in Oregon, Fab 42 in Arizona and Fab 14 in Ireland. Bohr didn't say which of Intel's other fabs will see 14nm, but given that it has yet to tool up six fabs for 22nm nearly a year after launch, we might be safe to assume that at least another 12 months will pass before 14nm arrives at more of Intel's facilities. Bohr said Intel's 22nm process node has seen its "defect density come down over the last year". He said it is now below the defect rate of the 32nm process node used for Sandy Bridge processors. Intel's 14nm process node will be used in its Skylake architecture, the successor to Haswell. While Chipzilla expects Haswell to debut sometime in the first half of 2013, with 14nm not expected to be production ready until the end of 2013 it is unlikely that we'll see Skylake chips become available before the second quarter of 2014, roughly two years after Ivy Bridge.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1350249431418</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:17:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350250609571-50</Id><Topic><Title>China's ZTE launches high-end Intel smartphone in Austria</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350083267850</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:07:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel phones launching everywhere and Intel will announce more and more Mobile revenue each quarter.

I used the proceeds to buy more SAN (Banco Santander) @ $7.29/share, when it went ex-dividend. I'm still holding ATML, now close to a 10% loss. If you can stomach the volatility, I recommend buying ATML. You may have to hold it through 4Q earnings, but it should rebound pretty strong by the end of 2012. ABX is another stock that will go up strong by the end of 2012. SAN is a good swing trade, and will be as long as the Spanish debt crisis remains in doubt (they may formally ask the ECB for a bailout this year ... which would get rid of the volatility and put SAN easily above $8/share where it went recently).

The doom and gloom has been substantially oversold. Even Jack Welch got it wrong and was unaware of significant improvements in the economy: The economy is improving more than professional forecasters anticipated, particularly in data on employment and housing, according to the Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’ predictions. The index, based on gauges compiled by private businesses and trade groups in addition to government, confirms U.S. growth is generating jobs in the face of a global slowdown and looming federal spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff." 2.) Wall Street hasn't just gotten the Intel story wrong, they have gone stark raving mad pricing in the same news again and again and again. Wall Street has priced in an $8 billion revenue miss. Intel's revenues would half to decline by half to justify the reduction in the stock price Wall Street has now baked in. Does anyone really think Intel's revenues will decline by half??? This is what happens when you price in the same thing over and over and over. Revenue miss announced. Chump Street prices it in. General economic conditions decline (which is why the revenue miss is announced along with the Windows 8 wait). Chump Street prices it in. Report of chip sales decline. Same thing and Chump Street prices it in. News of AMD having problems. Chump Street prices this in even though it's a good thing for Intel. And on and on and on. The same exact thing. 3.) Employment is improving. Housing has really improved. Consumer sentiment has reached pre-recession levels. The news from China is improving. 4.) Intel's mobility strategy is gaining strength. The new Motorola smartphone demonstrates this. Intel now has Motorola, Karbonn, MegaFon, Lenovo, ZTE, Orange and Lava selling its smartphones. And a big LTE roll-out in the US planned for 2013. 5.) Intel's new tablet design is really good and will open up the tablet market, especially in the enterprise area. 6.) Intel's fabrication lead is huge and growing every day. Intel is ramping up while ARM is coasting to a stop and will pause after 20nm for an extended period of time. 7.) Intel's WiFi chip development is going to give them a significant advantage with the Internet of Things (IoT) as connectivity of devices (modems, routers, sensors, RF Tags, ATMs, vending machines, signs, coffee makers, etc.) generates a new network as large as the existing cellular network with a revenue stream just as large. 8.) 2013 will be the year after which there will never ever be the need to buy an ARM chip except at the low end of the market as ARM evolves into the next AMD due to lack of technology, fabrication and manufacturing. 9.) Intel will have five 22nm facilities running in 2013 and quickly moving to 14nm. ARM is struggling just to provide 28nm to its customers. Those wanting state-of-the-art technology will have to move to Intel. 10.) Intel will continue its every eight quarter fab cycle. No company on earth can match it. It will continue its tick-tock strategy to integrate design and fabrication improvements. I believe Marsavian said it best: "Medfield is just the starter but Silvermont will be the main course and will ask questions of Arm chips that they probably won't be able to answer. Haswell is such an awesome design that will be like the second coming of Conroe which struck down Athlon64 with a mighty blow that AMD never recovered from. Haswell will be a similar quantum jump in performance and there will be sub 10W versions. 14nm Broadwall though will get the power down to 5W which is tablet class. At 14nm Intel is going to squeeze ARM from above with Broadwell and below with Airmont, probably only Apple's bespoke processor will still look any good in comparison. Even well before then the 32nm Medfield/Clovertrail generation will spread far and wide in phones and tablets and Windows 8 will give PCs a buying boost.
