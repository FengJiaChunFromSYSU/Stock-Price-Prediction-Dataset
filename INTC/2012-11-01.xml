Therefore, chips targeted at smartphones will probably not be highly clocked. Look at the current generation A6 at only 1.3GHz. The iPhone5 is a very popular device and its twice as fast as the previous generation product. The next generation iPhone will probably try to continue the trend rather than greatly exceed it on performance while sacrificing battery life. For most common tasks, the iPhone5 is already faster than needed. Where is the need for all this extra performance?</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1351758501633</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 04:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351761003144-3</Id><Topic><Title>Exynos 5 Dual handily beats Apple’s A6 chip, Intel’s Atom Z2460</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351590885743</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 05:54:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It appears to me from the first 32nm example that a relatively highly clocked single-core A15 combined with a single-core A7 is what will be ideal from ARM's perspective as a phone chip WRT performance/power and battery life, at least at 28/32nm, and this will be ultimately going up against a highly clocked single-core 22nm Silvermont with hyperthreading which will do the same job equally as well if not better. God only knows how Nvidia think they will be fitting their 4+1 Wayne A15 chip into phones ! ----- My understanding is that the 4+1 approach used by Nvidia in the tegra 3 is dead, that low power core is never used. I dont know why. There has been suggestions ranging from hardware faults, software issues (needs to be supported by the OS and that support was never added), to it just not working in practice. ARM's big/little approach is similar Nvidia so could have the same issues. My understanding is that we're likely to see dual A7 and dual A15's (then quad A7 quad A15). At the most simplistic level the OS only see's two cores (both the A7's or both the A15's) and it's the hardware that switches between the two sets of CPU's as the workload increases/decreases. If the OS has been patched, then it can see all 4 cores and allocate threads as it see's fit, migrating them as and when needed. All cleaver stuff...If it works... If it does work, then Silvermont is going to struggle to match the power/performance curve of these new SoC's. While we're talking about Silvermont, let's revisit the if the 25% increase in IPC rumour:) If the rumour is true, then she's going to struggle to beat the A15 without a high clock. Any thought on how high that would have to be?:)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351761003144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 05:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351767460528-4</Id><Topic><Title>Exynos 5 Dual handily beats Apple’s A6 chip, Intel’s Atom Z2460</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351590885743</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 05:54:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clockspeed will not be a problem for Silvermont, 2.7 GHz turbo techspotDOTcom/news/50544-next-gen-atom-to-feature-8-cores-ooe-and-turbo-boost.html I also don't believe Clovertrail has a general 50% ipc deficiency compared to A15 like you do as it has an integrated memory controller rather than the higher latency FSB of the N270 tested by Anand. Anand got a 700 odd ms Sunspider out of it in the Surface review although it was a different o/s and browser. We need apples to apples benchmarks on the same android O/S which will happen in 2013 when Clovertrail+ goes up against dual-core A15s like OMAP5 which coincidentally has the exact same gpu which will give a very good gaming comparison of the two. I also wouldn't cap the advantage as just 25% to going to OoO more like 30-40% like A9 over A8 in most benchmarks.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1351767460528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 06:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351769083057-5</Id><Title>what a POS this has turned out to be</Title><Msg>one of my worst investments ever.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351769083057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351773372686-6</Id><Topic><Title>what a POS this has turned out to be</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351769083057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great post from a dirt-bag that tried to con people on a message board by saying he "knew of big things coming from Intel" but just couldn't talk about it..... pathetic.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351773372686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351774166332-7</Id><Topic><Title>what a POS this has turned out to be</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351769083057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That depends on when you bought, how much your bought, what price you are in at and if you have any reserves to buy lower to lower your total position.</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1351774166332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:49:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351774315809-8</Id><Topic><Title>AMD blew their wa*d!

Intel's WiFi chip and developments like this will leave room for ARM only at the back of the bus. Or under the bus...] Intel boffins are working on a 48-core chip for smartphones and tablets Anaylsts reckon the superchip could have a profound effect on our computing habits. Analyst Pat Moorhead said the chip could finally allow the industry to do things that take too much processing power today. "This could really open up our concept of what is a computer... The phone would be smart enough to not just be a computer but it could be my computer," he said. The trouble is coming up with the best way to utilize multiple cores on a single device. Intel researcher Tanausu Ramirez said the 48-chip should be able to use different cores to decode video at the same time, resulting in a more seamless video experience. Also, a multicore design could improve efficiency, as the chip could use a bunch of cores in parallel rather than one core running at high clocks. "The chip also can take the energy and split it up and distribute it between different applications," he added. Intel CTO Justin Rattner believes the new chip could be ready much sooner than the researchers think. Let’s hope he is right.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351777797207</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 09:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351778245385-20</Id><Title>What Internet of Things needs to become a reality</Title><Msg>[Just more things that Chump Street doesn't know about and hasn't factored into the share price. Intel has a huge advantage when it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT). Why? Because of its WiFi chip development....] Depending on who you talk to, the Internet of Things (IoT) is defined in different ways, and it encompasses many aspects of life – from connected homes and cities to connected cars and roads (yes, roads) to devices that track an individual’s behavior and use the data collected for “push” services. Some mention 1 trillion Internet-connected devices by 2025 and define mobile phones as the “eyes and ears” of the applications connecting all of those connected “Things”. Depending on the context, others give examples that are less phone-centric, speak of a class of devices that do not exist today or point to Google Goggles as an indication of things to come. Everyone, however, thinks of the IoT as billions of connections (a sort of “universal global neural network” in the cloud) that will encompass every aspect of our lives. All of this public discussion suggests the IoT is finally becoming a hot topic within the mainstream media. Many recent articles point to the IoT as the interaction and exchange of data (lots of it) between machines and objects, and now there are product definitions reflecting the same concept. Hence, from a technology perspective, the IoT is being defined as smart machines interacting and communicating with other machines, objects, environment and infrastructures, resulting in volumes of data generated and processing of that data into useful actions that can “command and control” things and make life much easier for human beings … similar to the world envisioned in The Jetsons, only better. Estimates of the future market size for the Internet of Things cover a broad range, but most pundits agree that it will dwarf any other market. In mature markets today, the ultimate, pervasive consumer device is a mobile phone. Consider your own household, and count the number of mobile phones you currently have. Then count the number of windows, doors, electrical outlets, lights, appliances and heating and A/C units you have. You’ll quickly see why the IoT market will significantly surpass the mobile phone market, at least in the western world.

The successful tapeout is the result of close collaboration between the three technology leaders as they teamed to build an ecosystem to address the new challenges from design through manufacturing inherent in a 14-nm FinFET-based design flow. The 14-nm ecosystem and chip are milestones of a multi-year agreement between ARM, Cadence and IBM to develop systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the advanced process nodes of 14-nm and beyond. SoCs designed at 14-nm with FinFET technology offer the promise of a reduction in power consumption. "This chip represents a major milestone for advanced node process technology, achieved through tight collaboration among experts at the three companies,” said Chi-Ping Hsu, senior vice president, Silicon Realization Group at Cadence. “FinFET designs offer significant advantages to the design community, but also require advanced foundry support, IP and EDA technology to meet the considerable challenges. Cadence, IBM and ARM are collaborating to address these challenges and develop an ecosystem that can support 14-nm FinFET development for a broad range of production designs.” The chip was developed to validate the building blocks of foundation IP for 14-nm design. In addition to the ARM processor, SRAM memory blocks and other blocks were included that provide the characterization data necessary for foundation IP development for FinFET-based ARM Artisan physical IP. “Each move to smaller geometry brings new challenges that require deep collaboration among ecosystem leaders in the SoC design chain,” said Dipesh Patel, vice president and general manager, Physical IP Division at ARM. “With 14-n design, many of these challenges center on FinFETs, and our work with Cadence and IBM has focused on answering the key questions about how to make 14-n FinFET design viable and economically feasible.” ARM design engineers incorporated an ARM Cortex-M0 processor using 14-nanometer FinFET technology built on IBM’s silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, which offers an optimal performance/power profile. A comprehensive 14-nanometer double patterning and FinFET support methodology was employed, with engineers using Cadence technology to design the FinFET 3D transistor chip. “The tapeout of this 14-nm test chip is the culmination of the significant progress we have made with FinFET on SOI utilizing it's built in dielectric isolation,” said Gary Patton, vice president of IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center. “In fact, Cadence and ARM have collaborated on a design solution to tape out this test chip based on IBM’s FinFET technology. We continue to collaborate to deliver on the promise of superior power, performance, and variability control of fully depleted SOI FinFET devices at 14 nanometers and beyond.” To succeed, engineers required support for 14-nm and FinFET rule decks, as well as enhanced timing analysis. The chip was implemented using the Cadence Encounter Digital Implementation (EDI) System with ARM 8-track 14-nm FinFET standard cell libraries designed with Cadence Virtuoso tools. EDI System provides advanced digital capability required for implementing designs based on 14-nm FinFET-based DRC rules, and incorporates new GigaOpt optimization technology to realize power and performance benefits offered by FinFET technology. In addition, the solution also uses production-proven double patterning-correct implementation capabilities. Encounter Power System, Encounter Timing System and Cadence QRC Extraction provide 14-nm timing and power signoff capabilities supporting 14-nm FinFET structures.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351781980431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351782028654-50</Id><Topic><Title>what a POS this has turned out to be</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351769083057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a POS Flumoxed turned out to be.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351782028654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:00:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351783003806-51</Id><Topic><Title>Tapeout of 14-nm FinFET test-chip</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1351781980431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:59:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess that puts ARM one step closer to volume production at 14nm in 2036 A.D.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351783003806</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:16:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351783109101-52</Id><Topic><Title>what a POS this has turned out to be</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351769083057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll be celebrating next Tuesday, scum-lick.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351783109101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:18:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351783862529-53</Id><Topic><Title>Beginning of cyclical rise in tech stocks</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1351780412913</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:33:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ditto that.

In exchange, AMD could license their GPU designs to INTC (so INTC could use it but only in their chips that have integrated graphics). AMD would sell the GPU's into the GPGPU computing and consumer gaming markets. INTC could sell SOC's with onboard AMD graphics into phone/tablet/consumerPC space. INTC would continue making their world-class server and workstation CPU's whle AMD would basically give up on CPUs (if they're not fabbed at INTC they have no chance to compete with the INTC CPUs) and focus on selling world-class GPUs into the GPGPU space.

It would require quadruple patterning for some mask layers but “it’s still economical,” said Mark Bohr, director of Intel’s technology and manufacturing group, speaking to EE Times after a talk at the Intel Developer Forum here. Bohr did not reveal details of either Intel’s 14- or 10-nm process plans. His comments focused only on technical feasibility. The company has long worked to develop extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and recently agreed to invest $4.1 billion in tool maker ASML to drive it forward. “EUV is very important to us, and that’s why we invested in ASML, but we have multiple paths that we pursue such as immersion with multiple patterning,” Bohr said. Intel expects to use at least double patterning in some layers of some chips at 14 nm. If immersion is used at 10 nm, more layers will require double patterning, and some will even require quadruple patterning, he said. At 14 nm, Bohr said, "the increased wafer costs [associated with double patterning] is still being offset by improved density, so our cost per transistor continues to go down with each generation on a very steady trend." That trend would continue, he suggested, even if immersion is used at 10 nm. As of today, “EUV is later than I would like, and I can’t count on it for sure,” he said. “We are probably the last company continuing to stay on a pace of having a new process technology every two years or so,” Bohr said in his talk.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1351785791709</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 12:03:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351785928908-65</Id><Topic><Title>Beginning of cyclical rise in tech stocks</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1351780412913</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:33:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a mere 24?

Recently while in a popular cafe located in an affluent neighborhood and near several universities I observed about 15 customers working on their PC and surfing the net. These folks could afford any device they want to use but every single one of them used a laptop. There was not a single tablet user among them. What is happening here? Have professionals and students come to the conclusion that if one carries just one device, other than their smartphone, it must be full powered and capable of performing all tasks? If this is the case, the convertible ultrabooks should do well.

Computerworld - Intel researchers are working on a new way to display photos and videos, making them more social and collaborative. "It's about being able to display images of any type on any surface," said Manny Vara, senior technology evangelist for Intel. "It changes the way we interact with things. It makes our images more interactive." Researchers demonstrated the technology, which is still in development, at Intel's European Research &amp; Innovation Conference in Barcelona last month. Vara demonstrated the project, dubbed Display without Borders, with a laptop, a Microsoft Connect sensor and a projector. Intel didn't give a timeframe for when the technology might go to market.. With the flick of a finger, pictures and video can be seamlessly moved from the computer to most any smooth surface - a bowl, a tabletop or a wall. Then with other touches, the images can be rearranged, enlarged or made smaller. With a tap, the videos will even begin to play. The sensors, Vara explained, pick up the motion of the user's hand and turn the touches into directions. More sensors offer better tracking. "It knows when you grab a photo and it knows if it's going left or right," he added. Eventually, users won't even have to touch the image of the photos or video to move them or activate them, Vara said. Instead, it will be done by gesture. While he would expect the technology to be used in the home to show photos and video, Vara also said he envisions it being a useful technology in the enterprise, enabling workers to more easily collaborate in a meeting, for instance. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said he can see this kind of technology being installed in a lot of offices. "It should be pretty helpful... any time there's a working-together meeting," he added. "I'm not as impressed with moving them from screen to wall as I am with a capable common work area... This isn't a big piece of business, but if it's good, they'll have them in a lot of conference rooms."</Msg><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351808902976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 18:28:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351809031810-107</Id><Topic><Title>Tank under $20 continues today</Title><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1350569387335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:09:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And just like that, NYK2OH, Singlion, etc. vanish.

The problem is that, just before close tomorrow, the price of the call will trade near zero premium and the put will trade at near the DIVIDEND premium. After the close, the price of the stock will be adjusted down by 22.5 cents. At the start of trading tomorrow with the shares down by 22.5 cents, the calls will have 22.5 cents premium and the puts will have zero premium because the stock dropped and the call/put price did not change. They will then adjust and the put/call premiums will split the premium between them. The call will drop by 11 cents and the put will drop by 11 cents as the premium balances between them.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351809592706</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 18:39:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351810190722-109</Id><Topic><Title>Intel researchers work on new way to display, share images</Title><Username>chumpanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351808902976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 18:28:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chump, "Intel didn't give a timeframe for when the technology might go to market.."

He said that Jeep, the American icon and great Toledo institution, "is thinking of moving all production to China." Everyone paying attention to the election called him on it. Chrysler Group LLC has set the record straight, stating it has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America. Defiance is an Ohio auto town whose most important employer is the General Motors (GM) plant that was saved by President Barack Obama. Voters there recognize that Romney's claim is just plain foolish, because Jeep is expanding, not contracting -- it's been all over the Ohio press for a year. Though the fact-checkers and the media unanimously shot down Romney's claims, no one was more stunned at the sheer craziness of Romney's statement than the workers at the Jeep factory, just down the road from Defiance. Chrysler is investing $500 million, adding 1,100 jobs and will actually add new models to one of the Jeep plants in Toledo. Yet none of this would be occurring if the Obama administration had followed Romney's plan to rely on private capital to restructure Chrysler. No one, least of all voters in Ohio, who have lived through the ups and downs of the auto industry, believes that Romney's plan would have resulted in anything except the liquidation of Chrysler. Chrysler's CEO Sergio Marchionne said that it would have been "impossible" for Chrysler to get financing from the private markets in 2009. The court records are clear, too, but Romney wants voters to forget what Judge Arthur Gonzales said when finalizing Chrysler's restructuring plan: "The sale transaction is the only alternative to liquidation available to the debtors." All of which has brought us to a truly Etch-a-Sketch moment, where Romney, knowing he is sunk if he admits that his plan would have forced Chrysler into liquidation, tries desperately to flip the script with a big lie about Jeep moving out of Toledo. And, rather than take the opportunity to exhibit honesty and presidential character by correcting his misstatement, Romney doubled down with a misleading campaign spot about Jeep running in Ohio. Using Chrysler to take on the Obama administration's results in saving the domestic auto industry is an odd choice. After all, the Chrysler restructuring has been a great success, starting with Chrysler having paid back all of its loans from the federal government six years ahead of schedule. Just a few days ago, Chrysler reported that it had its best September sales in five years and that its third-quarter profit was up 80 percent over 2011. Since 2009, Chrysler has hired more than 7,000 workers in the United States and is hiring thousands more, starting with adding an additional shift at a plant in Detroit that builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee. And while Mitt Romney sticks to his false Chrysler narrative, an even more damning story about the dirty dealing of Mitt Romney's investment partners during the 2009 restructuring of GM is beginning to emerge. Mitt Romney and his partners made a killing on the GM bankruptcy by gaining control of bankrupt parts supplier Delphi, then threatening to withhold components critical to the production of GM vehicles. Romney's business partners were willing to force GM into liquidation and cause a national economic calamity unless they got more money. In the end, the Romney investor group got what it wanted and earned a profit of more than 3,000 percent on its initial investment. This is the real Romney, a man who objected to the rescue of the domestic auto industry, then made astronomical profits after his business partners threatened the survival of GM. A man who lies about Chrysler moving jobs to China, when his history at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded, shows that he has invested in Chinese factories where workers are grossly exploited. Romney won't even act to stop the Sensata factory in Illinois, in which he is an investor, from closing the doors and moving to China the day before the election. Mitt Romney won't come clean on Chrysler, won't come clean on his Chinese investments and threatened the restructuring of GM for his own profit. That is the picture of a me-first hedge-fund investor, not someone who has the judgment or character to be President of the United States. Bob King is president of the United Auto Workers.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351821068869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351821285185-123</Id><Topic><Title>Inconvenient truth about ARMH...</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1351816104440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 20:28:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>inetl architecture is a kludge.</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1351821285185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:54:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351821390196-124</Id><Topic><Title>intc Foundries Mass Produce Broken Microprocessors</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1351820866658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:47:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"intc slips into the cyber abyss.

Joseph Lowery. A quote reported by Diane Glidewell from the Monroe County Reporter. Almost as bad as daily Republican barage. Routine Republican-level garbage. The "slur" as repored by Diane Gildewell: "Lowery said that when he was a young militant, he used to say all white folks were going to hell. Then he mellowed and just said most of them were. Now, he said, he is back to where he was." Here’s the report from Diane Glidewell and the Monroe County Reporter, the local weekly: Lowery said Obama lost Georgia by 200,000 votes in 2008 while 390,000 black folks in Georgia did not vote. “I don’t know what kind of a n—– wouldn’t vote with a black man running,” said Lowery. “All that he did with the stimulus was genius. Nobody intelligent would risk this country with Romney.” Lowery praised Obama’s commitment to the poor and said politicians should quit saying ‘middle class’ and go ahead and say ‘poor.’ Then he urged individuals to look at their own character and conduct. “We’ve turned our backs on the faith,” said Lowery. “America is going to hell in a hand basket. We need to straighten up so God can use us.” Lowery said that when he was a young militant, he used to say all white folks were going to hell. Then he mellowed and just said most of them were. Now, he said, he is back to where he was. “I’m frightened by the level of hatred and bitterness coming out in this election,” said Lowery. Forsyth Mayor John Howard, a member of St. James who opened Saturday’s program, said he was “pretty shocked” by Lowery’s comments.

I am impressed at your courage. MIAMI — An Orlando woman now in her mid-20s told investigators that George Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, groped and touched her inappropriately over a decade, beginning when they were both young children, according to an audiotape released on Monday. "The woman, whose parents were close to the Zimmerman family, talked to investigators on March 20. Identified only as Witness 9, she said she had come forward, a decade after her last encounter with Mr. Zimmerman, because “with everything going on, I know he’s not going to be out in public.” is unclear how, or whether, prosecutors plan to use the allegations in their case against Mr. Zimmerman, who is free on $1 million bond. ¶ Mr. Zimmerman’s lawyer, Mark O’Mara, who first sought to block the release of Witness 9’s statement on June 18, called the allegations irrelevant to the case and inadmissible in court. Mr. O’Mara said the statement should have been withheld from the public because it would lead to “widespread hostile publicity” and would taint Mr. Zimmerman’s right to a fair trial. ¶ He said he would “vigorously defend” Mr. Zimmerman against the allegations and file counterstatements in the coming weeks. ¶ Mr. O’Mara also sought to block the release of another tape in which the same witness describes Mr. Zimmerman’s family as routinely disparaging black people. ¶ The witness said that Mr. Zimmerman, who at 28 is about two years older than she is, first touched her when she was 6. She was staying in the Zimmermans’ Virginia home while her parents were moving to Orlando, Fla., from Louisiana. The woman said Mr. Zimmerman had groped her while they lay under a blanket as they watched television with a group of other children.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351822852920</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:20:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351823450207-134</Id><Topic><Title>Reverend that inducted Obama back in 2009 now throwing out racial slurs</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351820957151</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:49:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>more propaganda for the dumb schitzes from the king of dumb schitzes.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351823450207</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:30:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351823498897-135</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL IS TOO CHEAP TO PASS UP ! =BACKING UP THE TRUCK !</Title><Username>bull_no_bear</Username><Timestamp>1351821920436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:05:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>targets ?</Msg><Username>jabu3</Username><Timestamp>1351823498897</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:31:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351823851675-136</Id><Title>bottom is in....</Title><Msg>It's the usual climb out from here...up 0.2 down 0.1...jagged..rough..wall of worry.. but by April '13 should be in the 30's.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1351823851675</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351823894540-137</Id><Title>att4gte is a #$%$</Title><Msg>and a loser.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351823894540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:38:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351824532924-138</Id><Topic><Title>att4gte is a #$%$</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1351823894540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:38:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>atthole is not a loser.

The ROMNEY campaign can simply publish whatever number ROMNEY wants it to be. The truth has never been a barrier to MITT operations. Romney Ad Ties Obama to Castro, Chávez The Romney campaign is running a Spanish-language ad in Florida directly tying President Barack Obama to left-wing Latin American strongmen like Hugo Chávez and the Castro regime. The negative ads, first flagged by the Miami Herald, have reportedly been in heavy circulation since Tuesday on Spanish-language programming in Miami, home to a large and politically active Cuban exile community. In the 30-second spot, a narrator asks "who supports Obama" and then features clips of Chávez, the Venezuelan president, and Raúl Castro's daughter Mariela saying they would vote for Obama. It also mentions an incident where an Environmental Protection Agency staffer inadvertently circulated an email featuring the controversial Cuban revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara. The end of the spot features a clip of Chávez saying that if Obama was from Venezuela, the U.S. president would vote for Chávez. Unlike other TV advertisements, this spot was not originally circulated to media by the Romney campaign. The ad comes during the final week of the campaign, when candidates typically make their closing pitches to voters. The Romney campaign has expressed confidence it can make gains among Hispanic voters in Florida, particularly by boosting its support among Cuban voters who largely support Republicans. But Democrats say the ad's claims are a sign that the Republican nominee is getting desperate. "For a candidate running on 'big' ideas &amp; 'expanding the map' Romney's throwing the kitchen sink in just a few states," tweeted James Gleeson, a spokesman for California Rep. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat. The Obama campaign said that the president has helped improve the U.S.'s image in Latin America while boosting trade, and accused Romney of elevating Chávez for political gain. "Mitt Romney continues to play Hugo Chavez's game, giving Chavez the attention he thrives on and that he doesn't deserve," said campaign spokesman Dan Restrepo. "Keeping America safe and advancing U.S. interests requires the kind of leadership President Obama has provided, not Romney's bluster." While the ad is striking, it's line of argument should not come as a surprise. Romney has publicly accused Obama of going soft on the Chávez and Castro regimes. In July, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took to Twitter and compared an Obama speech to that of a "left-wing 3rd world leader." The Obama campaign, however, has also run negative ads in Spanish designed to rile its base. In September, it released a spot criticizing Romney for opposing Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Puerto Rican whom the president nominated as the nation's first Latina high court justice.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351827076582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 23:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351828220385-147</Id><Title>Bloomberg Backs Obama, Citing Fallout From Storm</Title><Msg>In a surprise announcement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Thursday that Hurricane Sandy had reshaped his thinking about the presidential campaign and that as a result, he was endorsing President Obama. Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent in his third term leading New York City, has been sharply critical of Mr. Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, the president’s Republican rival, saying that both men had failed to candidly confront the problems afflicting the nation. But he said he had decided over the past several days that Mr. Obama was the better candidate to tackle the global climate change that he believes might have contributed to the violent storm, which took the lives of at least 38 New Yorkers and caused billions of dollars in damage. “The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the Northeast — in lost lives, lost homes and lost business — brought the stakes of next Tuesday’s presidential election into sharp relief,” Mr. Bloomberg wrote in an editorial for Bloomberg View. “Our climate is changing,” he wrote. “And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be — given the devastation it is wreaking — should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351828220385</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 23:50:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
