I am pretty sure your broker does not have it. I used to be able to get historical daliy quotes on options that showed price, volume, and which exchanges the transactions took place. I have not been able to find it when I checked the last couple of times. It was from the Options Clearing Corp. OCC CBOE ISE are the websites that have option data but I could not find any historical data like I could find long time in the past. I think you are looking for a chart of on option price and the part of that price that is "premium". Since the volumes of options are typically so low on a daily basis, charting them would leave a lot of holes. Much of the option volume is triggered when the underlying stock moves into the put or call transaction. You might see something on a daily or weekly basis. The only way I can think of is for you to construct the curves yourself. Fun!!! The premium on the option is a function time to expiration and difference between the STRIKE and the current price. The options market maker robotically uses (I think) the Black &amp; Scholes type of equations to establish pricing and therefore premium. Possible solution where you can manufacture the information that you seek, would be to copy the QQQ pricing into a spread sheet and then munch the QQQ pricing through a Black Scholes Excel ADDIN tool. It should give you a curve of what you are looking for. A search for these ADDIN tools indicates their are a number of them. I cannot vouch for them. Take care in your evaluation. You can then apply the Black Scholes equation to the QQQ prices. You might want to apply the volatility mulitplier to it. I found a CURVE on the ISE site. go to ISE SELECT QUOTES &amp; STATISTICS SELECT QUOTES, VOLATILITY &amp; CALCULATOR Funny that it shows the QQQ and its historical volatility.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350796835929</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 01:20:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350798781589-2</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Might Trend Downward for Months</Title><Username>profitgrowthfirst</Username><Timestamp>1350477611405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:40:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google's, Microsoft's, Invidia's, and AMD's bad reports are only going to continue to push INTC lower.

First of all, TXN recently decided to get out of that business. So much for tablets being strong overall. Very recently, Intel annouced revenues of $13.5 Billion. Back in Q3 of 2010, Intel announced for the first time, revenues of over $11 Billion, with the actual being $11.1 Billion. TXN announced revenues of $3.74 Billion back then and now are about to announce close to $3.3 Billion. So TXN coming in with revenues that dropped by 11% while Intel revenues rose by 21%. Yet TXN forward PE is 13.9 to Intel's 10. Let's compare EPS. TXN went from 71 cents EPS down to 46 cents EPS. Intel went from 52 cents up to 58 cents. And this is even after a $1.5 Billion R&amp;D increase to push itself further from the competition in technological advancements in chip fabrication. So TXN dropped EPS by 35% while Intel rose EPS by 11%. Yet TXN forward PE is alot higher than Intel's. Let's compare dividend yield and cash on hand. TXN has $2.33 Billion cash with $4.7 Billion debt. Intel has $10.5 Billion cash with $7.16 Billion debt. TXN has 3% dividend yield. Intel has 4.2% dividend yield with higher earnings power and higher cash to debt margin making Intel's dividend much safer. Yet TXN has forward PE that is over 35% higher than Intel. TXN completely gave up the so called high growth mobile computing by planning to sell OMAP division while Intel has just begun by announcing a large number of new customers to use Atom chips. Yet TXN still has forward PE of 13.9 to Intel's 10. Looks like Intel in fact has been doing alot better than its peers. Being in the same industry and sector as TXN, we deserve a much higher PE than TXN gets. Much higher!</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350828034968</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 10:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350830115897-11</Id><Title>They will be pushing Apple to use Intel with those price hikes</Title><Msg>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is being pressured by Chinese suppliers and Foxconn to accept price hikes because of increasing labor costs, says Digitimes.

You're probably right but enterprises will lap up that very same tablet if it comes with Clovertrail and a physical keyboard. Clovertrail extends traditional netbook chassis into new areas of battery endurance, touchscreen enhancements and small size, weight and power. Just watch Atom sales start reversing their decline in 2013 because it will be the start of a trajectory that won't stop until Intel is a major player in the mobile tablet/phone market (15-25%). 32nm Clovertrail will start the process and 22nm Silvermont and 14nm Airmont will extend the process until the ARM chip vendors are yelling uncle at their reduced profit margins ;-).

It is senseless to say the PC is dead because none of the activities people use PCs for are going away. In fact, the range of activities people use digital devices for are expanding. The PC is simply evolving to offer more formats, shapes and configurations. Windows 8 is likely to be highly successful for touch-enabled ultrabooks, convertibles and tablets. One can certainly question the wisdom of forcing a tile-based GUI on non-tough-enabled devices or a workstation user with dual monitors but fortunately there is a third party software product that will restore the start menu to Windows 8. Ultimately user demand will likely force Microsoft to give users a choice which UI they prefer. The game changing event is when the smartphone runs full blown Windows 8 as a guest virtual machine allowing one to take their entire desktop environment with them. Doing this well will require native x86 instruction set. One should never underestimate the importance of 25-30 years of OS momentum, user familiarity, device compatibility and software investment. The Wintel Alliance most certainly have had some retooling to do for the new platforms but they are very well positioned going forward.</Msg><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1350831159856</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 10:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350831283563-18</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Might Trend Downward for Months</Title><Username>profitgrowthfirst</Username><Timestamp>1350477611405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:40:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct--It will trade down to below 20 for sure- and maybe down to the 18 area - the big boys want in- but not until under 20 and they will control it down to this level--they do it all the time with this stock!

It's 10^-8 cm. That is 0.1 nm Got it or did I lose you so far??? 1 nm = 10^-9 m = 10^-7 cm = 10 Bohr radii. That is the Bohr RADIUS, the atomic diameter is therefore 0.2 nm. All atoms are bigger than that. All interatomic distances (distance between nuclei) in materials are bigger that that, except in rare situations. 14 nm is therefore = 140 Bohr radii = less than 100 x Bohr diameter (=70 BD ). What I said is that 14 nm, the node size, is about 100 atoms **on a side**..so about 100 x 100 or 10,000 atoms in a layer. The layers are about 10 to 30 atoms thick. 100 atoms is the **scale size**, or the edge size we are talking about (actually, 70 atoms = 14 nm, linear dimesnision..the area, is the square, the volume is the cube..these are thin layers) I guess you haven't learned to read either. In physics, we get a sense of scale and often round off to within a factor of a few or so. But, you are hapless and hopeless. You and your buddies in here are disgusting. You are the world's underachievers. I don't know what you do for a living, but selling ice cream out of truck or flipping burgers would be well beyond your capabilities, so you post your drivel in here.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1350836164744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 12:16:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350836499762-31</Id><Topic><Title>Q for the smart people on the board:</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1350831589216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 10:59:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The Bohr radius is the radius of the Hydrogen atom."

ROMNEY FLIP FLOP LISTS Is GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney "a strong believer in stating your position and not wavering," as he once bragged? Or is he, as his onetime presidential rival Gov. John Hunstman called him, a "perfectly lubricated weathervane"? Take a read and decide for yourselves. ABORTION Flip "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it. I sustain and support that law and the right of a woman to make that choice." — Debate with Sen.

I am pro-life. You can go back to YouTube and look at what I said in 1994. I never said I was pro-choice, but my position was effectively pro-choice. I changed my position." — Iowa Straw poll debate, 2007 "What I would like to see happen would be for the Supreme Court to say, look, we’re going to overturn Roe v. Wade and return to the states the authority to decide whether they want to have abortion or not, state by state. That’s the way it was before Roe v. Wade. So I am firmly pro-life." — Town hall meeting, Hopkinton, NH, 2011 HUNTING Flip "I purchased a gun when I was a young man.

It was not my desire to go off and serve in Vietnam." — Quoted by the Boston Herald, 1994 Flop "I longed in many respects to actually be in Vietnam and be representing our country there and in some ways it was frustrating not to feel like I was there as part of the troops that were fighting in Vietnam." — Quoted by the Boston Globe, 2007 GUN CONTROL Flip "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts.

Bain didn't build that new factory -- the Chinese Government Did October 20, 2012 | Mitt romney has made Obama's out-of-context “you didn't build that” quote a central theme of his campaign. It's ironic, as Mitt Romney is going to profit just before the election when Bain-owned Sensata Technologies moves 170 high-tech jobs from Freeport, Illinois, to a plant in China built for the firm by the Chinese government. Sensata enjoyed record revenues last year – this isn't about making the “hard choices” necessary to save a failing enterprise. The workers in Freeport have been working 24 hours a day, in three shifts. They make $14-17 per hour, with benefits. According to a report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, one of Bain's first actions after buying Sensata was to set up “12 Sensata/Bain capital funds 'organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands' so as to avoid paying taxes.” They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and then use those offshore funds to defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. American tax-payers, on the other hand, have paid $780,000 to retrain some of Sensata's laid off workers in Illinois, according to the New York Times . One would be hard pressed to come up with a clearer example of capturing private gains while socializing the costs. Mitt Romney is not directly involved in Bain Capital, but he did build its business model. In 1998, when he was actively running Bain, he personally visited the Global-Tech Appliances plant in Dongguan, China. He witnessed, personally, the horrific conditions the plant's workers were toiling in for .24 cents an hour, and didn't hesitate to invest millions in the firm." -Alternet dot org. "Romney's Bain Capital Is Sending a Bunch of High-Tech Jobs to China on the Day Before the Election. The story of Sensata Technologies is about the hollowing out of America's economy by a rapacious 1 percent. October 16, 2012 | On the day before an election that's supposed to hinge on jobs, taxes and the middle class, Bain Capital, the company Mitt Romney founded, will close the doors of a factory in Freeport, Illinois, and ship 170 good, high-tech jobs to China. The employees of Sensata Technologies were forced to train their Chinese replacements, and the American flag that long flew over the factory was reportedly removed while the Chinese engineers were visiting the site. A group of workers have set up camp across from the factory -- calling it “Bainport” -- and some supporters have tried to block the trucks hauling equipment out of the plant. According to Dave Johnson , there have been several arrests. Sensata workers have asked to meet with Mitt Romney and hoped to enlist his help keeping their jobs in the United States, but he has refused, instead remaining on the campaign trail where he speaks often about “getting tough” with China. The most important part of the story is that Sensata Technologies is profitable operating in Illinois. Net income last year was $355 million, up 16 percent from 2010. The company reported total revenues of $1.8 billion in 2011, up almost 19 percent from the year before. According to a company financial statement , “both 2011 net revenue and adjusted net income represent record levels for the company.” So this has nothing to do with “making hard choices” in the process of turning around a failing business, which is how the Romney campaign describes Bain's corporate raiding. Bain's partners are looking for a modest boost in profits by locating the plant closer to the booming Asian automotive market (Sensata makes high-tech automotive parts). They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and possibly defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. It takes both capital and labor to make a successful business like Sensata Technologies. In order to make a few more bucks, 170 of the people who helped make the company thrive will be cast aside like so much trash. The layoffs will surely have a ripple-effect in Freeport – a town of 25,000 with a declining population and a poverty rate well above the national average. The move is the epitome of corporate America's lack of patriotism – it's capital unmoored from any sense of responsibility for the people that make the profits or the communities where they live. The city passed a resolution Monday asking Romney to intervene. But the Sensata story has, so far, had little impact on the presidential race, mostly because Mitt Romney has no direct involvement in the operations of the company he established (despite continuing to make millions as a “passive retired partner”). But this is reading the story of Bain Capital too narrowly. Mitt Romney is directly responsible for its business model. As Tom Gaulrapp -- a lifelong resident of Freeport and 33-year employee of Sensata – told the Huffington Post's Amanda Terkel, “They're still using his business model. He's the one who taught them how to do this. These guys were put there by him. So you can say he doesn't run the day-to-day operations, but he's still at blame for the way they do business." Mitt Romney started the firm, and built it up on a strategy of buying firms with little money down, loading them with debt, raiding their pension funds and breaking their unions and then “harvesting them” – in his words – for a profit. Romney is the only person to ever serve as Bain's CEO – since his departure, the firm has been run by a managing committee. The story is bigger than Sensata, and bigger than Bain. The issue is the turn America's corporate culture has taken, and what the consequences of its model are for our economy and, indeed, our society. And it is Mitt Romney's embrace of that model – ravage capitalism that is loyal to no nation-state and blind to every human virtue but profit – that should be disqualifying. In the New York Times , Chrystia Freeland, author of “Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else,” wrote about the historical tendency of elites to self-destruct by extracting wealth from the broader community to such a degree that the society becomes dysfunctional and mired by social problems. She recalls how the Venetians became the most prosperous society in the world during the 14th century by opening their economy to a broad swath of the population. Then, at the height of its golden age, “the upper class acted to lock in its privileges, putting a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro d’Oro, or Book of Gold, an official register of the nobility. If you weren’t on it, you couldn’t join the ruling oligarchy.” She then notes parallels to the United States, which featured one of the most egalitarian economies through much of the last century, but is now plagued by rising inequality and decreasing economic mobility. She writes: The 1 percent cannot evade its share of responsibility for the growing gulf in American society. Economic forces may be behind the rising inequality, but as Peter R. Orszag, President Obama’s former budget chief, told me, public policy has exacerbated rather than mitigated these trends. Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent... Educational attainment, which created the American middle class, is no longer rising. The super-elite lavishes unlimited resources on its children, while public schools are starved of funding. This is the new [Venice]. An elite education is increasingly available only to those already at the top. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama enrolled their daughters in an exclusive private school; I’ve done the same with mine. Much of this is the result of the 30-year assault on organized labor. It's worth noting that Sensata Technologies is a non-union shop, which is a big reason the firm can move profitable operations abroad without much resistance. Employment, in raw jobs numbers, should not be the defining issue of this election viewed in isolation. We also need to consider what kinds of jobs are being created. A recent study conducted by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that while only 21 percent of the jobs lost during the recession were low-paying (with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83), a majority of those created during the recovery – 58 percent – have come with such low wages. These trends are not Mitt Romney's doing, but he is the walking, talking personification of what's been happening in the American economy. Mitt Romney was an innovator in offshoring. He and his family will make a few more dollars as a result of shipping those jobs to China, at the expense of the workers who “built that” in the first place. That's why the story of Sensata Technologies should have an impact in this race. -Endquote. -Alternet dot org</Msg><Username>sunnsailor</Username><Timestamp>1350866028427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 20:33:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350868823645-78</Id><Title>Can you imagine that</Title><Msg>Obama demonizes the Banking Industry at the same time he's asking them for donations!

Parodying the tech press, SNL hosted a pseudo panel of “experts” to discuss their extreme disappointment about the failings of Apple’s iPhone 5. “Everyone knows that Apple maps has been a total disaster and since there is no Google maps app yet, I’ve been forced to use Google maps in my browser, which is significantly slower,” said the parody Cnet journalist, only to garner the sympathetic, “Oh, what a nightmare!” response from the host. “I’m just upset about the camera, every time I point it straight at the sun there’s a very slight purplish hue in all of my photos, what is that?!” adds the lampoon Wired reporter. “Exactly! That is unacceptable!” the host chimes in. “The bottom line is, it’s just too thin and too light. I mean, I know we asked for a phone that was lighter and thinner, but, this is ridiculous, I mean, I feel like I’m holding three pieces of paper stapled together, not a smartphone,” said the caricatured Gizmodo reporter. “Wow, that must be so hard to deal with,” acknowledges the host. “I mean, it’s a real struggle, whoever built these iPhones, I don’t know what they were thinking…” says mock Gizmodo guy, before SNL’s panel host says, “Yeah… let’s ask them.” Cue the appearance of three actors playing Chinese peasant laborers. “Apple maps, it no work, right? You want Starbucks it take you to Dunkin’ Donuts? Dat must be so hard for you!” sneers one. “Oh yeah, you want Macy, it take you to JCPenny? Awwww, how you deal with that?” adds another. “I guess we just lucky, we don’t need map because we sleep where we work,” says the third. And so the satire continues. “You upset with bug in new phone? I sleep in communal bunk bed with 100 stranger, lice are best bug I get. Best!” says the first laborer before saying that the journalists are right, there are legitimate complaints and they should air them. To the tune of a “sad Chinese violin” and the mime of a “traditional sarcastic dance.” The real stinger, however, comes at the end of the clip when the host asks, “Finally, would you guys like to complain about an American product?” “Hmmmm, that’s a good question, let’s see, what does America make?” ask the laborers, before adding, “Does Diabetes count as a product?” From EETimes</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350870629790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 21:50:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350872172639-81</Id><Topic><Title>SNL tech talk touches raw nerve?</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350870629790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 21:50:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funniest skit in years.

Our response was as follows. Who you vote for as president comes down to which candidate’s plans are credible and whether you believe the candidate will work in the best interest of all Americans. We have listened to both conventions and watched all of the debates and many of their press releases. Here are our conclusions. Obama has to a large degree fulfilled the promises that he made prior to for his first term. He ended the war in Iraq, eliminated Osama bin Laden, got a heath care bills passed that ensures that everyone can get insurance even if they have a pre-existing conditions, eliminated don’t ask don’t tell, navigated our country through the worst recession in our lifetime despite obstacles put up by the opposition party, and signed a financial reform bill designed to prevent similar financial meltdowns in the future. He policies also helped save the American automobile industry. Did he do everything that he promised? No. He was unable to reduce the deficit, close the prison camp at Guantanamo, increase taxes on those making more than $250,000 or make changes in our countries emigration policy. In many instances his efforts were blocked by Republican filibusters in the Senate. While Obama has not laid out a specific agenda for his 2nd term he has pledged not to sign any legislation that retains the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 per year. He supports spending policies that stimulate new industries, protects our environment, rebuilds our countries infrastructure and improves the education of our children. He believes that a strong middle class is essential to economic growth. Romney believes that by further reducing taxes on both individuals and corporations and by cutting regulations hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created and that the economy will grow. However, he has not provided any details other than to talk about reforming the tax system and not raising taxes on anyone. His economic plan is just not believable. You can’t reduce taxes across the board by 20 %, increase defense spending and balance the budget all at the same time without making major cuts in programs that impact peoples lives and adding to our country’s unemployment. Additionally, he has shown no willingness to compromise on major issues. He has signed the Norquist “no new tax” pledge and promised during the primary that he would reject any deal that reduced spending but raised taxes. He is in favor of repealing the “Dodd Frank Act” that was enacted to regulate financial institution and provide financial protection for consumers and the “Affordable Care Act” that grantees insurance to everyone including those with pre-existing conditions. He is also in favor of cutting funding to Planned Parenthood and Public Television. On foreign policy Romney appears to be a Hawk in that his advisors served in the Bush administration. He wants to increase defense spending and take a strong position against our adversaries abroad. He believes that respect comes thru strength. Now it’s your decision to make.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350873459049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:37:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350874264876-83</Id><Topic><Title>The PC isn't dead, but the laptop is</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350831360946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 10:56:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The PC isn't dead, but Wallus &amp; Mux are dead broke.</Msg><Username>wallus_weener</Username><Timestamp>1350874264876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:51:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350876419871-84</Id><Title>Stuff Chump Street Doesn't Know</Title><Msg>1.)
