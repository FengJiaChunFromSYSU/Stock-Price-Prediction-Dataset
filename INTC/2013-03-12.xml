Also, "who" said run? And finally, "what" are the big big problems? Are you implying that someone should sell based on your comments? Do you consider yourself a trustworthy individual? What is your track record for stocks besides your selling Intel at a huge loss and over paying for Cisco a while back? Why are you so lazy that you paste the topic of your comment in the body of your message? Why do you make these moronic posts every day?

IMO, the semi-conductor cycle should run bullish for the next few years. Cloud, more compelling connectivity options, UC and big data should drive revenues for all players, with Intel's technology (14nm) leading the group. Critical for them will be capacity utilization as it affects the fixed cost component of gross margin played against ASPs to fill the plants. I suspect that being two to three years ahead on innovation should offer both a cost and a price cushion, depending upon yields.

Apart from the volume – and hence revenue – implications, fpga manufacture is an important part of the ramping process for new processes. TSMC has experienced well documented problems in manufacturing 28nm chips – even with the help of Altera and Xilinx. The loss of Altera – at least for the 14nm node – won't help the foundry giant. But how might this affect the 'balance of power' between Altera and Xilinx? Both make strenuous efforts to get leading edge chips out ahead of each other. The reason? Their major customers are comms companies desperate to keep ahead of the rapidly moving market. If Altera can get 14nm chips into customers' hands before Xilinx, it could get a significant advantage. Cooley believes Altera may get 14nm samples by the end of 2013. "With 14nm silicon," he concluded, "Altera will get to leapfrog Xilinx, which will be stuck in TSMC at 20nm."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363112844681</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363113004690-32</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Headlines</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363106206054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 12:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC doing AAPL A7's sounds more like a squirt than a big gush.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363113004690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:30:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363113005885-33</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight!</Title><Username>carl.hand</Username><Timestamp>1362392578308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:22:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>richarddavis80</Username><Timestamp>1363113005885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:30:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363113041473-34</Id><Topic><Title>INTC NOT to be featured on Mad Money</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1362912942358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 06:55:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great post!</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1363113041473</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363113382087-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Headlines</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363106206054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 12:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"INTC doing AAPL A7's sounds more like a squirt than a big gush."

Intel, of course...] Last time worked so well After Apple largely failed to meet any objective in its patent war with Samsung, the outfit is back at it with yet another court case. The new law suit is about the latest batch of Samsung products which Apple claims nicked its ideas. US District Judge Lucy Koh asked both parties what they think about the idea of staying the new lawsuit while the first case goes up on appeal, but Apple wanted to open the new case. Apple said that any delay would "seriously and irreparably prejudice Apple,” cause a long-term loss of market share and of downstream sales and loads of small fluffy animals would die if the case did not go ahead. It claims that this case is different because Samsung has made different products and Apple will have to troll with a different set of patents. Apparently this case is about newer phones like the Galaxy S III and iPhone 5. However Samsung pointed out that Apple is likely to use some of the same trial tactics that shouldn't have been allowed in the first case and are now up on appeal. Judge Koh issued a short order (PDF) stating simply, "In light of the parties’ joint status report, the Court will not stay the case." She also reiterated her earlier instructions to significantly narrow the claims in the case. The new lawsuit is still scheduled for trial in 2014. Looks like Apple trollage will go on for years without managing to stop Samsung.

The case for Apple to make an incremental move to Intel and use it to pave the way to the big move to Intel...] Does this mean x86-based chips will finally find a place inside Apple's best-selling iDevices? The short answer is an emphatic "no," at least in the near future. Rather than a move to the Intel architecture akin to Apple's sea-changing switch from IBM PowerPC chips to x86 for its MacIntosh products in 2005-06, this rumored move would utilize Intel's foundry services to produce some 10 percent of Apple's future A7 System-on-a-Chip (SoC) parts, according to DigiTimes. Those SoCs would presumably still be based on the ARM architecture, especially given Apple's major investments in the architecture, both materially and in terms of an evolved app ecosystem built around ARM. Further on down the road, say a few years out, is anybody's guess. Intel has arguably been making major strides in catching up to ARM in terms of producing competitive Atom-branded x86 processors for smartphones and tablets, which provide the kind of battery life bang mobile device makers value. Such a move would make sense for Apple, particularly as Intel paves the way for a new semiconductor manufacturing process at the 14-nanometer node, according to Patrick Moorhead, lead analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. "Apple needs Intel's manufacturing capabilities if it hopes to maintain its position in the marketplace," Moorhead said. "Many more competitors like Samsung and Huawei are now designing their own SoCs, and in Samsung's case, manufacturing them. This mitigates Apple's design advantage and they now need something different to be competitive and that 'something' is Intel's 14-nm capabilities." "It would make perfect sense to see a 22nm 'pipe-cleaner' prior to 14nm parts. This mitigates TSMC risk and gets them ready for 14nm volume production," he said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363116182549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 15:23:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363116236822-51</Id><Topic><Title>Another Bad Day for the ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363113635637</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:40:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This means that it won't become clear that ARM is a short to the rest of the world until maybe Q3/Q4 2013, so if I were to buy puts, I would want at least January 2014 expiration date ones.

Arm camp is suddenly sinlent with respect to the power advantage myth, arm processors have over intel. Already on the 32nm process Intel Atom is comparable power consumption with ARM's latest and greatest. Problem Apple faces is that unless their next MacBook has touch screen capability, it simply wont be desirable as opposed with Ultrabook touchscreens. Likewise a MacTouch convertable will canabilise Apples own Tablet market. Why buy a iTab able to run RISC apps only when you can buy a MacTouch with more processing capability, legeacy apps (X86+RISC), and doubles as a Tablet? Likewise, iPhone-x86 is the smarter progression for Apple.Why buy a iPhone able to run only RISC apps, when you can buy a iPhone-x86 with more processing capability, legeacy apps (X86+RISC), and distances itself from the Samsung clone. Most valuable asset Apple have is their product appeal and OS. Though even hard core Apple fans will swith to alternative products which have higher specs. Ok, Apples investment in their own ARM designs is significant, though lets realise they have had a huge return on this investment. Simply put Apple needs Intels far more than Intel needs Apple. Technology and feature is the key, and Intel can deliver. ARM is limited, and by it's architecture will remain limited. look at WinRT as a classic example of ARM failure. Surely Apple aren't so nieve to believe they can survive on a lesser technology and expect growth.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1363121944355</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 16:59:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363125055609-69</Id><Topic><Title>Android Tablets Pushing Aside iPad: IDC</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1363120980507</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 16:43:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If one spends the money on a good tablet with a high quality display and generous storage they should get a lot of utility from it. Consumers shouldn't be limited to just one OS. Bascially that's a closed box. Tablets that use Core architecure or Atom can run full W8 and can potentially multi-boot Android, Ubuntu Touch, and Tizen. I would readily pay the money for an mSATA SSD large enough (say 256GB) to be able to multi-boot whatever OS I need at the time. This would also help prevent premature obsolescence of one's purchase.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1363125055609</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:50:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363125714419-70</Id><Topic><Title>- - Research Firm DOWNGRADES TO SELL (EXCLUSIVE REPORT) - -</Title><Username>logan87anderson</Username><Timestamp>1363015385977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report</Msg><Username>mikeford869</Username><Timestamp>1363125714419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 18:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363126492360-71</Id><Topic><Title>Importan info about INTC future!!!</Title><Username>seanlacroix518</Username><Timestamp>1363042083166</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 18:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful info</Msg><Username>isaiahlyons50</Username><Timestamp>1363126492360</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 18:14:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363126583572-72</Id><Topic><Title>INTC NOT to be featured on Mad Money</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1362912942358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 06:55:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>galba_imperator: May I be so bold as to ask why the Sam Hill you are responding to all of the spam posts?
