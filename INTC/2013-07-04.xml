If ARM is still jerking around with 20nm back-end chips by then, even if they have smaller 14-16nm FinFETS at the front, it's going to look like AMD then with its uncompetitive bigger hotter chips than Intel. The result will not be pretty for the whole ARM business model and ecosystem.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1372913301141</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 00:48:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372914793599-2</Id><Topic><Title>WHATS GOING ON?????</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368550155862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:49:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how legit!</Msg><Username>chris_lamby</Username><Timestamp>1372914793599</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 01:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372939535635-3</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein Research</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372896322079</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:05:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The whole market has been ruined by Daytrading losers.

The S&amp;P 500 has been in an oversold bounce in the past week. The bounce stopped right at the resistance near the 50-day moving average, and the broader market index had been stuck in the 1600-1625 range over the past few sessions. The Friday's jobs report could help the market find a direction. But which way the S&amp;P 500 is going to take to break out of its current range will probably depend on the coming earnings season. Technically, the S&amp;P 500 is still in the downtrend started on May 22. The downside support stands at 1600, followed by the 1560-1575 area, its June low. Should earnings disappoint, we could see the index pull back to the low 1500 area near its 200 day moving average.

In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation.

Maybe TWC will strike a similar deal with Apple but the pre-condition for subscribers doing it is that they must first be paying customers of TWC's video service. This means there is no compelling need for Intel's steaming service. All the cable companies will have a similar offering so in effect Intel's streaming service is pre-empted before launch.

Even when computing devices shifted from huge desktop computers to small and slim ultrabooks, Intel manages to create a chip that is just right. Recently, the company has been venturing into mobile chips, computing and power efficiency. Intel spends billions of dollars on their research and development every year. Justin Rattner, who served as the company's chief technical officer, previously met with Tom Simonite about the Intel's investment on mobile chips. Mr Simonite is the senior IT editor of MIT Technology Review. Mr Rattner explained to Mr Simonite how Intel sees mobile chips as the company's ticket to overtaking their competitors and creating new opportunities. Mr Rattner just announced his stepping down as the Intel's CTO - he will be returning to the company in a position that is defined clearly yet. Rattner shared with MIT Technology Review the idea behind the new technologies the company is working on including "lab venture." "We have started taking a very select set of technologies from Intel Labs and building new businesses around them [while keeping them inside the Intel Labs organization]. The problem, and it's not unique to Intel, is businesses are busy with their current products and customers, and someone comes along and says 'If you just put another $50 million into this, we'll have this great product' - - that rarely happens. Silicon photonics is the first of those ventures and the only one we've talked about publicly. We've separated the team and started hiring product, design, test, and production engineers. We haven't detailed when we will announce products in this space," Mr Rattner said.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1372950044558</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:00:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372950064958-14</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Labs gearing up for Groundbreaking Chips</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1372950044558</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:00:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He also explained the idea behind the first silicon photonics product. "It's a 100-gigabit-per-second transceiver [a device that sends data between computers along an optical fiber]. We use conventional CMOS [chip] fabrication techniques to actually build the lasers into the chip. We showed a 50-gigabit-per-second link a few years ago that was built in the lab (see "Computing at the Speed of Light"); the current chip can do 100 gigabits per second, but the connector, which we teamed up with Corning to build, has the ability to go to 1.6 terabits per second." The silicon photonics will be useful for data centers. Facilities can access more bandwidth for a fraction of a cost. This will be a definite win for those looking for energy efficiency and excellent performance. Data centers are very keen on anything that can provide excellent performance but the cables that come with these capacities can be problematic. Intel Labs is working getting rid of those cables without sacrificing performance or efficiency. I think we're in a period of fairly rapid innovation. The industry built the same transistor for 40 years, and it just got smaller," Mr Rattner added.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1372950064958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372951633486-15</Id><Topic><Title>Apple just made a huge mistake by signing with TSMC</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372895929756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 19:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only thing to watch out for is if Apple sticks with the 40nm node from TSMC. And if it's truly a year out then the next node Apple may want from TSMC may be 28nm. I have faith that by next year TSMC can finally make 28nm in sizable enough yields to satisfy Apple. Lets be really clear about Apple. Up until last year they were still selling a few computers with Core2Duo processors. That' a processor that dates back to 2006! So, no they don't need the fastest processors, or so they think. The problem is that these Intel 14nm processors will be all over the market and Apple will once again will be two nodes behind. The iPhone will feel a bit sluggish compared to Intel based Android phones. Battery life will be questionable. If you look at the latest Apple press conference iOS7 looks like they copied Android homework very nicely. Apple seems to be running out of ideas, and they are slow to change hardware. You are thinking that Apple will have some amazing 20nm processor from TSMC and facing stock outages. That's not a good thing because Apple fans will wait 3 months for their new phone to arrive. I am thinking that in order to avoid the stock outages they will not take the first batches from the newest nodes from TSMC. They will most likely stick with 28nm. That's better for Intel because more consumers would fall off the iPhone bandwagon. Apple seems to happy to just be a player in the phone market providing just enough interesting stuff to keep consumers somewhat loyal. The lack of leadership from Cook makes Apple just a player instead of a leader in the smartphone segment. Sooner or later consumers will get tired of their small phones and lackluster performance and move on. Android is really the only other game in town.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1372951633486</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372951913440-16</Id><Title>Leaked Skylake Info</Title><Msg>techspot (dotcom) /news/53129-intels-14nm-skylake-platform-to-support-ddr4-pcie-40-sata-express.html</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1372951913440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:31:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372952068164-17</Id><Topic><Title>Leaked Skylake Info</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1372951913440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:31:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By Shawn Knight On July 4, 2013, 8:00 AM Comments 5 A leaked Intel Xeon roadmap purportedly sheds some light on what the chip maker has in store for Skylake, the successor to the yet-to-be-released Broadwell platform.

This will likely be a welcomed addition as more powerful graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia could use the extra bandwidth. If that werenâ€™t enough to get you interested, perhaps SATA Express support might do the trick. This standard will boost maximum bandwidth to around 16GB/s which is more than 2.5 times as much as the existing standard allows for. Hopefully solid state drives will evolve enough to actually make use of the extra bandwidth. The slide doesnâ€™t give an exact date as to when Skylake will be ready for prime time but weâ€™re hearing that Intel will likely launch the new platform sometime in late 2015 or beyond.

Quan: If you look at 28nm, and even at 40nm, we started working with EDA companies with our design rule manual earlier than in the past. Version 1.0 is basically production. At 28nm, we started working with our partners on version 0.1, which is very early, then version 0.5 all the way up to 1.0. With 16nm finFETs, weâ€™re now working on version 0.1. These can change every few days, so the commitment from Synopsys, Mentor and Cadence has to be very high because you have to have a way to synchronize these activities to get to the next version.]</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1372952959349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 11:49:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372953981638-21</Id><Topic><Title>Today's ARM upgrade</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372874179061</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:56:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just using the same word as semi_equip_junkie:) enDOTwikipediaDOTorg/wiki/Multigate_device</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1372953981638</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 12:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372954137962-22</Id><Title>With the Increased battery life of baytrail over ARM, everyone is clamoring for</Title><Msg>baytrail in their tablets.

Intel does both. It's funny that certain analysts always point out Intel's margin getting squeezed due to SoC manufacturing - the same analysts are completely ignorant to the fact that TSMC's FinFet does not provide the cost advantage compared to planar. TSMC should be downgraded due to margin pressure The lack of shrinking the FinFet will impact the margins of the entire ARM food chain. Even G61 admitted that TSMC alone will not do the heavy lifting by itself Going from 28nm to 20nm is a capex increase of 1.7 approx than they need to spend capex to get to FinFet but the cost advantage due to shrink is muted - (I am heavily invested in chip equipment companies - so I know what's coming down the pipe - Covello covers both equipment and Intel - he should know what TSMC et al are facing with respect to capex and its impact on TSMC's margin - nevertheless he only bashes Intel - he even suggests Intel to CUT capex! Covello IS one of the worst manipulators and he's backed up the money ) In DRAM manufacturing with razor thin margin the biggest #$%$ is shrinking - shrink is very powerful because one shrinks dies in x axis and y axis and you end up with a lot more dies per wafer Intel SoC will have cost advantage - than comes 450mm which is supposed to provide 30% cost reduction - that's why Intel is already spending $2 billion on 450mm.

Snore. It's 14nm Skylake time!!!. FinFET, too!!!! Microsoft says it's picking up the pace on software. The 20th rollout of every 2-3 years gone. Look for 1 year or less from now on. Bless the Mobile guys and their history repeating innovations. These are truly, truly... Very exciting times!!!! Cymer times!!!!!!! Haswell is pretty sweet, but it's old news. Say hello to Skylake - the "tock" that follows Broadwell: The details on this core are still scarce, but we know the following: Built on the 14nm process (so that gives the chip designers a lot more room to play with on both power and transistor count) Utilizes next generation DDR4 memory Supports the next generation PCIe4 standard (the AMD (AMD) bulls/Nvidia (NVDA) bears that claim that Intel is killing PCIe look pretty foolish right now) Supports the AVX3.2 instruction set Now, the last part is pretty important because we know that AVX3 brings yet another doubling of the peak floating point throughput for the processor cores: This suggests that for anything involving floating point intensive calculations (think games, spreadsheets, 3D modeling, and even all of the perceptual computing stuff that Intel keeps touting), and assuming Intel's software developer relations team does its job right, Skylake should be a monster. Now, the interesting thing is that Intel is going to be packing this kind of processing power into Ultrabooks and high end tablets.

The first benchmarks of Chipzillaâ€™s new Bay Trail SoC have showed up in Antutu and the chip looks very good indeed. A Bay Trail-T part clocked at 1.1GHz ends up about 30 percent faster than Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon 800 at 2.3GHz. Intelâ€™s little chip just gets more done per clock cycle, which means it uses less power to deliver more performance. At the moment ARM is the king of the frugal mobile chip market, but Intelâ€™s trump card looks a bit better. It scored 43,415 in Antutu, while Snapdragon 800 devices score about 30,000. Samsungâ€™s Exynos 4412 used in the Galaxy S3 scores around 20,000, while Nvidiaâ€™s Tegra 3 hits 15,000. Furthermore, Bay Trail-T is expected to ship with clocks in excess of 2GHz, which means upcoming commercial devices based on the new chip could end up even faster. Itâ€™s not just about performance. Bay Trail-T seems to use a lot less power under load than competing ARM chips. Intel claims Bay Trail-T will be more power efficient than dual-core ARMs, but at the same time it will outpace quad-core ARM chips.

Now, Piper Jaffray believes that since Intel didn't win the Apple foundry deal, and since it's not going to win every Samsung device ever, that it's shut out of the mobile market for CY2014 and CY2015. Are these guys serious? Do they forget that the tablet market is just beginning and that many companies are playing to win big time? While Intel has a good relationship on the PC side of things with Samsung (and again, Intel is in both the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1" and the Ativ Tab - two flagship designs based on older Atom silicon, not the new good stuff coming later this year), these analysts forget that there's an army of players - all of whom have excellent relationships with Intel - coming to market in force with both Windows and Android tablets (and Intel can participate in both). These firms are, ASUS Lenovo Dell HP Acer Toshiba Sony Fujitsu Of course, it helps that every major Taiwanese ODM will be building around the upcoming "Bay Trail" platform, so you will see the market full of Intel based tablets this Holiday season from all of the aforementioned OEMs. So, with a huge army of Android and Windows tablets coming with Intel silicon ranging from 7" to 11" and from sub $199 to $499, does it really matter that Intel isn't building Apple's A-chips? No, and in fact, each one of these Windows and/or Android tablets that gets sold is a lost sale for Apple and a market share shift in Intel's favor...and Intel gets more than just foundry margins for these chips.

However, MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum suggest that Intel is a more logical choice for the role since itâ€™s greater chip-making capacity could allow it to act as an Apple chip foundry without the need for new capital investment. Rumors suggest that TSMC has been investing heavily to accommodate Appleâ€™s anticipated orders. But Berenbaum says that TSMCâ€™s chip-making capacity remains too restricted to meet Appleâ€™s heavy demand</Msg><Username>mark.steffenhagen</Username><Timestamp>1372975026428</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 17:57:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372976104921-52</Id><Topic><Title>Making 100k a year trading!</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368346134909</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 04:08:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IUTR</Msg><Username>merri.evans</Username><Timestamp>1372976104921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 18:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372976667142-53</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Responding To Piper Jaffray's Downgrade</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372974329767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 17:45:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess Wally doesn't follow Intel seriously or he would have known?

It will come in three form factors, the standard 2.5-inch 7mm, mSATA and NGFF M2. Thereâ€™s also a generous choice of capacities, 80GB, 180GB, 240GB and 360GB for mSATA and NGFF M2 drives. The far bigger 2.5-inch will have a choice of 180GB, 240GB, 360GB and 480GB drives. There is still no word on performance, but the new series should end up noticeably faster than 520/525 drives.

He would have hypothesized that Intel would have to sell Apple the parts below cost in order to win business and the Apple products would then cannibalize other Intel products sold at high margins. It is a beautiful Catch22. Half the analysts pitching one view and half the other. If you win Apple, it will destroy margins and your business. If you lose Apple, you can't keep your fabs full and destroy your margins.

In fact, Wall Street has moved Intel down by a couple of bucks. The only way this would make any sense is if the mobility market is shrinking. It's not. It's still experiencing strong growth and Intel is getting a larger and larger piece of a growing pie. Welcome to you can't have it both ways, Wall Street! Is it possible that Wall Street still doesn't get it? After Silvermont? After Haswell? After the Samsung deal and new tablets? After the Bay Trail performance news? After FinFET? After ARM's failure to get traction with RT or in servers? With volume 14nm FinFET production just around the corner? No, it's not possible. Wall Street is looking for an exit strategy and is looking to unload its losing Intel short positions to whomever it can convince in the short-term that the sky is falling. ARM is great they say - couldn't be better, all fears are overstated. Just pay attention to who has his hand in your pocket, groping around for your wallet.
