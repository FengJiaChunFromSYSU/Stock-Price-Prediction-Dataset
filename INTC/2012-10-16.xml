The doom and gloom has been substantially oversold. Even Jack Welch got it wrong and was unaware of significant improvements in the economy: The economy is improving more than professional forecasters anticipated, particularly in data on employment and housing, according to the Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’ predictions. The index, based on gauges compiled by private businesses and trade groups in addition to government, confirms U.S. growth is generating jobs in the face of a global slowdown and looming federal spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff." 2.) Wall Street hasn't just gotten the Intel story wrong, they have gone stark raving mad pricing in the same news again and again and again. Wall Street has priced in an $8 billion revenue miss. Intel's revenues would half to decline by half to justify the reduction in the stock price Wall Street has now baked in. Does anyone really think Intel's revenues will decline by half??? This is what happens when you price in the same thing over and over and over. Revenue miss announced. Chump Street prices it in. General economic conditions decline (which is why the revenue miss is announced along with the Windows 8 wait). Chump Street prices it in. Report of chip sales decline. Same thing and Chump Street prices it in. News of AMD having problems. Chump Street prices this in even though it's a good thing for Intel. And on and on and on. The same exact thing. 3.) Employment is improving. Housing has really improved. Consumer sentiment has reached pre-recession levels. The news from China is improving. 4.) Intel's mobility strategy is gaining strength. The new Motorola smartphone demonstrates this. Intel now has Motorola, Karbonn, MegaFon, Lenovo, ZTE, Orange and Lava selling its smartphones. And a big LTE roll-out in the US planned for 2013. 5.) Intel's new tablet design is really good and will open up the tablet market, especially in the enterprise area. 6.) Intel's fabrication lead is huge and growing every day. Intel is ramping up while ARM is coasting to a stop and will pause after 20nm for an extended period of time. 7.) Intel's WiFi chip development is going to give them a significant advantage with the Internet of Things (IoT) as connectivity of devices (modems, routers, sensors, RF Tags, ATMs, vending machines, signs, coffee makers, etc.) generates a new network as large as the existing cellular network with a revenue stream just as large. 8.) 2013 will be the year after which there will never ever be the need to buy an ARM chip except at the low end of the market as ARM evolves into the next AMD due to lack of technology, fabrication and manufacturing. 9.) Intel will have five 22nm facilities running in 2013 and quickly moving to 14nm. ARM is struggling just to provide 28nm to its customers. Those wanting state-of-the-art technology will have to move to Intel. 10.) Intel will continue its every eight quarter fab cycle. No company on earth can match it. It will continue its tick-tock strategy to integrate design and fabrication improvements. I believe Marsavian said it best: "Medfield is just the starter but Silvermont will be the main course and will ask questions of Arm chips that they probably won't be able to answer. Haswell is such an awesome design that will be like the second coming of Conroe which struck down Athlon64 with a mighty blow that AMD never recovered from. Haswell will be a similar quantum jump in performance and there will be sub 10W versions. 14nm Broadwall though will get the power down to 5W which is tablet class. At 14nm Intel is going to squeeze ARM from above with Broadwell and below with Airmont, probably only Apple's bespoke processor will still look any good in comparison. Even well before then the 32nm Medfield/Clovertrail generation will spread far and wide in phones and tablets and Windows 8 will give PCs a buying boost."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350368100207</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 02:15:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350368187178-19</Id><Topic><Title>The Only Thing That Will Save Shorts</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350311137103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 10:25:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is failing in mobile.

It's about selling those silicone chips and that's something Intel is having trouble doing. If you think that a miss is prices in that you are dead-wrong. As I've said, I doubt that Intel will miss, since they surely setup the latest warning so they can handily beat the lowered estimates. As for the economy - it's definitely improving (at least until we get hit with the fiscal cliff). Unfortunately for Intel, those retail sales are going to iPhone and iPad sales and not to PCs (despite Intel's great fabrication). So, a better economy does little to help Intel at this point.</Msg><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1350372064015</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 03:21:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350372889743-30</Id><Topic><Title>What Shorts Know But Literally Can't Afford to Admit</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350368100207</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 02:15:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel just warned and lowered revenues for Q3 by 10% and "Wall Street" has it wrong?

If this is 25% faster per clock and the clock rate is also faster because of (32nm-- 22nm) Silvermont should be say 40% faster than Apple's current A6, A15 based ARM and Krait current gen (assuming that these three are comparable). Silvermont alternatives will probably catch up 2014 when TSMC 20nm comes into play. ---- The benchmarks in question: Motorola RAZR i Motorola Droid RAZR M ZTE Grand X IN Quadrant 4,226 4,944 2,710 Vellamo 1,928 2,442 1,550 SunSpider 0.9.1 (ms) 1,077 1,951 1,355 AnTuTu 6,175 6,364 N/A GLBenchmark Egypt Offscreen (fps) 41 56 N/A CF-Bench 3,115 9,392 873 SunSpider: lower scores are better As you can see, the RAZR i beats in one benchmark only. The 25% improvement in Silvermont, isn't clock, it's IPC, so if Silvermont had the same base clock (and turbo) as Medfield it would be 25% faster. If it has a faster clock, then the speed improvements would be compounded. If the 25% Silvermont IPC improvements are true, then she is going to struggle to gain any clear water against Krait especially with the various improvements coming with Krait in the next few months (faster clocks etc). As for the A15, it's IPC over the A9 is claimed to be 30-40%, with TI claiming an 50% improvement at the same clock over it's previous design (this is due to other things than just IPC). If this is true, and if the A15 can be clocked high without killing the battery then Silvermont actually falls behind the existing A9 to Medfield comparisons/benchmarks. If you want to have a feel of what 'better' benchmarks look like, head over to geekbench and search for various A9/Krait/Apple A6 then search on Atom. See where Atom win's and loses and by how much.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1350374936448</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 04:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350381727247-32</Id><Topic><Title>WE will trade over $25.00 by Friday....</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1350343297818</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:21:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to read and analyse intels income stream of past years. Intels income from the PC group was approx 60% of total sales. My guess that 60% of sales contributes approx 40% of EPS. The other 40% of revenues contributes 60% of EPS. Simple fact that needs to be recognised here is that the PC is about to be reborn, with Win8, touchscreen, apps, X86 compatability. Most bussinesses that have been delaying PC harware upgrade due to economics, and downtun, are running out of time as like all mechanical things CPU's have a limited life span. All those old pentium 4 class PC's are dead in the water, they wont be replaced by a ARM tablet or iPhone. if you believe all you write you should be shorting intel and calling ARM and APPL.

Manufacturing is up. Industrial production in the U.S. rose more than forecast in September, partially reversing the prior month’s slump, indicating manufacturers are regaining their footing. 2.) Retail sales are up. The biggest two-month gain in retail sales in almost two years may mean demand from American consumers is making up for slowing sales overseas and declining business investment as the so-called fiscal cliff approaches. A pickup in manufacturing would help give the world’s largest economy a lift. 3.) Earnings season isn't looking anything like the disaster that the doom and gloom types on Wall Street projected. 4.) Intel's miss was priced in too many times for the same exact reason each time. 5.)

The entry level version, with 32GB of storage and no Touch Cover keyboard ends up with a $499 price tag. An $599 will buy you a 64GB unit, or a 32GB unit bundled with the keyboard. So, the priciest model, with 64GB of storage and a bundled Touch Cover ends up at $699. Sold separately, the Touch Cover is priced at $119, while the black Surface Type Cover, with proper hardware keys, is priced at $129. This sounds a bit too steep and very close to what Asus is asking for its Transformer keyboards, which also feature a battery, USB and SD slot. So, the pricing is pretty much in line with entry level iPad versions, but we’re not sure that makes the Surface RT very competitive. The iPad boasts an unmatched ecosystem and a high-definition Retina screen, while the Surface features a 1366x768 screen and a completely new OS with a limited choice of apps. Let’s hope we're not looking at Microsoft’s next Zune. [Or Kin.

Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree told MarketWatch that the gains apparently were due to "more talk of Apple moving away from Samsung as a foundry" which has also led to speculation that either Intel or TSMC may be tapped to manufacture chips for Apple Inc.

(More...) Intel (INTC) reports earnings after the market close today and is expected to see a 23% decline in earnings per share to $0.50 versus $0.65 per share in the same quarter last year. The company has beaten expectations by an average of $0.04 in each of the last eight quarters but it is likely that the trailing earnings will be lowered to around $2.26 per share. While a continuation of poor PC sales may make the bears happy, the current price multiple is 30% below the near-term average and upcoming catalysts could improve sentiment. Problems mostly Cyclical The semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical and revenues can drop precipitously when business spending declines. Intel saw total revenue fall more than 9% from $14.2 billion in the third quarter 2011 to $12.9 billion in the first quarter of 2012 before rebounding in the last quarter. Expectations for the today's report are for a $300 million drop from the last quarter to $13.2 billion. The reason for the drop in revenues, and much of the negative sentiment as of late, is the slowdown in PC business. The switch from PCs to tablets and smartphones is driving an estimated 8% decline in revenues for the company's PC client group which accounted for $8.7 billion or 64% of total revenue in the second quarter. While the trend away from PC is something the company needs to address, much of the recent decline in sales is likely cyclical instead of a structural shift from the product. PC sales are expected to fall 1.2% this year, the first decline in 11 years. Is this really news though? Investors had to expect some bad news given the global economic picture and slower business spending leading up to the rollout of new Windows products. A Management Team that has Always Delivered Despite the weakness in macro issues, management has delivered with an operating margin of 30.8%, above 95% of competitors in the industry. Even with a 34% payout ratio and a 4.2% dividend yield, management has grown the book value of the firm by 7.5% annualized over the last ten years. A return on equity of 25.4% is great in just about any industry, but it beats 96% of Intel's competitors in the semiconductor group. The company had $13.6 billion of cash and short-term investments last quarter and cash flows from operations of $4.7 billion. Cash flow was more than enough to pay for $1.7 billion in investment and $2.2 billion in financing, including $1.4 billion for share buybacks. Even after recent weakness in shares, investors have been rewarded with a 7.1% annualized return over the last 10 years. Next Year Presents Strong Catalysts for Growth Windows has announced that it will only provide support for XP until April of 2014. While many businesses have already transitioned out of the system, next year should see an increase in desktop replacement. While Win8 failed to impress the markets when delivered on Nokia's (NOK) new smartphone, next year brings the launch of touch-enabled Ultrabooks at lower prices that could better utilize the new software. Further, the lower prices should help to bring in the late adopters into the product line. The company plans on launching Haswell in the first quarter. The new processor is expected to offer twice the graphics performance at significantly less power consumption than standard products. Beyond any micro-level events, any pick up in the macro environment will help to drive sales in developed markets as well as continue the strong growth seen in emerging markets. Even if trailing earnings come down to $2.26 and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio increases to 9.6 times, the stock will only have been cheaper 5% of the time over the last decade. While the stock saw much higher valuations before 2004, it has averaged 12.5 times since 2010. This average multiple is 30% higher than the current and upcoming catalysts could drive sentiment even higher. Weakness in PC sales may seem like a structural problem but the company has responded to industry changes before and has always been able to adapt. Next year provides several catalysts for a return of sentiment and a rebound to the average price multiple yields a 30% upside on top of a healthy 4% dividend.</Msg><Username>tooofunnky</Username><Timestamp>1350403244209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:00:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350403308518-129</Id><Topic><Title>Add Another</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350402694895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>soon or later u can add more more, because it's no power to go up, I told u so!</Msg><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1350403308518</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:01:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350403639446-130</Id><Title>intc to buy amd soon my gut feel 3.50 buyout offer wish list</Title><Msg>wish list 3.50 amd buyout will help intel</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1350403639446</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:07:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350403711249-131</Id><Topic><Title>Add Another</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350402694895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After earnings it will likely drop back down to 21.50 area... then a week later go up to 23 and soon after 24...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350403711249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:08:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350404158163-132</Id><Topic><Title>Add Another</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1350402694895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this junk doesn't have power, I told u so!

Intel had dominant control of the PC CPU business and acquiring the only other PC CPU competitor would not have been approved. Additionally, keeping AMD around lessened the involvement of the FTC and DOJ into Intel's business. However, the environment is different today. Windows runs on ARM processors and one can buy ARM servers, tablets and smartphones already. ARM supporters say ARM will be in every segment of Intel's business and the market has already priced-in damage to Intel's business future because of the ARM factor. In short, the big difference today is that customers have choice for their Windows and Android CPU's and an Intel takeover of AMD shouldn't be the concern it once was by anti-trust types. To Intel, there would be numerous benefits. First Intel would reclaim the x86 intellectual property the court unjustly gave to AMD in the '90s. Secondly, they would gain ATI's graphics technology and patents to gain further advantage over Nvidia and third, Intel would remove the constant pressure of having a perpetually weak AMD low-ball x86 pricing. What was unthinkable yesterday may well be possible today.

The moderator than, unlike the idiot on PBS, calls him out on the lies. Romney calls the fat btttch some name and is rude to her. That would be a massive win for Obummer. But likely--Obummer, who was a woosey boy last debate will continue to be a woosey boy. Romney called him "BOY", and Obummer did nothing last debate. But no matter what--it is the crowd that could make Romney fold. Obummer will be hammered on the killings in Libya but in the end--Americans want to hear about the economy and domestic policy. Women want to hear about women and their right to abortion. I say unless Obama goes nasty and calls Romney out on every lie, that Obummer loses the debate and the election. Rombo is going to be screwed when people in the crowd ask him about issues and he refuses to answer. What will you cut in the budget Romney? Oh well---Obummer is against the wall. if he loses the debate, the election is lost. However, if Romney loses, his GOP gang will implode. Never in my life has one debate been so important. What if Romney flips out and calls Obummer NGR? HAAA HAAA I would pay for that on pay per view. The crowd would go nuts and the debate would be over. But more likely is that Obummer has some dirt on Romney and his taxes that will go out.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1350409616668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:46:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350409621336-174</Id><Topic><Title>INTC up 10% tonite if meet expectations &amp; guidance</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1350407885569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:18:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Based on past performance after earnings, we won't see $23 till next month at earliest... $25 not likely till closer till 4th quarter earnings report...

PC is dead is all #$%$ : apple and its products( exclude laptops) are based off consumer taste - it is not a necessity but PC will be here for some time. QWERTY - the keyboard alphabets on our PC/Laptop was derived from typewriters. Computer technology could not replace that. PC also is somthing similar.

What just happened? Apple is transitioning from ARM to INTEL. Why? Because TSM does not have the capacity or production capacity for the high end chips needed to cover Apple's chip demand. As 22nm and 14nm INTEL chips hit the market ARM chips will soon no longer be able to compete with INTEL chips. In the short term TSM will produce the A7 while Apple products increasingly adopt the premium performance of INTEL's chips to stay competitive. Expect more hardware company defections from ARM chips to INTEL as INTEL slaughters the competition. I believe the timing on this will be Q1 2013.</Msg><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1350411498591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:18:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350411500778-186</Id><Topic><Title>If INTC doesn't raise div, announce large buyback, or how they will get this stock to $30, I'm selling and buying more AAPL.</Title><Username>jdr52683</Username><Timestamp>1350410991955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope.

(2) From the foundry angle, Intel can sign up deals that may not be directly related to its x86 business. There are several rumors about Cisco signing up as a customer for Intel's foundry business. It will take only a few deals like this for Intel to further decimate the volumes and revenues of the "pure foundries", which will impact their capacity to invest in newer fabs and processes. We have seen some wins under (1) above.

When demand increases manufactures increase production to meet that demand (Econ 101). In most cases this results in additional employees being hired. These newly hired employees generally use the income that they receive to buy things that they need or want thereby increasing demand for those items. This cycle repeats itself again and again thereby creating more demand and more jobs until the cycle is finally broken. This cycle was broken in 2009 when the banking crisis developed, the stock market crashed, the housing market collapsed, and hundreds of thousands of individuals lost their jobs. So the question becomes what can our country do to increase demand. Here are a few suggestions for your consideration. 1.Reduce taxes on that segment of our population that will spend the increased income that is available to them. 2. Provide additional monetary stimulus to our economy by investing in our countries infrastructure. education, research and development and in new industries that will have a long term benefit to our society. 3. Provide tax incentives to companies bringing jobs back to the United States. If you have other suggestion lets hear them.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350422254823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350422272183-376</Id><Topic><Title>Singhlion said he was going to cover at 19.........even though Intel is going to Single Digits</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350419668997</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:34:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ENTERPRISE SLOW DOWN/CONSUMER SLOW DOWN/ECONOMIC CRISIS FORCING OEM'S LESS INVENTORY?WHAT A GREAT CC Absolutely more warnings in DEC 2012 again PC demand hell and smart phones lagard Windows8 based pads.......demand will be LOL Laptop remains only bright spot Enterprise demand hell warning is very bad Horrible Horrible Guidance ..Listening into CC Re: Stacy Smith just said Margins would BOTTOM in Q4 then move UP as they focused capacity on 14nm By singhlion2001 . 34 seconds ago .

Essentially intel will continue to say bad things and outperfrom the projections and after all is said and done you will simply see that not only 2012 wasnt particularly down year vs 2011 but that eventually all stock declines were a jock and a pivotal entry for 30 and 40 eventually after Obama is re-elected and the losers Republicans are forced to cooperate with him or destroy the US with their blessings.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1350422891578</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350422894080-392</Id><Topic><Title>Stacy Smith just said Margins would BOTTOM in Q4 then move UP as they focused capacity on 14nm</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350419413422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:30:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody of significance is buying any mobile chips from Intel.

Intel isn't going to $25 or $26 in 2012 without some new business, some Apple business, some new developments, something. Cutting capex, lower gross margins, and a slowing macro environment. What's funny is the biggest Bull or #$%$'er here is WW and the last thing Intel needs is Obama to stay and that's what the biggest #$%$'er here wants.

You need a faster pc to do what? What are you running that is going to be improved by a faster processor and a newer verson of windows? Tell me one thing Windows 8 will do for you that my Windows XP doesnt't do and really matters in the scheme of things? Like nyk20h said....PC's used to be replaced every 2 years and I will admit I was part of that cycle for the past 2 decades. But I see no software, except for perhaps games (both processor and vide intensive) that require anything new. I will offer this suggestion. If you have a second hard drive on your desktop put a new installation of Windows there and boot from it. I will predict you will see a significant improvement. The overhead of patches and security fixes packed onto an original windows install, will over time greatly degrade its performance. I think you will find that its not your processor or windows version that is slowing things down but rather a pasted, glued, and fragmented version of windows that has been slowing you down. Try it...I think you will be surprised.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1350428328988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350428415123-494</Id><Topic><Title>Expect the stock to go up ...</Title><Username>stockplaza555</Username><Timestamp>1350425590063</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:13:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said ...

Before, it was a race to see who could upgrade INTC the most. Now, it will be a race to see who can come in with the lowest guidance. Bernstein set the high bar with $20 last week. We should see targets in the low teens, setting up every short with a margin account. Don't argue fundamentals, just ride this short train, trust me on this.

Stock up $50 even since. At least Intel beat revised estimates which already has caused stock to go down nearly $3, and slightly guided lower than current expectations. Chances are, Intel set a very low bar to handily beat expectations once again. They are depending somewhat on the Windows 8 launch. If analysts think Windows 8 will not do much, then Microsoft is in a bigger trouble than Intel. Intel has software number two to capitalize on which is Android by Google. Intel has reason to be excited about the future. I would definitely take any weakness in stock to add to position. Maybe in form of call options this time being that so little is expected of Intel with the low premiums being asked for by investors. Long term options of course.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350431656016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 19:54:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350431757508-530</Id><Topic><Title>Yo Whobeli.. ask yourself these questions....</Title><Username>bimmy.beoris</Username><Timestamp>1350429868407</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 19:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$15B in cash are there against accounts payable.

Apple losing market-share is not simply a case of customers delaying purchases in anticipation of the iPhone 5. It's about the Galaxy III being as big or bigger than the iPhone 4s. I personally know multiple people who switched from and iPhone to Samsung - something which was unheard of since the launch of the iPhone. The gap has closed, and Apple has no way of opening it again. Any hopes of having an iPod like control over the smartphone market are gone and that means margin pressure and constant market-share risk.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350434487595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:41:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350434517124-565</Id><Topic><Title>NYK2OH shorted Intel from 25 to 29 at least twice on the way up and got KILLED</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350426126705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:22:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nyk20h is a loser who spends his life posting negativity because he has no money left and is just too jealous when everyone else makes it.</Msg><Username>bull_no_bear</Username><Timestamp>1350434517124</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:41:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350434520086-566</Id><Topic><Title>Expect the stock to go up ...</Title><Username>stockplaza555</Username><Timestamp>1350425590063</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:13:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry- but declining revenues does not make a stock go up --your wallet will soon be hurting even more if buy here--this will certainly go below 20 and possibly below 18--watch and see.</Msg><Username>marrohead</Username><Timestamp>1350434520086</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350434647924-567</Id><Topic><Title>14nm</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1350431940099</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 19:59:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hit the limit of 5, so I cannot respond to your delusional post.

The other three announced partners, and there are said to be other unannounced partners, are Achronix, Tabula and Netronome. Netronome is a network processor company from Santa Clara, California Intel's home town, with whom Intel has been working for five years on development but onlt signed up for foundry services earlier this year.

There will be more than 140 Core based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of a tablet. Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point with some Bridge SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom based tablets from six or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand new SoC that will enable tablets as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds. With three weeks of connected standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect. I am excited about these products and the capability they bring to consumers and the enterprise. We continue to make progress in handhelds with Motorola’s launch of the Razer I, the world’s only two gigahertz smart phone that delivers better battery life than similar competing devices. In general I see the computing market in a period of transition but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity. Intel has a history of navigating the industries transitions and emerging better and stronger. But the hardware and software road map expand the smallest portable devices to the most powerful data center servers and world leading silicon process technology, we are excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets .

I think your confusing dividend and yield. The dividend is probably safe...but that doesn't mean the yield is. What I was trying to illustrate was that a dividend yield of 4.09% isn't some magic number that has in the past supported the share price of this or some other stocks. I used AT&amp;T and its yield of 5% as an example. If the share price of INTC falls to $19, and I'm not saying it is or isn't, the dividend yield would then be 4.74%. Is there anything magical about that number? No. Does it make the stock more attractive? Sure. If the stock goes to $23, the dividend yield becomes 3.91%. Does it become less attractive? Probably a bit. At $25 the yield was 3.6%. At $22 the yield is 4.09% . The share price has fallen $3 since 9/6/2012, the dividend, when you get it, will only have protected you $0.225 cents, or 7% of the decline. Dividends are great when the market is moving higher as you get not only the share price apprecation but the dividend as well. In a decline, it does very little to buffer the pain except to take away some of the sting. Is it better than a stock that pays no dividend? Sure. Are high yielding stocks better in the long run that low or non yielding stocks. Sure again. But that does not mean that in the short run...there may be some share price pain as we have seen over the last several weeks. And often times the share price can challenge ones stamina in waiting around for 4% when the share price has fallen 20%.

After the job you did last night the stock shot up this morning. Pretty sure you can do it again - especially if you just make stuff up like that shown above. You've obviously run out of your tiny selection of facts. Instead why don't you tell us how Wall Street totally blew the call by predicting an $8 billion revenue miss when it turns out there wasn't ANY revenue miss. Or earnings miss either.

I dropped $800 one night at blackjack and spent $5,000 over past 2 years trying to get even. I have better luck with stocks. I only dropped around $500 on shorting BAC, but I was smart enough to get out before it was all gone. I figure if I just get 2 out of three right, I can make a nice living out of this. I've been out of work for over a year and there is absolutely nothing out there. __________________________________________________________________________ .
