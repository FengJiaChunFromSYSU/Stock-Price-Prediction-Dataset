Looks like it's time for another incremental ARM put buy. Here are some of the things putting pressure on ARM: 1.) Big news on Apple's declining margins as reflected in the declining stock price. It would seem that any big decline in Apple would affect ARM. Hasn't til now, but it looks like that is changing. 2. Better than expected reception for the Surface Pro. Although still an imperfect product, it shows that Intel tablets are going to be in demand and will have greatly superior performance to all ARM tablets. 3.) As many as 200 million IT workers may be holding out for the right Windows 8 tablet, Forrester says. And that means an Intel tablet, not an ARM toy. 4.) News on an Apple smartwatch is heating up. This is supposedly in development with Intel. This would be a shocking development that would crush the ARM stock price if it happens. I'd expect ARM to drop below 20 no more than six months after Intel begins shipment of 14nm product.

Substitute period for DOT. Some call-outs from the presentation: 1) At 16/14nm, they expect only Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. Callout: If no other foundry joined the 16/14nm camp, fabless companies would not be happy at all. (That would be Qualcomm, nVidia, Apple - where are they going to get their Snapdragons, Kraits, Tegras, and A#s made?) 2) Callout: The number of designs that foundry can support is declining as process technology advances. (Would foundries (only TSMC at 16/14nm) even take on companies that are directly competing with Intel in the mobile SoC space?) 3) Callout: Only a few high-end chip makers today can even afford the exorbitant cost of NEXT-GENERATION RESEARCH AND DESIGN, much less the fabs to build them Summary:  Semiconductor industry is going toward the post Moore’s law era. Uncertainty increases and roadmap is no longer clear.  Only few companies have the capability to build beyond 20nm fab.. Moreover, few fabless companies can involve the products development at this advanced technology node.  The relationship between fabless company and foundry become sensitive. Foundry will only select the fabless companies with high volume products and strong capabilities. Once fabless company chooses a foundry, it will not change. Some kind of “binding” between them will be established.  Design engineers should be manufacturing-aware and have indepth understanding of the process variables. DFM and DFY are new challenges.  Software is important. Fabless company should be aware of the value of IC vendor software.  China is the most important semiconductor market for both domestic and global industry. Although there are many difficulties, China will certainly welcome a new turn of fast growth in this area.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1360593811269</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 09:43:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360594989225-24</Id><Topic><Title>Can we all agree-there is NO presidential election for 4 more years.

All the data suggests Intel's predictions were correct. There will be Intel and maybe two others capable of competing for top tier product. But one of the remaining two, Samsung, may be captive to their own products which leaves one foundry for everyone else. The non-captive foundry will have to behave like one to compete and that means it will have to significantly downsize the number of customers it serves, make far fewer designs and make their customers share far more of the risk and cost. The ARM ecosystem will undergo a huge transformation, fabless companies will engage in bitter infighting for limited top tier capacity and the surviving companies will face higher costs. Very useful data and a good reminder of Intel's earlier prediction.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360596119063</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 10:21:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360596156487-29</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Is Toast: Here's Why</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"At 90nm there were 19 ARM foundries.

My SG2 Skyrocket's response and battery life are very poor. Sure its look is attractive and display is very nice. Also its 4.5" screen size saved me from needing a separate tablet. SG3 is even better. I had almost gone for SG3 as my second famility smartphone, but backed out reminding myself of SG2 user experience. If more people catch up with this experience, SG's will no longer be hot. Will be replaced by Lenovos', Motorolas' models. So Samsung's dominance at present is not the end of the road.

The headline numbers are a tease for their $2500.00 report. Forrester seems like a reputable company but survey questions are tough to properly craft. From an Information Week article by Michael Endler | February 08, 2013 01:28 PM . Surface Pro Demand: Don't Believe The Hype "The figure is an extrapolation of data collected for Forrester's 2013 Mobile Workforce Adoption Trends, which surveyed almost 10,000 information workers in 16 countries and found that 32% of respondents want Windows running on their next work tablet." and later .... "In an interview, Forrester analyst Ted Schadler said it's possible demand for a Windows 8 tablet has declined and acknowledged that Surface Pro might not be the device survey respondents envisioned. He countered, however, that the "main point is that people thought and likely still think that Microsoft is a contender in tablets." This point is valid; Redmond certainly has the reputation and resources to inspire anticipation and confidence among would-be tablet buyers. The question, though, is whether Surface Pro will be the device that actually translates these sentiments into sales.

Neither semiconductor guy nor 61 understand capex - and the chip analysts have the same problem. Was a good slide show / contribution - and don't waste your time on the idiot posters "Result: FD-SOI die cost less At the 28nm node, if you only look at the processed wafer cost, the FD-SOI solutions are roughly 7% higher. However, yield issues and the net die/wafer at 28nm have a major impact on the bottom line. When defect densities and parametric yields are factored in, the FD-SOI solution results in a lower per-die cost: from 8% lower for the smaller, low-power chips, to 18% for large, high-performance chips. At 20nm, however, the FD-SOI processed wafer cost is less than both bulk CMOS and FinFET processed wafers. The FD-SOI processed wafer cost advantage is then massively increased when yields are factored in." From advanced substrate news published by Handel Jones in November of 2012 Once ~20nm bulk FinFETs have matured in Q1/2016, FD-SOI will still offer comparative per-die savings of 50-60%.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1360614142188</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 15:22:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360615474843-70</Id><Title>Going to buy a yacht with these big 2 cents gains on Intel</Title><Msg>Really swimming in money</Msg><Username>harrydick836</Username><Timestamp>1360615474843</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 15:44:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360616159102-71</Id><Title>Microsoft accused of Surface Pro shenanigans!</Title><Msg>Dagger Surface Pro availability: Sold out?

Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. It means a extra cost of 50-100M USD per year.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360634152883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 20:55:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360634385811-91</Id><Title>Surface pro sold out is just the begining for intel</Title><Msg>Intels just getting started in mobile and the surface pro sold out.All you have to do is wait good things are starting to come are way.14nm is just around the corner.All you need is a holding in intell and patience .patience is not waiting a week or a month try a year and this ball will be rolling two years and look out.Sit back and collect, patience........</Msg><Username>kravcleve</Username><Timestamp>1360634385811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 20:59:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360635104443-92</Id><Title>AMD delays next gen graphics cards</Title><Msg>[Sorry, Tom but AMD has more problems than you can shake a stick at...] [Note: Expect all the ARM marketing departments to use the same slant on its products, "Everyone is happy, we don't need any stinking new products - just like we don't need any stinking new fabrication!!!"] Uneventful year ahead of us While some people are packing in smoking, AMD thinks it is a good idea to pack in releasing new graphics cards, at least for a year or so. AMD marketing manager Robert Hallock told Megagames that the company has no intentions to release Radeon HD 8000 series cards for the foreseeable future. "The HD 7000 Series will remain our primary focus for quite some time," he said. When pressed he said that AMD and its partners are happy with the HD 7000 Series, and it will continue to be its emphasis in the channel for the foreseeable future. There had been some rumours that an HD 8000 Series was being developed. However AMD has never confirmed it and so far there has been no proof that any were ready to show up. Hallock’s comments lend credibility to rumours that the HD 8000 family won’t be out before Q4 2013.

Both online and physical retail stores are now out of stock. In Seattle, some waited up to two hours in line over the weekend to get their hands on the tablet, Geekwire reports. Mr. Softy later told the news site that response has been "amazing" and that the company is working with retailers to "replenish supplies as quickly as possible." We don't yet know how much inventory Microsoft had to sell, so it's too soon to compare initial demand for the Surface Pro to other high-profile device launches. Still, if the Forrester report is to be believed -- and it's looking spot-on so far -- Microsoft may have emerged as Apple's most serious challenger in tablet computing. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) , meanwhile, must be thrilled. The chip maker, whose technology powers the Surface Pro, has struggled to win enough mobile business to offset declining sales to PC makers. Microsoft has suffered from the same issue. Windows division revenue came in at $5.9 billion in the latest quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase but more than $1 billion short of Microsoft's last major release. Windows 7 helped push division revenue to $6.9 billion in fiscal 2010's second quarter. A weakening Windows business is bad news for Mr. Softy. Surface Pro may be the second wind the company needs. At the very least, the weekend sellout suggests users see it as a competent enough iPad alternative to keep them using the same Windows ecosystem for tablet computing that they use for desktop computing. A tourniquet designed to tie off bleeding caused by flagging PC sales, in other words. That's a huge win for a business that's spent the better part of a decade under assault.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360635237163</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 21:13:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360635613181-94</Id><Topic><Title>Will Intel ever see 25/share again?</Title><Username>stuckinintelfrom27</Username><Timestamp>1360629563972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 19:39:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>be patient</Msg><Username>joemama56</Username><Timestamp>1360635613181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 21:20:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360635752880-95</Id><Topic><Title>Will Intel ever see 25/share again?</Title><Username>stuckinintelfrom27</Username><Timestamp>1360629563972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 19:39:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the king will rise again</Msg><Username>joemama56</Username><Timestamp>1360635752880</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 21:22:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360636059794-96</Id><Title>ARM Bubble Watch</Title><Msg>Hmmm, maybe that should be the the Bubble-popping iWatch.
