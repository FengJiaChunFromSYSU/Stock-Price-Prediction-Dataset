We believe InterDigital’s recent successful appeal with Nokia will be an important catalyst with other licensees. - Valuation: IDCC shares trade at over 50 times our 2012 EPS estimate, which does not include upside from potential agreements with Nokia, LG, ZTE, and Huawei (largely because of uncertainty in timing). Combined, these opportunities generate annual incremental EPS of up to $5 per year and current valuation reflects a conservative view of the prospects for resolutions with unlicensed vendors, especially in light of the company’s recent favorable appeal against Nokia . With more than 18,000 patents (following the pending sale of 1,700 patents to Intel), InterDigital is the third-largest holder of 3G patents and second-largest holder of essential 4G patents. The company therefore has a formidable and defensible position in the wireless world. According to TechIPm, the company holds an estimated 19% of all the essential patents for the LTE standard. Other top players in the LTE space include Qualcomm, Nokia, LG, and Samsung. According to TechIPm, by July 2010 roughly 81% of all 4G IPR was shared among these five players</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1350983216382</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:06:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350983326240-14</Id><Topic><Title>Acer planning smartphones with Intel chips.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1350977891528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 03:38:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gosh, Intel has garnered so many design wins for its first mobile chips and from all corners of the world.

A strong uptick on Apple Inc.’s shares on Monday morning gave a lift to much of the tech sector, though one of the company’s more notable suppliers missed out on the action. Qualcomm Inc. QCOM-0.99%, which makes the modem chips used in popular products such as the iPhone 5 and latest iPads, was trading down about 1% on Monday morning – extending a slide that has knocked more than 9% off the stock over the last month. Apple AAPL-0.63% was up 1.7% at last check, likely on anticipation of a new, smaller iPad to be introduced at an event on Tuesday. The reason is centered around worries of continued shortages of the 28 nanometer chips used in high-end wireless devices. Qualcomm reported a shortage of these chip products earlier this year, but has been scrambling to improve supply. But the launch of popular devices like the iPhone 5 can act as a further constraint on tight supply. And as Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan noted in a report on Monday, the market conditions for 28nm chips are still a “zero sum game,” in which chips shipped to Apple for its products are not shipped to other big Qualcomm clients, such as HTC, which makes it hard to generate revenue upside even from a popular device launch. In fact, Hall said he believes that Wall Street’s shipment estimates for Qualcomm’s first fiscal quarter ending in December “have likely gotten ahead of reality as 28nm supply remains an issue.” He thinks that December quarter numbers will “come back to Earth” after Qualcomm reports its results on Nov. 7. Both Qualcomm and Apple have been weighed down by investors’ concerns on product shortages. Despite Monday’s uptick of 1.6%, Apple shares remain about 11% below their $700 level on the day of the iPhone 5 launch on Sept. 21. Qualcomm is down 9% in that same period. – Dan Gallagher</Msg><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1350998124738</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:15:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350998340244-34</Id><Topic><Title>INTC has plenty</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1350998124738</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:15:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You whining becaue Intel won't make chips for the competitors is hilarious.

"Naked short selling, or naked shorting, is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset of any kind without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed, as is conventionally done in a short sale. When the seller does not obtain the shares within the required time frame, the result is known as a "failure to deliver". The transaction generally remains open until the shares are acquired by the seller, or the seller's broker settles the trade.[1] Short selling is used to anticipate a price fall, but exposes the seller to the risk of a price rise."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350998369717</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350998515559-36</Id><Title>New low coming today...</Title><Msg>I speculate 21.20 (in that area) as the new low today.</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1350998515559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350998677547-37</Id><Topic><Title>Demand NAKED Short Selling to STOP!</Title><Username>dedrapop</Username><Timestamp>1342024403000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-11 12:33:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>has the raw data on naked shorting.

(AAPL)’s iPhone, said it started the current quarter with a record order backlog after third-quarter sales rose more than estimated by analysts. Revenue in the three months through September rose 19 percent to 144.6 million pounds ($231 million), the Cambridge, England-based company said today in a statement. The average estimate by analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for sales of 139.4 million pounds. Pretax profit gained 29 percent to 55.3 million pounds. ARM is benefiting from demand for semiconductors used in mobile phones and tablet computers. Apple’s iPad is based on ARM technology, as are most tablets on sale today. The shift in consumer spending to tablets is hurting makers of processors for traditional personal computers. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) last week forecast fourth-quarter sales that will miss analysts’ estimates and said it will cut 15 percent of its staff. ARM predicts a “strong” fourth quarter for licensing revenue as it “enters the final quarter of 2012 with record order backlog and a robust opportunity pipeline,” it said.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351001337004</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:08:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351001529380-46</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>shavonitu85646</Username><Timestamp>1350998448240</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:20:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks legit.

According to his biographer, it was the clever screen trick that convinced Jobs that Apple (AAPL) could make a successful cellphone. According to Scott Forstall, it was a deal-breaker in the company's negotiations with Samsung. "I don't remember specifics," the Apple senior vice president said in a pre-trial deposition. "I think it was just one of the things that Steve said, here's something we invented. Don't -- don't copy it. Don't steal it." And it was one of the five patents on the basis of which the Apple v. Samsung jury decided to hit the leading manufacturer of Google (GOOG) Android phones with $1.05 billion in damages.

When the NOV $22 call bid hits 20 cents, the BID size drops to 300 and the ASK goes to 5,000. BUYING calls supports the stock. SELLING calls pressures it down. The option market maker can be encouraged to buy/sell shares to hedge positions so when you see option volume like this, it implies a narrow trading range.

OBAMA has done fine. He and America would have done much better if Mitch, John and Eric had put America first rather than defeating Obama. It was in their political interest to make Obama fail and they stalled/stopped progress/compromise on every front. They imposed "progress sanctions" on Obama and damaged the US in the action. He shot his wad on healthcare that isn't even defined. It's not a tax yet the supreme court said it can go forward because it is a tax. BUSH APPOINTEE CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS shocked everyone by his choice. Roberts could have easily gutted the legislation but chose not too. The "TAX" angle was a mechanism for Roberts to justify his vote. The key question is "Why did Roberts do that?". Because it was the right thing to do for the country. And for shoving that thru he lost his dimcratic congress, advantage gone and the economy flounders for 3 years after that. So, he runs up the debt and talk about not caring! he doesn't care how high it runs because I have seen a video where he flat out says, he is for wealth redistribution. I HAVE SEEN VIDEOS THAT GLENN BECK AND SEAN HANNITY have modified to make similar points. The economy flounders because of the BUSH FINANCIAL PANIC. Your videos are not important. Yes, BUSH. And NO NOT recession. Do some reading on financial panics and you will see that they recover differently that a recession. It takes 10 to 15 years to heal after a financial panic. The debt is piling up just as fast as it was at the tail of the BUSH term. There is no difference other than BUSH did not have the benefit of the revenue destruction that started on Sept 23rd 2008 when LEH declared bankruptcy and froze the financial markets. No matter what he does, dumb people will remain dumb. The only hope id birth control and education. You can't make his people open books and read. Bernanke is the only tool that has worked. DUMB PEOPLE WILL REMAIN DUMB. That is too easy. At least Romney has run a business. ROMNEY HAS run a business. Bain Capital. ROMNEY HAS run many businesses into bankruptcy. ROMNEY HAS run many businesses to China. ROMNEY HAS run a business for his personal benefit and not others. ROMNEY records on his business dealings, Olympics and MA Governorship are gone. Why did ROMNEY shred all the records of his dealings? We have seen 4 years of failure, we need a change. A QUOTE FROM THE HPQ BOD before hiring Léo Apotheker, disastrous CEO for HPQ ROMNEY IS THE "Léo Apotheker" of American Politics. ROMNEY SAYS HE WILL DO EVERYTHING "ON HIS FIRST DAY".

Choose a 2.3GHz or 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or configure Mac mini with an even faster 2.7GHz Intel Core i7. With up to 2x the performance of the previous generation, Mac mini keeps up with computers twice its size.1 When you’re using processor-intensive applications, Turbo Boost 2.0 increases the clock speed up to 3.4GHz. Hyper-Threading lets each core run two threads, so OS X multitasks even more efficiently. And an integrated memory controller connects fast 1333MHz memory directly to the processor, so it gets right to work on your data.

Declan McCullagh by Declan McCullagh October 23, 2012 10:35 AM PDT (Credit: James Martin/CNET ) Apple's tiny Mac Mini computer has become a bit more capable. At an event today in San Jose, Apple said the revamped Mac Mini will have three USB 3 ports, dual or quad-intel Core i5 or i7 Ivy Bridge, with Intel HD Graphics 4000, and up to 16GB of RAM. It starts at $599 for a 2.5GHz computer with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive. There's also a server edition for $999 that has a pair of 1 TB hard drives. It ships today. The revised Mac Mini will also have a Gigabit Ethernet port, HDMI, Thunderbolt (as before), and an SD card slot. Apple last updated the Mac Mini in July 2011, when it received second-generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPU updates and a Thunderbolt port. It lost its SuperDrive DVD burner -- which has not returned -- but did retain the HDMI port. In July 2011, CNET awarded the previous version of the Mac Mini three out of five stars -- a "good" rating. It had previously sold for prices starting at $599, meaning Apple is keeping the same price.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351014249434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351014337201-115</Id><Topic><Title>Apple: iPad accounts for 91% of web traffic for tablets.</Title><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1351014222244</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ivy Bridge, LOSER.

It has a Core-i3 IvyBridge for $400. Meet Intel's new ultra-compact PC possibility By Loyd Case, PCWorld Sep 12, 2012 1:54 PM Small form factors are the new black, and Intel wants in on the action. Compact systems such as Lenovo's ThinkCentre M92p fill a niche between all-in-one PCs and standard desktop PCs. They take up little space and can be hidden away, yet still offer substantial PC performance. Intel wants to push small form factors even smaller, with its new ultra-compact form factor. Intel first previewed its "Next Unit of Computing" or NUC in May 2012, though details were somewhat sketchy. The company offered few details on storage, specific CPU configuration, or availability. Now Intel is finally prepping the tiny board for October shipments. The 4-by-4-inch board houses a mobile Core i3 Ivy Bridge CPU and chipset on one side. The CPU includes Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics, but using a mobile CPU reduces the power footprint. Flipping the board over reveals four total slots. Two are standard SO-DIMM sockets for memory, one is an M-SATA slot for adding an SSD and the last is a mini-PCI slot that can be used for anything, but would typically be used for a WiFi plus Bluetooth networking card. Also included will be three USB ports and an HDMI connector for video output NUC is an Intel-developed program, with the goal of shrinking a full performance desktop PC into as small a form factor as possible. While it might seem to compete with Via's Pico ITX, the performance is substantially better than the Via Centaur CPU on those boards. The 4-by-4-inch format was chosen as the smallest board capable of supporting an Intel Ivy Bridge CPU with supporting core logic and expansion. NUC is aimed at OEMs that may need the small form factor for embedded applications as well as hobbyists looking to build tiny computers into cards, home theater systems or tiny servers. The dedicated video block inside Intel's HD 4000 GPU can handle two HD video streams at full frame rate. Intel isn't planning on selling complete systems, but will source a small case and external power supply for buyers who want to experiment with building a system. Intel will offer two boards, with the key difference being connectivity. One will include a Thunderbolt port, while the other will have a wired Ethernet connector instead of Thunderbolt. Both will still have WiFi options, similar to those used in many laptops, which will take up the lone mini-PCI slot. OEMs can feel free to use the mini-PCI slot for other purposes if they don't need WiFi. Intel will also offer a chassis just big enough for the board plus an external power supply with the units, so hobbyists and OEMs can experiment with these tiny PCs. The case itself is barely bigger than the 4-by-4-inch board, though the power brick is an external unit. The cases will even have VESA mounts, so can be attached easily to the backs of LCD displays or wall mounted. Since the miniature system is based around off-the-shelf Intel components, the system will be capable of running Windows or Linux. A system with Thunderbolt could connect to a small external hard drive to act as a compact media or home server. Pricing isn't firm yet, but complete kits are targeted to be under $400 for a board, case, and power supply. The two first NUC kits will be available in October.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351017655447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351018103904-138</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC is UP today?</Title><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1351017405081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Microsoft will be innovator from now on (not Apple).</Msg><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1351018103904</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351018240471-139</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC is UP today?</Title><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1351017405081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC pays a very good dividend,that makes the stock attractive as well.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1351018240471</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:50:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351018618098-140</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC is UP today?</Title><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1351017405081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Something is different.

Samsung is cutting Apple displays off. Remember who bought up all the touch displalys for their Ultrabook customers? Intel Samsung Display to terminate Apple deal 10-22-2012 16:26 Samsung Display to terminate Apple deal By Cho Mu-hyun, Kim Yoo-chul Samsung Display plans to terminate its contract with Apple and no longer supply liquid crystal display (LCD) panels to its long time partner, according to industry sources. The news comes as speculation is mounting over a rift between the two firms that have shared a long relationship in electronic components. The display panel manufacturer plans to completely cut its years-long business ties with Apple as it believes its American partner is no longer a cash-generator due to the iPhone maker’s stiffer supply-chain management structure. The Cupertino, California-based firm has been lowering its reliance on Samsung-manufactured displays for use in its popular i-branded devices as it is leveraging its influence to source components from Samsung’s rivals attracted by better pricing. “We are unable to supply our flat-screens to Apple with huge price discounts. Samsung has already cut our portion of shipments to Apple and next year we will stop shipping displays,” said one senior industry official, asking not to be named, Monday. According to multiple sources contacted by The Korea Times, Samsung Electronics’ handset division and Amazon are increasing their orders for displays used in tablets, which is a sufficient substitute for possible losses from cutting the relationship with the iPad maker. Samsung Display was the top supplier to Apple as of the end of the first six months of this year, shipping over 15 million LCDs, followed by its biggest rival LG Display with 12.5 million and Japan’s Sharp with 2.8 million, said market research firm DisplaySearch. “But Samsung shipped less than 3 million to Apple during the third quarter of this year and we expect the quarterly shipment in the fourth quarter to fall to some 1.5 million,” said the source, who is directly involved with the matter. Samsung Display didn’t provide panels for Apple’s new iPad — tentatively named the iPad Mini. The new tablet will have a 7.85 inch screen, which was exclusively reported by The Korea Times in March this year. “Although we are losing Apple business, Samsung looks safe as we found the right alternatives — Amazon and Samsung Electronics’ handset division,” stressed the source. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue. Stock market analysts note that the critical reason for ending ties was due to the plummeting margins from supplying Apple. Even before the coming launch of the iPad Mini, the price per pixel have more than halved from the iPad 2 to the new iPad. Research firm DisplaySearch said the LCD display used in the new iPad, which has a resolution of 2048x1536 millimeters, sports 3.14 million pixels priced at $.00003 per pixel. The one for the iPad 2 was priced at $.000063 per pixel.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351030706089</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:18:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351030753032-166</Id><Topic><Title>Why INTC is UP today?</Title><Username>pakaushik</Username><Timestamp>1351017405081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just bought 700 shares at 21.23 Friday.

Computerworld - BARCELONA -- Intel researchers envision a future of driverless smart cars that can be updated at any time with the latest technology and apps. Intel hopes to play a major role in the new age, creating small, energy-efficient multi-core chips that can make cars more intelligent. "In the next generation, we are talking about quad-core," said Michael Konow, an Intel engineering manager based in Germany. Intel-based smart car system Enno Luebbers, a research scientist at Intel Labs Europe, shows an Intel-based smart car system. Running a low-power processor similar to Intel's Atom chip, the system is running car- and driving-related apps, such as a navigation system, along with an Android-based entertainment system that has games and movies. (Photo by Sharon Gaudin/Computerworld) "We are looking far ahead to safe driving cars," he said. "We would need a lot of compute power for a car to understand that if there's a ball rolling on the street, there might be a kid running after it. This is very, very difficult. As humans, we have intuition. We need to find a way to get this intelligence into the system." Emerging tech Intel readies for programmable smart cars Autonomous cars will arrive within 10 years, Intel CTO says NASA's Curiosity makes first drive at Bradbury Landing 'Talking' smart cars begin year-long test aimed at accident reduction Harvard stores 70 billion books using DNA IBM claims spintronics memory breakthrough Watch out Google: Apple gets patent for wearable device Google Glass launches new age of personal computing NASA shoots for riskier Mars rover landing Researchers use diamonds to boost computer memory More: Emerging Tech page Konow, who presented a smart car demo at Intel's European Research and Innovation Conference here today, told Computerworld that the auto industry is several years away from having many-core chips in cars, but that lab work on the technology is well underway. "A car that drives autonomously and has a 100% guarantee that an accident won't happen would require a lot more compute performance," he said. "How much? We don't really know yet." Today's cars, said Konow and Enno Luebbers, a research scientist at Intel Labs Europe, are getting overloaded with single-core chips. That's a problem, because eventually there won't be enough room for the additional chips that would be necessary to accommodate the ever-growing user demand for new functionality. Adding a new function requires adding a new chip, said Konow. That means "you [might need] more than a 100 single cores in one high-end car," he said. "You cannot keep up this trend." With so many single-core chips stuffed into one vehicle, onboard computer systems are becoming too large and complicated, he said. The goal now is to save power and space, "which is critical because there is basically no space left," added Konow. "[Researchers] are trying to come up with weird shapes of boxes to squeeze them into the tiny amount of space left." When automakers are able to integrate multi-core chips -- from quad-core to 8-core, 12-core and beyond -- into vehicles, they'll be able to add a lot more functionality, such as updated navigation options, more safety features and social applications. Today, you have to buy a new car if you want the latest automotive apps. In the future, automakers will offer programmable cars, and users will be able to simply download new apps or upgrades if they want state-of-the-art systems, say Intel execs. "It's almost like 'What applications wouldn't you want in your car?'" said Intel CTO Justin Rattner. "Once the car is a programmable platform, you'll see all kinds of innovation." Rattner noted that the smarter cars could work together to make commutes easier. For instance, cars could have sensors, cameras and computer chips programmed to report potholes to road maintenance crews, and to report traffic jams or accidents to other cars in the area. In-car apps also could tell drivers which local parking garage has spaces available, or if any of their friends are driving nearby. "We'll start thinking of our cars more like we think of our laptops and phones -- updateable," said Luebbers. "For me, it's about synthesis," said Martin Curley, director of Intel Labs Europe. "We're thinking about how these can be integrated into a system of systems that helps us achieve a sustainable society." Luebbers said a key challenge for engineers working on smarter cars is to ensure safety and security. It's one thing for an entertainment system to be breached; it's another for hackers to access a rearview monitoring system, for instance. "One of the main challenges is integrating functions of different criticality," he said. "You have to treat the testing and development differently." A higher level of security will be necessary when we start driving connected cars. "Over the last 20 or 30 years, [onboard car computers] weren't built with security in mind. It was not required," said Konow. "[Automakers] were looking to save costs. They did not need to design it to be secure." Widespread connectivity, though, presents the potential for significant problems, he said. "[Automakers] don't want to re-engineer a whole system, but have to find a way to protect systems from external attacks." Luebbers also noted that car makers have traditionally focused on making sure vehicles did not fail by accident. Now they have to focus on making sure they do not fail because of a digital attack. That, he said, forces OEMs to think about security in a new way.</Msg><Username>getsome_nads</Username><Timestamp>1351040626739</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 21:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351041087785-191</Id><Title>ARMH-based Surface tablets utter trash and ARM Holdings is the problem.</Title><Msg>Otherwise, though, Windows RT can’t run any of the four million regular Windows programs.

Police inspector Roberto Lima said by telephone that on Sunday Jose Marcos Araujo identified a body at the city morgue as being that of his brother, Gilberto. Lima said that Jose Marcos took the body to his mother's home where a wake was held. "The confusion started when news started circulating that a car washer had been shot dead," Jose Marcos' wife, Ana Paula, told the UOL Internet news portal. "Police called my husband and told him that his brother had been killed and his body was at the morgue." Lima said the confusion was "understandable." "The two men closely resembled each other and both worked as car washers," Lima said adding that the man whose body was in the morgue was named Genivaldo Santos Gama. He said further information on Gama was not immediately available. A few hours before the Monday burial "a friend of Gilberto's saw him walking down the street and told him that his family was mourning him," he said. "So he went to his mother's home to let everyone know he was very much alive." When Araujo showed up at his wake "some people fainted and others were so scared they ran away. It was a big shock," family friend Maria Menezes told the G1 online news site. Gilberto's mother Marina Santana told reporters "I am overjoyed. What mother wouldn't be after being told that her son is dead and then sees him alive."</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1351041306406</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 21:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351041941010-193</Id><Topic><Title>LOL Dirtbag Liberals sending fake letters to Florida Republicans saying they aren't eligible to vote</Title><Username>conmen_brokemen</Username><Timestamp>1351040212552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 20:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you are equally upset about Republiscum sponsored voter suppression laws.

Intel Now A Buy - Historically Oversold Relative To Trading Range Looking Ahead -- Exiting the Trade A rebound to the $22.25-$22.50 region would place Intel squarely back around its "price equator" (its near-term fair price "hot zone"), and would be considered the sell signal of this Trading Ocean trade pair.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351044995329</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351046210681-197</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH vs INTC</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351032791501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:53:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351046210681</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351046236291-198</Id><Topic><Title>LOL Dirtbag Liberals sending fake letters to Florida Republicans saying they aren't eligible to vote</Title><Username>conmen_brokemen</Username><Timestamp>1351040212552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 20:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EVERYONE should be encouraged to vote and the government should not disenfranchise anyone. There was no letter from "Liberals" it is more likely the complaining Republican sent the letters. There is nothing on the FL Election official page. He who observed it served it. He who detected it ejected it. Whoever rhymed it crimed it. He who said the rhyme did the crime. Whoever spoke last set off the blast. Whoever smelt it dealt it. Whoever denied it supplied it. The next person who speaks is the person who reeks. The smeller's the feller. He who inculpated promulgated. The one who said the verse just made the atmosphere worse. Whoever's poking fun is the smoking gun He who accuses blew the fuses. He who refuted it tooted it. He who pointed the finger pulled the finger. He who articulated it particulated it. He who deduced it produced it. She who sniffed it biffed it. The slanderer made the gland error. He who eulogized it aerosolized it. Whoever makes the joke makes the #$%$ smoke. He who rapped it cracked it. Whoever rebuts it cuts it. Whoever said it let it. Whoever asked blasts his/her #$%$.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351046236291</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351047400292-199</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH vs INTC</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351032791501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:53:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump Bump and Bump.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351047400292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:56:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351050893223-200</Id><Title>What Was Wrong with Mitt Last Night?</Title><Msg>Mitt looked shell shocked. Might be this was on his mind: October surprise: Gloria Allred's after Romney's sealed testimony and gag order Mitt Romney might get hit with an October surprise after all. Now that he’s in a dead heat with Barack Obama it looks like famed celebrity lawyer, Gloria Allred’s trip to Boston is the beginning of that surprise. According to Radaronline on Tuesday, October 23, 2012, Allred is headed to a Boston court Wednesday for an emergency hearing in an attempt to obtain a court order to unseal the sworn testimony of Romney in a prior court case. Along with her goal of getting the Romney’s testimony unsealed, Allred is looking to get the gag order lifted so the parties involved in that case can speak about Romney. Just what they need to say is another mystery today swirling around the Presidential candidates.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1351050893223</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:54:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
