Last December, Intel introduced the Atom S1200, its first Atom based processor for microservers, and now the company is lining up more SoCs for the microserver market. First up are the Atom S12x9 series processors, which are designed for storage. These processors offer 40 lanes of PCIe 2.0 bandwidth. There are 24 Root Port lanes and 16 Non Transparent Bridge lanes for failover support. In addition Intel provides hardware RAID storage acceleration to offload the computationally intensive RAID function into hardware, thus freeing up the SoC to execute other software applications. There is also a special DRAM interface Asynchronous DRAM Self-Refresh (ADR), which can protect critical DRAM data in the event of a power interruption. According to Intel the Atom S12x9 series also supports Native Dual-Casting that allows data to be read from a source and delivered to two memory locations simultaneously, which can increase RAID-5/6 bandwidth by as much as 20 percent on a 16+2 RAID 6 system compared to system bandwidth without the Dual Cast feature. Avoton is the codename for a 22nm Atom processor based on Intel's new Silvermont microarchitecture. Avoton includes a built-in Ethernet interface, but Intel did not say much more about it except that it is expected to deliver a significant performance per Watt improvement. A die shrink from 32nm to 22nm combined with the new microarchitecture should yield at least a two-fold power improvement, Intel indicated. Intel's final Atom announcement was Rangeley, which is also a 22nm processor, but specifically targeted at embedded communications products such as entry level to mid-range routers, switches and security appliances.

Intel has already released the sub-10w Atom Centerton S1200 targeted at the microserver market and later this year will release the 22nm Avoton SoC with integrated Ethernet and improved performance per watt over Centerton processors. Avoton samples are with customers and the first systems are expected to be available in the second half of 2013. Intel is working on silicon photonic interconnects and cable designs that will help with the modular design. These are intended to enable 100Gbps interconnects that have 'such low latency' that components that previously needed to be bound to the same motherboard can be spread out within a rack. One implementation of Intel's rack scale reference architecture is already taking place in China, as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and China Telecom are collaborating with Intel on Project Scorpio, an initiative that will deliver a physical aggregated rack consisting of the fan and power supplies within the rack, with the goal of demonstrating TCO savings. The Intel announcement closely follows HP's release on Monday of its new family of Moonshot microservers targeted at the same hyperscale market.

I would not be surprised to see that somewhere around $22.00 is an option award price for pre-RSU options awarded 10 years ago.

I think it is the latter... =========================================== HILLSBORO, Ore. (KOIN) — Trucks are making hundreds of trips a day up and down a residential Hillsboro street. It’s part of an Intel expansion neighbors hope will mean good things for the economy. After all, Intel is Oregon’s largest private employer. But for now they’re struggling with growing pains. At Intel’s Ronler Acres campus Wednesday construction workers crawl the campus by day and cranes jut into the skyline by night. These are just some of the side effects of expansion, affecting even people who don’t live anywhere near Intel’s campus. Dump trucks roll to and from the Intel campus to a nearby rock quarry. Their most direct driving route takes the heavy vehicles up and down Southwest Tongue Lane, an area not far from the campus where the sound of chirping birds has been replaced by the sound of truck traffic. “You get four or five of [the trucks] together,” said neighbor Jeff Burgess, and his house will “rumble a little.” ..... “I’m kind of tired of this,” he said, “but that’s the way it goes.” ... “I was talking to a driver a couple days ago,” said neighbor Ernie Doyle, “and he was saying there’s hundred[s of] trucks making multiple trips through here everyday — and it wears.” ..... Oregon’s Department of Transportation is expected to start a $45 million expansion of the Brookwood Parkway/Helvetia Road Interchange on Highway 26 north of Intel’s Hillsboro campus. The road work is expected to improve traffic flow between the highway and Intel. The truck traffic around the Intel expansion will continue through the spring and summer. koinlocal6DOTcom/2013/04/10/intel-development/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1365680051579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 07:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365680517599-47</Id><Topic><Title>who thinks Intel goes up tomorrow ???</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365658105176</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 01:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wallace this is not NEWS coming from IDF.

Waiting to see if Intel can pull in shipping dates for both.... ============================ By all accounts, the ZTE Geek should be an unremarkable phone - its unimaginative, plasticky and has decidedly mid-ranged specs. But just like the Lenovo K900, the 2GHz Atom Clovertrail+ SOC in it delivers ARM beating performance. In the standard AntTuTu Benchmark that we ran on the show floor, the ZTE Geek scored an impressive 29401, better than the scores found in the public domain of the HTC One (Qualcomm 600) and Samsung Galaxy S IV (Exynos 5410). Naturally, one should reserve judgement and not entirely formulate opinion based on benchmarks done on the show floor (who knows what shenanigans could be happening behind the scenes). We would love to get our hands on one of these in our labs to do a proper analysis especially on the battery drain characteristics of the Clovertrail+ SoC, which actually matters more than raw performance to most people.

It could have something to do with inventories or it could have to do with people waiting on the really significant new improvements just around the corner. It could have to do with the focus on PCs instead of processors. If only IDC and Gartner were smart enough to report on processor sales instead of the PC stupidity. Even in the medium term it's meaningless. Haswell is still a mere 7 weeks out and Intel 14nm FinFET production is another day closer. ARM's efforts at the top and bottom end have failed.

You are a credit to this board. My view is that netbook sales continue to be eaten by tablets, and that's why the sales numbers are back to ~2009 levels which...is right around when Netbooks began to ramp. "Bay Trail" tablets/convertibles should fill in the spots that netbooks once had, and this could bring unit sales back to 2011 levels.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365686872545</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:27:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365686964754-77</Id><Topic><Title>I Don't Trust IDC or Gartner</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365686641013</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:24:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah they just make this stuff up ! lol</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365686964754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365687369245-78</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just received your first email.</Msg><Username>muledeerkelli</Username><Timestamp>1365687369245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:36:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365687526585-79</Id><Title>Be very careful</Title><Msg>INTC usually has a tendency to move a lot near its earning report.

But just like the Lenovo K900, the 2GHz Atom Clovertrail+ SOC in it delivers ARM beating performance. In the standard AntTuTu Benchmark that we ran on the show floor, the ZTE Geek scored an impressive 29401, better than the scores found in the public domain of the HTC One (Qualcomm 600) and Samsung Galaxy S IV (Exynos 5410). Naturally, one should reserve judgement and not entirely formulate opinion based on benchmarks done on the show floor (who knows what shenanigans could be happening behind the scenes). We would love to get our hands on one of these in our labs to do a proper analysis especially on the battery drain characteristics of the Clovertrail+ SoC, which actually matters more than raw performance to most people vr-zoneDOTcom/articles/zte-geek-atom-z2580-clovertrail--smartphone-is-smoking-fast-spanks-the-top-arm-socs/19619DOThtml</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1365688995556</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:03:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365689019744-97</Id><Title>Face it, Intel needs the Apple deal.</Title><Msg>As soon as the papers are signed, the stock HEADS UP SLOWLY PAST 40.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1365689019744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:03:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365689106090-98</Id><Topic><Title>Nuff's big dream = to buy Intel at 19</Title><Username>larrytate151</Username><Timestamp>1365686445697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:20:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Facts like- 2nd quarter earnings will be horrible.

Otellini became CEO as the market was coming off the dotcom bubble, More stocks than Intel are far from those peaks. Paul had/has to deal with a financial panic unlike anything since the depression. Paul had done all the right things for the Apple iPod/iPad design according to the Jobs biography. Intel revenues and profits are up 60% during his watch. Paul is not a real public guy and not the perfect CEO but IMO, he deserves much more credit than Backbay gives him. Paul played a pretty good hand with cards dealt him.

I think that the BoD gave him so much time to deliver measurable traction in mobile, and that he did not meet their timeline. Not unlike a losing baseball team (like the Red Sox, right Backbay_bstn), ... if the team sucks you don't see all the players getting canned. Instead they go for the manager's head. In any event it's all political and orchestrated by a bunch of suits who have probably forgotten what it is like to really work for a living. I just finished my Intel career where, for over 23 years I worked under the leadership of Andy Grove, the "leadership" of Craig Barrett, and then ultimately under the leadership of Paul Otellini. I think Paul was an excellent leader for the company and all you have to do is look at the company's business performance during his tenure to see this. Forget about correlating the job he did as CEO with the stock's performance, the market and it's agents are manipulative crooks taking great advantage of the fact that the regulatory laws have not yet caught up with technologies that enable them to cheat the average investor all day long. I say thank you Mr Otellini, your leadership was very much appreciated.</Msg><Username>bhy11141</Username><Timestamp>1365704739366</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:25:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365704763993-212</Id><Title>Intel should make Bitcoins</Title><Msg>It is a business plan with better margins than what products are being manufactured.</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1365704763993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365705712710-213</Id><Title>JAPANESE ARE STILL BUYING...VOLUME GOING UP</Title><Msg>SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING LASTHOUR OF TRADING</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1365705712710</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:41:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365705972224-214</Id><Title>Intel bravely clawing its way back up despite slime trying to bring it down</Title><Msg>Booyah!</Msg><Username>larrytate151</Username><Timestamp>1365705972224</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:46:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365706483056-215</Id><Title>Just think of all of those empty predictions through the years</Title><Msg>Y2K will create huge buying and upgrade surge for computers Windows 7 will create huge buying and upgrade surge for computers Affluent Chinese middle class will create huge buying surge for computers After 2002 recession corporations and companies will create huge buying surge for computers After 2008-09 great recession corporations and companies will create huge buying surge for computers New improved sound cards, flat screen monitors and video cards will create huge buying surge for computers How did that all of that turn out for all of you INTC bagholders?</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1365706483056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365706534949-216</Id><Topic><Title>scenario: All this good IDF marketing is to alleviate the stinker quarter and guidance.</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365702084485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why should guidance be strong?

No meaningful sales to smartphones and table vendors.</Msg><Username>wonderng</Username><Timestamp>1365706534949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:55:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365706845115-217</Id><Title>BUYTIME FOR 30</Title><Msg>opportunity</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1365706845115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365706879932-218</Id><Topic><Title>scenario: All this good IDF marketing is to alleviate the stinker quarter and guidance.</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1365702084485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moron.

Kelleher is concerned not only about unit declines in PCs, but also about the shift in relative standing of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and China’s Lenovo (0992HK), with both reports showing the two neck and neck in PC sales worldwide: Market share shifts could also impact Intel’s margins. H-P reportedly lost share to Lenovo, which has heavy consumer exposure in developing markets. H-P, while also selling consumer machines, has a strong enterprise IT presence in PCs. Relative weakening in H-P’s position, and slack enterprise demand overall (attributed to the disliked Windows 8 operating system) does not bode well for Intel’s overall margins. Also in the enterprise market, virtualization and cloud are optimizing data management and tempering device demand even as data growth continues. Kelleher also notes the imminent retirement of Intel CEO Paul Otellini, and the uncertain succession plan as a risk to shares: Intel also faces a looming leadership change. The company has not yet found a successor to CEO Paul Otellini, perceived as having failed to transition Intel more smoothly into tablets and smart devices. We believe Intel remains by far the best play not only in microprocessors but in the PC space in general. However, we would like to see a re-set in INTC’s share price to the upper teens before becoming constructive on the stock once more.

Shorts got everything they ever hoped for in the IDC report and then only got a measly 43 cents out of it. It didn't even cover yesterday's gain much less the two day gain much less anything else. It seems clear that there is now recognition that ARM's RT effort is dead, that ARM's server effort is so far out and so limited that it will not bear fruit, and that Intel is going to roll the improvements out in waves that ARM can't match. Here's the football analogy: Intel is on ARM's 3 inch line, getting ready to score for a third time in a row. Intel hikes the ball and it suddenly flies up into the air and directly into the hands of one of the ARM fanbois who runs 60 yards up the field. At Intel's 40 yard line he decides in his supreme joy to do a forward flip. He only gets half way around and lands badly, fracturing his spine and three ribs. And drops the ball. Intel recovers. First and ten.

The demo of the 100Gb/sec module was presented via a video during Intel CTO Justin Rattner's keynote presentation at the Beijing Intel Developer Forum on Thursday. The chip incorporates modulators, detectors, waveguides, and circuitry – and that aforementioned laser – all in garden-variety silicon rather than pricey hand-built, gallium arsenide–based photonics modules such as are currently available. Since integrated silicon photonics modules could be fabbed using existing equipment and tested using a hybrid of conventional and Intel-developed techniques, such speedy modules could be created much more cheaply, and therefore eventually work their way into far more devices and systems.

The current optics are so expensive that – I don't even know how to put it – they basically inhibit the market." With the advent of silicon photonics modules such as those Intel demonstrated on Thursday, however, "One hundred–gigabit becomes a very viable technology for the networking industry," Bechtolsheim said, "and it will take off as soon as this is shipping." In addition, the current 100Gb/sec throughput is nowhere near the top end of silicon photonics capabilities, Rattner said at the Open Compute Conference. "We're not even close to the single lambda speeds, the single color speeds, that we've described in the literature," he said. "We can make those photons go faster, we can put more stuff on the fiber, we can add fiber – so we're scalable in three or four dimensions." Exactly how scalable? Well, Intel has said that it's aiming at eventual terabit-per-second throughput.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365723825508</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:43:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365723982677-259</Id><Topic><Title>Intel demos inexpensive 100Gb/sec silicon photonics chip-cont'd</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365723825508</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:43:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"One hundred–gigabit becomes a very viable technology for the networking industry," Bechtolsheim said, "and it will take off as soon as this is shipping."

But just like the Lenovo K900, the 2GHz Atom Clovertrail+ SOC in it delivers ARM beating performance. In the standard AntTuTu Benchmark that we ran on the show floor, the ZTE Geek scored an impressive 29401, better than the scores found in the public domain of the HTC One (Qualcomm 600) and Samsung Galaxy S IV (Exynos 5410). Naturally, one should reserve judgement and not entirely formulate opinion based on benchmarks done on the show floor (who knows what shenanigans could be happening behind the scenes). We would love to get our hands on one of these in our labs to do a proper analysis especially on the battery drain characteristics of the Clovertrail+ SoC, which actually matters more than raw performance to most people vr-zoneDOTcom/articles/zte-geek-atom-z2580-clovertrail--smartphone-is-smoking-fast-spanks-the-top-arm-socs/19619DOThtml</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1365727069394</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:37:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365730494884-271</Id><Topic><Title>REMEMBER APPLE/INTEL DEAL IN MAY AFTER MICRON PURCHASE OF ELPIDA IS COMPLETED</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1365725511465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung reportedly increasing purchases of memory products from outside Josephine Lien, Taipei; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES [Thursday 11 April 2013] Samsung Electronics reportedly has expanded the purchase of memory products from outside, including the purchase of mobile DRAM chips from Elpida Memory as well as NAND flash and eMMC devices from Toshiba. Samsung's own supply of memory products is already falling short of demand, including that for its Galaxy-series smartphones and tablets, industry sources have claimed. Any shortage of DRAM and NAND flash chips at Samsung will affect the global memory supply/demand balance, given that the vendor's in-house production capacity accounts for the biggest portion of the world total, the sources said. Nonetheless, Samsung has switched to a more flexible approach to its component procurement - an effort to manage risk, the sources observed. Some industry observers, however, have questioned the motive of Samsung's reported move to buy more memory products from outside suppliers. They noted that Samsung reportedly is buying more chips from Japanese firms while continuing to use its in-house produced chips for its Galaxy-series mobile devices. This is reportedly happening when Samsung has actually implemented a strategy to tightly control its chip output, the observers pointed out. Taking eMMC devices as an example, the market has been in a tight situation since 2013 due to brisk demand coming from the smartphone and tablet sectors, the observers said. Samsung has a significant portion of the available production capacity worldwide. Samsung has long been the world's largest producer of DRAM and NAND flash memory, and in recent years expanded at a fast pace its presence in the mobile device field. In the smartphone market, Samsung pulled ahead of Apple in 2012.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1365730494884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 21:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365731197776-272</Id><Topic><Title>new lows in a bull market...gotta stink</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1365702779031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:52:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've gotten the Dividend for 10 straight quarters and am in under 20.

"I think you give Intel &amp; Paul way too much credit" Maybe. I think that many people are giving him too little credit. You are welcome to your opinion as I am welcome to my opinion. "How do you explain the entire miss of the cell phone market?" The original design was for a $399 MP3 player design. How successful was an MP3 player going to be? I guess you thought that a $399 MP3 player was a successful blockbuster product when there was other products on the market at a fraction of the price. "Do you blame Craig more?" What did Intel look like in 1999 through 2001 when Apple was designing the iPod? In 1998 he was placed in charge of the Intel Architecture Group, taking on overall responsibility for Intel's $21 billion microprocessor business, which accounted for 80 percent of Intel's total business. Paul was responsible for the high margin CPU and he did make that very successful. He is responsible for the Server business. "You can't convince me that someone at Intel was asleep at the helm" You probably can't convince me that in 2001, that it was in Intel's best interest to divert high margin wafers to support a $5.3b company's "5,000 songs in your pocket" product. I am not trying to convince anyone anything. The answer is rarely black or white with some blame and some success for all parties.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365735566383</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 22:59:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365737384860-282</Id><Topic><Title>INTC getting crushed in pre-markets</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1365676516107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 06:35:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You probably can't convince me that in 2001, that it was in Intel's best interest to divert high margin wafers to support a $5.3b company's "5,000 songs in your pocket" product.

I think you nailed it - but there are a lot of Monday AM quarterbacks out there that might not even comprehend the concept of opportunity cost:: The difference in return between a chosen investment and one that is necessarily passed up. Say you invest in a stock and it returns a paltry 2% over the year. In placing your money in the stock, you gave up the opportunity of another investment - say, a risk-free government bond yielding 6%. In this situation, your opportunity costs are 4% (6% - 2%).</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1365737384860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 23:29:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
