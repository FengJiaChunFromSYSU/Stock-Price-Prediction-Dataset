JPMorgan through its analyst Christopher Danely, has expressed excessively negative opinions regarding Intel’s operations and results. This has occurred not just for a period of weeks or months but literally for a period of years. Mr. Danely appears not only to understand little about fabrication, manufacturing and the chip sector – he appears to have little or no learning curve. He not only has been wrong about Intel, he has been consistently wrong. A typical headline where Mr. Danely has talked to the press would be something like " Intel: J.P. Morgan Downgrades; Sees Margins Peaking." This from an actual headline. This horrid record in regard to judging and predicting Intel’s performance leads one to question the internal machinations within JPMorgan. Are there no corrective actions within JPMorgan for an analyst with excessively bad judgment that continues for years? For if there are then there has to be another reason for JPMorgan’s constantly bearish opinions and reports to the press. There are only a couple of possibilities. My great fear is that JPMorgan’s opinions on Intel have nothing to do with Intel’s fundamentals or results – that JPMorgan’s opinions on Intel are related to some trading strategy. A phrase for this type of behavior would be "greed at the expense of ethics." Or perhaps trading against your own customers. Of course I have no way to know exactly why JPMorgan consistently bashes one of America’s great companies, one of America’s great success stories and a company that manufactures here at home. At a very difficult economic time it would seem that JPMorgan would attempt to assist in an economic recovery. It appears to me that JPMorgan is engaging in activities that are as a minimum ethically distasteful and that additionally work against US economic recovery. A review of Intel’s PE ratio clearly demonstrates that the company has been valued far below that of an average S&amp;P 500 while producing substantially better results. It appears to me that JPMorgan has had a significant role in this valuation with its constant negative views, downgrades and press releases. It also appears to me that JPMorgan’s efforts in regards to Intel are being mirrored by a number of other key Wall Street firms. I don’t know why anyone with access to information would attempt to present such a biased viewpoint for this extended period of time. I therefore request that you conduct a full investigation of JPMorgan’s trading, analyzing and reporting activities in regards to Intel. And that you report back to Intel shareholders exactly why JPMorgan has supported market views of Intel that are not substantiated by facts or actual performance. Until such time as you do, I will ask others to make this same request of you. And I will encourage everyone I know to stop doing business with JPMorgan until said report is issued. Intel shareholders and investors have had enough of this behavior. We want explanations. Sincerely, On behalf of Intel Investors and Shareholders cc.

PT cut to 400p. Deutsche analyst said, "Despite secular EPS growth drivers, we believe ARM's high valuation will come under pressure as falling smartphone chip prices impact royalty growth, Intel's (Nasdaq: INTC) odds to gradually gain market share in mobile are improving and the Windows-on-ARM ramp could be below expectations. With EPS growth slowing and longer-term estimate uncertainty increasing, we believe ARM can de-rate to a still rich 20x 2014 P/E, closer to its expected 2012-16 EPS CAGR of 13%."

The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, attractive valuation levels and expanding profit margins. Highlights from the ratings report include: Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 13.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.6%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displaying stagnant earnings per share. INTC's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.15 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. To add to this, INTC has a quick ratio of 1.65, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. When compared to other companies in the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment industry and the overall market, INTEL CORP's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&amp;P 500. INTEL CORP reported flat earnings per share in the most recent quarter. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, INTEL CORP increased its bottom line by earning $2.39 versus $2.05 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346765642408</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:34:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346765766229-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Stock Buy Recommendation Reiterated</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346765642408</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:34:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course you'll never see this from the big firms on Wall Street.

Supply-chain commentary suggests continued weakness in PC sales; aggregate Taiwan original design manufacturers (ODM) unit production will likely end up flattish in 2012 as slight growth in notebooks is outweighed by declines in desktop. For Intel, we model only 2.5% PC client group growth in both 2012 and 2013 -- a meaningful Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 8 build, share gain from AMD, and sales to underreported regions such as Brazil should offset some of the broader weakness, though we are not counting on Ultrabooks to push PC sales higher, as higher costs (solid-state drives (SSDs), advanced battery and cases) raise prices, and similar features can increasingly be found in cheaper devices with hybrid drives. The key driver of our disconnect from consensus on Intel remains data-center growth -- we model 15% growth in 2012/2013 versus consensus 8%-10%. It also seems that Intel is finally gaining traction in mobility, with apps processors in a number of new phone designs. Mobility is unlikely to move the needle in 2012, but should provide some growth in 2013.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346784000980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:40:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346784492962-55</Id><Topic><Title>multiple options prices?</Title><Username>kholdings209</Username><Timestamp>1346783813691</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:36:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you are seeing the WEEKLY expiration options that expire in 3 days on 9/07 (120907C00026000) and the MONTHLY that expire on 9/22 (120922C0002600 notice the date encoded in the SYM). 26.00 INTC120907C00026000 0.01 0.00 N/A 0.01 446 333 26.00 INTC120922C00026000 0.08 0.06 0.07 0.08 3,157 34,750</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346784492962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346784874044-56</Id><Topic><Title>Lower Celeron prices = weakness - NOT st</Title><Username>car90212</Username><Timestamp>914467998000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 1998-12-23 21:53:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You were way ahead of the curve with your prediction there.</Msg><Username>harlan_titusville</Username><Timestamp>1346784874044</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:54:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346785257209-57</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH down 9% on Intel threat</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1346778987803</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:16:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its pretty clear that WOA will be a disaster.

The SOCs being discussed are those from Qualcomm and Intel, which is raising some questions about what will launch where. As a technology industry analyst, I have deep relationships throughout the mobile industry. After talking with my sources, what is clear is that Motorola’s commitment to Intel remains high, and the only reason we don’t see an Intel-Motorola design in the US is because Intel won’t start shipping LTE until the end of 2012.

The system will see laptops and smartphones sharing power with an integrated transmitter and receiver chipset from semiconductor designers Integrated Device Technology (IDT). Intel says it'll begin building the tech into ultrabooks, smartphones, and standalone chargers by the middle of next year, which should mean a full commercial rollout in 2014. "Charging times are similar to what you’d see with a normal USB cable charging setup," Dan Snyder, PR manager at Intel told El Reg. Intel's keeping fairly quiet about the details of the system, no doubt saving the juicy stuff for the forthcoming Intel Developer Forum (IDF) next month. There's no data on cost per unit and, crucially, on power wastage. Wireless power isn’t particularly efficient at the best of times, and charging your phone at the expense of the laptop could be a waste of time. Wireless power has been around for over 100 years but it seems we might at last be getting a large-scale rollout of a system. The 19th century scientist (and soon-to-be museum piece) Nikola Tesla first demonstrated that power could be transmitted wirelessly, but the technology laid largely fallow, although it has been vital to the RFID industry for many years. When Intel powered a light bulb wirelessly at IDF 2008, it was slightly depressing to see how little things have moved on more mainstream applications. A year later, Palm demoed its Touchstone wireless charging system, and companies like Nokia, TI, Samsung, and Sony formed the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) to push a common standard for transmission based on induction. Research@Intel: Wireless Resonant Energy Link demo Intel's come some way since this 2009 prototype, but ended up buying in from IDT Samsung has since added wireless power from the WPC specs, dubbed Qi, to its S3 smartphone and the consortium has over 60 products that also use the system. But it still isn't what you'd call mainstream. Intel isn't a part of the WPC and won’t comment on whether the IDT technology will be available to other chip makers, such as ARM or Samsung, who have a much stronger position in the smartphone market. If Chipzilla is keeping the system to itself, then it looks likely that this will be another niche wireless power system, since market demand for Intel-based smartphones has been tepid at best and Qi has a good lead. "We welcome the advancements in resonance technology and will support its continued success by delivering the most integrated and full-featured ICs in the world," said Arman Naghavi, general manager of the analog and power division at IDT in a canned statement. "IDT is excited to collaborate with Intel and looks forward to playing a key role in the proliferation of wireless power technology." ®</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1346795358270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 17:49:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346795588920-83</Id><Topic><Title>Check this out</Title><Username>luettaeeb193</Username><Timestamp>1346794351309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 17:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool picks.

Most economists think the relevant number is the external debt of $9 Trillion which is composed of China +Britain+ Germany +Other countires in equal proportions, plus a bunch of investment firms, widows, orphans, universities, etc etc etc. But, hey, these are only facts, and what are facts to a b^^u^^t^^t eating guy like you?</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1346806556609</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 20:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346807406695-103</Id><Title>Intel Corp. expects to slash the energy consumption of its flagship chip line by 41%.</Title><Msg>that's huge</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1346807406695</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 21:10:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346807893764-104</Id><Topic><Title>markets will head down until bush talks</Title><Username>indexit</Username><Timestamp>1223056626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2008-10-03 13:57:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Damnit, can we use foul language now?
