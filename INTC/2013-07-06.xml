It looks like Schwab had a layoff in the recent past since there are several who are MF "contributors". I personally dealt with a number of these Schwab trading specialists on the phone. Some, I called and others called me. None could answer my questions. I had to teach them about the problem so they could try to ask someone who might know. I was not impressed. SPAMMING for MF is one way for someone with a BA in Economics to keep food on the table. Niu's BA Economics is probably better than MF Steve Heller's BA Film. You would not know it by comparing the two. Niu and Heller are both pretty good at distorting the facts to reflect the message they want to send. I just wish that MF added the author name to their publications so I could figure out which were worth the click. MF used to source some quality articles. About a year ago they changed their methods to use the articles (like SA) to channel readers into the spam at the tail of the articles.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373084890556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 00:28:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373085324709-3</Id><Title>iWatch, Google glasses will be flops</Title><Msg>Unexpected success of smartphones and tablets have made analysts and media into a habit of making stupid assumption that anything brought by Apple or Google will be market hit, will be the next big thing. However, I think iWatch and Google glasses will be flops. These are awkward ways of doing the things which a smartphone or a tablet can do more conveniently. Anyway, I think iWatch is just a eye-wash by Apple, and the real thing under the cover may be porting of iOS to x86 for future iPhones/iPads. Sure, Apple may have signed a deal with TSMC. But should TSMC fail to deliver, Apple would want to be Intel-ready. This may turn out to be good for Intel as Intel will not be just a foundary but will get to provide complete chips to Apple for iOS devices. To be fair enough, I don't think Intel's hybrids and convertibles will ever gain market traction either. These will remain very low volume devices and may even die soon. It is fascinating to see all different kinds of mechanism in a museum (stores). But very few enthusiasts would like to have them at homes or work places. Most convertibles in a tablet form are bulky tablets and defeat the whole purpose of having a tablet. Intel should focus on pure lightweight tablets with detachable keyboards as accessories.</Msg><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1373085324709</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 00:35:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373087714587-4</Id><Topic><Title>Some Analysts will bad mouth the pig next week.

First Silvermont-Based Atom “Bay Trail-T” SoCs Due Early This Fall [07/04/2013 11:35 PM] by Anton Shilov It looks like the first tablets based on Intel Corp.’s next-generation Atom system-on-chips based on Silvermont micro-architecture may arrive a little earlier than expected. According to a document from Intel, the new Atom Z-series chips that belong to “Bay Trail-T” platform will be formally introduced in late August or early September. Intel will officially launch Atom processor Z-series for Bay Trail-T platforms designed for tablets between August 28, 2013, and September 13, 2013, according to an excerpt from an Intel document published by Chinese version of VR-Zone web-site. It is unclear when the chip giant plans to introduce other members of the Bay Trail family, which includes solutions for notebooks, desktops and industrial applications. Intel will offer three versions of Bay Trail platforms based on different versions of ValleyView system-on-chips: Bay Trail-T (3W), Bay Trail-M (4W – 6.5W) and Bay Trail-D (12W) for tablets, notebooks, and desktops, respectively. Actual SoCs will come in different form-factors, with different levels of performance and even with some feature-set differences. In addition, there will be server and industrial solutions based on Valleyview. For the first time in history, highly-integrated Atom system-on-chip will utilize Intel’s own graphics processing technology (current SoCs use PowerVR technology). Thanks to Intel HD Graphics 4000-series graphics core, ValleyView will provide three times higher performance than today’s Atoms for netbooks and nettops.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373137860940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 15:11:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373137919185-15</Id><Topic><Title>Baytrail to be here well before the Holidays</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373137860940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 15:11:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silvermont: Next-Generation Microarchitecture Silvermont will serve as the foundation for a breadth of 22nm products expected in market later this year. The performance-per-watt improvements with the new microarchitecture will enable a significant difference in performance and responsiveness for the compute devices built around these products. Intel's Silvermont microarchitecture was designed and co-optimized with Intel's 22nm SoC process with tri-gate transistors. By taking advantage of this industry-leading technology, Intel is able to provide a significant performance increase and improved energy efficiency. Highlights of the Silvermont microarchitecture include: A new out-of-order execution engine enables best-in-class, single-threaded performance. A new multi-core and system fabric architecture scalable up to eight cores and enabling greater performance for higher bandwidth, lower latency and more efficient out-of-order support for a more balanced and responsive system. New IA instructions and technologies bringing enhanced performance, virtualization and security management capabilities to support a wide range of products. These instructions build on Intel's existing support for 64-bit and the breadth of the IA software installed base. Enhanced power management capabilities including a new intelligent burst technology, low- power C states and a wider dynamic range of operation taking advantage of Intel's 3D transistors. Intel Burst technology 2.0 support for single- and multi-core offers great responsiveness scaled for power efficiency.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1373137919185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 15:11:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373143587674-16</Id><Title>Recent Benchmarking test is terrible news for Intel rivals</Title><Msg>Extremetech recently reported results from an Antutu benchmark test that shows a "Baytrail" 1.1 GHz SoC outperform the best 2.1 GHz Qualcomm chip by more than 40%. The results are alarming for its rivals, given that Baytrail was running at half the clock speed of the QCOM chip. What this means is that an equivalent Baytrail chip could possibly outperform the best ARM designed QCOM chip by 3:1 later this year. The results are even more dramatic when compared to the test results of Samsung and Nvidia processors. This is not a surprise given that Qualcomm makes the best mobile SoCs. This is a huge lead and could see Intel capture a huge share of the table SoC market. I am sure that mobile SoC makers using ARM (ARMH) designs will also advance their technology and processing in the next 6 months. But overcoming a 200% lead seems improbable in my view. There is little reason to doubt this report and it seems logical in the light of the earlier Intel claims about Silvermont and Intel's process advantage.
