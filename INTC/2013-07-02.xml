We all know Wall Street is corrupt. These guys will publicly bash Intel but secretly, they work for the large institutions who will do the opposite of small retail investors. The recent selling in ARMH means indicates the money is moving from ARMH to INTC. They are still in buying mode (hence the bashing), but look for major move up in INTC as these same #$%$ s change their tunes.</Msg><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1372737772479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 00:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372740535935-2</Id><Topic><Title>Gus and Covello et al</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1372737772479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 00:02:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shouldn't their stock purchasing and bash-timing be public record?

In an effort to correct this disconnect, Intel last week held an event for its Israeli worker ants to experience the glamour and glitz of the major product rollouts the company puts on at big tech events, like CES in Las Vegas and Computex in Taiwan. The bottom line for Intel, and for consumers, is that the company is on the crux of a major revolution and shift in the device business. If the cool device for 2012 was the iPad, the new devices that are to be marketed by companies like Sony, Lenovo, Asus, Samsung, and other laptop and tablet makers will redefine the meaning of “cool,” according to Hochberg. A big part of the revolution, said Hochberg, will be choice. “We have over 50 designs of Ultrabooks coming onto the market,” said Hochberg. “You can have a device that works as an ultra-light laptop, that separates into a tablet and automatically works on Android, and switches to Windows 8 when it is ‘reunited’ with its keyboard component.” Not only that, said Hochberg, but “you can also have any design you want — a device where the screen twists, flips, or slides in and out. We engineered the entire design from top to bottom to ensure a maximum of flexibility and consumer choice, to the extent that we even redesigned the hinges on these two-in-one devices to ensure they lasted a long time. With the two-in-one Ultrabook line, you no longer have to choose between a laptop and a tablet.” It’s easier to watch videos on a tablet than on a laptop, but harder to do a spreadsheet on one, he said. In between there was a black hole, but we have succeeded in filling it. In fact, said Hochberg, a huge breakthrough...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372745115046</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 02:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372751447154-4</Id><Title>this is the quiet period.</Title><Msg>When INTC cannot comment.

INTC will maintain the high end MacBook Air and Pros. Apple reduces dependence on Samsung and spreads risk between TSMC and INTC. INTC, as we know, will have no problem with capacity. Even if TSMC has issues, and we know they do, with 20nm, it really won't matter for the iPad or MacBook Ether as they are low power devices. If Apple decides to put the full OS onto an iPad, I'm sure it will be an INTC chip. If Apple decides to make cheap iPhones, I'm sure it will stay an ARM chip. Having the high end covered and low end on contract gives Apple the ability to expand in either direction. It's a smart move by Apple. When the rubber hits the road and INTC's Bay Trail, et al, gets some traction, it will be an easy switch to INTC--and by easy I mean there are engineers already working on the solution. Again, just my humble opinion.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372751471245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 03:51:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372751683429-6</Id><Topic><Title>IMHO: Apple will split CPU manufacturing between TSMC (low end) and INTC (high end)</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372751471245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 03:51:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, though INTC could cover it all.

The trade organization said global chip sales reached $24.7 billion, up 4.6 percent from the previous month, and a 1.3 percent increase over March of 2012. The increase amounts to the biggest month-to-month sales increase since March of 2010. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew the most, nearly six percent while the Americas grew 5.6 percent. Japan and Europe also grew slightly, marking the first time in a year that all four regions have seen month-to-month growth since mid-2012. It’s a big improvement versus April when sales fell nearly two percent from the year-ago period. In a statement SIA president Brian Toohey called the results “unambiguously strong.” Shorts? Longs?

NUC is The Next Unit of Computing. It is a 4.5" x 4.4" x 1.5" box. The box effectively replaces desktop computers. The NUC has an x86 motherboard, Wireless LAN, a Solid State Drive, and DRAM memory and some other subsystems. The curious thing about this is the way I learned about it. My son-in-law called me one day and mentioned they were re-doing all their IT equipment, but not with notebooks and not, heaven forbid, with desktops or towers. They were using NUCs. I asked him what a NUC was. When he was through, he had described a desktop computer that would fit in your hand. They cable tied them to the back of their monitors. I didn't think much about it until my wife came home from a city council meeting last night. She is the mayor of our little town. Turns out that the city council had just approved $151,000 worth of new IT. The seven-year-old notebooks were to be retired, and not replaced. They were using NUCs! The present system had become unstable and was down much of the time as a result of all the different hardware and software used in different ways throughout the city. Now, with a NUC-based system, the staff could suck their work down from the cloud, do work, take notes, etc. When at work, they are able to access the cloud again and have everything they had been working on at home. Nothing surprisingly new, but the city's system is expected to become more stable and usable. The reason that I am so impressed by our city selecting NUCs is that I personally know how much effort they expend researching this kind of thing. One occurrence is a curiosity, but two occurrences of using NUCs starts to smack of a trend. Intel has some videos on the website here and here. The system is available on Amazon (AMZN), so they must be serious about it. Short mixed review of NUC here. i7 NUC coming.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372777672677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:07:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372777691076-32</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: The Next Unit Of Computing - NUC</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372777672677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:07:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, this thing has the CPU, the SSD, the DRAM, the WiFi, the comm channels, including Thunderbolt. It occurred to me that this is what I have been muttering about in some other recent articles, just in a little bigger format. It takes a little time for it to sink in that this is not a Dell or HP product, this is an Intel product. The SSD and DRAM and all the bits are sold by and bought from Intel directly. It also dawned on me that the industrial/business upgrade cycle of PCs is happening; they just look a little different this time. To the extent that NUC is successful, Intel will directly supply multiple times the dollar value of compute products it is currently supplying indirectly though the PC makers. Unlike the speculation in previous articles, Intel would not likely manufacturer the DRAM and NAND components used in the NUC except through its Joint Venture with Micron (MU), but the entire processor board comes from Intel and at least some of the other subsystems (think SSD) will be bundled with the NUC system. If Intel NUCs are accepted by the market in a big way, how are the third party market analysts, who revel in the continuing prediction of the demise of the PC, going to count all the PCs sold? They haven't done a very good job of that the past few quarters anyway, so if NUC makes up 15-20% of PCs sold, they will continue to underestimate the PC market. The NUC was intended for signage automation, kiosk management and other more industrial applications, however, as PC World says, "it makes a good little home PC." The article also mentions that Intel is quick to point out that the company is not in the business of selling complete systems -- nor does it intend to enter that business with the NUC. Of course, that is exactly what it has done, probably out of frustration with the creative lethargy at its two largest customers, HP (HPQ) and Dell (DELL). Just another small reason to own Intel.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372777691076</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372778007963-33</Id><Title>Don't you just love CNBC PUMP so Wall Street can dump, Now down over $2, CNBC have the best con men on TV , Must really going to drop on</Title><Msg>Don't you just love CNBC PUMP so Wall Street can dump, Now down over $2, CNBC have the best con men on TV , Must really going to drop on earnings did you see what Wall Street did to BBRY WOW</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372778007963</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:13:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372778106618-34</Id><Topic><Title>Don't you just love CNBC PUMP so Wall Street can dump, Now down over $2, CNBC have the best con men on TV , Must really going to drop on</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372778007963</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:13:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PUMP IT Wallis PUMP it, Wall Street needs to dump it</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372778106618</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372778480269-35</Id><Title>WOW INTC could drop just like BBRY on earnings Everyone thinks INTC will beat the way lowered earnings by 10 Cents WOW if they don't</Title><Msg>INTC could drop just like BBRY on earnings Everyone thinks INTC will beat the way lowered earnings by 10 Cents WOW if they don't</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372778480269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:21:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372778522188-36</Id><Topic><Title>All Things Digital reports: Chip Sales Grew In May At Fastest Rate in Three Years</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372768077429</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:27:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Intel still cant move up!

The government has set up a negotiating team that includes Economy Minister Naftali Bennett. “Contrary to Intel’s previous investment, we are trying this time to create a long-term process in which each side will commit for at least 10 years,” Itzkovich said. He did not say how much of a grant or subsidy the government was considering providing Intel for the new investment. A spokesman for Intel declined to comment on the report and officials at the ministry were not immediately available for comment. Intel’s last overseas investment was made in Ireland and if it does not build a factory in Israel this time the country could find itself no longer relevant to Intel, Itzkovich said. “We are talking about a manufacturing facility that has incredible impact on the Israeli economy,” he said. “That said, it is incumbent upon us to examine the worthwhileness and to explain to the public what the benefits are and what the considerations are if we approve the investment.” Intel will build chips over the next two to three years with features measuring just 14 nm in Ireland and the United States but the company is already thinking about where it will produce 10 nm chips. Intel Israel executives said in February they would like to see 10 nm production in Israel.

They all have their own views on the stock. That's what markets are about. You cannot manipulate a stock ; the buying or selling pressure is what really makes the stock move. Remember the upgrades of Apple to 1000 target when it was at 700. The analysts simply could not "manipulate" it higher; too many investors already owned too much of it. There could be funds that are frusterated that Intc has been a laggard and decide they will keep reducing while others think it is a bargain and keep adding. Then you have the share buybacks too; also the high level of short interest which to me is very bullish. If you want to call company buybacks or short sellers as manipulators, go ahead. They are just a key part of the supply demand balance. Supply versus demand. The more those unloading are out the way, the better it will be. Intc earnings reports will trump all analyst opinions.

Subsequently, Apple‘s keynote presentation at WWDC saw the new, Haswell-toting Macbook Airs brought out, promising a 70% increase in battery life and the achievement of all-day functionality away from power outlets – the Holy Grail of the road warrior. The consumer tests on Haswell are coming in now, but some sectors have been working with and testing Haswell-driven devices for a considerable period – and in some cases for extraordinary purposes. Ben Saunders, the British polar explorer, is intended to assault the South Pole this autumn, retracing the steps of Captain Scott’s unsuccessful Terra Nova expedition. In the run-up, he received early access to a Haswell-powered ultrabook – Sony VAIO® Pro Ultrabook – with which to connect during the journey through one of the world’s truly remote places.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372789963803-102</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: Haswell At The Bottom Of The World: Intel's Polar Adventure</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part II I contacted Saunders after the announcement of the Scott Expedition. My first question was, why Scott? Terra Nova remains one of the most famous tragedies in the history of polar exploration – why relive it? My motivation stems in part from a fascination with the fact that this journey remains unfinished. There hasn’t even been an attempt on it in the 101 years since Scott’s death. In ways the Terra Nova expedition was a tragic, poignant tale, but I think its achievements are often overlooked. Scott, Wilson and Bowers died after covering nearly 1,600 miles on foot, which is a record that stands to this day. Given what we’ve learnt in the century since, about everything from solar panels to scurvy, it’s amazed me (and it’s testament to their determination and endurance) that the bar they set has never been raised. Polar exploration has become a simpler process in the intervening century, of course – just as Everest, fifty years ago one of the deadliest challenges for the intrepid mountaineer, has become a challening but achievable part of a backpacker’s itinerary, not least through improvements in portable oxygen technology. One of Scott’s innovations was the use of “motor sleds” – which sadly experienced disabling malfunctions and, unlike his rival Amundsen’s dogs and ponies, could not be eaten when they broke down. How would Saunders’ journey differ?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789963803</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:32:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372790008803-103</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: Haswell At The Bottom Of The World: Intel's Polar Adventure</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part III In many ways the two trips are almost incomparable, yet in others they’re identical. We’re following Scott’s exact route to and from the Pole, via the Ross Ice Shelf and the Beardmore Glacier and we’ll be entirely unsupported for the entire expedition, which means we’re travelling on foot, wearing harnesses and dragging our supplies and gear for the entire journey, with no external assistance (and no motors at all!) Scott wouldn’t have had the communications we’ll have. We’ll be using the latest technology to communicate with the world beyond Antarctica whilst we’re away in a way that hasn’t been done before, blogging daily and sending video back regularly that will be posted on our own YouTube channel. And the custom-made clothing we’ll wear would also have been almost unrecognisable to Scott and his men (ultralight synthetic micro fibre shells, closed-cell foam insulated ski boots, hollow-fibre insulation, polarised goggle lenses…). Our sleds or pulks are made by hand from carbon fibre and kevlar by a Norwegian composites specialist. We won’t have the pre-positioned depots and a siege-style approach that Scott had though; Scott’s men hauled roughly 200lb each, or 91kg. In contrast, Tarka [L'Herpiniere, Saunders' partner] and I start with loads of nearly 440lb each, or 200kg.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372790008803</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:33:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372790044393-104</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: Haswell At The Bottom Of The World: Intel's Polar Adventure</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part IV Cold boot Temperature affects high technology in unusual ways – in particular, in extremly low temperatures, batteries discharge quickly, and the temperature changes of hot processors against cold air can have unwelcome consequences. How does cosumer-grade technology function in a polar climate? The Ultrabooks have stood up extraordinarily well to Intel’s testing. Initially they made sure sure they were reheated to room temperature before booting them, but towards the end of the ten-week testing cycle they’d occasionally start them up from deep-frozen, and they all worked (and have kept on working). The Ultrabooks we’ll take are completely unmodified. The battery life is remarkably good, and we’ll recharge all of our tech gear using a 62-watt solar panel and a couple of lithium polymer battery packs. The only thing we’ve changed are the cables – power, USB, that kind of thing – which have all been replaced by low-temperature silicone cabling (apparently good down to -190 degrees C…) Connectivity will be provided by an Intel NUC [Next Unit of Computing - a low-power, small form factor computer driven intended for media centre and other light use], connected to an Iridium satellite phone, broadcasting a wireless signnal to alow the VAIOs to connect from inside the relative warmth of tents and sleeping bags. The NUC itself will be powered by a dedicated photovoltaic panel powering a lithium-poymer battery.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372790044393</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:34:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372790100472-105</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: Haswell At The Bottom Of The World: Intel's Polar Adventure</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part V We’re travelling through the Antarctic spring and summer so will have 24-hour daylight. We tested a new type of 62-watt folding photovoltaic panel in Greenland this spring and it was extraordinarily effective, happily powering two Ultrabooks, two Iridium sat phone handsets, a Nikon D800 and a handful of other gizmos including MP3 players and some e-book readers we were testing. The panel charges a couple of 400-gram 51Wh lithium polymer battery packs made by a Chinese company called Ape (“light weight, fashion appearance!”) and they’re streets ahead of anything else we’ve tested. The tech gear, in turn, is all recharged from the battery packs. We have two Iridium satellite phones and a Solara tracker that’s always-on and automatically sends our coordinates back to our UK base team on an hourly basis via the same Iridium network, so they’re the devices we’re absolutely reliant on, along with our handheld GPS units. During the journey, Saunders and L’Herpiniere will be tweeting and blogging their progress, in a first for Antarctic explorers (this is now no escape, it seems), but also gathering scientific information: We’ll also be using (the computers) to store meteorological data that we’ll be recording en route. And I’m not sure if I should own up to this, but we’ll also be loading a few movies onto the Ultrabooks. We watched a couple in Greenland and it felt like pure (and utterly incongruous) decadence to be lying zipped up in a sleeping bag watching a film while a storm was blowing outside. Tarka’s never seen The Wire, so we’ll take that as well, I reckon!</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372790100472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:35:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372790151735-106</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes: Haswell At The Bottom Of The World: Intel's Polar Adventure</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372789917617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part VI If nothing else, a viewing of The Wire may radically alter the pronunciation of “sheet ice“.

Wallis used to get called out and what do you know........those posts would receive as many as 250 ratings...1 star ratings. I'm sorry, but NOBODY cares about Wallisweaver enough to rate a post 250 times. He can't do that anymore under the new format, so he posts as carpetbumper or vinny_bagodonilz to try and flush the board when he is called out. Let's be perfectly clear: Wallisweaver is a stock pumper, a degenerate bum and just not a good person.

Intel plans to make use of its advanced manufacturing processes to create smaller, more power-efficient chips than the competition to try to gain a foothold in wearable devices before competitors–not play catchup as it has in smartphones and tablets. Krzanich made it sound like the company is pretty far along in attracting customers, though he didn’t name any. “I think you’ll start to see stuff with our silicon toward the end of the year, and then into next year,” Krzanich said. . . . . My first guess is, Krzanich was referring to Apple iWatch. But it doesn't really matter.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1372812817952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 20:53:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372812827529-175</Id><Title>Dividend raises will move the "low" price up each year</Title><Msg>Hope you are in at 19 for the next 15 or 20 years.

On the Windows and Android side, Haswell is really giving computer makers lots of ammunition to get consumers to upgrade the XP and Windows 7 computers. Notebook/Ultrabooks/Hybrids with Haswell, are allowing all-day battery with unheard of graphics resolutions. The ATIV Q and ATIV Book 9 are perfect examples of this. It has only been 2 week since Haswell release and already we are selling some incredible devices...ATIV Q, Dell XPS 11, Sony VAIO Duo 13, etc. We will see even more incredible devices once the Haswell Y series ULV parts (6W SDP) and the ultra ULV parts (4.5W SDP) are released.

Next shoe to fall, the IDC &amp; Gartner PC early returns for Q2, which is due any day now. I'm sure the bears &amp; Romit Shah especially will use those numbers to trash INTC - he'll be on CNBC next week I'm sure.

Here's the conclusion of the article: Now, we have a chronology that defines what was involved and how long it took to bring these chips to market. We also know that Intel is taking another two years after P1270 (22nm FinFET's) to bring P1272 (14nm FinFETs) to market. I think we are starting to get an understanding of why Samsung is now buying Intel chips. They realize that they can't wait that long to develop this technology for their own semiconductor manufacturing lines. They need to buy from Intel to remain competitive with others who are or will be buying from Intel. Now, tell me again how TSMC is going to pull this off in a year. Tell me how GlobalFoundries is going to do it in six months. Tell me how they are going to work out a viable manufacturing process for FinFETs, build and/or outfit the plants, bring up the plants, achieve manufacturing yields, develop design rules and models, and then build chips - just as Intel did. Can't be done!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372821631277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:20:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372823174470-219</Id><Topic><Title>ANALysts really have it wrong</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372731133141</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 22:12:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's simple math to show just how off these ANALysts are: These ANALysts have the current average earnings estimate for Q3 at $0.50. Intel has already stated that gross margins for the last 3 quarters (including the just ended Q2) were hit by one time excess capacity charges and startup cost for 14nm FAB upgrade. So GM for last 3 quarters were as follows: 58%, 56% and 58% (estimate for Q2). Intel also said that by Q3, margins will be back to normal ( 60%). They also guided margins for 2013 to be 60%. This means Q3 and Q4's margins will average at least 63%. Revenue was guided for single digit growth, so will be at least $54 billion. This means revenue for Q3 and Q4 will average over $14.3 billion each. For comparison, in Q3 2011, Intel's revenue was $14.2 billion and GM was 63.4%. For that quarter, Intel earned $0.65. This is $0.15 above the current Q3 estimate!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372823174470</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:46:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372823666531-220</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC, GlobalFoundries, And Samsung Can't Save ARM And AMD From Intel's FinFETs</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372821631277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:20:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And this is why I don't worry about the latest dip in the stock price. It's clear what is happening and what will happen. We will see the ARM world fail and fail badly to meet the fabrication schedule that the marketing department has laid out. Why are the ARM foundries making these predictions that they can't possibly meet? They simply don't have a choice. If they told the truth there would be literally a stampede to Intel by everyone who could get Intel to take them. By making outlandish promises they buy a little time to attempt the impossible. Will it help? No, it won't fix anything. It will merely delay the inevitable. As Arnold indicates, the ARM foundries have years and years of work just to get to a half-step to FinFET. The reality will come clear as dates start to be missed. Intel is ready to move up to a two process node advantage in six months. Anyone who wants this state-of-the-art technology has to be working with Intel now. So, there are quite a few of the big boys of mobility who are already late to the game. And they know they have to come to Intel or their competitors will. Wall Street continues in denial as if something might happen to turn this around. Nothing is going to turn this around. The situation was created by ten years of effort and billions and billions of dollars. ARM can not and will not get back into the game. Not everyone is oblivious to what is happening. The 14 dollar drop in the ARM stock price is evidence. That drop should have been accompanied by a huge move up in Intel's stock price. This latest dip in Intel's stock price will just make it that much sweeter when the trap closes on Wall Street. Intel longs will laugh last, long and best....</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372823666531</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
