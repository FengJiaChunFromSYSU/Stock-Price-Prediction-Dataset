Intel should trade plus/minus the dividend amount around the strike prices. The option arbitraging should provide some gravity toward those price points since the option premium is highest. Today, SOXX and the semis are down 1.5%+ while Intel is trading down 1%. Watch for unusual option volume and for this pattern to influence trading till Friday AM. Thursday after the close, there will be a 22.5 cent discontinuity in the pricing of Intel stock. The ADJUSTED price of Intel will be adjusted down 22.5 cents to reflect the value of the dividend awarded to shareholders. Put options will increase in value by 22.5 cents. Call options will drop in value by 22.5 cents. Watch for unusual option volumes and expect that some call options will be exercised on Thursday as the premium drops to zero in the afternoon.
