For years, Apple bought processors from Intel for its computers, and if the company will switch sides, ARM could lose a large portion of its revenue base. ARM's advantages in pricing and power efficiency could dissipate as Intel introduces next generation chips. Intel continues to lose market share in the processors markets, it suffers from the economic slowdown in the leading economies, and it is losing costumers that trade laptops for tablets. Despite all these short term negative factors, Intel is still much bigger and has a lot more resources to allocate towards producing microprocessors than ARM has. Intel also has the connections to enter this market; therefore, it could be just a matter of time before the company starts taking market share from ARM. This process could lead to a price war, and if that happens, the company left standing is the one with the deeper pockets.</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1343275413000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 00:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343275637000-3</Id><Title>Apple is going to use Qualcom for I phone 5?</Title><Msg>Doesn't Qualcom depend on TSMC?

They aren't going to just switch to ARMH, especially since ARMH server chips aren't and won't be made by ARMH.

And, if that doesnt work Intel will give their chips away at cost. But, as you said, the switching costs alone will prevent any OEM to switch if there is no compelling reason to do so...there wont be. I laugh at all the Intel bear analysts who are using this ARM threat to scare investors away from Intel.

The uncertainty is whether this technical edge will be enough to warrant business decisions that are influenced by several other factors.

Where the needle swings to on this will determine Intel's viability in mobile and this is largely technology independent. A case in point being the south-bound ASPs at which mobile chips sell.

While many a die hard long, Wally, Otellini, et al, clearly fail to realize (due to their absolutely faulty reliance on fundamentals) is that they likely already missed the chance they had of selling at peak margins, peak prices, peak profits back in May when it is quite likely the bear market rally ended (one can hardly call a market that failed to reach a new high a bull market, thus bear market rally, a bear market which should continue given the clearly defined pattern of lower highs and lower lows. It is highly unlikely against this technical backdrop that anywere near the May highs will be seen for quite a long time in either INTC or the markets. Simply because INTC pays a dividend does not provide any meaningful protection from a renewed and revived bear market in equities. While at some point there should be a counter-trend (trend is clearly down) rally, that rally will likely be used by the smart money to sell and sell short the market.</Msg><Username>wdblawhypocrite</Username><Timestamp>1343348738000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 20:25:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343349944000-85</Id><Topic><Title>WDBLAWGROW calls for Intel under 16 !</Title><Username>wdblawhypocrite</Username><Timestamp>1343348738000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 20:25:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While it is entirely possible that INTC could eventually drop below 16.00, I never said that, and it no where to be found in that message.
