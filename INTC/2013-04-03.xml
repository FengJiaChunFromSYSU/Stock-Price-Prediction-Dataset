The "insider selling" in April is automatic selling to cover the taxes of the vesting of new RSU options. coinmaker77 knows this. He also knows that corporate insiders have options that have vested, taxes paid on them but are unexercised that amount to several times the "selling". There is no need to acquire ownership by paying for the shares until they near expiration or need to be sold. Some are sellers. Few are outright open market buyers. I would like to see a high technology company where there are buyers. I like to point out QCOM as sellers. go to secform4DOTcom and select QCOM lots and lots and lots of sellers. coinmaker77 is not interested in accuracy.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364962047664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 00:07:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364962272011-2</Id><Title>NVDA wafer price projections</Title><Msg>google NVDA deeply unhappy with TSMC, claims 20nm essential worthless and you can read the chart/table "wafer price is hiking up" eyeballing going from 40nm to 28nm = 1.5 x 28nm to 20nm = 2x 20nm to 14nm = 3x This comes from NVDA !

Next up is the rather nebulous claim that this allows a company to leverage 16nm efficiencies through magic hand waving and PR distractions or something. To use non-technical terminology, this is basically BS, but the press will eat it up and parrot it back until people think it is ‘truth’. That said, this is nothing that will actually be real to the end user, so they could claim it will bring world peace next week too. The point of all this is that TSMC is calling their next node 16nm not 14nm like the Common Platform guys and Intel. ... If they were it would be the aforementioned competitive intelligence goldmine as well as something the public really doesn’t care about. How does the headline, “TSMC announces 20nm tapeout of rev3 of their 6th test structure die, the 19th and final test chip before 20nm is finalized!” sound? I know, heady stuff but even those in competitive intelligence would probably not read the full release before they died of boredom. The same goes for today’s 20nm Coretex-A57 tapeout announcement, it is a nice headline grabber but totally irrelevant to real news or progress.S|A</Msg><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1364963806325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 00:36:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364963827326-4</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcom is the problem, not ARM</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364575475237</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 12:44:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I looked at QCOM IP revenue from licensing and royalties.

WHAT'S NEW: JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna downgraded Intel to Market Perform from Market Outperform. The chip maker is having technological difficulties with its new Haswell architecture and will not implement its planned power management scheme for the chips, Gauna reported. As a result, the company may have to delay launching Haswell, and the product may have performance issues, the analyst wrote. Meanwhile, CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri predicted that Intel would lose a significant amount of the Linux server market to ARM chip vendors. The prices of Intel's server processors will come under pressure, added the analyst. Pajjuri maintained an Underperform rating on the stock. TODAY'S PRICE ACTION: In early afternoon trading, Intel dropped 45c, or 2%, to $21.40. OTHERS TO WATCH: Applied Micro (AMCC), Cavium (CAVM), and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are the ARM vendors that are well-positioned to see a major impact from Linux server share gains, added the analyst. He has an Underperform rating on Marvell (MRVL) and no ratings on the other two stocks.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364963948252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 00:39:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364965556534-6</Id><Topic><Title>The chip maker is having technological difficulties with its new Haswell architecture and will not implement its planned power management scheme for the chips, Gauna reported.

Intel can build a 22nm FinFet chip way cheaper then TSMC can build a 20nm planar chip. Another problem is if they can actually deliver the volumes that the industry needs. Intel is building out 450mm wafer fabs and so they are investing in a more efficient process for the future. Dumb bunny analysts call this "wasted" CAPEX but Intel is investing in future efficiency. Some of these people just don't get it. The battle isn't just shrinking the transistors that is important but maximizing manufacturing efficiency. Near as I can tell, Intel is winning both of those battles.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1364984751226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 06:25:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364984770527-16</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful!</Msg><Username>ryanwillie792</Username><Timestamp>1364984770527</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 06:26:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364985221254-17</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC won't have 16nm in full production until 2016 - if everything goes according to plan</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364955238060</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:13:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My prediction is that Samsung will only be a memory manufacturer in 5 years.

In fact, such a device would likely score very high on the "price versus function" scale against conventional tablet operating systems, potentially mitigating the threat from mobile computing.</Msg><Username>agermangymnast</Username><Timestamp>1364992925529</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 08:42:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364993486693-33</Id><Topic><Title>Intc free falling</Title><Username>kopach</Username><Timestamp>1364931168790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:32:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes perfect sense... shame though... means without some BIG news, we are going to maintain the same $21 to $22 range for a long time... and I don't see what they could do to bring BIG news... except maybe if more android devices switched to INTC processors, that might be a great boost...

Fab 14 is supposed to churn out 20nm SoCs and according to Taiwanese media it will open on April 20, two months ahead of schedule. If nothing goes wrong, it will begin volume production by the end of Q2, with shipments ramping up in the second half of the year, reports Focus Taiwan. Observers believe TSMC’s 20nm process could help it land some orders from Apple. It has been rumoured for months that Apple wouldn’t mind building its A7 chips at TSMC. All this might be very bad news for Samsung. The Korean giant is apparently struggling to produce enough 28nm Exynos 5 chips for its flagship Galaxy S4, yet TSMC is already gunning for 20nm. In theory, Qualcomm, Nvidia and other ARM players could have 20nm SoC designs as early as next year, while Samsung is still ironing out its 28nm process.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364995792480-38</Id><Topic><Title>April Conference Call &amp; 1st quarter earnings</Title><Username>typea1948</Username><Timestamp>1364987713074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 07:15:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have owned Intel for over 4 years.

TSMC expects 28nm shipments to grow by 3x this year compared to 2012, with the first 20nm shipments occurring in 2014. He believes 20nm shipments in 2014 will be larger than 28nm shipments in 2012, while 20nm shipments in 2015 will be larger than the company’s 28nm shipments in 2013. When asked how much volume TSMC would be doing on 16nm in 2015, Chang responded “I think it will be very small.” And that tracks perfectly with what we’ve previously seen from ARM/TSMC collaborations. The first Cortex-A15 built on 20nm with TSMC taped out in 2011. If Chang’s remarks are accurate, we might see such a chip come to market in 2014 or 2015 — three or four years after tape-out." extremetechDOTcom/computing/152382-arm-tsmc-complete-16nm-cortex-a57-tape-out-chip-launching-no-time-soon</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364996198377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:36:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364996370972-41</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 20nm Fab 14 coming on line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3 or 4 years after tape-out.

Ltd. (Hsinchu, Taiwan) is reportedly going to start installing equipment for 20-nm CMOS production at its Fab 14 on April 20, two months earlier than previously planned. TSMC would then be able to begin volume production at the end of the second quarter and ramp 20-nm production in the second half of 2013 a Focus Taiwan report said referencing unnamed sources. That timetable seems extreme as it usually takes several months to get a production line hooked up and another few months for the first wafers to "pipeclean" the line. However a smooth installation could get some additional 20-nm production out in 2013. At a groundbreaking ceremony for phase 5 of Fab 14 held in April 2012 TSMC indicated that the fab would be TSMC's second 20nm-capable fab area and planned to begin 20-nm volume production early 2014. TSMC's phase 6 at Fab 12 in Hsinchu was slated to be TSMC's first 20-nm production site, coming on stream in 2013. So an early ramping of Fab 14 looks to be an effort to expand 20-nm production capacity and pull it back into 2013. Many observers are tying this to the expectation that TSMC will make the A7 processor for Apple. TSMC's ability to transition manufacturing of chips from 28-nm to 20-nm bulk CMOS is seen as a key advantage over competitors Samsung and Globalfoundries</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364996419416</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:40:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364996642386-43</Id><Title>how them ARM shorts working ?</Title><Msg>that has gotta lead to hypertension and other health issues.

LSI acquired the site in 2006 when they acquired Agere Systems.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364998815402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:20:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364998820767-66</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 20nm Fab 14 coming on line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"During TSMC’s last conference call, CEO Morris Chang gave some guidance on the company’s roadmap through 2015.

The buying is finite and it is not a strong gravity. When INTC got close to $21, the premiums on the the $21 STRADDLE would make it the attractor and Intel would probbaly punch through to $20.90 on put buying and then start back up on call buying for the straddle pair. If Intel hits the $21.80 area, the $22 planet gravity becomes the attractor and the OMM behavior tends to move toward that strike. The low premiums (caused by the low BETA) make the straddle/strangle buys attractive. There are a number of other low return option pairs that are routinely played in the 100 to 1000 contract range.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364999737538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:35:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364999819049-76</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364999104545</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as if INTC didn't also drop, what a bunch of dolts</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1364999819049</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:36:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364999928615-77</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 20nm Fab 14 coming on line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Read justfine790's article, CEO says "the first 20nm shipments occurring in 2014"...which part of that don't you understand" understood it completely now just sticking to he headline... what part do you not understand...

TSMC would then be able to begin volume production at the end of the second quarter and ramp 20-nm production in the second half of 2013 a Focus Taiwan report said referencing unnamed sources. That timetable seems extreme as it usually takes several months to get a production line hooked up and another few months for the first wafers to "pipeclean" the line.

"Any cut that Intel makes gets transferred almost immediately to consumers," another analyst comments. This means that Intel's 1.8-GHz Pentium 4 will cost only $260 - as opposed to $562 today. "It puts AMD under a huge amount of pressure," analysts say. "I'm not sure they have any choice [but] to lower prices." I owned AMD at the time, and the "price bomb" threat (which was actualized) always stuck with me. My impression of Intel is that they are a Roman Empire type of company. They are not interested in peaceful competition but a full annihilation of the enemy and they'll pursue this goal even if it temporarily damages their own welfare. Those fabs are their legions, and they have built (and are building) so many of them to maximize damage to others.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1365004297730</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365004307765-105</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 20nm Fab 14 coming on line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course 20nm has a negative ROI and whose knows if anyone will actually want to buy the old technology planar chip when it fully ramps sometime in 2014.

I'm not looking so much about the writing on this board but the writing on the wall for ARM. I mean day after day it's the another glorified ARM puff piece. If they really weren't worried they would calm down. ARM seems more engaged in winning the PR war right now instead of the processor war. As though one influences the other. Maybe ARM should hire Journey to sing "Don't stop believin." on their behalf. Hey guys in India, Journey was a rock group from America in the 80's.

If you want to know where ARM is most vulnerable it's not phones but tablets. What can you say about ARM tablets? Well, plenty. iPad outsells the competition 20 to 1 and looking at Apple's declining sales even though they have a new iPad out means that there is a problem. And here's the problem, people want more of a PC experience on a tablet than a phone experience. If they are forced to have a phone experience they prefer the iPhone experience. Clearly there is nothing ARM has come out with that pushes the tablet experience along. With Intel, the size, processing power and features are unlimited. I am so glad your mantra is ARM64. Come on say it with me "ARM64, ARM64, ARM64" Of course you assured me last year that Windows RT would break open the Wintel Dynasty and frustrated consumers tired of paying the Intel tax would flock to it. Still waiting for that day. But at least with ARM64 you can't possibly be wrong twice in a row!

The excerpt below is from a 2012 article. Do you ever get tired of posting trite, meaningless, mean-spirited, cowardly garbage?] Addiction on Wall Street High-profile, cocaine-fueled meltdowns are old hat on Wall Street. The truth is, finance is more haunted than ever by addiction, compulsions and eating disorders. Here's why. But now, a remarkable 10-year-long study has peeled back the glass partitions on the Street and confirmed the worst fears about drug abuse in the cathedrals of high finance. A University of Southern California researcher, who was once herself a Wall Street banker, followed more than two dozen freshly minted MBA’s from the boot camps, or “grind mills,” of investment banks as they clawed their way toward wealth and absolute power. By the fourth year in business, they had succumbed to a litany of out-of-control behavior. Even when Wall Streeters have climbed to the top of their fields, have managed to race through the war zone of stress and bodily punishment and somehow come out on top with a fat bag of money like the Monopoly man, they are vulnerable to addiction’s ravages. The economic meltdown of 2008 hasn’t helped them, but not for the reasons you think. High-finance intervention specialists, like Curry, have seen an uptick in drug abuse on Wall Street since 2008.

Check out the whole thing. Here's an excerpt: So the real question is how does having this LTE capability help drive revenue growth for Intel. Simply put, it opens more of the market to Intel to compete in. Intel having "the smallest and lowest power solutions" for LTE that earned top honors from the Signal's Research Group will power sales in the mid-range smartphone segment. In 2013, I expect Intel to sell chipsets for up to 60 million units due to its presence in several devices aimed at the emerging markets. This LTE capability should create more design wins for Intel. The smartphone market is expected to reach over 900 units in 2013 and with Intel's LTE solution, support for the Android OS, and next generation processor due out in the second half of the year, the design wins could lead to another 10-15% in units for this year. 2014 is the year I expect Intel to shine in the smartphone market and I would not be surprised to see Intel capture close to 20% or more of the market which could be conservatively 200 million units. Assuming an average price for the chipset of 15, more if including the optional LTE baseband chip, that would equate to approximately $3 billion in revenue from smartphones in 2014.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365026728040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365026984334-204</Id><Topic><Title>Kim Jong-Un 2 B Next Intel CEO</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1365020585391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 16:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stick to fixing HVAC units and window fans.</Msg><Username>herbal_dud</Username><Timestamp>1365026984334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365027230638-205</Id><Topic><Title>Kim Jong-Un 2 B Next Intel CEO</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1365020585391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 16:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Next Intel chip will then be nuclear powered!</Msg><Username>clrodrick</Username><Timestamp>1365027230638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:13:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365027296950-206</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC 20nm Fab 14 coming on line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364995766156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:29:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someone needs to tell TSMC PR department that April fools day was two days ago.</Msg><Username>clrodrick</Username><Timestamp>1365027296950</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:14:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365027867525-207</Id><Title>whne the shooting start on the korean pennisula</Title><Msg>When the shooting starts in Korea the Intel fabs outside Asia will be cranking</Msg><Username>albacornus</Username><Timestamp>1365027867525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365029395487-208</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung - N.
