Anyway, Intel didn't have a competitive mobile SoC until February 2012 with "Medfield". In late 2012, Intel launched "Clover Trail" which actually garnered ~7% of the entire tablet market. Not bad, eh? But in phones, Intel doesn't yet have an LTE solution (although it is coming soon), so that keeps it out of the US market. In foreign markets, Intel is trying to establish a base with its "Z2420" low end chips, and it seems that the company is slowly but surely winning designs. However, you won't see a real market share grab from Qualcomm (this is the major player) until the firm has both LTE and a significantly better apps processor than what is currently on the market. Intel's "Silvermont" disclosures imply the latter, and the LTE was confirmed at MWC as coming in 1H 2013. In short, Intel hasn't yet really played in the game, and as a result doesn't have large share yet. Time will tell, but when Intel is running full-force in this space, I expect real share gains in tier-1 devices. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368764195663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368764299715-9</Id><Title>Shills Adopt New Strategy</Title><Msg>Content-free posting and laughably stupid rumor mongering.

It just takes some time to roll out but all the pieces are in place. So, I'm not too concerned about what happens on any given day or in any given week. I hear Intel is going to give Cisco a run for its money on switches. Here's one article: "Intel's switching dreams will be Cisco's and Juniper's nightmare" Intel has big plans in the networking –plans that will upset the status quo from merchant silicon vendors like Broadcom to box makers like Cisco and Juniper who are dependent on custom ASICs. ...the chip giant is making aggressive moves in the data center and enterprise computing sector. After buying networking silicon vendor Fulcrum in 2011, Intel introduced a few products and hinted at its plans, but on Wednesday at the Open Networking Summit it revealed its SDN strategy and took the gloves off. Intel is showcasing its networking silicon, but it’s also offering two reference designs — one for new switches and one for new servers that would use Intel’s new chips. It’s also showing of a software layer called the Intel Data Plane Development Kit for OpenVSwitch that will accelerate packet processing on Intel’s CPUs instead of on dedicated network processors. One of the reference designs is aimed at the data center and the top of rack switches made by Cisco, Juniper, Arista and Force10 (owned by Dell), and the other is more of a punch for Cisco and Juniper in that it’s aimed at service providers. In fact, at the event Intel said Verizon was testing a prototype version of its reference design. With these offerings, Intel is putting Broadcom, a popular maker of merchant silicon, on notice that it’s going directly after its business. That’s not surprising. The only question is how low Intel will go in pricing to put the hurt on Broadcom. But it’s also providing designs and capabilities that could obviate the need for special-purpose silicon that Cisco and Juniper currently rely on in their high-end box</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368766229679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:50:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368766243400-18</Id><Title>MSFT is hitting new 52wk highs despite missing the mobile revolution.

Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits.

But, oh, what could have been! Even Otellini betrayed a profound sense of disappointment over a decision he made about a then-unreleased product that became the iPhone. Shortly after winning Apple's Mac business, he decided against doing what it took to be the chip in Apple's paradigm-shifting product. "We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it," Otellini told me in a two-hour conversation during his last month at Intel. "The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do... At the end of the day, there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought." It was the only moment I heard regret slip into Otellini's voice during the several hours of conversations I had with him. "The lesson I took away from that was, while we like to speak with data around here, so many times in my career I've ended up making decisions with my gut, and I should have followed my gut," he said. "My gut told me to say yes."</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368795268554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 08:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368795421229-43</Id><Topic><Title>Atom could have been in the iPhone</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368795268554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 08:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many of the structural changes that occurred in these industries now seem predictable. It feels like somebody else could have positioned Intel differently to take advantage of these trends. At the very least, Otellini should have seen where the changes were leading the silicon world. And the thing is, he did. He just wasn't able to get the Intel machine turning fast enough. "The explosion of low-end devices, we kinda saw as a company and for a variety of reasons weren't able to get our arms around it early enough," he admitted. It was Otellini, after all, who had made the call to start developing the very successful low-power Atom processor for mobile computing applications. And it was Otellini, who upon ascending to the throne, drew a diagram that I'll call the Otellini Corollary to Moore's Law at the company's annual Strategic Long Range Planning Process meeting, or SLRP. He duplicated it for me in an appropriately anonymous Intel conference room, calling it half-jokingly "the history of the computer industry in one chart." On the Y-axis, we have the number of units sold in a year. On the X-axis, we have the price of the device, beginning with the $10,000 IBM PC at the far left and extending to $100 on the far right. Then, he drew a diagonal line bisecting the axes. As Otellini sketched, he talked through the movements represented in the chart. "By the time the price got to $1000, sort of in the mid-90s, the industry got to 100 million units a year," he said, circling the $1k. "And as PCs continued to come down in price, they got to be an average price of 600 or 700 dollars and we got up to 300 million units." He traced the line up to his diagonal line and drew an arrow pointing to a dot on the line. "You are here," he said. "I don't mean just phones, but mainstream computing is a billlion units at $100. That's where we're headed."</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368795421229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 08:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368795497676-44</Id><Topic><Title>Atom could have been in the iPhone</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368795268554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 08:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What I told our guys is that we rode all the way up through here, but what we needed to do was very different to get to [a billion units]...

"How well do you think Intel is thinking about ultracheap?" I asked. "Oh they got it now," he said, to the laughter of the press relations crew with us. "I did this in '05, so it's [been more than] seven years now. They got it as of about two years ago.

Fact is, at the time the Blackberry and other pre-iPhone smartphones were already enormously popular and the global market for mobile devices was growing exponentially. And at the time Intel already knew cellphones were one of the fastest growing markets for the semiconductor industry, but instead of making CPUs suitable for handheld use and taking the business from ARM Otellini pumped billions of dollars into a useless multi-year effort financing the U.S. startup Clearwire and pushing their WiMAX standard - which was ill-fit and doomed from the start with mainstream carriers. The wasted opportunity is absolutely tragic.

I bet you are a liberal that thinks a 2 dollar tip for a waitress that's helped you all night long is "feasable."" [ghostupinhere, sounds like you need to rename your ID "stick-up-in-here". What the world doesn't need is another affluent white boy who thinks his money earns him the right to bully people. It doesn't. You seem to want to punish every single person on the planet who doesn't agree with you. Unfortunately (for you) the ability to punish anyone on a message board depends on three things: 1. Intelligence. All your posts sound like they were written by someone who had half of his brain replaced with his prostate. 2. Writing ability. Your posts aren't articulate. They reflect sputtering, unintelligent, wandering, impotent rage, confusion and frustration more than anything. 3. Humor. Hard to couple humor with impotent rage and you haven't managed it yet. So, I have some advice. If you want to punish people get someone to "ghost your posts" as opposed to channeling your inner Joseph Stalin.

I am not sure about the rumors but I doubt Intel would sell below cost for long. Intel is pretty tight lipped about their costs. Apple probably had some minimum volume requirements in addition to cost. I think the bigger issue was the fabs were running at capacity with all the strategies hitting on all cylinders. How do you decide who would not get requested parts so Apple could get theirs.

Now, when you put Bay Trail into those products, you get even thinner and lighter products and even better battery life. Then you also have 7" and 8" bay trail tablets flooding the market running Android and full versions of Windows 8. Who wouldn't want a device that can do it all? Intel TV is the first of its kind. No other company will be offering Internet-based only TV service. They can work with current service provider or new ones.

Industry and media luminaries gathered for an exclusive event at the M-Space in Haidian, eager to get a glimpse of the metal-clad flagship that stands out as much for its category-topping performance as its slim, sleek design. The Lenovo K900 goes on sale in China this week, and will roll out to additional international markets throughout the summer. The unibody design of the K900 makes a bold statement for Lenovo. The sleek-cut, stainless steel frame exudes power and strength, while the unibody chassis maintains a low profile at 6.9mm, ensuring a smooth, elegant look and feel. The attention to detail and focus on design for Lenovo’s latest flagship smartphone makes the K900 an excellent choice for top-end smartphone buyers, while Lenovo’s expanding distribution for smartphones ensures the K900 will compete head-to-head with many of the top smartphones in the market today. Lenovo K900 is the first smartphone in the world to leverage the latest Intel Atom™ Z2580 processor, a dual core chip, which runs up to 2.0 GHz and utilizes Intel Hyper-Threading technology to boost performance efficiency. The Intel-powered device also features an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator engine running a PowerVR SGX 544MP2 GPU, which triples graphics performance over the previous generation. This makes the Lenovo K900 very responsive, especially for key functions such as web-browsing, multi-tasking and application-switching. “Intel and Lenovo have raised the bar for smartphones with the K900. Our teams got together and worked closely to innovate around a number of important features and capabilities that our customers care most about...

He's a company man who is not much of a rhetorician, and the last few quarters of declining revenue and income have brought out detractors. They'll say Otellini did not get Intel's chips into smartphones and tablets, leaving the company locked out of computing's fastest growing market. They'll say Intel's risky, capital-intensive, vertically integrated business model doesn't belong in the new semiconductor industry, and that the loose coalition built around ARM's phone-friendly chip architecture have bypassed the once-invincible Intel along with its old WinTel friends, Microsoft, Dell, and HP. Intel generated more revenue during Otellini's 8-year tenure than it did during the rest of the company's 45-year history. And yet, consider the case for Otellini. Intel generated more revenue during his eight-year tenure as CEO than it did during the rest of the company's 45-year history. If it weren't for the Internet bubble-inflated earnings of the year 2000, Otellini would have presided over the generation of greater profits than his predecessors combined as well. As it is, the company machinery under him spun off $66 billion in profit (i.e. net income), as compared with the $68 billion posted by his predecessors. The $11 billion Intel earned in 2012 easily beats the sum total ($9.5) posted by Qualcomm ($6.1), Texas Instruments ($1.8), Broadcom ($0.72), Nvidia ($0.56), and Marvel ($0.31), not to mention its old rival AMD, which lost more than a billion dollars.

Moore’s Law is not running out of steam but the increasing cost of producing smaller and smaller transistors faces some companies such as TSMC with challenging investments. As a result, what is being branded as transistors of smaller sizes actually produces chips that are no more dense in terms of actual transistor count: After a fairly routine shrink from 40nm LP to 28nm LP, TSMC and other foundries rolled out HKMG technology, which greatly reduces leakage power. The HKMG process is more expensive than the standard 28nm version, but both have the same transistor density. At 20nm, HKMG becomes mandatory, because otherwise, the leakage of the tiny gates would be overwhelming. Double patterning is also needed at this node, adding more cost. FinFETs, another technology to reduce power, compound the cost problem. TSMC is adding FinFETs to its 20nm process and calling it 16nm FF, but the transistor density remains unchanged (see MPR, “Foundries Stretch for FinFETs”). […] the bottom line is that wafer cost will more than double between 28nm LP and 16nm FF, but the transistor density will only double. Thus, the cost per transistor will increase during this transition. Gwennap thinks companies making top-tier devices, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, will be able to pass along the higher costs of more expensive transistors, while those selling into markets for cheaper devices may not be able to afford the most expensive process technology. Gwennap sees Intel as well-positioned to use its process technology advantage to deliver on Moore’s Law and, hence, scale Moore’s Mountain...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368817898337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368818038434-113</Id><Topic><Title>I'm actually glad to see INTC bouncing back (This is the real Vinnie, not the idiot clone)</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1368802478209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:54:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who's Dana?</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1368818038434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368818041589-114</Id><Title>Time to Buy More ARM Puts?</Title><Msg>Marsavian, what do you think about the current ARM technicals?

AppleInsider reports that supplies of Apple's MacBook Air are beginning to shrink ahead of next month's Worldwide Developer Conference with multiple major retailers listing the high-end 13-inch model in particular as "out of stock." The MacBook Air was last refreshed at WWDC in June of 2012. Apple's strict command of its supply chain means that it tends not to have a lot of excess inventory sitting around in warehouses—according to a Gartner report from about a year ago Apple can turn over its entire inventory of product in about five days. Reduced inventory for current products tends to indicate that new ones are around the corner. If that by itself isn't enough evidence for you, consider that Mac hardware refreshes generally tend to be tied to Intel's hardware cycles and that Intel's next-generation Haswell architecture (with its enhanced integrated GPUs) is all-but-guaranteed to be announced at Computex at the beginning of next month. When it launched Ivy Bridge last year low-voltage CPUs intended for thin-and-light laptops were the first to be released, meaning that by the time WWDC rolls around Apple will likely have the CPUs it needs to make next-generation MacBook Airs happen. Apple is also widely expected to make announcements about the next versions of iOS and OS X at WWDC which begins on June 10. Ars will be at the opening-day keynote covering this and any other announcements that the company makes at the show.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368824293910</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 16:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368824738794-149</Id><Topic><Title>MACBOOK AIR SUPPLIES DWINDLE AHEAD OF WWDC AND INTEL CPU REFRESH</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368824293910</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 16:58:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like Russ Fischer is right: "Something different is happening with Haswell.

"I did this in '05, so it's [been more than] seven years now. They got it as of about two years ago. Everybody in the company has got it now, but it took a while to move the machine." *** Perhaps, though, the transformation that Otellini began in 2005 will finally be complete during Brian Krzanich's tenure. Intel's technical lead, perfectionism, and scale will create amazing chips at prices that cause phone and tablet makers to give up their commitments to the ARM ecosystem. *** What's clear is that when Intel has a single competitor to focus on, they are hard to beat. "The thing about Intel is that we always come back," Otellini told me. "We put resources on it. We get focused. And watch out." They outinnovate, outmanufacture, and outcompete any company that comes into their targets. *** If you're Intel, which fly do you fire the shotgun at? Not ARM, that's for sure.

February 27, 2012 Elpida actually files for bankruptcy protection. February 28, 2012 The IMFT (Intel (INTC)-Micron Flash Technology) joint venture is re-negotiated. The JV redo involves an "enhanced JV" where Intel sells to Micron the Intel interest in the IMFT fabs in Singapore and Manassas, VA for $600 million. $300 million cash and $300 to remain on deposit with Micron for payment for future NAND chips. These fabs had a replacement cost of perhaps $8 billion, with Intel's interest worth about $4 billion. Selling the Intel interest in the fabs for $600 million was tantamount to a "Phantom Transfer" of over $3 billion in appraisable value to the Micron balance sheet. It also sent to the Japanese a message that Intel was indirectly standing behind any offer that Micron would make on the Elpida operation. May 4, 2012, Hynix (not in great financial shape themselves) withdraws from the bidding for Elpida. May 10, 2012 Micron confirms rumors that they are in discussions to acquire Elpida as a continuing operation. May 16, 2012 Industry sources reveal that Apple (AAPL) has contracted with Elpida (still officially in bankruptcy) for mobile DRAM that represents half of the output of the Hiroshima fab. We need to pause and think about that for a minute. Apple essentially bet the company on a supplier of an essential product that was in bankruptcy proceedings. July 2, 2012 Micron announces sponsorship agreement to acquire Elpida Memories. February 28, 2013 Tokyo district court approves the acquisition of Elpida by Micron. March 29, 2013 A small group of unsecured creditors file an appeal, which can only delay the closing of the acquisition.

The Apple business will move from Samsung. The debate over whether the business goes to Intel or TSMC (TSM) will soon be over. My bet, since Intel played a big role in saving Elpida, to Apple's distinct benefit, they will get the "A" chip business with or without the ARM (ARMH) cores."</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1368839296993</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 21:08:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368846032754-167</Id><Topic><Title>INTC will see 18 before it sees 22 again</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1365430004086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 10:06:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice call, fat boy.

The surging volume late in the session of the past two Fridays suggests capitulation among the short sellers. The short covering process, coupled with a lack of sellers, could propel stocks higher. The S&amp;P 500 is likely to take aim at 1700 while the Russell 2000 small cap index makes a run at 1000. With that said, stocks are overbought on both the short term and immediate term basis. Some pullbacks won't be surprising.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1368848602643</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 23:43:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
