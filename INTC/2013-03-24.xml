Most of the dozens of vendors who spoke to EE Times were longtime PowerPC and Freescale customers. Most were increasingly adopting the x86 while rolling out their first products with ARM and Atom cores. Most saw a rise in the need for communications in embedded markets, but generally at data rates of a gigabit/second. A handful of vendors are pushing into Ethernet and Infinband at 40 Gbit/s rates. These board makers were also driving into high performance apps using general-purpose graphics processors (GPGPUs) from AMD and Nvidia. Some are even starting to talk about a new category of embedded supercomputers. Meanwhile DSPs have been on their way out of embedded boards. Increasingly they are being replaced by FPGAs at the high end and x86 chips with their latest SIMD instructions in other markets. eetimesdotcom/General/PrintView/4410161</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364141031245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:03:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364141684339-15</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: $48 Per Share In 4 Years</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1364091124340</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 22:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your opinion doesn't add up to much.

Which of the 4 Geekbench sections do you think has most relevance to a smart phone and also if the same is true for tablets. Some of the tests seem reasonable but other choices seem strange. How are the 4 sections weighted when they are combined? 50% of the integer result is based on compress/decompress. Does a smartphone really do a lot of encrypt/decrypting? Lua instead of Java? How do the memory read and write tests differ from the stream copy? Geekbench combines 4 benchmark sections some way to generate a composite number. 1. Integer: encrypt/decrypt, text compress/decompress, image compress/decompress, Lua script to compute prime numbers 2. Floating point: Mandelbrot, DOT product, LU decomposition, Lucas-Lehmer prime number test , Sharpen and Blur Image 3. memory performance: sequential memory read, write, system malloc()/free(), memset(), memcpy() 4. stream performance: computes copy(a[I]=b[I]), computes scale a(i) = q * b(i), computes add a(i) = b(i) + c(i), and computes triad a(i) = b(i) + q * c(i).</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364141717540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364142149534-17</Id><Title>Intel VP: Here’s Our Bleak Outlook... at Wall St. Cheat Sheet11:51am EDT</Title><Msg>LOOK OUT BELOW!!!</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1364142149534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:22:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364142700610-18</Id><Title>Intel VP: Here's our bleak outlook for the 10 inch tablet</Title><Msg>Not for Intel itself.

Skaugen partly bases his doleful outlook of the full-sized tablet market on the recent success of smaller-sized tablets such as Apple’s iPad Mini and the various smaller Android-powered tablets. The iPad Mini has an 8-inch screen and many of the successful Android tablets competitors have 7-inch screens. As ZDNet reported last year, the iPad Mini has been cannibalizing sales of the full-sized iPad since its debut. Skaugen also believes that the emergence of hybrid laptops with detachable displays will make 10-inch tablets redundant. As reported by ZDNet, Skaugen points to the new touchscreen-friendly Windows 8 operating system that he believes will promote the production of touchscreen capable laptops.

Instead, Samsung will incorporate Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 to power the Galaxy S4 smart phone until it will mend the overheating problem, an industry analyst familiar with the Exynos octa-core CPU. The Exynos 5 octa-core CPU is the first commercial implementation of ARM big.Little architecture that incorporates two ARM quad-core processors-a low-power ARM Cortex-A7 and a high-performance ARM Cortex-A15 in a single silicon die. The big.Little architecture was meant to balance performance envelop and power budget, letting high-performance A15 processor to perform duty-heavy computing jobs like graphics rendering and full HD 3D video playback, while assigning energy-efficient A7 to mainly work out light workloads. [1]The idea is to optimize performance and power consumption depending on workloads. In theory, , for example, the balancing act will result in up to 70% power and energy savings, compared with when high-voltage and high-performance A15 works alone, often overworking light processing workloads and thus wasting power. Yet, the reality is going the opposite way. . What are mainly blamed for the overheating are so-called bus contention and the static power consumption. The Exynos octa-core CPU has one dedicated bus interface to boot up data from on-chip memory, but each core is contending with each other to get faster access to data on-chip cache memory, often resulting in data latency. The power consumption of a CPU is a total sum of static, or leakage power and dynamic power consumption. On the 8-core layout of Exynos 5 octa-core CPU, some cores are operating at or near a peak frequency, mainly consuming dynamic power, while other cores sit idle, or in a standby mode, but still co</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364162946281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 18:09:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364163119364-41</Id><Topic><Title>DEVASTATING NEWS FOR ARM CAMP</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364162946281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 18:09:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>itersnewsDOTcom/?p=26964 Samsung Galaxy S4 overheats on Exynos 5 CPU</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364163119364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 18:11:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364163299822-42</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Intel building so much capacity?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364150000932</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 14:33:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, sorry, I saw what looked like Wallis' format (putting comments in square brackets "[...]") and inadvertently said "thanks Wallis" when I now see that the message was from a different dude names bacbacker.

When asked specifically about integration of LTE modem circuitry with a mobile application processor such as the Atom during an analysts' conference call held to discuss Intel's fourth quarter 2012 financial results, Otellini said: "In terms of integrated solutions, you'll see higher levels of integration from us next year." During the call, Otellini said Intel was shipping a data-only mode LTE modem IC to customers and that a data-and-voice multimode modem would ship during the course of 2013. He added that he expects the first mobile phones with Intel supplied LTE capability to have launched early in 2014 at about the time of the Mobile World Congress. The lack of an integrated baseband modem and processor for mobile applications puts Intel some way behind Qualcomm Inc. (San Diego), which already offers integrated LTE capability in its Snapdragon line of application processors. Other companies with chips that integrate the application processor with the baseband modem include Renesas Mobile with its MP6530 and ST-Ericsson NV with its NovaThor L8580 ModAp chip implemented in 28-nm fully-depleted silicon on insulator process technology. Intel's wireless capabilities are largely derived from the company’s acquisition of the wireless business unit of Infineon Technologies AG (Munich, Germany) completed in January 2013. Otellini said the former Infineon team is making good progress in LTE: "We believe we have a very competitive solution. The Infineon team is known for not necessarily being first to market, but being really good at engineering a very solid solution and being cost effective and cost competitive and I think that they are doing a very good job with respect to this product."

Intel Launches XMM 7160 4G/LTE Multimode-MultiBand Modem [02/25/2013 09:28 PM] by Anton Shilov Intel Corp. on Monday revealed one of the world’s smallest and lowest-power multimode-multiband 4G/LTE solutions for global roaming in one SKU with envelope tracking and antenna tuning. Intel’s strategy is to deliver a leading low-power, global modem solution that works across multiple bands, modes, regions and devices. The Intel XMM 7160 is one of the world’s smallest and lowest-power multimode-multiband 4G/LTE solutions (LTE / DC-HSPA+ / EDGE), supporting multiple devices including smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks. The 7160 global modem supports 15 4G/LTE bands simultaneously, more than any other in-market solution. It also includes a highly configurable RF architecture running real time algorithms for envelope tracking and antenna tuning that enables cost-efficient multiband configurations, extended battery life, and global roaming in a single SKU. “The 7160 is a well-timed and highly competitive 4G LTE solution that we expect will meet the growing needs of the emerging global 4G market. Independent analysts have shown our solution to be world class and I’m confident that our offerings will lead Intel into new multi-comm solutions. With LTE connections projected to double over the next 12 months to more than 120 million connections, we believe our solution will give developers and service providers a single competitive offering while delivering to consumers the best global 4G experience. Building on this, Intel will also accelerate the delivery of new advanced features to be timed with future advanced 4G network deployments,” said Hermann Eul, Intel vice president and co-general manager of the mobile and communications group. Intel is currently shipping its single mode 4G/LTE data solution and will begin multimode shipments later in the first half of this year. The company is also optimizing its LTE solutions concurrently with its SoC roadmap to ensure the delivery of leading-edge low-power combined solutions to the marketplace.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364178886981</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 22:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364179121166-56</Id><Title>Intel Delivers New Smartphone Chips, Makes 4G Modem Play</Title><Msg>"I'd expect to see this announcement of new Atom devices and an LTE chip lead directly to an integrated SoC by end of 2013 or early next year.

Intel has acquired a series of strategic assets (including Fulcrum Micro, Wind River, McAfee, and Infineon), enabling the company to more deeply penetrate the datacenter market over the next decade. Intel’s addressable market moves beyond computing and into storage, switching, security, and specialty network equipment. Overall, Intel’s portfolio of acquisitions seeks to enable commoditized hardware platforms, while leveraging its value proposition in x86 processing driven by Moore’s law.

We know that Intel will be shipping the 22nm Silvermont Atom SoC this year and the 14nm Airmont Atom SoC in 2014. Intel is shrinking Atom chips every year. We know that the ARM world fears Intel's move to 22nm SOC's but it's the move to Airmont that literally strikes terror into their hearts. We know that Intel’s integrated 4G/LTE solution will be here in 9-12 months. We know that the arguments from the ARM world now center around band-aids like big.little and the fairly short wait for Intel’s LTE solution to arrive. Their argument about getting traction in PCs disappeared when the RT not only failed to excite customers but resulted in many saying that the product should be discontinued. We know that Intel will soon be two process nodes ahead of ARM and will maintain this advantage for years. We know that the Altera deal completely changed the competitive landscape by clearly demonstrating that companies really want and will get in line and pay for Intel's advanced fabrication and technology. We know now that many more discussions are taking place and that Intel will be able to pick and choose the ones that it wants. We know that Apple is in huge trouble and needs Intel more than Intel needs them. Samsung is beating Apple like a drum. Apple better make a move and they better do it quick. We know that Intel expects to see solid in growth in networking and data centers as well as in mobility.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364180837831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364182999385-63</Id><Topic><Title>What We know Now</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364180837831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:07:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mentioned 4G/LTE will be here in 9-12 months. From INTC's website (binged "xmm 7160") and the first two sites (Intel's) that come up talk about it ... pretty good testing data compared to other 4G/LTE (actually tops), but it mentioned this, "Intel is currently shipping its single mode 4G LTE data solution and will begin multimode shipments later in the first half of this year."</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1364182999385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
