Where have we heard this lie before? Wasn't it from Apple back in the days it had risk processors? They would claim that their RISC processors were twice as fast as Intel? So a 800mhz RISC processor was on the level of a 1.6ghz Intel processor. Except it was all BS. The tests were, well, greatly exaggerated. If that's the best Warren East can do, then ARMH is very much in trouble. The other part about Intel being at 32nm currently while ARM being at 28nm is true, in theory. TSMC is making some 28nm for GPU's on video cards. They aren't exactly flooding the market with these processors. And then he had to go on and talk about 20nm. What? 28nm really hasn't been unleashed on the market yet. ARM does have some good things to talk about on their own right now, they have solid sales volumes. This approach of grandstanding leads me to believe that the fabrication issues of ARM at TSMC are serious enough to need addressing at the top level. Like Wally has been saying, this is a crises. Pick any flavor of ARM 800mhz SoC's you want and put them in a phone running Ice Cream Sandwich and hand it to anybody who is familiar with smartpones and have them use it for a day. Then have them run the Intel Orange San Diego for a day and ask them which one they prefer, what would you think they would say? Wait a minute, am I calling Warren East a liar? No, I am calling him a desperate, grand standing second rate snake oil salesman of a liar. Come on you ARM fans, which one of you wants to get behind this? "An 800MHz ARM delivers the same performance as a 1.6GHz Atom," says East." I am not talking some obscure test in a lab to fabricate BS numbers that nobody believes, I am talking real world performance. Which of you would dare stand up for Warren East? Like I said, there is less to cheer for every day with ARM.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345729431000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:43:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345729490000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Where's Paul?</Title><Username>StockJock44</Username><Timestamp>1345679891000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:58:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A 53 year old loser named Tiglet crying on the yahoo board because the CEO won't allow him to trade Intel the way he wants to.

Take a look at the two processor diagrams below. The monolithic design allows the L3 cache to be shared by all four cores in the Barcelona. In the event that Core 1 needs data stored in Core 3's cache, it can directly probe Core 3's cache and retrieve the data. This allows for high-speed sharing of data between the dedicated caches of all four cores. In contrast, the Intel's split-die design and separate memory controller requires a markedly different solution. If the same scenario presents itself, Core 1 will have to send the request to the memory controller (located in the north bridge chip) through the relatively slow front side bus. The memory controller will then probe Core 3's L2 cache, resulting in Core 3 sending the requested data to the memory controller. The data is then forwarded to Core 1. Needless to say, this results in much slower sharing of data. http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=424&amp;pgno=2 ------------------------------- Where AMD screwed up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! problem only occurs when data needs to be shared between cores of different processor dies. If data is to be shared between cores of the same processor die, Intel processors will still be faster since the L2 cache is shared by both cores.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345734328000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345734338000-61</Id><Title>Going low 20s maybe teens as predicted.

The show is about them doing stuff as a family, going ATV riding, going to the Red Neck Olympics where they were bobbing for pigs feet (uncooked pigs feet) and mud belly flopping. One episode they had Christmas in July where they had kids sit on Santa's lap and tell what they wanted. Keep in mind this is a backwoods town of around 1000 people. The kids said "I want an iPhone" and "I want an iPad." Makes me think about what some Apple snob wrote a couple of years ago about the Apple fans being the technically elite.

A few scenes later mom was telling the world that she is healthy because despite being 315lbs she farts at least 15 times a day and she heard somewhere that if you do that it means your healthy. Such an outstanding endorsement of Apple iProducts, you should be proud!</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345742489000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:21:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345742679000-101</Id><Topic><Title>Att: Walldork- At $24.99</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1345741877000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:11:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6 cents 2 go!

Barrett concentrated instead on the Itanium chip--that has been a razzle-dazzle winner hasn't it? Otellini then initially considered TV chips. Sun Micro that was bought by Oracle thought that Internet would become the Network--replacing MSFT--and Otellini and company instead of focusing on the Internet Devices and appliances of the future fell asleep doing the same thing that INTC has been doing for over 30 years. Otellini sits on the Board of Google and how he missed the paradigm change to Internet Mobile Appliances and Devices--it is amazing. He said a couple of years ago that he was going to focus a large percentage of his time on the future--apparently his vision has been pretty clouded because he missed the resurgence of APPLE as well. Bottom line--INTC has still not come to grips with the future. They are spending a ton of time and money building more advance chip plants--and the real question is whether those plants are actually needed in the new world order. Are these plants going to be dinasours and an albatross around INTC's neck? Are they the right kind of chip plants of the future? It looks like INTC is married to MSFT and their various operating systems--present and future. Perhaps INTC needs to rethink its whole strategy on what Mobile of the future will look like--they obviously have missed the current iteration!</Msg><Username>shmemony</Username><Timestamp>1345746133000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345746234000-114</Id><Topic><Title>Five Buck Miss</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1343055551000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:59:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The boneless bears will soon be defeated.

When you listen to these types of presentations, it becomes clear that Intel operates at an entirely different level than the rest of the industry. I recommend everyone listen. But here are a few notes I made: Intel can adjust to market changes on the fly. Don’t worry if the market shifts. On demand flexibility is built in to the Intel system. Intel has right to first refusal on tools on ASML deal. EUV is going to happen. 450mm will save $5 to $8 billion a year. Intel has the right level of support to provide 450mm. Intel keeps adding more and more functionality on each die but manages to keep die sizes relatively the same by new fabrication every eight quarters. If you don't do this the die sizes become unmanageable. [Look for this to happen to ARM as their fabrication improvements grind to a stop.] Ramps are more complex. Everything is getting harder. Intel’s lead will continue. Harder for competitors to keep up. Technologies build on each other. So companies who don’t make each step will have a harder time. People can get to 22nm but without FinFET they don’t get the 2x power improvement. So, ARM products at 20nm will be inherently inferior to Intel 22nm FinFET. TSMC at 16nm was discussed. Intel’s 3 to 4 year lead in fabrication won’t be affected. Fabless model discussed. Intel's IDM model is much better. Foundry die cost to wafer cost pricing is to make design teams work harder - trying to emulated the IDM model. ARM companies trying to buy capacity from foundries in order to emulate the IDM model. Atom roadmap to catch up to the regular roadmap at 14nm. Effects on Atom will be really really significant at 14nm. Intel will be trying to ramp 14nm at an even faster rate than ever before due to its superior performance and effect on the market. Intel would have to lower margins to become foundry. But technically no reason why it couldn’t happen. So, Intel will be extremely choosy. [Demand for 14nm will prolly alleviate most considerations of foundry type work. Intel prolly won't even want Apple's business. Imagine that...] Intel continues to build functionality into the CPU. Becoming much more an SOC company. Strong roadmap in integration. Putting mixed signal on silicon is not that hard. Intel has a new unpublished roadmap that will integrate all functions into silicon. [Conclusion: Intel quietly continues preparation to crush competitors with its fabrication...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345771730000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345771765000-208</Id><Topic><Title>Pacific Crest Presentation</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345771730000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:28:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.intc.com/eventdetail.cfm?EventID=117744</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345771765000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:29:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345771785000-209</Id><Topic><Title>What if TSM bought ARMH?</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1345769860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:57:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not really.

Yeah, he's a genius, Gump. You recently said this: "The point I'm making is Intel is not uniquely positioned to make greater progress than competitors on either architecture or process. Both camps will make about the same amount of progress if you buy the law of averages. I would tilt the balance in favor of the ARM camp because they have much more momentum in low power." Which means, of course, that you don't know enough about fabrication to put on the head of a pin. Not surprising for a three-page message history lucy shill. Law of averages??? Intel has FinFET. ARM doesn't. Intel moves to a new node every eight quarters. ARM can't. Intel smoothly ramps up new nodes. ARM falls all over itself resulting in angry customers begging Intel to take them on. Intel routinely spends $10-12 billion on each new fab. ARM has exactly one foundry that can keep up with this pace and it doesn't have FinFET. Intel's roadmap extends two generations past 14nm. ARMs roadmap ends before it gets to 14nm. Exactly what does the law of averages have to do with this?</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345773030000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:50:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345773251000-214</Id><Topic><Title>What if TSM bought ARMH?</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1345769860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:57:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes that is true. But foundries generally do a lot more business than just ARMH chips. There's GPU's and CPU's and other segments they could move into if TSM agreed to pull out of those for approval by antitrust reviewers. They could also agree to not build any MIPS chips designs too. Na, I think antitrust issues would be far less extreme than in the case of an AAPL-ARMH buyout.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1345773251000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345773387000-215</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Rangebound for 10 Years</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1345646266000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:37:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The lucies trot out the 10 year stat whenever they don't have any real ammunition.

There would be no difference between QCOM and NVDA because they would be forced to use identical building blocks - the fabless players would become commodity because you would strip off differentiator. TSMC needs to provide a process that is wide enough to cover all customers but by doing so they will have to make trade off and these tradeoff will affect TSMC customer.

Except if they chose to go with MIPS (or even AMD) to differentiate their products from TSMARMH SOC's. &gt; TSMC needs to provide a process that is wide enough to cover all customers...TSMC can not provide a fully optimized process to all fabless players at the same time that fully meet requirements. &lt; Yup. Standardize the offering. Isn't that what INTC does? They can focus all their efforts on developing 'ONE' optimized process for each chip generation, just like INTC. That's why I say this would make the new TSM a much more serious challenger to INTC.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1345777859000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:10:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345778372000-223</Id><Topic><Title>What if TSM bought ARMH?</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1345769860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:57:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Their relative enterprise values says a buyout is possible. The merged company could operate much like INTC as far as product/process development which puts them on a much more level playing field. Yes INTC has the process advantage, but ARMH products also have dominant mobile marketshare.

So if Intel goes from 32nm to 22nm and a new architecture in 18 months, ARM goes from 45nm to 28nm and A9-&gt;A15 in the same time frame. They'll maintain relative position and at the starting point they're about even. They'll probably stay even in terms of technology. In terms of market presence you can see what Intel's scrambling to do with selling reference designs to no-name customers in remote corners of the world.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1345779212000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345780728000-225</Id><Topic><Title>Obama going for the moron vote</Title><Username>wallispumper</Username><Timestamp>1345775594000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 22:33:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only "clueless idiot" here is YOU!
