He certainly did. But you can argue that his strategy for adapting the chip maker to the trend really wasn’t the right one. But as a 40-year Intel veteran it never very likely he would reject one of the company's articles of faith. Perhaps he should have. That Intel hasn’t adapted to the mobile world is clear. We’re all buying fewer traditional computer form-factors, but never more smartphones and tablets. Early in his reign, Otellini attempted to position Intel at the forefront of this change. In 2006, the company was quick to promote first the Ultra-Mobile PC (UMPC), a Celeron-based low-end PC in a thick tablet form-factor. A year later, UMPCs having failed to win a thumbs up from consumers, Intel strove to persuade World+Dog to buy netbooks instead, compact laptops designed for easy portability and Wi-Fi net access. Initially based on Celeron chips, netbooks soon became flag bearers for Atom, Intel’s new family of x86 processors for ultra-mobile devices. At the time, Otellini forecast Atom would go on to become the foundation for the Mobile Internet Device (MID), another tablet, this one smaller - and much thinner - than the UMPC but more internet friendly than the phones of the time. Indeed, in 2009 the CEO said Intel would, in five years' time - so by 2014 - be selling more Atom system-on-chips (SoCs) than regular CPUs. x86 for mobility The common thread running through all these initiatives - apart from mobility, of course - is the use of Intel’s x86-based processors. It’s now driving the largely unsuccessful push to Ultrabooks. Intel had ARM chips in its portfolio, but one of the first things Otellini oversaw on becoming CEO was to shift his engineers’ attention away from the ARM instruction set architecture (IA) and back to Intel’s core IP, the x86 instruction set. Eventually, he sold Intel XScale ARM family to Marvell. x86 holds a special place in long-term Intel executives’ hearts. Alongside with Moore’s Law, it is one of the two ‘self-evident truths’ that define the post-1970s Intel: that chips will double their transistor count every 18 months or so, leading to ever more processing power, year in year out - and that those chips will use Intel’s IA. Neither, of course, are scientific principles, merely a hypothesis and a business strategy. But Intel had a nice run through the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s demonstrating that these two notions are more fundamental than they actually are. There’s no reason Moore’s Law can’t continue to define Intel’s chip roll-outs for some years yet. But the rise of ARM, the de facto standard architecture for the world’s phones, smartphones and tablets, shows that x86 does not reign supreme. Intel executives continue to claim that the key benefit of x86 is compatibility: with Windows and with the vast library of application software already coded for the platform. Otellini banked on buyers wanting to run that software on their mobile devices too. May be they do, though there’s no real evidence to show that that’s the case. Certainly, users have exerted little pressure on makers of ARM-based mobile devices to develop x86-based versions that can run Windows and Windows apps. Yes, Microsoft is offering an x86 version of its Surface tablet, but that’s as much about Redmond playing all the angles as a firm sense that some folk don’t want an ARM-based Surface. In the middle of the last decade, Otellini knew that technology was going mobile and that ARM was then best suited, from a hardware perspective, to deliver greater mobility. He pledge to aggressively drive down Intel chips’ power consumption to a point where x86 processors could match the energy efficiency of ARM devices. Eight years on from Otellini’s elevation to CEO, Intel can argue that it’s there. It has x86 in smartphones and, unlike previous attempts, they don’t deliver a much shorter battery life than ARM devices. The problem now, though, is that the rise of ARM in the interim has eroded the compatibility value of x86. x86 for compatibility Manufacturers have used ARM for a variety of reasons, some financial, others technical, such as the platform’s energy efficiency and the way ARM’s licensing model makes for greater system-on-a-chip customisation, the better to differente your chip from your rivals, and the better to tailor your design for for role it will be put to. Intel could have delivered such a foundation years ago, but its belief in the primacy of the x86 instruction set and the software compatibility that came with it slowed its development work down. Google’s development of Android primarily on ARM, and Apple’s choice of ARM for the iPhone and iOS, shows the didn’t see Intel’s chips as viable alternatives in the mid-2000s and, more importantly, that they were willing to invest in a new IA. Had Intel not been so wedded to x86, it would have had energy efficient mobile CPUs out sooner and might have become the one that defined that IA. Now it can match ARM on energy efficiency, at least, it’s too late, and the market had shifted even further from the x86 compatibility requirement. Apple is a pragmatic company. It migrated to Intel from the PowerPC platform because it saw no benefit in staying, and it made the the move a success, just as it had when it went from Motorola 680x0 to PowerPC. Rumours have it that it’s now investigating whether it can make and sell laptops with ARM chips. Its clear processor agnosticism will mean that, if it sees a benefit - financial, technical and/or practical - in doing so, it will shift away from Intel. Rival firms don’t need to, of course. Samsung, for instance, can happily go on making and selling Intel-based laptops for customers who want one, and ARM-based mobile devices for everyone else. These are not, after all, separate groups. Laptop owners also use phones and many of them have tablets too. There will, then, still be a role for Intel, as the key manufacturer of Windows - and Linux, since the open source OS runs primarily on Wintel machines stripped of their shipping OS - laptop processors. But as ARM moves up the line into laptops and, soon, mini-desktop ‘living room PCs’ - it’s already putting footholds in the server world - Intel may come to rue its insistence on x86 above all, not because it can't compete technologically, but because the once implicit link between x86 and personal computing has been broken. Otellini’s departure, two years before it was anticipated, is, he says, about making room for new blood, new thinking. Intel needs to be sure his replacement is not as wedded to the x86 faith as he was. ®</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1353421679778</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:27:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353421706199-29</Id><Topic><Title>It was over for Right-wing trash ballllllll loser Paul O when he publicly endorsed Rombo Romney THE LOSER!</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1353345270543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:14:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That makes them die hard liberal in your mind? Keep in mind that $65 pps in 2000 was in the midst of the nasdaq bubble, their p/e was dumb high, not as dumb high as armh is now but still it was irrational. Intel's biggest failure was to ignore mobile. It would be like AT&amp;T saying no to 1st the cordless phone around the home and then 2nd to ignoring the cell phone. Intel lacked vision and now they are going to have to play catch-up to the likes of QCOM. Good luck. Now the CEO who knows what is in Inetl's pipeline is bailing and he is 61 years old? I don't see how it can be good. I would rather hear that the BOD suggested he leave.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1353421706199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:28:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353421785537-30</Id><Title>New lows today... jeesh..</Title><Msg>This is a becoming a dead end stock...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1353421785537</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:29:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353421973281-31</Id><Title>They downgraded so they can load up on BAD NEWS</Title><Msg>They got caught surprised about Otell's quitting, they did not steal it under $20... so they downgrade on priced in news.

The USA has had difficult times in the past but good leadership to help those that truly needed it always came to the forefront. Today there is not that leadership with integrity that really is for the people. Obama can provide all the rhetoric he wants but his actions have not backed his word. It is the hard working works that you needed to support as they are the folks that grow the country economically and with integrity. You have two types of takers in the country. Those that do not want to work which is really a small segment of the unemployed and many of the wealthy which is also a small segment of the country. Yet that is where most of the money is going.

Markets KNOW there is a reason why. Danger--they sell.</Title><Msg>WHO is the new CEO? What the heck is Intel going to do? Big Rich and in a battle for its life. Remember Nokia? It was a monster and now it is a little rat bleeding on the ground. Intel, because of the server space, does not face that meltdown but the markets are worried. I told you Intel fanboys long ago that it was PHONES! Intel is late and unless it can rip into Apple and Samsung with its chips in them or in others soon, Intel could be hurt for ever. For all you Apple and Samsung fans, good for you for now. For Arm and Arm chip makers, good for you too. BUT--A Tech company like Intel has Massive money and a steady income to counter attack with. All it needs is a New CEO with the backing of the Board to attack the markets with. Make your own phones Intel. Make your own PCs and your own Notebooks and Tablets. Apple is a giant and no one can argue that it is not a monopoly of sorts at this time along with Samsung. A Duopoly. Apple with over 100 billion dollars in cash will either kill Intel or hurt it severely if Intel and its best friend, Google, do not strike BACK HARD IN , 2013. Rip into Apple with an attack because Apple will never do a deal with Intel. That is why Paul Ottelini lost his job. He thought he could get a deal but Apple never ever was going to do a deal with Intel. Apple has a Messiah complex now and thinks it is the GOD of tech--of the business world. Intel needs to take a baseball bat and knees cap Apple hard breaking its legs. Make your own phones with Google and sell them in huge volume and rip into the bottom line of Apple. Apple makes 66% of its money from phones so rip into that area and you will make Apple bleed like a Thanksgiving Turkey. I am positive about the firing of Paul. He was incapable of doing the new things that need to be done. Make your own retail products Intel. It is TIME. Samsung and Apple will soon be making all their own chips and making their products. Intel has to enter the fight. Apple thinks it can compete with Intel chips? Intel should make that fight a head to head one.

Folks, Shorts and Longs, I have no position in AMD but have CISCO, NTAP and others; I have made a great chunk of money from tech stock for last 20+ years. This is the first time after 6 years I see AMD is really about to take a good percentage of market share of Note and Netbook, Server and GPU. Mr. Reed is a turnaround manager and his experience has proven many times, his goal is to turn AMD around and he seems like doing a fantastic job, the team he is putting together is second to none. Just give AMD another 6 months and you will see 6, 7, 8, 9, or $10 price will be history soon. Again I have no position here but have position in the Apple, I bought at $63 and never listen to any stupid comment from neither the shorts nor long, just do your DDs and study the company and you will be surprise how much you can gain from fine prints. The turnaround managers and CEOs in today’s market are like shining stars and Rory is one of the well known one. Mark this post and come back in September and look at AMD stock. There are some clowns like AMDACE who probably have a couple hundred shares shorted and have nothing to do but to sit and post garbage here, and there are some longs who just post some unjustified messages on the board, as soon as the stock goes up a few pennies they jump all over this board. If you are short unless you short a large number of shares, I mean 100,000 or more then you are not making any thing and in the end you just lose money. If you are long then don’t even bother checking every hour for a penny up or down, just sit tight and you will be soon rewarded. I have no position in AMD yet but as soon as it hits $8.50, I will be in for a large share and will hold until Rory complete his job, this means bring AMD back to $30 to $40.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1353435974853</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:26:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353435984044-227</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to dump Intel soon</Title><Username>shirpelang</Username><Timestamp>1353435189929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:13:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My friend</Msg><Username>shirpelang</Username><Timestamp>1353435984044</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:26:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353436060640-228</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to dump Intel soon</Title><Username>shirpelang</Username><Timestamp>1353435189929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:13:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD will be 12 to $15 by September By shirpelang.Mar 1, 2012 7:19 AM.Permalink .</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1353436060640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:27:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353436062543-229</Id><Topic><Title>Will close today at 18.88</Title><Username>simpleawright</Username><Timestamp>1353435569335</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:19:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right on it, End of year $15 or lower.</Msg><Username>shirpelang</Username><Timestamp>1353436062543</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:27:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353436135598-230</Id><Title>Worst stock AND company on the NASDAQ!!!

Its progressive highs July 2005, 28; Dec 2007, 28; Apr 2012, 28; But, while the highs seem to be capped at just under 30, the lows have progressively dropped. Sep 2004, 20; Jun 2006, 17; Feb 2009, 13; If it is heading for a new lower low - it has a long way to drop. A stock like this has been a short sellers dream. And, while this might be a nice entry point for a long term hold - given the dividend, I personally would wait for this to show some kind of decent upside strength before investing my money. Specifically, I would like to see it turn around sometime before 13.</Msg><Username>cynicalanddisgusted</Username><Timestamp>1353436889073</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:41:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353436934786-245</Id><Title>Holiday Hit</Title><Msg>I think the Samsung ATIV 500T tablet is becoming a holiday hit. The problem is most retailers are still showing pre-order. The reason for the hit is that the perfect place for Win 8 in the year 2012 might just be on an inexpensive carry computer. Then the computer includes WiFi and ethernet so avoid cellular. Also, the $750 price incudes a laptop keyboard to dock-to. Why this instead of the Surface ? Well, the PC tablet will run Photoshop Elements, for instance. Of course a better laptop but not a tablet would be the Samsung 13.3" Series 9. Amazon has it for $1200 with Win 7 or for $1300 with Win 8. Meanwhile the Lenovo ThinkPad 2 tablet didn't make the November 16 date. And Emirates airlines is equipping its flight crews and cabin crews with the HP Elite Pad 900 tablet but HP is not even not trying for a date before January.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1353436934786</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:42:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353436940426-246</Id><Topic><Title>Stops will be taken out by dropping below 19.16 -- then back up.</Title><Username>smorcos83</Username><Timestamp>1353434981870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:09:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>next drop AFTER 19.16 is 18.41. . . then 17.60. . .</Msg><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1353436940426</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:42:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353436967248-247</Id><Title>Happy Turkey day to all</Title><Msg>I made tons of money shorting this pig.</Msg><Username>shirpelang</Username><Timestamp>1353436967248</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:42:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353437097268-248</Id><Topic><Title>AMD to 40 per shirpelang</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1353435974853</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:26:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what are your thoughts on research in motion?</Msg><Username>d186282mps</Username><Timestamp>1353437097268</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:44:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353437097356-249</Id><Topic><Title>Good call from UBS!</Title><Username>happyperson_1</Username><Timestamp>1353430942938</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:02:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>poor INTC longs thinking the dividend is going to save them. congrats, if you held a year, buy and hold is a suckers game</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1353437097356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:44:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353437230516-250</Id><Title>INTC going lower not even in the game, WAY WAY behind going a lot lower</Title><Msg>INTC going lower not even in the game, WAY WAY behind going a lot lower</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1353437230516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 13:47:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353437329449-251</Id><Title>Don't overlook Louis Burns</Title><Msg>CEO of Care Innovations...

This is a very solid long term entry and i dont care if it goes to 15 with upside in couple years over 40. You will not have a stock market with intel at 15, it will be worse than 2008-2009. This today is as bad as the 12-13 levels were in 2009. What the hell where the earnings back then and what are today? Are we for real going to let the planet go to hell like that? Why? to risk a revolution in the streets of all western countries??? There is nothing wrong with the market intel is targeting. It is mostly servers anyway and serious companies and students doing heavy work, the rest of the market is a superficial smaller section user and that fractional consumer PC base is not going away either. It is only forced down near term because of the Apple gadgets that enrich but do not replace the core computing and the worldwide economic stress that has in the hands of inept politicians held hostage the consumer to uncertainty that can now cripple all top markets. It is for this reason that you will see a focused effort to solve the financial crisis for good in all top countries Germany, US, Japan,China. Intel right here is treated as pathetically as stupid old companies with less relevance to worldwide computing as Dell or HP. Basically it is treated as a box maker. #$%$ The fact is all this move past 24 is insanely wrong and a massive overreaction exploitation left and right.They are picking up shares from panicked people here. Nobody long intel past 3 years is at profit today without trading. This is precisely why they are doing this. To force a massive radical exit just about the turning point in history. For over 30 years now each time intel at 250 day level crossed severely lower than -2sd from that year long band it made massive rally later all the way to the other end some 20-30-40% higher within months. It will be the same again. This point is a solid multi year entry with 1000% upside! Yes 1000% . Lets see it happen in 10 years. It will take only 2 for intel to start dominating the mobile market anyway with first signs next year. This is a transition point that wakes up the giant. The war with apple starts today and apple is not the one that has the technology, its the user of the technology so with a new better CEO watch intel attack apple at the core of the problem which is the determination of the direction of gadget and home markets. Intel wasnt born to be a slave to other companies. Intel is not a txn or mu. And yet those punks enjoy higher PE or other metric valuations today. Are you kidding me??? CSCO, IBM at double PE seriously??? Entry today has you at least see 25 in 2013 at some point. This a very extreme crash oversold situation entry. Full relentless buy of 2014 25 call leaps every chance you get. In in a huge way at 19.38. Lets see what happens now.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1353444896290</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:54:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353444917308-342</Id><Topic><Title>Capitulation ?</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1353443414665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:30:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good example of queer is the guy with all the aliases (coinmaker, too funny, etc) that keeps running down Intel.

He didn't develop FinFET's, that was a multi-decade, multi-disciplinary, multi-person effort that was fundamentally led by Mark Bohr and others in PTD, who are also responsible for the pathway to 14 nm and below. I can date stuff back to '92 that we did that's just emerging. Otellini never was much of a technologist, believe me, but that wasn't a problem because Intel is chock-full of process, design, and packaging technologists. Where PSO brought value was in the business and management side, and in recognizing the value of a robust software operation, something the prior CEO's didn't. Where he lacked as a CEO (and he's not alone in this) is in the visionary space - Jobs is the one everyone thinks of, but there are plenty of others, such as Hewlett, Packard, Grove, etc. Nobody really stepped up to the plate to back him up as a true CTO, with an exciting and involving vision on par with what came from Grove in the past ("Billion connected PC's"). Maybe the next CEO can do that or find someone who can. Best thing is that at least PSO didn't blow $20B with virtually zero return as did his predecessor.</Msg><Username>zubeneschemali</Username><Timestamp>1353448379954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:52:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353448391612-384</Id><Title>no good news for Intel Im glad I sold mine last month</Title><Msg>AMD did bette than this crapola stock</Msg><Username>bashermasterwad</Username><Timestamp>1353448391612</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:53:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353448529575-385</Id><Topic><Title>Meg Whitman = retard with a bad hair cut...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1353448217225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:50:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paul leaving as the stock plummets, maybe he and Meg should get together...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1353448529575</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:55:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353448660545-386</Id><Topic><Title>The Myth of the US Debt</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1353445822367</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:10:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you'd find amongst boomers very very few houses paid off and very very few massive returns in 401k's.

Singapore-based Creative Technology announced today that it has signed a US$50 million deal with Intel. The chip giant will pay US$20 million to license certain technologies related to high-performance graphics from Creative's ZiiLabs. Creative will also receive US$30 million for selling its UK subsidiary--ZiiLabs Limited--to Intel. The UK subsidiary was part of graphics firm 3DLabs, which was acquired by Creative in 2002 for an estimated US$170 million. The move was an attempt by Creative to challenge PC consumer graphics stalwarts--ATI and Nvidia--by merging 3DLabs' expertise in professional-grade graphics with Creative's multimedia business. Renamed ZiiLabs after the acquisition, the subsidiary has been involved in Creative's ARM-based StemCell processor. Despite the sale, Creative retains ownership of the StemCell chip and related technologies, and will continue to sell its ZMS-branded processors to interested parties. The company has been trying to attract Chinese OEMs to use its ZMS chips in their tablets (seen here in the Creative HanZpad). However, it doesn't appear to have had much success so far. Known for its Sound Blaster PC audio cards, Creative has been losing money for 14 straight quarters and its trove of patents built over the years may be one of its last few valuable assets.

SoC technology is more important than absolute performance, and Intel is years behind on SoCs.

Intel's sale of its chip business for mobile handhelds and cell phones, which had been rumored in recent months, is intended to enable the company to get back to basics. The sale will also remove a business that struggled to take off and has weighed down the company's overall financial performance, despite billions of dollars in investments. As part of the Marvell deal, Intel is selling its PXA9xx communications processor, code-named Hermon, which is found in BlackBerry 8700 devices but has not been widely adopted by other handset makers and wireless carriers. Hermon is the second effort produced by Intel's attempt to enter the cellular handset business, which is dominated by Texas Instruments. It is a combination of an application processor, a communications chip for cellular networks and flash memory. The first chip, code-named Manitoba, was a flop. Only one phone was ever released to the public featuring the chip, and only then after a significant overhaul of the design. Hermon at least captured the high-profile BlackBerry design win, but Intel had few other successes to tout in this market. Intel has had better luck with its PXA27x application chip, code-named Bulverde, which is used in Palm Treo smart phones, Motorola's Q and other devices, the company said. But that chip is also heading off to Marvell.

Intel Chairman: We Tried To Get Otellini To Stay For Another Year By Kristin Bent November 20, 2012 12:15 PM ET Intel (NSDQ:INTC) surprised the tech world Monday by announcing that President and CEO Paul Otellini plans to retire in May. But even Intel execs, it seems, were caught off guard by Otellini's plans. According to an interview Intel Chairman and former CFO Andy Bryant held with Barron's Monday, Otellini's departure in May comes much sooner than the chip maker had hoped for. "I did everything I can think of to buy myself another year [of Otellini's leaderhip]," Bryant told Barron's. "We were targeting further out for [his retirement]." [Related: HP Intros New Intel Itanium-based Servers Even As Intel Works To Combine Itanium, Xeon Platforms] Otellini's sooner-than-expected departure will fall at a critical time for Intel, Bryant said. The chip maker has been racing to nab a share of the lucrative smartphone and tablet markets, especially as traditional PC sales continue to tumble. According to Bryant, Otellini felt Intel's charge into the mobile market could be best led by a fresh set of eyes. A specific successor for the CEO role has not yet been named. "After almost 40 years at Intel, and the Intel CEO job for eight years, which is a really hard job, [Otellini] felt it was time to move to the next generation of leadership," Bryant said in the report. "We do have big issues in front of us, moving to the tablet and phone markets, and he was ready to let the next generation lead those battles." Otellini already has helped Intel break into the smartphone and tablet space, having brought to market Intel's low-power Atom Medfield and Clover Trail chips, which are optimized for mobile devices. Still, the chip maker faces an uphill battle against U.K.-based chip licensor ARM, whose processor architectures are already used in 90 percent of the smartphones and tablets on the market today. Despite Otellini's departure, Bryant said getting into the mobile market will remain a top priority for Intel. "We're shipping the most advanced [semiconductor] process, and providing chips in smartphones outside the U.S., and in tablets inside the U.S.," he told Barron's, continuing: "We’re pretty comfortable with where we are technically." Intel channel partners told CRN Monday that they hope Otellini's replacement will be bullish when it comes to mobility and help the chip maker go toe-to-toe with ARM. They also said they hoped Intel's new leader will be just as channel-friendly as Otellini had proved to be. According to Steve Dallman, director of Intel's North American distribution and channel marketing, Intel will always be a friend of the channel, even after Otellini has stepped down. "Paul has always been a great supporter of the Intel reseller channel throughout his career. While he will be sorely missed both personally and professionally, his legacy will continue at Intel, which includes the channel," Dallman said. "We will all miss him, his insight and active participation in many of our channel and distribution events and meetings," he added. "I am sad to see him go and will miss him."

IDC and Gartner both project a 10% PC growth over the next 5 years. Intel will take a big chunk of that growth.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1353465406917</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 21:36:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353465759373-464</Id><Title>INTC was down as posted I was right again today</Title><Msg>I am never wrong because I set the share price on all stocks.

Oct 26, 2012 2:57 PM . Permalink My guess both Apple and TSMC split the margin pressure - nowadays there is no easy switching from one foundry to the other. Samsung might be glad getting rid of Apple - Apple served Samsung's needs by making Samsung a serious competitor and building capacity. Samsung will have no problem filling capacity - if necessary with captive production. Apple orders seen squeezing TSMC’s gross margins October 25, 2012, 11:02 PM Barclays Capital upgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM +1.20% TW:2330 +2.95% to overweight from equal weight Friday, saying that short-term cyclical concerns were already priced in and that it will maintain its global leadership in metal castings on expected orders from Apple in the first quarter of 2014. metal castings = that happens when a Komputa translates TW:2330 But the brokerage said a lower gross margin of 35%-40% on Apple’s AAPL -2.81% orders would drag on TSMC’s estimated gross margins of 40%-45% for 2014-2015.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1353466884197</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 22:01:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353467004925-471</Id><Topic><Title>investment 101</Title><Username>kn592</Username><Timestamp>1353453740279</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 18:22:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Took a small loss and glad I did."

Raystock's actual job is cleaning the restrooms at Burger World but his second job is to post endless lies on yahoo message boards to seek the attention that he so desperately craves. Raystock is not too bright and has yet to figure out that no one likes a liar and that is why he has been unable to cultivate friends in his offline life. We do however recognize that Raystock has received high praise from his boss at Burger World for "taking pride in assuring that every surface in the restrooms shine".</Msg><Username>wowsm1th32</Username><Timestamp>1353467107295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 22:05:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353467189747-473</Id><Topic><Title>INTC was down as posted I was right again today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1353465759373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 21:42:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When Raystock sets the price for a stock he then sits back and watches what it will do and whether it goes up or down he claims to be right.
