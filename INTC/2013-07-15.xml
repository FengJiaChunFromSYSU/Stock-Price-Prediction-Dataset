ARM Holdings plc (LON:ARM) shares are a Sell with analysts at Liberum Capital who see 2013 second quarter results as being unlikely to be a game changer for their longer-term viewpoint on the company. Janardan Menon at Liberum says: "We do not expect any surprises from ARM’s Q2’13 results. Both licensing and royalties are forecast to decline slightly QoQ in Q2, but pick up in H2. The key issues facing the stock are however the slowing growth rates in the high-end smartphone market and the in-roads being made by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) into the smartphone and tablet space. "We believe ARM’s valuations do not adequately factor in these trends and remain negative on the stock." Intel Corporation tipped to take further market share Liberum advise clients that they remain cautious on ARM Holdings given the view that Intel will steadily take share in both smartphones and tablets in coming years. This along with slowing growth in high-end smartphones is likely to put pressure on ARM’s royalty growth rates. "While ARM is likely to take share in other areas like servers, networking and microcontrollers, the impact of this is likely to be smaller than that of potential losses in smartphones and tablets. The stock is expensive and we re main sellers," says Menon. ARM is widely expected to reiterate that it is comfortable with current consensus forecasts. "However, with licensing growth rates now slowing down along with the slowdown in the smartphone market, we believe the likelihood of ARM beating expectations in coming quarters is fairly low," says Menon.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1373888869971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 07:47:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373890607022-39</Id><Topic><Title>The questioin can INTC drop to $19 on earnings? on Lower revenue, Lower earnings and Lower margins</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373857986546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If I were to let you buy your coveted 100 shares @19, would you be willing to leave the board forever?

(INTC) to beat expectations when it reports second quarter</Title><Msg>Intel Earnings Preview: Will it Beat? ZacksBy Zacks Equity Research | Zacks – 27 minutes ago... We expect semiconductor company Intel Corp. (INTC) to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2013 results on Jul 17. Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Intel is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Positive Zacks ESP: The Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (Read:Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Method), which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.56%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Zacks Rank #3 (Hold): Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank#1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. The combination of Intel’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a positive ESP of +2.56% makes us reasonably confident in looking for an earnings beat on Jul 17. What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings? Intel’s new products, its strong position in emerging markets, solid execution, and cost control measures are expected to generate a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, Intel’s focus on the mobile segment, adoption of new products, growth in data centers and new offerings should help drive growth. Also, the company has increased its focus on the ultra-mobile, ultra-thin computing segment with its ultrabook concept. This has been welcomed by Hewlett Packard and Dell, among others, which is quite encouraging. The positive trend is seen in the trailing four-quarter average surprise of 6.44%.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1373904009983</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373904028045-109</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INTEL GUIDES $14.3 BILLION &amp; $15 BILLION FOR Q3 AND Q4 AND GM 63% FOR REST OF YEAR?</Title><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373903578930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:52:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nuff will be in the fetal position.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1373904028045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:00:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373904255858-110</Id><Topic><Title>We expect semiconductor company Intel Corp.

Intel's price action placed the stock below this important level, which makes it difficult to be bought, as the stock will certainly face resistance as it approaches its 50 day moving average. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), designs, manufactures, and sells microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors and microcontrollers, flash memory products, graphics products, and other computer related components. The largest chipmaker in the world was founded in 1968 and is based in Santa Clara, CA. The latest price action range, defined by a peaks and troughs algorithm, placed calculated support at $22.64 and resistance at $25.68. These levels will be closely monitored, as they provide great insight into the latest price dynamics. If traders want to establish a position in Intel, given the resistance expected as the stock approaches its 50 day moving average, a trade might materialize as the stock manages to break this important technical level. After the breakout, the 50 day moving average could be used as support going forward. However, until the break materializes, buying the stock is basically a gamble with 50-50 chance.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1373911636991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373912336214-133</Id><Title>"All you need to know about Intel's Haswell chip"</Title><Msg>That's the title to an interesting article about Haswell. First off, I wasn't aware of the Intel's naming scheme: "Haswell is a small country town in the US state of Colorado. Its entry into the IT lexicon, due to Intel’s determination to avoid trademark issues by using location names instead, appears at a critical time in the computing landscape." I didn't know Windows 8.1 will exploit Haswell's power savings: "The competition Intel is feeling from ARM, particularly in the mobile and server space, is immense so the need to address power consumption is already seeing the chip giant offer news that some Haswell CPUs could use as little as 100mW of power in idle mode. That compares with the 3W minimum with Ivy Bridge. This scale of reduction could see impressive idle battery life coming from tablets and ultrabooks — possibly enough to rival the iPad. Indeed, Intel is spruiking the possibility of 9 hours-plus battery life at idle. But rumours are that Microsoft’s up-coming Windows Blue (Windows 8.1) will also play a major role in achieving that 9-hours-plus, thanks to a new power management model that ties into some of Haswell’s new power states. Blue is expected to help older systems improve battery life too, but it’ll be Haswell that gains the most from the new OS release." This I did know --- "Contrary to popular opinion, the desktop PC/laptop market isn’t disappearing any time soon. But as computing becomes more decentralised into the cloud and portable devices, Intel will need to ensure that it covers all the bases equally well with its future CPUs. Haswell is Intel’s first major release to show whether it can handle the needs of a much broader computing environment."</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1373912336214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:18:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373912781227-134</Id><Topic><Title>Semi equipment junkie</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1373892066999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 08:41:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your heritage is Adolf Hitler.

Ltd. will build 14-nm processors for future Apple Inc. iPhones and iPads under the terms of a deal signed over the weekend, according to a report by the Korea Economic Daily. According to the report, Samsung will build 14-nm A9 processors for Apple with FinFET process technology starting in 2015. The A9 will be used in Apple's iPhone 7. Apple has used Samsung as its chip-making foundry since it started designing its own custom processors for its smartphones and tablets several years ago. But the relationship between the two companies has become strained in the past couple of years, including several high-profile patent litigations in several countries (see Apple-Samsung trial coverage). It has been widely reported that Apple chose TSMC as its foundry for 20-nm A8 processors. However, some believe that Apple may have foundry supply contracts in place with both firms (see Samsung, TSMC and the A6: not OR but AND?). Recent reports also indicate that Apple is in negotiations with US-based foundry Globalfoundries on a supply agreement (see Why GlobalFoundries Should Appeal to Apple). Last month, Digitimes reported that Apple inked a deal with TSMC for 20-, 16- and 10-nm processors (see TSMC signs up Apple for three-year FinFET deal).</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373926970848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:22:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373929028546-164</Id><Topic><Title>Latest rumor _ Samsung/Apple ink 14nm foundry deal</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373926970848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't be surprised if there is a G-F backup to this backup too ;-).

Apple and Intel have been talking. Intel is of course talking about 14nm. Apple is talking to the other suppliers like TSMC , GF and Samsung and discussing what they could do to one up the Intel offer. What price could they do, how many units and what do they need from Apple? TSMC is probably saying that they could ramp up to 20nm and that they would go to the bank, take on huge debt and invest heavily in 20nm if Apple could give them a three year contract. GF and Samsung are making their best pitches as well. Nenni would have broadcasted loud and clear if TSMC inked a deal. I don't see Apple as a company that needs cutting edge technology. But as the new Intel fab comes online they are going to have to make a decision. The processor wars are heating up and Intel has them concerned enough to not be 2 to 3 generations behind. Instead of jumping the ARM ship why not see what TSMC,GF and Samsung are will to offer? And then there's Intel's offer. It's a big decision. I doubt that analysts and bloggers have the inside track to secret contracts from Apple. If Apple were to sign such contracts you'd most likely hear about it from their own press releases. There are of course folks who are desperate to keep ARMH above $40 a share so any news that they can exploit, even being the slightest bit true is put out in the press. That's the way ARMH rolls.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373931266524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 19:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373931403931-167</Id><Topic><Title>Now they are bashing QCOM due to losing it's mobile advantage to Intel.</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1373926039164</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:07:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry, Intel is developing a very strong pimp hand, and will keep these ho's in line in the next few quarters.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373931403931</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 19:36:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373932709210-168</Id><Topic><Title>Latest rumor _ Samsung/Apple ink 14nm foundry deal</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373926970848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good question and I think the answer is probably that Apple thinks that Intel is powerful enough as it now thinks of Samsung. No foundry would attempt to get chip value pricing as Intel is doing now. If Apple eventually comes to Intel it will be because it has no other serious competitive choice and it may yet come to that in time if Apple sees the competitive edge from that being worth sharing the chip profits with Intel. Complicated power dynamics go on at these high levels.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1373932709210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 19:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373933030894-169</Id><Topic><Title>I got my dry powder ready for Wednesday -- if we meet expectations it's going to fly</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1373925926664</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:05:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If i were in charge at Intel what i would do is sandbag as much as possible.I know it's not a popular opinion to have. ARM is looking like less and less of a viable competitor as the month rolls on. The analysts have already written this quarter off and part of next quarter. There has been a change of the guard so nobody is going to ask the CEO to resign this soon into the game. On the other hand, if Intel were to start 2014 by commenting on a record breaking quarter for the Q4 of 13 due to strong demand for the new mobile processors it would do wonders for Intel. You would have manufactures leaving CES worried that if they don't jump on board the Intel bandwagon they may be missing out. Too many people on here equate Intel's performance on Wednesday to the health of the company. Honestly, what is Intel up against? AMD? ARMH with a new 3 year contract deal with Apple every other day? I say let the analysts enjoy another quarter or two manipulating the stock before they are owned once and for all.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373933030894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 20:03:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373933176198-170</Id><Topic><Title>Latest rumor _ Samsung/Apple ink 14nm foundry deal</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373926970848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because ARMH is paying for the rumor articles.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373933176198</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 20:06:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373934061355-171</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver aliases/personalities</Title><Username>wallisweaver_alias_roundup</Username><Timestamp>1373907879724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 13:04:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>malebuttlover?</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373934061355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 20:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373934114833-172</Id><Topic><Title>Latest rumor _ Samsung/Apple ink 14nm foundry deal</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373926970848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>apple is over, who cares? they had their time, they're done</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373934114833</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 20:21:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373934184069-173</Id><Topic><Title>Now they are bashing QCOM due to losing it's mobile advantage to Intel.</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1373926039164</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:07:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel doesn't need any help help holding Intel down, they've done fine hold themsleves down for the last 13 years.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373934184069</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 20:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373934253475-174</Id><Topic><Title>Mr Weaver is mysteriously missing today.

This seems ironic in that you mentioned Adolf Hitler earlier today. One of Hitler's techniques in dealing with the "Jewish problem" was to demonize them. This is the "softening up" that is done prior to suggesting something more dramatic - like shoving them all into gas chambers. You seem to be applying the same concepts to liberals. How long will you wait before proposing the "final solution" to the liberal problem??? It also occurs to me that you know little of American history. American wasn't founded in order to perpetuate and serve the upper class. It was founded to perpetuate and serve the middle class. Your 'favor the rich" policies are actually anti-American. America can survive quite nicely without the rich but not without the middle class. It seems to be your intention to turn America into a Hitler-styled Latin American oligarchy where the rich rule and everyone else suffers. Especially the liberals while they still live.
