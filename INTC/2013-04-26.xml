One of the primary reasons has been the inability of current hardware to give the optimal Windows 8 experience. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is ready to remedy some of these issues with its latest Haswell chips. This new hardware can kick-start a major upgrade cycle and greatly benefit Windows sales. According to reports the codename Haswell chips will be 20x more efficient as compared to existing Ivy Bridge structures. Intel is promising that battery life of as much as 13 hours on Haswell, which is phenomenal by any means.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366948947661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:02:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366948995128-2</Id><Topic><Title>Wallis, Re: ARMH stock.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366936370609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 20:32:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it's beer money I'd go ahead. I like pushing things out until January but it seems like you did okay on your last puts. If you wanted to be a little more conservative you might wait until the Haswell release gets closer. But it's pretty close now. I truly can't believe anyone paying $46 for a little dab of earnings just prior to Haswell. It just shows you that the average ARM investor has never heard of Haswell. But they will. Also we still have a lot of shoes to drop. Another big Intel deal could happen any day. We know they are out there. It would take very little to pop the ARM bubble. Any ARM investor not taking the money and running at this stage is nuts. ARM is getting propped up as an exit strategy. I have to say that they are doing a nice job of giving the smart ones an opportunity to unwind while sticking the sheep with their load. The sheep, the sheep...

After Microsoft CFO Peter Klein confirmed that Windows 8 was headed for smaller devices, images of an upcoming 8-inch Windows 8-based tablet appeared online at French website MiniMachines. The page was quickly taken down thanks to a request made by Acer, but the page's Bing cache remained long enough for additional reports to surface. That cache too has also been deleted as of this report. That said, The Tech Report claims that the 8-inch Windows 8 tablet will be known as the Iconia W3. It will feature Intel's "Clover Trail" Atom Z2760 dual-core SoC clocked at 1.8 GHz – meaning no Windows RT on this device – 2 GB of RAM, dual cameras, a possible microSDHC slot, and an optional foldable sleeve that can prop the tablet up when placed in landscape mode. Photos indicated that the display aspect ratio is 16:10, and the original report speculated a 1280 x 800 IPS screen. Alongside the tablet's launch will be an optional keyboard, according to the report. It will be wider than the tablet itself and will not have a hinge, meaning the peripheral will be a standalone accessory and not the other half of a complete convertible design. Based on the image above, the accessory looks to be a dock that holds the tablet up and supplies a recharge at the same time. Reports speculate that the unannounced Acer tablet may be on par with larger Windows 8 tablets currently on the market including the 10.1-inch Asus VivoTab Smart selling for $429.99 at Newegg. It's unlikely the 8-inch tablet will compete directly with the Nexus 7, but rather Apple's iPad mini in terms of pricing.

We are fairly confident that no one considered the possibility of Intel making a fast AND energy efficient SoC in the time span that they have. AMD has now underestimated Intel twice and in the process they have drug ARM along with them. Now AMD is going to be behind the curve by about 18-24 months when they can finally put a low power SoC with 8000 series graphics on the market. They have to rely on ARM and others more heavily than they probably intended. AMD is already very late to the thin and light, tablet and phone party while Intel is enjoying fairly good sales. Still with no money to spend to invent their own new products from the ground up AMD has to enter partnerships and buy technology IP when they can to build a better offering. AMD has made the right move here, but I am concerned that it might be too late to make the difference they want and need. We hope that AMD can ramp up and start turning things around soon. The alternative is to slide into obscurity and no one at AMD wants that. decryptedtech</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366949632722</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:13:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366949785244-5</Id><Title>Toshiba rolls out detachable Windows 8 tablet</Title><Msg>Toshiba has officially launched a Windows 8 tablets with an 11.6 display and keyboard dock, allowing the device to be easily used like a notebook.

In particular, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a relatively strong track record, laid out a roadmap in January predicting that the MacBook Air could see an update by late in the second quarter with Apple's MacBook Pro moving to an all-Retina lineup early in Q3. Reports on whether there will be any design changes as part of a rumored June notebook update have varied, with a February report from Taiwan's Economic Times claiming that the MacBook Air will see a design refresh while Kuo has suggested that the Retina MacBook Pro may also see design tweaks. Digitimes has weighed in several times on the June notebook refresh rumors, first noting them in late December while suggesting that Apple may cut prices on the MacBook Air in the interim in order to keep sales moving. To that end, Apple did in fact drop pricing on its high-end 13-inch MacBook Air alongside a February spec bump for the Retina MacBook Pro. Digitimes weighed in again just weeks ago, claiming that Apple will be updating its notebook lineup late this quarter, again suggesting a June launch. In a new report out today, Digitimes claims that Apple's quarterly notebook shipments are expected to grow 10% sequentially as the company works through the remainder of its excess inventory and looks to begin ramping up production again in mid-May. The report notes that this new production will primarily be next-generation models based on the Haswell platform. Apple's MacBook shipments Q2 are expected to grow 10% sequentially as the company has almost finished digesting its excess inventory and should start placing new orders in mid-May, according to sources from the upstream supply chain. The orders in May are expected to be mainly Haswell-based models, the source said.

Television is primed to undergo a revolution, the foundation of which rests in online viewership. Websites such as Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu have been players in online streaming, but there is yet to be a platform worthy of being deemed a true cable-killer. Intel's television system is said to stream over the Internet and to come with a reportedly visually stunning top-box. Specific details, however, remain secret. Ad Age, report discusses what it says to be are rave reviews for the service. The head of advanced TV at Group M, Michael Bologna, has spent hours with Intel's box and in a statement of praise claims that "no one expected [Intel] to come out with a product like this." There seems to be a consensus of impression with the product, which is nothing but good news for Intel. Another key point is presented in the Ad Age article. The author notes that Intel has separated itself from other failed attempts such as Apple (AAPL) TV, Google TV, and Xbox Live by taking the effort to become a cable provider itself. Early reports about Intel's television service are drawing excitement and suggest that the platform has a large potential for success.

AMD ex-CEO and founder Jerry Sanders developed strategic partnerships during the late 1990s to improve AMD's presence in the PC market based on the success of the AMD K6 architecture. One major partnership announced in 1998 paired AMD with semiconductor giant Motorola.[1] In the announcement, Sanders referred to the partnership as creating a "virtual gorilla" that would enable AMD to compete with Intel on fabrication capacity while limiting AMD's financial outlay for new facilities. This partnership also helped to co-develop copper-based semiconductor technology, which would become a cornerstone of the K7 production process. In August 1999, AMD released the Athlon (K7) processor. Notably, the design team was led by Dirk Meyer, who had worked as a lead engineer on multiple Alpha microprocessors during his employment at DEC. Jerry Sanders had approached many of the engineering staff to work for AMD as DEC wound down their semiconductor business, and brought in a near-complete team of engineering experts. The balance of the Athlon design team comprised AMD K5 and K6 veterans. By working with Motorola, AMD was able to refine copper interconnect manufacturing to the production stage about one year before Intel. The revised process permitted 180-nanometer processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase Athlon clock speeds to the 1 GHz range.[2] Yields on the new process exceeded expectations, permitting AMD to deliver high speed chips in volume in March 2000.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366951536532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:45:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366951671200-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel platform worthy of being deemed a true cable-killer, large potential for success</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366951023379</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:37:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>damn they are gonna waste a lotta money on this. oh well ..they do make nice chips.</Msg><Username>everywhere41</Username><Timestamp>1366951671200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:47:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366952446360-10</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver, need your help</Title><Username>wallisdreamweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366937517811</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 20:51:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah wally is a zero content unhuman. truly the lowest form of life.</Msg><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366952446360</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 01:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366953118436-11</Id><Topic><Title>up days are over</Title><Username>philip_914</Username><Timestamp>1366931618130</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>qcom gave up the truth about margin pressuresssssss.</Msg><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366953118436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 01:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366954305763-12</Id><Topic><Title>up days are over</Title><Username>philip_914</Username><Timestamp>1366931618130</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>regarding margin pressure TSMC capex is projected i$9,5 billion - how does this compare to Intel? whose margins are pressured?</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366954305763</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 01:31:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366978532316-13</Id><Topic><Title>Mr Weaver and all of his personalities are on this board.

Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits. Intel's lead in fabrication and manufacturing is increasing in virtually every area.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366981195290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 08:59:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366981367891-16</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news just out, INTC back to $19</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1366946972619</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 23:29:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're the same guy that tried to hire soemone on yahoo to kill your wife because you lost so much money on Facebook.

According to an Intel official, Android notebooks powered by Intel processor will be available in retail stores in the near future, the cheapest device being priced at $200. The information clarifies the previous rumors regarding Android laptops which haven’t been confirmed until now, and the statement comes from the Intel chief product officer Dadi Perlmutter. The execute gave an interview to online publication Cnet, after the company’s CEO Paul Otellini made some remarks last week about PCs featuring touchscreens that will be available for purchase for approximately $200, but he did not mention what operating system will the devices be running. Now there is no room for further questions as we know that the devices will run Android OS. The main reason must be the fact that the operating system developed by Google is free to use by any OEM, unlike Windows * developed by Microsoft which has to be licensed by manufacturers. So, the Android computers will be powered by the Intel Atom CPU, and we expect the device to be actually tablets featuring a keyboard dock for the users to be able to convert them into laptops when they desire. Unfortunately, none of Intel’s current partners have confirmed the fact that they have such a project in development, thus there is no way to tell when the devices will appear on the market nor what specs they will come with. Even though Perlmutter has not provided an exact period when the Intel based notebooks will be launched, he said that it won’t be sooner than the end of 2013 or the beginning of 2014. Of course, this could mean anything and the release of the products could be further delayed. As far as I see it, nothing is set in stone and anything can happen considering that the Intel officials are rather vague in their statements. What’s more interesting is the fact that, even though the price tag for the devices will start at $200, there will also be more expensive tablets that will cost $399 and $499 meaning that</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366984238529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366984390620-42</Id><Title>Intel-Cisco Foundry Deal Confirmed</Title><Msg>seekingalphaDOTcom/article/1308611-intel-cisco-foundry-deal-confirmed worth $3 billion/yr</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366984390620</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366984439984-43</Id><Title>KLAC falls down ..</Title><Msg>says things are slow.</Msg><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366984439984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:53:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366984586286-44</Id><Title>shorts better cover NOW!!!</Title><Msg>$25 next week!!</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366984586286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:56:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366984682127-45</Id><Title>Someone bought big yesterday - check the volume</Title><Msg>Q1 was worst quarter...all upside from here</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366984682127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366984730202-46</Id><Topic><Title>KLAC falls down ..</Title><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366984439984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:53:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>people don't understand what "revenue recognition" means - they don't understand the difference between shipments and revenue as you can see LRCX/NVLS is UP - so moved some stuff from LRCX into KLAC</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366984730202</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:58:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366985121464-47</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Expected to Ramp Up Production of Haswell-Based Notebooks Next Month</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366950523378</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tim cook says 'exciting new product category' coming...I think it is a hybrid.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366985121464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:05:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366985227411-48</Id><Topic><Title>Someone bought big yesterday - check the volume</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366984682127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:58:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeahhh for every buyer there is a seller.....</Msg><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366985227411</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:07:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366985233564-49</Id><Topic><Title>Intel XOLO X500 (based on low-end Intel Lexington Z2420) scores similar to premium Samsung Galaxy, HTC One, and Sony Experia phones</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1365769812557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:30:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lexington is a surprise hit</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366985233564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366985355850-50</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Surface Pro: It's A Hit</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1365992683088</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 22:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>notice how MS did not even mention RT in conference call.

Any company, Intel or Amazon attempting to bypass the cable co's for live TV will face this. Even if the challenges weren't great enough with cable companies having huge marketing and regulatory advantage, there is another issue and that is the reliability (or lack of) of cable Internet service. Most people aren't aware because they don't monitor it but cable Internet service often drops several times throughout the day. Unlike the service reliability rules the FCC applies to basic telephone service there is no equivalent requirement for consumer broadband reliability. It's not a big deal for email when their net connection drops because that email will get delivered when the service returns but it is a big deal if someone is relying on their Internet connection to watch some important live news event. And no, if someone's Internet service drops it doesn't the entire cable service is out. The Internet service can drop while the cable provided HDTV and phone service continues to work fine. How many times will it take for someone who has switched their TV service entirely to Over The Top streaming to drop before they call up and say, "take this stuff out of my house". Even though the technology is identical, the business for Netflix style on-demand movies is very different from the business of delivering live TV and it's the latter that hardware vendors will find do difficult to succeed. Despite all the interviews with Eric Hugger about Intel's plan for Web TV, there is a good chance that business never launches as originally planned. The good news is that it won't make any difference to Intel's overall success.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1366985628744</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:13:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366985640833-53</Id><Title>Alex: Is this still explicable by your options theory?</Title><Msg>I think it looks like traders are selling, and not a bunch of MM's suckin' face with OMM's..

Wallace - Chief Executive Officer, President and Executive Director Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, our outlook for the industry CapEx investment in the year has moderated somewhat from our initial commentary in January, as our customers adopt a more measured outlook for new wafer capacity investment in the near term and prepare for the next node. We believe some of the major factors impacting the timing of equipment demand in the near term include uncertainty in the potential magnitude and breadth of participation among fabless customers for the 20-nanometer node, challenges associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures and a persistently weak global economy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edwin Mok - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division So just to follow up with that. For those developments today that you're saying those are targeting 20-nanometer, are they 14-nanometer and are they specifically for foundry? And I guess on your outlook for the year, are you not factoring in much 20-nanometer investment in the second half of this year? Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer, President and Executive Director No, not a lot of investment on the second half for 20, still some, but I would say a little broader participation. So maybe some of the players that haven't been as active in 20 already will participate, but we're modeling relatively modest on a compared basis. And toward the end of the year, more investment associated with maybe the later phases of 20 and some of the sub-20 work.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366986483393</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366986763472-58</Id><Topic><Title>KLAC falls down ..</Title><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366984439984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:53:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>da*n ...great info justfine...sounds like not a lot of support for tsmc 20nm</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1366986763472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:32:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366987240381-59</Id><Title>Large Mobile Customer may be AMAZON!</Title><Msg>Remember Sunit Rikhi, general manager of Intel's custom foundry business, told the news agency that the company was prepared to begin a new deal with a large, unidentified mobile customer?

But Dadi Perlmutter, Intel executive vice president and chief product officer, told CNET on Wednesday that notebooks priced at the $200 level will predominantly be Android products running on Intel's Atom mobile processor. Whether Windows 8 PCs hit that price largely depends on Microsoft, he said. "We have a good technology that enables a very cost-effective price point," Perlmutter said. The price of Windows 8 laptops "depends on how Microsoft prices Windows 8. It may be a slightly higher price point. cnetDOTcom/8301-1001_3-57581500-92/android-notebooks-yep-intel-says-and-theyll-only-cost-$200/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366988272154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:57:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366988420780-64</Id><Topic><Title>This should make both Apple and Microsoft jittery...</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366988272154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:57:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The beauty of being Intel is that people will never stop procreating and children will never stop getting old enough to buy phones and PC's.

Now CNET has a few more details about Intel’s vision for the future of cheap notebooks, and that vision includes Google Android. While it’s possible that we could see Windows 8 notebooks at similarly low prices, it’s likely that device makers will stick to Android or other platforms that have lower licensing costs. Microsoft charges PC makers a fee for every device they ship with Windows software. While there are patent fees and other charges associated with loading a notebook or tablet with Android software, Google makes its operating system available free of charge. So it’s not surprising that Android products tend to cost less than Windows devices. A few years ago PC makers took a similar approach toward cutting costs in netbook computers. Some of the first netbooks shipped with Linux-based software such as Xandros, Linpus Linux Light, and OpenSUSE. Microsoft responded by offering low-cost Windows XP (and later Windows 7 Starter) licenses, and for the past few years Linux-powered netbooks have been the exception, not the rule. But Android-powered notebooks (or convertible tablets) could be in a stronger position than Linux-powered netbooks. There are millions of Android phones and tablets already in the wild, which means that many potential customers are already familiar with the operating system. Android also arguably has a lower learning curve than Ubuntu or other desktop Linux operating systems, and there are hundreds of thousands of apps available for Android devices. While there’s definitely a group of folks who would prefer an Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora (or even ChromeOS) mini-laptop to one running Android, I’m not surprised to see Intel banking on Android for low-cost notebooks. It’s a trusted brand that’s already proven popular with consumers.

It is expected that Intel will make an announcement regarding Haswell chips at the IDF conference, due to take place next week in Beijing. Haswell, Intel’s most power efficient mainstream processor, was touted by CEO Paul Otellini as the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel history. A range of ultrabooks and tablet/laptop hybrids will be powered by the Haswell processor. According to the latest media note from Intel, the 4th generation Haswell core is on track for a mid-year launch. The Haswell processors retain a 22nm process similar to that of Ivy Bridge processors, though there’a new microarchitechture for improved performance.

For the 1st full quarter of Microsofts Windows 8 tablets, over 3 million units were sold. Analysts may not think that it's very impressive considering Apple tablets sold over 19 million units, but they thought it was huge for Apple to sell just over 4 million units in its first full quarter back in 2010. This could bode very well for Intel, since the majority of Windows 8 tablets run on Intel chips. And, the Surface tablet itself has only one third sold using the RT version. Which have been getting huge amounts of being returned back to stores. So for the very 1st quarter of release, Windows 8 tablets are not that much behind iPads tablet release during its 1st full quarter. For its debut quarter, Apple actually release around 3.47 million tablets. Usually a debut quarter is the most interesting for Apple since the diehard Apple fans would buy the product no matter what. Looks like Microsoft and Intel are off to a very good start in tablet sales.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366998434913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:47:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367000140662-94</Id><Topic><Title>iPad slows as Surface grows.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1366998434913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:47:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like the post PC era is as over-hyped like we thought.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1367000140662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367000382040-95</Id><Topic><Title>This stock is going to the MOON!</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1363965968442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just sold for a cool $21,113 profit, thanks for all of you help Jim.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1367000382040</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367000464545-96</Id><Topic><Title>This stock is going to the MOON!</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1363965968442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now is the time to short this stock.

It's official. Intel's fourth-generation core "Haswell" processor will arrive on June 3. Expect a crush of desktops, laptops, convertibles, detachables, and tablets to ensue. "In approximately 3,337,200,000,000,000 nanoseconds, Intel will reveal all there is to know about the highly anticipated 4th generation Intel Core processor family," Intel said in a statement Friday. That's June 3 in the U.S. and June 4 in Taiwan, where it will be rolled out at Computex. Haswell is mostly about better battery life and, to a lesser extent, about improved graphics performance. So, expect, for instance, Haswell laptops that last longer -- maybe a lot longer if other power-saving technologies are also used -- than today's latest and greatest offerings. The first Haswell processors out of the chute are expected to be the quad-core variety aimed at high-end laptops. But don't be surprised if more quad-core chips seep into mainstream 13-inch and 14-inch laptops too due to Haswell's improved power efficiency. At the other end of the spectrum will be a new variety of ultra-power-efficient Haswell chips that should allow PC makers -- and Apple if it so chooses -- to offer newfangled ultrathin designs with good performance. And, of course, touch will be a big factor because of Windows 8 -- with Windows 8.1 to follow in the second half. But it's not just a Windows world anymore. Intel told CNET that Android laptops are on the way. While many of them will tap Intel's Atom chip, new designs that run Google's Chrome OS -- like the Chrome Pixel -- will adopt Haswell.
