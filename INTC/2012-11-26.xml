I've been extremely positive on Intel's future in the mobile SoC business. Qualcomm's lead in modem technology is formidable, and it is on the border of fanaticism to suggest otherwise. Intel will improve here, while really bringing its CPU expertise to the SoC side of things. This has been my stance the whole time. Again, as someone who is regularly accused of being an Intel pumper, I find it interesting that I'm now being attacked as a basher. Which is it, folks?

According to him, the end of life as we know it is near after The President was reelected. There is NO talking sense to him or any of the other poor GOP tools. They live in an alternative reality--or should I say Non-reality. He tells me now that his media people were not stupid but just pushing the party line when they said Romney would win. He knew--says he now, that Romney would lose and he wants to buy a gun now for the impending riots to come. I am serious. This is what he says. These guys live out in the countryside and believe the trash the rightwing media spews. He brings up taxes went up and I correct him and tell him Obama cut his taxes. He knows I am correct but the fact that he said it means he and so so many on the right are out of their freaking minds with fear. But oh well. You know what you do to people and the market to slap it back to reality? You ignore them and smile and simply go long and make money. When these idiots but back in it will be the end, not the start of the Bull run. I bet we get Dow 20,0000 or more in 4 years. 25,000 is doable. Unemployment will be down to 5% or lower and America will be the number one oil producer in the world in 4 years. Healthcare will be liked by 70% or more of the population. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will be all over and our troops will be out. Huge savings for our nations there. The Dems will btch slap the GOP in the off year election and completely decimate the GOP in 2016 when another Dem gets elected Pres. Yet--talk radio and Fuxed up news will sit there spewing nonsense and 30% of the population will still believe it even though all facts show them that the propaganda is all lies. They want an America that never existed. The nation has always been screwed up and their ignorance makes them think otherwise. But it is way better now for most people than it used to be. KKK trashballs in the GOP base are getting old and will pass away in the next 20 years making the GOP republican south way of thinking useless. When Texas goes to the Dems in 8 years or 12 years at the longest, the GOP will be finished. I will be long in our markets for the next decade and I will cash in on the coming American boom. Intel--Phones wil be a winner for Intel and the media idiots are clueless.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1353944743991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:45:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353945380886-20</Id><Title>BUY THIS STOCK NOW!</Title><Msg>Get tru torch energy is low right now and you can make some money! buy buy buy!</Msg><Username>sjoe787</Username><Timestamp>1353945380886</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:56:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353945721334-21</Id><Topic><Title>The markets down because some of the rightwing dingbats believe the GOP talking point propaganda.</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1353944743991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:45:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have an old friend who is the same way.

The list of complaints by technically astute PC users is long.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1353952953616</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:02:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353953019962-38</Id><Topic><Title>LOWLY YAHOO SHARES POISED TO ECLIPSE INTEL SHARES</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1353942703805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How's it going today, F-wad?</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1353953019962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:03:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353953086285-39</Id><Topic><Title>Bought in at 20.71 last year average</Title><Username>getmeoutuhhere</Username><Timestamp>1353952558207</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 12:55:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Housing prices increasing for the RIGHT reasons By duhboysarebackintown.Aug 7, 2012 2:15 PM.Permalink .

Ltd. has held a groundbreaking ceremony for a fab module at its Fab 14 gigafab at the South Taiwan Science Park in Tainan, Taiwan. The phase-six module is expected to be TSMC's first fab to mass produce 16-nm FinFET circuits in 2014. Building of the sixth-phase module is being commenced only seven months after TSMC (Hsinchu, Taiwan) broke ground on phase-five. Building work for phase six of the Fab 14 gigafab is not due to start until 2013 as part of a $17 billion capacity expansion scheduled for the next five years, according to a Taipei Times report. "The factory will be the world's first 12-inch factory producing 20-nanometer system-on-chips and the first 16-nanometer FinFET chip manufacturing site for TSMC," the report quoted TSMC co-chief operating officer Chiang Shang-yi, as saying. Fab 14 phases 5 and 6 are expected to approximately double the manufacturing capacity of the first four phases by offering a total cleanroom area of 87,000 square meters – equivalent to more than 11 soccer fields and four times larger than a typical 300-mm fab.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1353956284193</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:58:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353956393101-45</Id><Topic><Title>LOWLY YAHOO SHARES POISED TO ECLIPSE INTEL SHARES</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1353942703805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do the world a favor and throw yourself in front of a bus.</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1353956393101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:59:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353956900152-46</Id><Topic><Title>LOWLY YAHOO SHARES POISED TO ECLIPSE INTEL SHARES</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1353942703805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for responding and, thereby, moving my message back to the top, nincompoop</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1353956900152</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 14:08:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353957036576-47</Id><Title>Sony, Dell Win Big with Windows 8 Sales (Intel Inside baby)</Title><Msg>Sony (NYSE: SNE ), Dell (NASDAQ: DELL ) and Acer appear to have had a successful Black Friday. The three companies sold a large number of Windows 8 PCs last week as consumers endured massive crowds and long lines on the biggest shopping day of the year. In conducting a retail survey, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry found that Acer and Sony produced the "hottest-selling Windows 8 notebooks." According to Chowdhry, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Stores had a "very strong promotion" on the Acer Aspire V5 notebook, which is powered by an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core i5 processor. He estimates that each Microsoft Store had about 500 units. "[They] were completely sold out within the first 30 minutes," Chowdhry wrote in a note to investors and reporters. During the promotional period, Microsoft sold the Aspire V5 for $399. Not to be outdone, some Microsoft Stores also sold out of a $1,500 touch-enabled Ultrabook from Sony. "Sony Vaio Touch Intel i7 was the fastest selling Windows 8 notebook in the high-end category," Chowdhry added. While this may be the year that the desktop PC died , Dell has not given up on the market. And it's a good thing, too -- if it had, it could not have built the fastest-selling all-in-one Windows 8 desktop. On Black Friday, Dell's XPS One 27 earned that crown. Chowdhry said that while he could not get any color on the number of units available, the converged view was that the "demand was too high" for Dell's $2,000 machine. Not every Windows 8 device performed well on Black Friday. Chowdhry estimated that Microsoft lost one in five sales on the Surface RT because of the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) chipset. "Had Microsoft first shipped Surface on Intel chips vs. on ARM chips, sales of Surface would have been 5X better than current levels," the analyst wrote. Regardless, Chowdhry found that Microsoft "had decent sales on Windows Surface RT." "We observed a lot of interest in Microsoft Surface, but interest was not necessarily leading to sales," he said. "We spoke to no less than 30 people, who showed the most interest in Microsoft Surface RT, but did not make the purchase. 'We are going to wait for the Pro version of the Surface, as that will run on Intel Chips,' was the unanimous view we got."</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1353957036576</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 14:10:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353957313416-48</Id><Topic><Title>LOWLY YAHOO SHARES POISED TO ECLIPSE INTEL SHARES</Title><Username>lucy_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1353942703805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are an a^h^o^l^, sir, with all do respect.</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1353957313416</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 14:15:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353958042893-49</Id><Title>It is over for shorty.

Without the optional DVD player which is a second device that physically attaches to the main unit, it only stands about a half inch tall when laid on its side. The photos often show this unit standing on its edge in the included stand. On its edge or side it is tiny and very cool. Believe it has VESA mounts to mount behind most monitors and can turn a monitor into an All-In-One PC. Also adds smart-TV capability to HD sets that don't have it. There are also many uses for home and small business as a standalone Windows or Linux server.

Ivy Bridge is already in tablets, but battery life is not as good as something like Clover Trail. Haswell has a lot of delicious power gating/saving techniques that will make tablets a LOT more viable with the 10W version of the chip, but I think at 14nm is where we see an iPad-style tablet with a "Core" chip. Basically, the "Atom" line becomes the "Celeron" of tablets.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1353974919133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:08:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353975314048-84</Id><Topic><Title>A question regarding Ashraf's SA article about baytrail tablet chips this afternoon.</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1353974579529</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:02:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.

"As part of this deal, Berkshire Hathaway will earn 10.5 percent lending money to Media General. This is about the dividend amount Buffett earned from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) when he bought $5 billion worth of preferred stock back in 2008 at the nadir of The Great Recession." "Small city and small town newspaper offer strong classified advertising incomes, both print and digital. In addition, the Internet will never replace the local newspaper for community news. By buying so many newspapers, Buffett can affect a roll-up type strategy. This will reduce costs through buying power. Expenses will be reduced through synergy.

By having the voltage regulator on the CPU, the Haswell microcode or the OS software can lower the voltage or shut down large section of the CPU (extra cores) .

LT cap gains will require 2-3 year holding (and still likely go up to 20/23.8%) and require 5 years to get to current levels. Dividends will not see the increases being feared. It is basic political analysis. Large swaths of the US population currently or will soon depend upon dividends for income. In contrast, financial speculators are widely disliked and an easy target. Besides, what the Fed and Admin are really trying to do is encourage ownership of productive assets (those that actually produce income streams and not simply revenue streams...).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353988991731</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 23:03:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353990543102-119</Id><Title>ARM is junk</Title><Msg>Microsoft Surface is generating a lot of interest, "but interest was not necessarily leading to sales," Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a note Monday.

I don't think we will see any of those on sale after 2013. All new laptops will either have touch capabilities or be convertibles. I think this will spur a major PC refresh starting in 2013. Here is a partial listing of convertibles we have right now: Clover Trail: ----------------- Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2 Samsung Ativ Smart PC Dell Latitude 10 HP Envy X2 Acer Iconia W510 Samsung ATIV 500T Lenovo IdeaTab Lynx Samsung Series 5 Ultra Convertible (folds back like Lenovo Yoga) Ivy Bridge: ------------- Microsoft Surface Pro Samsung ATIV 700T Lenovo Yoga 13 Acer Aspire S7 (wish it folds back like the Lenovo Yoga) Acer Iconia W700 Asus transformer book Asus Taichi Lenovo Thinkpad Twist Dell XPS 12 Convertible Fujitsu Lifebook U772 HP Envy TouchSmart Sony VAIO Duo 11 Convertible Toshiba Satellite U925 Ultrabook Haswell will be out first half of 2013 and ramping to 20% of Intel's sales by mid 2013...imagine how many convertibles will be out by then. The battery life, size and form factor using Haswell should be amazing. I think we will see a glimpse of them at CES 2013. Broadwell and Bay Trail out beginning of 2014. BTW, Z2580 for smartphones beginning of 2013 and another 22nm chip by mid 2013. Intel should be very competitive in smartphone market as well.</Msg><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1353991729068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 23:48:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
