Apple stores are starting to get complaints that the shiny toys are fast becoming scratched and scuffed and in the few days since they were sold are starting to look rubbish. However according to an email to a 9to5Mac reader by Senior Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller, Apple had no intention of fixing the problem. He said that any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver colour. That is normal, he said. In other words fanboys are idiots for buying phones made of the stuff it is not Apple's fault they did not think the shiny metal body thing through. Apparently the black iPhone 5?s back tends to scratch much easier than its glass-backed iPhone 4/4S predecessors. However, the aluminum back obviously stands up to drops much better than glass. Apple thinks that scratches are less important than actually breaking, which is a good point. Anyway the phones are designed to be obsolete in a year so how scratched can you get a phone in a year?

CloverView is pretty good, it has A6 cpu (multithreaded) performance and A5 gpu performance and battery life. Will make the WindowsRT Surface Tegra 3 model totally redundant as it will beat it in cpu, gpu, endurance and software compatibility. ------ I'm not convinced, from the reg: "The Z2760 has made an appearance in Passmark Software's CPU benchmark database, scoring 705 points. That puts it on a par with the netbook-oriented Atom N2800 (709 points) and a 2.66GHz Pentium 5 (705). Desktop Atoms beat it by a fair margin: the 2.13GHz Atom D2700 scores 833, for example." If we look at N2800 over at geekbench we get scores ranging from 800 - 1800, while the Transformer Prime (Tegra 3) 1300-2000 (depending on the clock). Memory bandwidth and Integer performance win it for Atom (depending what score you use), but floating point is all ARM. As for consumer apps being integer based, I largely agree but I think you would be surprised at how much floating point is used these days. As for GPU performance, lets see. Medfield's performance on paper should be much better than it actually is (driver issues? Bandwidth?), and the same issue(s) could haunt Clover Trail. Benchmarks aside, ARM's windows performance is all about how good (or bad) MS's compiler is...</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1348829587481</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 06:53:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348833141772-9</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>Yesterday's rally again showed the market's addiction to QEs, regardless whether it is real QE action or simply talks or rumors.

One of the greatest benefits of Intel's investment in advance fabs and processor shrink roadmap - is lower cost and higher gross margins for its products. Intel is in an enviable position to make the most advanced CPUs and SoCs while having a cost advantage over competitors.

SImple is fine. I have no problems with simple unless oversimplification is used to make a point that is more complex than it appears. There is always the larger story behind the simple headline. Many reporters are lazy and I do not 100% trust the information presented. Simplicity makes it easier to make unwarranted leaps in logic to make unsupported points. "att4glte" posted an oversimplified political insult on a finance board. I wanted to add some additional information and transparency on the subject. We could have a longer and spirited discussion about what comprises a "significant group" but I agree with you that I gamble in the stock market (Intel by investing in their stock). I am addicted to coffee, tea and Diet Coke. Not too much of the illegal stuff anymore. If your point is "the bottom quintile" is comprised of the dysfunctionals you describe, then I would disagree with you. That argument will not be resolved on this board. I did not add complexity. I think I added facts and added color to a colorless statement. I also do not yet own a smartphone and go the desktop/laptop route. Someone gave me a tablet they did not want too. I don't use it much. I bought a 15" Sandy Bridge laptop from Dell Outlet Tuesday .....with the DELL coupon, the scratch and dent system was $254 plus tax. I do not consider your statements old fashion and I don't think I said that. It becomes clear that any additional burden on this lowest group would simply widen the gap between what that have and what others are paying. I wrote the message part down to the phrase "2011 Quintiles of income before taxes" and the rest was copy/paste from the BLS site so the words at the bottom come from that page (thanks to Yahoo's anti-spam policy). I agree with you 100% on Intel.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1348842080930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:21:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348842393487-18</Id><Title>Intel: Turning Around And Catching Up With The Atom Z2760</Title><Msg>[Gee, more things Wall Street doesn't know and won't recognize...] Intel (INTC) opened higher on Thursday, then pulled back to the intra-day low of $22.65 before heading higher thorough out the day and closing at $23.08 for a 1.94% gain. The volume of 43.88M shares is very close to the 30 day average volume of 43.99M. Since the lowering of sales guidance on Sep 7, 2012, INTC's share price had been falling, and was trying to stabilize in the past 2 weeks. With a $0.44 gain today in addition to $0.11 for yesterday, INTC finally had two days of advancing. The advancing today is mainly due to the news release of the first chip of its Clover Trail family, the 1.8GHz due-core Atom Z2760, which is particularly manufactured for tablets and hybrid devices running Windows Phone 8 from Microsoft (MSFT). Two major reasons for INTC's sharp decline from the May 2, 2012 high of $29.18 were the slowing down of PC demand and the concern for INTC's inability to catch up in the mobile market. With the introduction of the first wave of new tablets and tablet convertible designs based on Intel Core vPro, Intel Core, and Intel Atom processors, including the new Atom processor Z2760 (formerly codenamed "Clover Trail"), it will be the beginning of Intel's effort in the tablet market, as stated by Erik Reid, general manager of Application Processor Platforms for Intel's Mobile and Communications Group, whose goal is to deliver products that fit the spectrum of evolving needs of both consumers and business users without compromising on compatibility, experience or battery life. Before this, INTC's processors were not able to handle the limited battery life of mobile devices effectively; however, as the mobile trend continues, INTC needs to adapt fast. Although there are still concerns about the success of Windows Phone 8 and Intel's support for Android &amp; Linux, as written by Steven J. Vaughan-Nicholas from ZDNet, Z2760 and the upcoming Atom SoCs should give INTC investors a reason to cheer on. The list of Intel Atom SoCs is attached below Source: Wikipedia INTC's position into mobile platform might not be perfect yet, but with INTC's past history and solid fundamentals, the risk and reward ratio will not justify betting against INTC in the long term based on INTC's current low PE of 9.78 and strong free cash flow of 2.077B with 20.94% profit margin (as of June 30, 2012). In the short-term, MACD (12, 26) is turning bullish with past two days of gain, as seen below. The MACD indicator is more useful for trending stock with less erratic price action and it had been a consistent, less faulty indicator for INTC.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348842393487</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:26:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348842653618-19</Id><Title>Intel CEO meets Acer executives to discuss smartphone business</Title><Msg>[Oh, no - yet more smartphone developments that Wall Street hasn't reflected in Intel's stock price...] Intel CEO Paul Otellini recently had a meeting with Acer's executives in Taiwan, discussing the smartphone business and has also introduced some telecom carriers to Acer as a foundation for future cooperation, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.

While Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) shares dipped nearly 9% since the company reduced guidance earlier this month, this has pushed the dividend yield to 4% and given investors an even more attractive entry point for this solid core holding. Not only does Intel continue to be one of the most skilled companies at managing its public face, its growth prospects are improving heading into the new year. The company is scheduled to release earnings in mid-October, and I believe buying shares ahead of this announcement will prove solid in both the near and longer-terms. Public Relations For nearly as long as the company has been reporting earnings, Intel has been successfully controlling the flow of information about what its numbers will look like. Time and again, the company will lower guidance a month or so before earnings, only to report an actual number that is superior to the lowered expectation. As familiar as the news cycle has been the trading activity of the stock based on this pattern – the stock is mildly punished on the lower guidance and then more than covers the loss when the earnings “beat” is announced. Despite the regular repeat of these events, the market seems to never learn. Along these same lines of press management – in my opinion – is the story that was leaked earlier this week with Intel “bashing” Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). According to the report, Intel’s CEO said that Windows 8 was not really complete and was plagued with bugs, but that releasing the OS on time was the right call. Starting with the statement itself, an ultimate conclusion that Microsoft is making the right call is not really a bash. What it does do effectively is place just enough distance between itself and its long-time partner to allow Intel to avoid any direct criticism if Windows 8 has problems. It is not uncommon for software to be released and then rapidly upgraded with easily downloaded patches after the fact. From the PR standpoint, a quick update will be better received than a delivery date miss. All the comment really does is give Intel a little wiggle room when Windows 8 debuts to continue to manage its own press – something it is clearly very talented at doing. The Way Forward Putting aside the earnings expectation game, Intel has a number of positives that should appeal to investors moving forward. While the company has yet to roll out its own 4G LTE chip, Intel chips are being included in both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) devices being sold in Europe. The company is expected to complete development of its offering by the end of the year, giving it the ability to compete more seriously in the U.S. market. As mobile – specifically smartphones and tablets – continue to be the growth focus in computing, a solid entry into this market is vital. Of potentially equal importance is the role the company will play in the series of devices that will be introduced in conjunction with the release of Windows 8. Microsoft is set to release its own tablet – named the Surface – that may serve as the first crossover between the PC and the tablet. What is expected to set the Surface apart is its ability to run a near-full version of Microsoft Office. Where Apple’s iPad and Google’s Nexus 7 are primarily used for consumption – reading books, watching video and shopping – the Surface may be the first tablet that consumers can use as a true replacement for their notebooks and desktop PCs. Beyond Microsoft, many of the top PC-makers have already announced notebook-tablet hybrid designs. The bulk of these are expected to be powered by Intel chips. If these devices are well accepted as I expect, this could begin another massive shift in the computer market – again with Microsoft and Intel playing staring rolls. The change may be subtle at first, but the real demands of the business community will likely be served by more productive tablets, giving Intel a real opportunity. The Trade Based on the company’s track record of managing earnings expectations and solid growth potential in multiple areas, the stock is a buy ahead of earnings in mid-October. The shift in the PC world has created real concern for Intel shareholders, but this may be an opportunity for anyone wishing to establish or add to an existing position. With the added kicker of a 4% dividend yield for income generation, the stock should be in your core portfolio.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1348850315309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 12:38:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348850568261-37</Id><Title>one day up, ten days down</Title><Msg>this dog couldn't hold the gain, i told you so!</Msg><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1348850568261</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 12:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348852376075-38</Id><Topic><Title>This Is Gonna Be Fun</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1336573582000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-05-09 10:26:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really enjoyed plowing through 27, 28 and 29.

We will use data from Yahoo Finance and some forth grade arithmetic to demonstrate how silly this is. While we can't know the exact gross margins a any particular device, a company's overall gross margin will serve as a close approximation for the individual device margins. Let's use a mobile chip that sells for $10 to make the arithmetic easy. for the first supplier we will use Qualcomm (QCOM). QCOM has corporate gross margins of 67%. since a good size chunk of QCOM's business is cost-free revenue from patent royalties, we will reduce this 67% to 60%. Fair? Ok, QCOM will pay their wafer supplier, TSMC (TSM) 40% of the $10 or $4 for that chip. TSMC, in turn, has corporate gross margins of 45%, so that chip that they charge QCOM $4 for has a manufacturing cost of $2.20. That $10 chip has a total gross margin from manufacturing to the end user circuit board of 78%! Let's compare that to the same size device supplied by Intel. Since Intel is thought to be a higher cost manufacturer (I don't think this is true, but we'll throw the Myth Believers a bone), we will use an Intel manufacturing cost of $3. Intel likes to get 65% gross margins, so if we divide by .35 we will get the Intel full margin price to the end customer of $3/.35 = $8.57. Now, let's assume that Intel is not the high cost producer and that their cost is also $2.20. In this case a full 65% margin final price from Intel for that $10 part would be $6.28! Of course, the best technology available to QCOM would be the TSMC 28/32nm node. Let's assume that the Intel version of our fictitious chip is built on their 22nm process. That would make the chip 40% smaller that the 28nm chip. It would also be 40% cheaper, so that would give us an Intel cost of $1.32. Plugging the 65% gross margin onto this cost would give an end customer a price of 3.77. Just to bore you further, consider this chip built on Intel's 14nm process. The cost drops to $.55, the end price drops to $1.57. This is how we get to a $100 smartphone cost and a $200 retail price to you and me. So, the myth is not only false, but the cost and competitive advantage that Intel has over the competition is so overwhelming and smothering that for suppliers like Qualcomm and Nvidia (NVDA), even selling at cost doesn't do any good! Oh, and the mobile SoC in not a low margin business. Does this give us an idea why Apple (AAPL) has decided to design their own SoC and deal directly with the semiconductor manufacturer? Texas Instruments (TXN) has figured all this out early and decided to exit the mobile SoC business.</Msg><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1348871122904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:25:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348877696525-64</Id><Title>so simple</Title><Msg>Lost all the gains from yesterday because it is a junk, no power to go up and hold.</Msg><Username>teaandtea</Username><Timestamp>1348877696525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 20:14:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348878774508-65</Id><Topic><Title>Intel - debunking a myth</Title><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1348871122904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:25:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Translation: The rest of the players are FOOKED when Intel starts shipping 14nm chips in BULK.

Earnings? What earnings? Earnings will be a disaster, maybe worse. The PC is dead folks, AND SO ARE THE CHIPS THAT GO INTO THEM along with the investors who invest in them. Did any of you ever hear of the buggy whip story? What happened to buggy whips when the car came into mass production? Do any of you remember 8-track tape cassettes? Oh, how about the hola hoop? That's what INTC chips are now kiddies, hula hoops and buggy whips. You don't have to sell, but after earnings [think Beethoven's 5th] you will be looking like Romney after election day.I warned ya.</Msg><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348890513719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348890834976-72</Id><Topic><Title>wholesale dumpage</Title><Username>sharppolly</Username><Timestamp>1348863312513</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:15:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your July 18th advice was right on target.
