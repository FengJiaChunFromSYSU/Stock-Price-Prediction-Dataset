Your argument changes each time. Opinion sound bite after opinion sound bite. They are fine as your opinion. If you feel your understanding is sufficient to make your decision, then go for it. Do not confuse your opinion as "fact". Your logic should not persuade anyone but those who already agree with you will be fine. Argument #1: Obama failed us. Obama is not for us. You must not be part of the 47% that is leaching off the government. You are getting less benefit than you expect to lose from a Romney administration. No Social Security, medicare, or in need of any other government programs like that. Argument #2: Obama lies. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party and the religious extremists supporting them have become the greatest source of material for world comedy. Full employment for comedy. Now... Argument #3: low opinion about leadership. "For me obama is like carter. i had very low opinion about carter and i have even lower opinion about obama. I am talking about leadership." The truth is probably that you "HATE OBAMA" and will do anything to get him out of office. That is just my opinion. If I were someone who hated the President, publicly committed to make him a one term President and I was in some position of authority would I chose to compromise with him (give him a success?) or would I chose to trip him up at every opportunity? House Speaker John Boehner House Majority Leader Eric Cantor House Committee Chairmen Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Any Senator who can put a secret hold Record number of Obama appointee nominations for executive and judicial positions put on secret hold. How much damage or good has been accomplished by these holds? These American leaders of the House and Senate have damaged America in order to execute their hate. You are just a puppet of theirs.</Msg><Username>dumpwad</Username><Timestamp>1349592800522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 02:53:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349601005045-5</Id><Topic><Title>Futures up HUGE!

You only pay taxes on the profits and the losses can be written off against the gains. Its not like they would be taking 99.99% of the money like you make it sound like. QE is going to make Intel look good for a long time at these lower prices. I see more upside than downside thanks to the endless easing and the nice dividend that pays 5 times what my bank account pays. And that's not even including how underestimated and undervalued Intel is.

A: 1979...Jimmy Carter's last year as President. Debt ratio is the only rational way to metric the debt, and it is simply = Debt/GDP. The Debt ratio decreased monotonically from 1.3 at end of WW-II to 0.4 in 1979; Ronald Reagan then proceded to triple the national debt, and in the process he doubled the Debt Ratio up to 0.8. Bush I and Clinton got it back down to 0.6. Bush II during his term of office drove it back up to 0.8 with 2 wars and tax cuts. W also drove us off a cliff, and today, to avoid a massive collapse of GDP, Obama has had to run deficits, so the Debt Ratio now stands at 1.0 . Today the Debt is about 60% external (China, UK, Germany, Japan and a lot of funds, colleges, widows and orphans) and 40% "internal" (social security...if you were the SS trust fund you would hold US gov't bonds too). Many economists argue that it is the external debt that matters. The "External debt ratio" is only 0.6 today, compared to 1.3 after WW-II and about 0.3 in 1979 and 0.65 after Reagan. For comparison, Japan has a Debt Ratio of about 2.5 - 3.0, and most European nations have external debt ratios of 0.8 - 1.0. So Republicans, quit proclaiming Ronald Reagan as your great messiah and instead put Jimmy Carter up on Mount Rushmore.</Msg><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1349612815716</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 08:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349613396385-8</Id><Topic><Title>Watch Google + INTC</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1349580600339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 23:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They will own both markets, AND lots and lots of things you and I haven't even thought of.

It is basically a talk by Morris Chang, CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) about the changing competitive environment facing TSMC. He speaks of Samsung (SSNLF.PK), Global Foundries, and Intel (INTC) as new and powerful rivals in the foundry business. At one point Mr. Chang openly encourages TSMC customers to diversify their foundry sources: Samsung and Global Foundries are newcomers in the industry, Chang said, and suggested that TSMC's customers should diversify their foundry sources rather than rely on TSMC only. Mr. Chang's language gets even more grim when he speaks of Intel: "All of our customers rely on TSMC in foundry production, and Intel relies on its own foundry plants," he said. "If our technologies are not improved enough and Intel keeps improving its technologies, our customers' products will lose competitiveness to those of Intel. It's horrible to imagine the outcome." This is such an unusual thing for a CEO to say that I re-read the article periodically to make sure I didn't imagine the "horrible" part. What could the "horrible" be? Here's what I think it could be: TSMC has never faced Intel in a directly competitive environment before. In the past, TSMC being a node behind Intel really didn't matter because it didn't build x86 processors. Now being a node or more behind and having Intel breathing down your customers' necks is a major concern. TSMC made 28nm capacity decisions back in the middle of the great recession. It underestimated the demand and has been struggling with the repercussions of those decisions ever since. In order to have sufficient 28nm capacity to comfortably service leading-edge customers, TSMC needs to spend an immediate $5 billion on additional capacity. That is $5 billion the company doesn't have. If it had the money and wrote the checks today, it would be two years before the new capacity would produce the first wafer. By that time Intel, executing its tick-tock strategy, will be in mass production on 14nm products and TSMC could be 2 nodes plus Trigate behind. That would be an untenable position for TSMC and its customers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA). Intel's chips would be 1/4 the size, 1/3 the cost, and higher performance and lower power than anything TSMC could produce. What faces TSMC is an aroused Intel on the verge of introducing a mobile application processor with embedded LTE. Samsung and Global Foundries are also major challenges. Since there is no way for TSMC to leapfrog to a competitive position with Intel, I would not be surprised to see TSMC "throw in the towel" on the bleeding edge of fab technology and concede the sub 28nm mobile business to Intel. I think this is one of the outcomes that Morris Chang speaks of as "horrible to imagine." Maybe there are others. I can't think of a happy outcome for TSMC. Who wins and loses? Intel is the obvious winner and will double its market share of the semiconductor industry in three years or less. Nvidia is a major loser. Qualcomm will lose a great deal of business and be a shadow of the company it is today. ARM (ARMH) only gets a substantial nick financially, but the stock P/E could get cut in half or more.

Justin Rattner was talking all about radios, so you can see what is on Intel’s mind for the mid-term future. Three main topics were presented at the keynote, digital silicon radios, wi-fi docking, and centralized LTE base station computation. Of the three, the first was very interesting, the latter two seemed more of a sales pitch than a technological advance. That said, the change of pace was certainly refreshing. Intel has been talking about digital radios for a long time, it is the holy grail of current silicon development. Doing analog radios in silicon is not a real trick and hasn’t been for years. If you have a cell phone, you probably have half a dozen analog radios in your pocket. What concerns Intel is doing a radio digitally. The solution according to Intel Intel is so keen on digital radios because the mainstay of their business in shrinking transistors every couple of years. This leads to higher performance, lower costs, and more bang for the buck, watt, and nearly every other metric. Intel has a clear lead over the entire industry here, so doing radios in silicon is very attractive. One minor problem is that radios now use large amounts of analog circuits, not digital. Mixing analog and digital circuits on a chip, while quite possible, can be problematic to do. This headache is by no means a showstopper, but it involves another set of compromises that would be vastly more efficient to avoid where possible. More important is the major problem, analog circuits don’t really scale down in size. In fact, shrinking an analog circuit can often lead to lower performance, lower tolerances, and more fabrication headaches than making it larger. If an analog circuit took the same die area as X transistors, a shrink will mean the same functionality now takes 2X transistors worth of area. This is seriously diminishing returns for the maker. The entire industry is very keen on making a completely digital radio. Some parts will have to remain analog, but this theoretical minimum is a very tantalizing goal for many reasons. There has been a lot of talk, but no one has demonstrated one publicly yet. At the third keynote, Intel did just that, they showed a fully digital Wi-Fi radio that looks like this. The chip that powers it all is called Rosepoint, a dual core Atom with a fully digital Wi-Fi radio. Intel has identified four major parts to be converted from analog to digital, the Sigma Delta ADC, Digital Frequency Synthesizer, Digital RF Power Amplifier, and Digital Phase Modulator. The Flux Capacitor will have to remain analog until 2015. Now that the problem is solved, or at least a solution demonstrated, Intel plans to roll out the four major chunks one at a time as they become technically and financially viable. During the Q&amp;A session following the keynote, Rattner said that the radios were roughly comparable in area and performance to current analog devices, but they were far from optimized. Rosepoint is a technical demonstration, not a product, so we have no doubt it will be implemented far more efficiently in the future. The current parts are 32nm, and if they line up favorably against analog components now, 22nm and 14nm digital radios should have a serious cost advantage over analog. More important than the sheer cost and die area is flexibility. If you think about it, analog radios have a limited range of frequencies that they can address. A digital radio should be able to provide far greater ranges, possibly even doing multiple frequencies at once. In theory they would not only be smaller but you could potentially have one digital radio instead of a half-dozen analog devices. Hopefully it will all pan out, the promise is quite enticing. In the end, the radio keynote was amazingly good. Silicon was mentioned, actual tech was discussed, and the advantage Intel has over everyone was made clear.

Intel unveiled the technology during the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) held in San Francisco this week where, 10 years ago, Pat Gelsinger – the recently appointed CEO of VMware – put the company on the path towards a "radio free Intel", pledging to create the technology to get radio into all devices as standard and without extra charge. “This was a dream… no, it was a fantasy, a fantasy comes become a dream is even realistic,” said Justin Rattner, chief technology officer (CTO) at Intel. “The mobile wireless group were particularly unhappy with his speech, they wanted to make radios and charge!” The reason Gelsinger’s vision was so unthinkable at the time was that radio technology had only worked as an analogue process. This means that while chips were continuing to get smaller thanks to the move to digital, radio could not scale at the same rate and was taking up more and more of the silicon as processor sizes diminished. The breakthrough by Intel Labs now means radio transceivers – used so devices can access Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G connections and so on – can use digital filtering and frequency synthesisers. This enables them to shrink substantially, compared to the analogue equivalent and fit onto the 32nm chips, (the size first used in Intel’s core i3 and i5 processors released in 2010). Intel has incorporated this breakthrough into a system-on-chip (SoC) codenamed Rosepoint, which features two Intel Atom core processors and a Wi-Fi transceiver on the same die. “We went back to the books and it required some very creative mathematics,” said Yorgos Palaskas, research leader for the radio integration lab at Intel. “Now we will look to take this radio to productisation.” It is not clear when these chips will feature in hardware. With Intel planning to move to 14nm technology by the end of 2013, Palaskas and his team are going to have a lot of work to do to shrink the radio transceivers even further. But, for now, Rattner is happy to say to his old colleague Gelsinger: “We have achieved our 10 year quest for radio free Intel, just with less of the free.” From Computer Weekly</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349636412220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 15:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349636462579-52</Id><Topic><Title>Intel makes breakthrough on digital radio chips</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349636412220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 15:00:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's how much Wall Street has included in Intel's stock price for the breakthrough in digital radio: Zero.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349636462579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 15:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349636835739-53</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's A6 processor is good for Intel</Title><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1349481319567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:55:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The benchmark scores you quote are true if you were comparing arm to arm chips.

The chip company's researchers believe that as time goes on, every device from the smallest phone up to the largest supercomputer will have to take on advanced wireless capabilities to help transfer data. The Rose Point SoC packs a digital transceiver and two Atom chips onto the same die. Image: Jack Clark On Thursday at the closing keynote of the Intel Developer Forum, chief technology officer Justin Rattner showed off some of the technologies the chipmaker is developing to get to this point. In a wide-ranging speech, Rattner showed prototypes that went all the way from the transistor up through the middle of the stack and finally to technologies for the radio access network. "From the simplest embedded sensor to the most sophisticated high-end supercomputer, I think all of them will [eventually] connect one way or another wirelessly," Rattner said. Intel demonstrated an all-digital radio transceiver — something that Intel researchers themselves had thought 10 years ago was nigh-on impossible to build — along with technologies for biometric authentication, faster wireless data transfer, smart NICs and software base stations. The Impossible Digital Radio The 'Moore's Law Radio' caps off a 10-year mission by the chip company to digitise radio. It uses an experimental 32nm 'Rose Point' system-on-a-chip (SoC) that incorporates a Wi-Fi transceiver and two Intel Atom cores onto the same die, which will let the chip company dramatically reduce the transistor footprint of radio technologies, while improving their performance. "We believe these radios will out-perform the best of analogue radios," Rattner told ZDNet on Thursday, noting that digital technologies allow the radio to constantly calibrate and deal with the interference environment. Furthermore, by digitising the majority of the radio's components, Intel will be able to take advantage of improvements in chip fabrication technology to shrink the footprint of radios on chips, saving power and allowing for greater miniaturisation. "The trouble with analogue is that it doesn't scale with the [CMOS fabrication] technology," Rattner said. "It actually gets worse as the transistors get smaller." Taken together, Intel's technology means that radios can cost less and go into a wider array of devices, playing into the chip company's strategy of bringing powerful wireless communication technologies to everything from tiny sensors to huge supercomputers. As is typical with Intel Labs presentations, Rose Point was a prototype, and Intel did not give a timeframe for when it hopes to commercialise the technology. WiGig at 5Gbps In a related scheme, Rattner invited Ali Sadri, the president of the WiGig alliance and director of Intel's mmWave Technology, to demonstrate a next-generation wireless data transfer standard that can shift data at 5Gbps. After a couple of demo headaches, Sadri showed a 1080p video being streamed from a HDD, via an ultrabook, onto a monitor. "We've always had the vision we needed to develop a very high throughput wireless technology," he said. The WiGig technology will hopefully get certification in mid-2013, and after that devices should appear on the market that support it, Sadri said. Smart Connect takes another step The company also showed off its Smart Connect technology, which lets idle devices sync with cloud services while keeping power consumption low. The 'Spring Meadow' prototype uses advanced traffic analysis tools to make the network-interface card filter data and reduce the load upon the processor, thereby saving power. With Spring Meadow, Intel is able to save about halve the compute power compared to current Intel chips. The company thinks the technology could eventually go into mobile processors. Biometrics get an upgrade Along with Smart Connect, the company showed off a biometric authentication technology that authenticates a user with their local device and then on their cloud service provider to let people do away with passwords. The 'PalmSecure' technology works by recognising the unique patterns in the veins of peoples' palms. Once it authenticates the person on their local device it can send a message to a service provider via SAML or Open ID or another standard (Intel is still working out this part). This authenticates the person with their service provider, such as a bank, and logs them in, all with the swipe of a palm. No biometric information is sent from the device. In an onstage demo, attendees saw the system work by an Intel Labs employer holding their palm up to it. The system logged them in within a couple of seconds. C-RAN: Turning base station kit into software Finally, Intel demonstrated a prototype server for cutting the hardware cost of cellular base stations by swapping proprietary equipment for standard servers. Read this Eye-controlled arcade games move closer Read more The Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) initiative lets Intel move "the heart of the radio access network to the cloud", Rattner said. C-RAN is being co-developed with China Mobile. Intel demonstrated two SuperMicro servers running multiple base station software elements. In the future, Intel and China Mobile hope to use undisclosed virtualisation methods to support up to 100 base stations in a single server. However, when asked by a journalist from Computer Weekly whether Intel had been in talks with European telecommunications hardware suppliers about the technology, Rattner indicated it had had a frosty reception. "Since you're turning radio access networks from what was largely a hardware business into what will be a software business, you can understand why they're relatively cool about it," Rattner said. "System suppliers have been relatively cool." Towards a data-intensive future Considering the keynote, it becomes clear that Intel is preparing to deliver technologies to support a future where everything is using more data. From the digital radio initiative, up through the Smart Connect and into the cloudification of base stations, Intel is betting that digital and software-based methods will supersede traditional analogue and hardware-based approaches for dealing with the expected flood of information. The technologies also represent a strategic shift by Intel up from pure silicon and into other, related technologies. The message to take away is that though the processor is the lodestone of any modern piece of technology, the I/O layer is now receiving a huge level of investment as well. "It used to be we'd come out and all we'd talk about was the silicon," Rattner said. "As we moved along we talked more and more about platforms and I think today, yesterday and the day before you've come to appreciate the focus we have on creating great experiences across the entire compute continuum. I'm sure we'll enjoy the ride into the future together."

[Meanwhile, ARM still hasn't cracked the problems that will allow them to make 20nm chips...] The chip company's Ivy Bridge and Haswell chips are due to be built on its 22nm tri-gate process. After that, the company will move to 14nm and is expecting to start making chips with that process in late 2013 or early 2014. On Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum, the company revealed that it thinks it knows how to build to 10nm as well. Intel is exploring a spread of technologies for manufacturing new chips. Image: Jack Clark The process a chip is made to dictates the density with which transistors can be packed together and the efficiency with which they use power, so new manufacturing methods at finer detail levels allow for better chips. "The 14nm technology is in full development mode now and on track for full production readiness at the end of next year," Mark Bohr, director of process architecture and integration for Intel's technology manufacturing group, said. "Right now I'm spending my time personally on 10nm pathfinding and it looks like we have a solution there." The 10nm solution may rely on a number of experimental technologies (pictured) potentially based around photonics, graphene, materials synthesis, dense memory, nanowires, extreme ultra violet lithography (EUV) and updated tri-gate transistors, Bohr said. When it comes to how the 10nm chips will be manufactured, Intel has an immersion lithography method that works, though it would prefer to use EUV. "I'd like to have EUV for 10, but I can't bet that it would be ready in time," Bohr said, hinting at the difficulties in using this method. EUV has much higher costs than immersion lithography. Intel's research group are also exploring technologies for 7nm and 5nm solutions, though these are a very long way off as 10nm is not expected to go into production qualification until 2015. Bohr capped off his talk by noting that Intel, unlike chip rivals AMD and ARM, owns and operates its manufacturing facilities. "Yes, [process development] requires huge investments, but it also provides huge economic advantages," he said. ARM licenses its chips and they are predominantly made in foundries operated by Samsung, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and GlobalFoundries. AMD uses GlobalFoundries. Intel has a three-year lead over these companies in terms of process, and with the news on Wednesday it looks like it could maintain that far into the future.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349642344058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 16:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349648151730-64</Id><Topic><Title>INTC smartphone</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1349633401174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 14:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I completely agree with you,IMO INTC is grossly undervalued to the extreme.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1349648151730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 18:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349650644667-65</Id><Topic><Title>Going Long On INTC Who Is With Me?</Title><Username>alvaelliott392</Username><Timestamp>1349524223378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 07:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>im in with 50 share</Msg><Username>distributors31</Username><Timestamp>1349650644667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 18:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349652436301-66</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Talks About</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349640709638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 16:11:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel talks and talks and talks (just like wallus), but the insiders just keep voting with their wallets.

Meanwhile we hear almost nothing about ARM's 20nm development...] Intel isn't planning on moving away from its Moore's Law strategy for transistor development anytime soon, with die sizes as small as 10nm already on its research radar for 2015. That was the message delivered by Mark Bohr, Intel senior fellow and director of the chip maker's Process Architecture and Integration group, during a session Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco. Bohr walked through Intel's transistor roadmap for the next few years, ensuring attendees that Moore's Law -- or the development strategy through which Intel doubles the number of transistors on its chips approximately every two years -- is alive and well. Moore's Law was most recently demonstrated with this year's launch of its 22nm third-generation Ivy Bridge Core processors, and it is already paving the way for production of a new line of both 14nm CPUs and system-on-a-chips (SoCs), code-named Skylake, for 2013. "The 14nm technology is in full development mode now and on track for full production readiness at the end of next year," Bohr said. Every new generation of chips pumped out based on Moore's Law delivers lower levels of power consumption and higher speeds than its predecessors. In Ivy Bridge's case, Bohr said, the 22nm processors yielded a 20 percent performance boost on multi-threaded applications and doubled the processing speeds for media applications over the prior-generation, 32nm Sandy Bridge processors, all while consuming nearly 20 percent less power. Bohr said. And as Intel's die continue to shrink in size and offer greater levels of power efficiency, they become more and more suited for use in smaller hardware devices, such as smartphones and tablets. "Of course, we are doing that to support a wider range of products, from high-performance server and desktop products ... to low-power and low-leakage transistors for Ultrabook, tablets and pocket-device applications," Bohr told attendees. Intel's adherence to Moore's Law and its planned development of 14nm chips for 2013 places it ahead of rival chip makers AMD and ARM, who are currently eyeing 20nm architectures. Part of this could also be because Intel manufacturers its chips at its own fab facilities, while AMD and ARM work with partners or third-party fabs such as Global Foundries.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349653433745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:43:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349653634676-68</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC: The Next Thing To Happen Could Be Very Ugly</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1349635187652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 14:39:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By that time Intel, executing its tick-tock strategy, will be in mass production on 14nm products and TSMC could be 2 nodes plus Trigate behind.

Intel's chips would be 1/4 the size, 1/3 the cost, and higher performance and lower power than anything TSMC could produce. What faces TSMC is an aroused Intel on the verge of introducing a mobile application processor with embedded LTE.

Hard to believe the Apple/Samsung partnership is going to continue for very long...] Samsung and Apple have been battling it out in courtrooms across the globe over patents. Now a new battle seems to be brewing. South Korea’s biggest consumer electronics company says it plans to expand a TV commercial—one that pokes fun at Apple’s iPhone 5– in Australia and New Zealand later this month. A company spokesman said details such as when it would air haven’t been finalized, but the plan is to expand the commercial to other markets in the Asia-Pacific region at a later stage. A day before Apple officially launched its iPhone 5 in the U.S. on Sept. 21, Samsung aggressively rolled out a series of TV, newspaper and billboard ads. The ads note that the bigger screen and faster 4G network on the iPhone 5 is already available on Samsung’s Galaxy S III smartphone, launched world-wide in June. In the TV commercial that will be rolled out in Australia and New Zealand like the one already airing in the U.S., Samsung depicts a typical iPhone launch day in which hundreds of consumers wait in line for hours before Apple stores open. In one scene, a young man waiting in line strikes up a conversation with another, saying, “welcome back, I guess the Galaxy S III didn’t work out?” The second man answers, “No I love the GS III. It’s extremely awesome. I’m just saving a spot in line for someone.” Turns out, the spot is reserved for his parents, who come strolling in later. Without saying much or even making explicit reference to Apple in the commercial, Samsung’s message hints that the new features on the iPhone 5 aren’t really new, and that it’s a smartphone for an older generation. The commercial ends with the phrase “the next big thing is already here”referring to its Galaxy smartphones. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Samsung in the past has typically marketed its devices more quietly, rather than directly targeting its competitor. But under the direction of its U.S. chief marketing officer–Todd Pendleton, who previously spent years at Nike–the company is becoming more aggressive in its marketing efforts. The latest example highlights just how severe the rivalry between the two has become as they battle it out in the courtroom over patent infringement. At stake is dominance in the fast-growing smartphone market. While Samsung overtook Apple last year to become the world’s largest smartphone maker by shipments, strong demand for the iPhone 5 could tip the scales back in Apple’s favor, some analysts say. Apple said on Sept. 24 it has sold more than 5 million iPhone 5s, just three days after its launch. Both Samsung and Apple are spending heavily on advertising. Apple spent $647 million on advertising for the iPhone in the U.S., from its release in 2007 through its fiscal year 2011. It spent about $457.2 million for the iPad, which debuted in 2010. Samsung, meanwhile, has spent $2.8 billion in marketing expenses in the second quarter, up from $1.97 billion a year earlier. In the second quarter, Samsung’s smartphone market share was 34.6%, compared with Apple’s 17.8%, based on data from Strategy Analytics. A year earlier, Samsung’s market share was 18.3% versus Apple’s 18.4%.
