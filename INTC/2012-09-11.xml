Hewlett-Packard (HP) previously announced plans to launch server products using Atom processors, and Quanta QCT, a subsidiary of Quanta Computer, also recently announced it twill launch an Atom-based micro-server product at the end of 2012. The micro-server product will adopt Atom-based processors codenamed Centerton, a CPU series specifically designed by Intel for the lower-power-consumption server market. Compared to Intel, ARM, which has also been aggressive about the low-power-consumption server market, is at a disadvantage in the market due to its need to rely on chipmakers such as Marvell or Calxeda.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347338632055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 00:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347338866176-2</Id><Title>Intel preps interconnect for server CPUs</Title><Msg>From Digitimes: Intel Corp. is not providing details, but it has disclosed plans that confirm industry speculation of recent weeks: The x86 giant is developing a next-generation interconnect it will integrate in future Xeon and Atom server processors addressing a range of uses from supercomputers to microservers. The news is timed to compete with an announcement later on Monday (Sept. 10) from Advanced Micro Devices about the Freedom Fabric it acquired with startup SeaMicro. AMD is expected to try to make that interconnect an industry standard for its server CPUs, and probably those of emerging ARM-based server SoCs. Interconnects--sometimes called fabrics--are key to linking tens to hundreds of thousands of processors in a broad range of servers. They are used in everything from the world’s most powerful supercomputers to large cloud computing data centers and microservers, dense chassis packed with processors generally used as Web servers. The industry has been anticipating an Intel move into interconbnects after three recent acquisitions. In April, Intel bought an interconnect group from Cray for $140 million. In January, it acquired the Infiniband chip business of QLogic for $125 million, and in July 2011 it bought Fulcrum for an undisclosed sum. “We are putting a salable fabric into the processor using the assets we have with our recent acquisitions,” said Raj Hazra, general manager of Intel’s technical computing group. “We think this integration happens much sooner than end of decade as some people have suggested, tying it to exascale supercomputers,” he said. The new Intel interconnect aims to cover the waterfront in applications. At the low end, it could be used in microservers to link a hundred or more processors at tens of GBytes/second with latencies of less than 1,000 nanoseconds. At the high end, it ultimately will scale up to linking hundreds of thousands of processors at hundreds of GBytes/second at latencies measured in tens of nanoseconds.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347338866176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 00:47:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347340748676-3</Id><Title>Watch out when PETE the CON MAN from CNBC wants you to buy a stock.

Fifty-two percent of likely voters support Obama, and 46 percent back Romney (2 percent responded neither, and 1 percent had no opinion). That's a four-point bump since a poll taken before the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., when the two candidates were tied at 48 percent. Prior to both conventions, Obama had 49 percent to Romney's 47 percent. Obama took the lead as the candidate better trusted to handle the economy, with 50 percent of likely voters saying he'd do a better job on the issue, compared to 49 percent who favored Romney (1 percent said neither). Prior to the Democratic convention, Romney led 51 to 45 on the issue. Democrats also expressed renewed excitement following Charlotte, coming out on the winning side of the enthusiasm gap for only the second time in 2012, with 59 percent saying they were extremely or very enthusiastic to vote, compared to 57 percent of Republicans who felt similarly. Tracking polls over the past weekend showed a small bounce for Obama following the Democratic convention. Romney pollster Neil Newhouse acknowledged the bump, but dismissed it Monday as "a bit of a sugar high." The CNN poll surveyed 709 registered voters by phone between Sept. 7 and Sept. 9, with a 3.5 percent margin of error.

But is the boom for real? For high-paying, skilled manufacturing jobs, it just might be. The number of job openings for skilled factory workers has increased 38% since 2005, according to numbers from the Conference Board that measure labor demand across industries. More strikingly, the sharpest increase in postings for skilled workers -- 152% -- has occurred in the last three or so years. Related: 'I started a business in a boomtown' Among the states where demand is the highest for skilled workers are Ohio, Michigan, Texas, California, Illinois and Indiana, according to the Conference Board. The employers range from small parts makers that contract with large manufacturers to mid-sized and large assemblers in the auto, aerospace and industrial metals sectors. The hottest openings are for machinists, tool-and-die makers, computer-aided machine operators and similar specialties. And the jobs pay well. Starting salaries are often as much as $45,000 to $50,000. Overtime, which is common because of a shortage of skilled workers, can bump that up significantly. "What's clear from the data is that there is a pick up in [manufacturing] hiring and the biggest swath of job openings is the central part of the United States," said June Shelp, vice president at the Conference Board. "Is this pick up because manufacturing is actually growing or is this because of a bounce back from the recession? That remains to be seen," said Shelp. The trend lines are promising. According to the Conference Board numbers, which aren't adjusted for seasonal factors, there were 151,478 job postings for skilled workers nationwide in May 2005. That number dipped to 82,741 in February 2009 before rising to 208,887 last month.

The sources estimated that the official launch of the Retina Display 13.3-inch MacBook Pro should be in either September or October to target back-to-school demand and the year-end holidays. As for the iMac, Apple originally planned to release three new models with upgraded panels and CPUs, but due to poor yields of the panels, the mass production of the high-end model, has been postponed, without any launch schedule. The other two models – targeting the mid-range and entry-level segments – saw shipment volumes from the supply chain increase in September. Apple shipped 1.01 million iMacs in the second quarter, accounting for 2.8% of global desktop shipments, while the company's total iMac shipments in the first half were 2.23 million units, helping it to become the fifth-largest desktop vendor worldwide.

Apparently this will involve the integration of a converged fabric controller inside future server chips. This will make server communication faster while helping data centers operate at peak efficiency. Raj Hazra, vice president of the Intel Architecture Group said that Fabric virtualises I/O and ties together storage and networking in data centres. If you add in an integrated controller you get a wider pipe to scale performance on cloud platforms. He said that the integrated fabric controller will appear in the company's Xeon server chips in a few years as part of Intel's cunning plan to bring the controller to the transistor layer.

Until recently Intel was focused largely on thinned and lighter laptops, known as Ultrabooks, but Microsoft’s “reimagining” of Windows has shaken things up. Windows 8, which officially arrives on October 26, is designed to work on both PCs and tablets. There will be plenty of conventional laptops—with and without touchscreens—as well as slates. But the hybrids that attempt to bridge both worlds are the most intriguing. The first Windows 8 hybrids surfaced at Computex in June. Many of these were early prototypes with few details. More recently, at a large tradeshow in Germany, many computer makers officially announced a slew of Windows 8 convertibles. This week at the Intel Developer Forum we should get a better look at some of these Widows 8 convertibles.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347373391350</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347373427022-32</Id><Title>I am keeping INTC down today so you all can buy real cheap</Title><Msg>Buy today for I will,be taking INTC up this week.

HUGE improvement over Ivy Bridge</Title><Msg>by Mark Tyson on 11 September 2012, 15:04 TagNASDAQ:INTC) Intel has been focussing on reducing power consumption of its chips. Not many years ago only megahertz mattered as Chipzilla and AMD battled each other throwing up ever higher headline MHz speeds, in what seemed like a race to the moon. That numbers game was sidelined with the arrival of the Pentium M range of processors with their large caches; cool running and with great performance. Since then things have developed further and marketers are emphasising numbers of processor cores in their sales efforts but people are not as blind to these figures as they used to be. Most people know a good balance is required, especially in the ever more important portable computing market. Also Intel now has a new foe which dominates the growing smartphone and tablet markets with its superbly energy efficient processors: ARM. Back to the point of the article! The new upcoming range of Intel chips codenamed Haswell will be launching sometime in 2013. A major milestone the chips will reach is that some Haswell chips will reportedly come in at 10 watts. That figure is a great improvement over Intel’s current best Ivy Bridge efforts which use 17 watts. The Haswell 10 watt figure is said to include the power consumption by the integrated GPU.</Msg><Username>vinnie_bagofhotwind</Username><Timestamp>1347375183545</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347375447836-42</Id><Title>2013 Haswell Ultrabooks - 699 or less, 9 hours of batter life, etc..</Title><Msg>HUGE XXXXX has also had some inside info from Intel which details the intended 2013 Haswell Ultrabook configurations. A standard Ultrabook must not have a bill of materials exceeding $699 and for that the following must be supplied “All day battery life at nine hours, voice command, HD video chat with a 720p resolution camera, as well as a wireless display, robust Wi-Fi, bundled anti-virus protection in the consumer model, and a multi touchpad.” Also at least 16GB of NAND storage must be integrated for “while using” functions. No current hybrid drives have that much NAND built-in so perhaps manufacturers will have to include dedicated SSDs if nothing else develops in the meantime. Touch screens won’t be a baseline requirement of the new Ultrabooks.</Msg><Username>vinnie_bagofhotwind</Username><Timestamp>1347375447836</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347375957854-43</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone Rumors</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347373031301</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:17:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Motorola, ZTE, Orange, Xolo...

The installation of the new equipment needed for automatic mode operation was successful and the Company is now running production on the new tool in automatic mode. Samples of displays from the new machine were provided to customers and performed well based on their tests. eMagin is nearing completion of its own reliability testing (a long duration 1,000 hours testing) of the displays, which is showing positive results. The testing will conclude in mid-September, after which displays from the new machine, including those in inventory, can be shipped to fill customer orders. The new OLED deposition machine is replacing the Company’s current Satella machine for production purposes. The Satella will continue to be used primarily for research and development of next-generation microdisplays. The new machine provides significant advantages, including more up time, reduced maintenance, improved consistency, higher overall quality, greater speed of production and higher yield. Andrew Sculley, president and CEO of eMagin, commented, “Automated operation of our new state-of-the-art OLED deposition machine is a significant achievement by our team that will enable us to increase production and address the most demanding applications from the military, industrial, consumer and medical markets.” About eMagin Corporation A leader in OLED microdisplay technology, OLED microdisplay manufacturing know-how and mobile display systems, eMagin manufactures high-resolution OLED microdisplays and integrates them with magnifying optics to deliver virtual images comparable to large-screen computer and television displays in portable, low-power, lightweight personal displays. eMagin microdisplays provide near-eye imagery in a variety of products from military, industrial, medical and consumer OEMs. More information about eMagin is available at</Msg><Username>zeroletdown</Username><Timestamp>1347376941344</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347376979336-46</Id><Title>Why I'm buying</Title><Msg>I decided to start back into Intel this AM and here is why: Haswell sounds like it could be another revolutionary chip--an even bigger jump in technology than Sandy Bridge. Sandy wasn't appreciated until he brought in 20-30% growth and way higher earnings than anticipated. The key is looking at the chip technology, and then you have a jump on the crowd! Haswell looks to be without competition to me, but we will find out a lot more over the next two days. This warning has produced an opportunity imo. Many factors could take it lower, so averaging in is always good, but we could have bottomed, too.

The slim size and portability is definitely a plus. The better tablets start at about $400 and with added storage can run between $500-$600. However even at the higher price the devices are still limited to mostly information consumption. The idea of using a tablet on occassion is appealing but a high-end smartphone can do virtually everything an iPad or Android tablet can do and most people already carry their smartphones all the time. A hybrid Ultrabook-tablet is a no-compromise device that compliments the smartphone and gives the owner the ability to work and play on a single device while simplifying the number of devices to have to manage. Windows based tablets built on x86 will deliver a similar experience.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1347377196106</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377359053-48</Id><Topic><Title>I am keeping INTC down today so you all can buy real cheap</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1347373427022</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:23:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well INTC #$%$ me off yesterday so EOD I tripled down my Oct $26 options.

They have also leaked that ULV (and all Mobile) TDPs will go down drastically--41% on the ULV. The key is if a 10W ULV chip will outperform a 17W Ivy on the CPU, or whether they mean at the same clock. I suspect Haswell will be close on the CPU and double on the graphics, with about a 41% reduction in power, but I could be too optimistic. However, this likely puts Intel in an exclusive region. There simply is no good reason to buy any other chip for a laptop, including prior Intel chips. Laptop battery life will go up tremendously with better performance overall. Just ask yourself if you can live with your tablet only, or do you need a real computer? I love my Ipad and Iphone, but I also need a laptop. PCs aren't going away. The growth rate may recede, but w8 will wake it back up this Christmas I suspect.

Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, David (Dadi) Perlmutter said Intel reduced the platform idle power of its 4th generation Intel Core processor family based on the next-generation "Haswell" microarchitecture by more than 20 times over the 2nd generation while delivering outstanding performance and responsiveness. He also said Intel will add a new line of even lower-power processors based on the same microarchitecture to its roadmap starting in 2013. Both new products underscore the company's focus to aggressively drive power consumption down to enable longer battery life and a wave of new, more mobile designs, while delivering ever-increasing processor, graphics and media performance. "The 4th generation Intel Core processor family and our new line of low-power processors will usher in an era of unprecedented innovation in mobile computing," Perlmutter said. "Our focus to deliver even lower power with the great performance that our processors are known for is as fundamentally significant as when we shifted our development focus beyond sheer processor speed in 2001. As a result, you'll see our customers delivering sleek and cool convertible designs, as well as radical breakthrough experiences across a growing spectrum of mobile devices."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347391796634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:29:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347391873504-65</Id><Topic><Title>IDF: Intel's Haswell CPU to Fuel Future of Mobile Computing Innovation</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347391796634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>["more than 20 times over the 2nd generation..."] "Perlmutter said Intel reduced the platform idle power of its 4th generation Intel Core processor family based on the next-generation "Haswell" microarchitecture by more than 20 times over the 2nd generation while delivering outstanding performance and responsiveness.

Intel took its share of hits over its belated entry to the mobile device party, but the chip giant still has plenty of innovation up its sleeve and its vertically integrated advantages remain second to none, according to Intel product chief Dadi Perlmutter. Kicking off the 15th annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco on Tuesday, Pelmutter said the company and its developer ecosystem are preparing to "reinvent" computing yet again, following on from the personal computing and mobile revolutions of years gone by. "By the end of the decade we'll be able to touch not just the few billions we do today, but the lives of every human on the planet," Perlmutter said during his opening keynote. Perlmutter said touch technology, such a huge ingredient in the success of the smartphone and tablet markets that Intel has struggled to penetrate, is just the first level of coming innovation in the user interfaces for computing devices. "Touch is just the beginning. Whoever thinks touch is the end [of interface innovation], it's not," he said, demonstrating new voice-recognition technology from Nuance, a new ultrabook-optimized gesture recognition platform from SoftKinetic, and an Intel-secured NFC credit card reader that MasterCard is rolling out soon as part of its PayPass Wallet. Intel is also betting quite a bit on the evolution of the tablet market beyond the standalone slate going forward, particularly with next month's release of Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system. Perlmutter drew a sketch of a near-future tablet/laptop market that had plenty of room for slab tablet designs like Apple's best-selling iPad, but also for detachable and convertible designs for ultrabooks that serve as clamshell units and tablets, not to mention traditional laptops. If Intel's chances of breaking into the tablet market seem credible in the chip giant's telling, particularly when the company redefines it to suit its purposes, the smartphone arena seems a trickier puzzle. Intel has earned some design wins with its Medfield generation of Atom SoCs for smartphones, but it is still a long way away from making a dent in rival ARM's dominance of the handset market. That's where Intel's top-to-bottom integration of manufacturing and design comes into play, according to Perlmutter. "The Intel advantage is that it's all under one roof. We have the best transistors, the best factories, and great logistics all around the world on one side, and the great architecture that spans all systems on the other," he said, pointing to a global installed base of a whopping 1.5 billion systems for Intel's x86 chips and 11 million developers working with the architecture worldwide. Medfield will be followed in 2013 with a new 22-nanometer process architecture code named Haswell. Perlmutter demonstrated a reference system running on a Haswell chip that was able to match the graphics performance of a current-generation Ivy Bridge ultrabook while drawing half the power. If Intel can significantly reduce the power consumption of its next-gen Atom SoCs without sacrificing performance, one major advantage the ARM architecture has had in recent years would potentially disappear. That's saying a lot and it won't do to assume that ARM won't also be improving its designs and process technology. Plus, mobile device makers software developers have experience with ARM and have made too many long-term investments in the architecture to switch away from it overnight—Intel of all companies should know about the advantages of market dominance. But as one of a handful of semiconductor companies in the world that truly drives process innovation, Intel does enjoy a first-mover advantage in getting faster and more efficient chips to market. Intel maintains that as the cost of manufacturing microprocessors gets more expensive, that advantage is only growing with time. Intel, the prime steward of Moore's Law, necessarily takes the long view of the computing industry even as it talks about reinventing it. Perlmutter spent a good amount of time discussing the embedded side of Intel's business and how the company is positioned for the so-called "Internet of Things" —the spread of Internet-connected computing to all sorts of non-PC installations, from cars to Coke machines. Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, found this part of Perlmutter's talk, when combined with Intel's vision of future computing interfaces, compelling. "The most interesting thing Intel talked about in their keynote was perceptual computing. This essentially signals Intel's multi-year initiative for the natural user interface and the 'Internet of Things,'" Moorhead said. Lest anyone think Intel is only concerned about consumer-facing technology these days, Perlmutter reminded the crowd that the chip giant remains the king of the data center. "The data center runs on Intel. And a data center is not just one thing. It's a very broad set of capabilities that need to be run," he said. With products ranging from Itanium to Atom, Intel's reach into the data center spans mission critical computing to Web hosting, he added. The digitization of data has also increased Intel's opportunities, Perlmutter said. The explosion of social media, for example, hasn't just ushered in a new era of content creation but has also generated an ever-increasing amount of big data that can be analyzed for various purposes—number-crunching that Perlmutter and Co. would prefer to be done on Intel processors, naturally.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347392038261</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392065432-67</Id><Topic><Title>I am keeping INTC down today so you all can buy real cheap</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1347373427022</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:23:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raystock is the resident idiot on the qid message board.

It turns out that Haswell 4th generation Core needs 7.6W for the same task where Ivy Bridge Core-i 3000 series needed a flat 17W. This is a huge difference but you should have in mind that at the end of the day Intel will offer the same 17W parts with Haswell but they will bring a significant performance at the same 17W. This also means that the graphics part got significantly better. Intel didn’t talk about it on the record but our sources for a while are talking that you can expect some 10 percent performance increase with Haswell vs. Ivy Bridge in processor performance.

Ultrabook performance in a tablet...] An improved GPU and lower power consumption make for a versatile chip. The desire to save power extends beyond the CPU itself—Intel has also added support for several low-power interfaces normally associated with ARM-toting tablets, including I2C, SDIO, I2S, and UART, along with more traditional SATA, USB, and PCI Express interfaces. All of these improvements, along with system-on-a-chip (SoC) versions of Haswell with a TDP of just 10W (down from the 17W in Ivy Bridge processors), should enable Intel to put Ultrabook-class performance into tablets with similar size, weight, and battery life to today's ARM-based offerings. If Intel's upcoming Atom processors are getting serious about competing with Cortex A9 and A15-based ARM processors, then Haswell is about giving us tablets in a whole new class of performance—benchmarks for Ivy Bridge Ultrabooks are five or six times higher than they are for the quad-core Tegra 3 in the Nexus 7, just to pick an example.

Jack Clark By Jack Clark | September 11, 2012 -- 22:42 GMT (15:42 PDT) Intel has a range of chips in development, but none seem more important for the company than the upcoming fourth generation core processor, codename Haswell. Haswell will span mobile devices such as tablets through to desktops and eventually into high-end servers. Never before has Intel attempted to bridge so many devices with a single architecture. "It was designed with mobility in mind," Dadi Perlmutter, general manager of the Intel architecture group, said in a keynote speech on Tuesday, and should "span the power performance from the tablet to the ultrabook to a high-performing desktop workstation." The chip sees Intel try to embrace a variety of different device form factors within one processor, hoping to net together the post-PC diaspora - tablets, convertible PCs, ultrabooks - by having them all sit on a single processor. Intel hopes to do this by offering a chip with sufficiently low power consumption for it to go into mobile devices, and a high enough performance ceiling for it to go into PCs and servers as well. Haswell's power savings come from two things - improvements to the chip architecture, along with better-than-expected performance of Intel's new 22nm 'tri-gate' fabrication process, Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel's PC Client Group, said on Tuesday. The chip company is preparing to start shipping a Haswell-based development ultrabook to developers with a chip that draws 15W of power, Skaugen said, and plans to generally launch the chip in the first half of 2013. One version of Haswell will have a power draw of 10W. This compares favourably with the 17W draw of an Ivy Bridge-based third generation core processor. "With fourth generation core we're going to nearly double the battery life," Skaugen said. Along with boosting battery life, Haswell is designed to make mobile devices, such as ultrabooks and tablets, more desirable to consumers by imbuing them with a range of futuristic, compute-intensive features. So far, Intel has said Haswell should give devices it sits in greater support for multiple displays, processor-intensive augmented reality, depth tracking via integrated cameras and features like text to speech synthesis voice interfaces via a tie-up with Nuance. Taken together, Skaugen thinks Haswell could spawn "more innovation in the next 12-18 months in the PC industry than in the past decade." Intel's gamble is that the advanced media features of Haswell, combined with its 20X improvement in idle power consumption over Sandy Bridge chips, will give it a chip that is competitive with processors from chip rivals like ARM. The chip should be able to "burst with capabilities far above what an Atom or ARM or other device" is capable of, Skaugen said. However, the proof will be in the sales of the devices and this is not a sure thing - the grave state of the global economy caused Intel to cut its earnings forecast for its third financial quarter on Friday due to depressed consumer demand. The next year will be crucial for Intel as the chip company shepherds its Haswell processors into devices made by major original equipment partners like HP, Dell and Lenovo. What happens next depends on the consumer, and whether the new capabilities of Haswell devices will be compelling enough to make people part with their money in a cash-strapped time.
