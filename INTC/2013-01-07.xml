They would have waited for a Razr-like flagship from the much more visible Motorola/Google. Merrifield seems to be more of the same. Incrementally better and near the top of the pack for now. Intel doesn't seem to understand what it takes to build a mobile chip that phone makers really want. For example, they still clock their chips at 1.6GHz -2GHz and then expect the phone maker to put in a huge battery. If better sense prevailed, they would target a lower power operating point which a lower peak GHz rating. They seem to be stuck in the PC world where "performance" is everything by their own definition. The problem is, they're not the ones defining things in this market.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1357539485359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:18:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357539620853-2</Id><Title>NVIDIA Introduces World's Fastest Mobile Processor</Title><Msg>LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwire - Jan 7, 2013) - CES -- NVIDIA today introduced NVIDIA® Tegra® 4, the world's fastest mobile processor, with record-setting performance and battery life to flawlessly power smartphones and tablets, gaming devices, auto infotainment and navigation systems, and PCs. Tegra 4 offers exceptional graphics processing, with lightning-fast web browsing, stunning visuals and new camera capabilities through computational photography. Previously codenamed "Wayne," Tegra 4 features 72 custom NVIDIA GeForce™ GPU cores -- or six times the GPU horsepower of Tegra 3 -- which deliver more realistic gaming experiences and higher resolution displays. It includes the first quad-core application of ARM's most advanced CPU core, the Cortex-A15, which delivers 2.6x faster web browsing and breakthrough performance for apps. Tegra 4 also enables worldwide 4G LTE voice and data support through an optional chipset, the fifth-generation NVIDIA Icera® i500 processor. More efficient and 40 percent the size of conventional modems, i500 delivers four times the processing capability of its predecessor. "Tegra 4 provides enormous processing power and efficiency to power smartphones and tablets, gaming devices, auto systems and PCs," said Phil Carmack, senior vice president of the Tegra business at NVIDIA. "Its new capabilities, particularly in the area of computational photography, will help improve a whole range of existing products and lead to the creation of exciting new ones." Computational Photography Capability Among the Tegra 4 processor's breakthroughs is its Computational Photography Architecture, which automatically delivers high dynamic range (HDR) photos and video by fusing together the processing power of the GPU, CPU and the camera's image-signal processor. Its HDR capability captures images, including those taken with a flash, the way they are seen by the human eye -- with detail in both bright and dark areas. Unprecedented Power Efficiency Designed for maximum energy efficiency, Tegra 4 includes a second-generation battery saver core for low power during standard use, and PRISM 2 Display technology to reduce backlight power while delivering superior visuals. Tegra 4 consumes up to 45 percent less power than its predecessor, Tegra 3, in common use cases. And it enables up to 14 hours of HD video playback on phones.

"You've been president four years," Romney said at the Oct. 3, 2012, debate in Denver. "You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. …" He added, "I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done." We’ve heard the claim before that Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. Let’s review our findings. Remarks from 2009 Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a "Fiscal Responsibility Summit" one month after his inauguration. His words: "Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. That figure was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011. In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in an August 2012 report. The estimate marks the fourth year in a row with a deficit of more than $1 trillion, the CBO noted, although the projection is down slightly from the $1.2 trillion deficit that CBO projected in March. "This year’s deficit will be three-quarters as large as the deficit in 2009 when measured relative to the size of the economy," the report noted. So the deficit is shrinking, but it’s nowhere near half the level from 2009. PolitiFact Florida previously asked the Obama campaign about the pledge. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012. "Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized," he said. "Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …" Our ruling Romney reminded Obama during the debate, "you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half." The statement is accurate. Obama made the pledge shortly after taking office in 2009. Today, the deficit is smaller, but it’s not half the size it was. We rate Romney’s statement True.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1357577874184</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 11:57:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357578011325-49</Id><Topic><Title>if this is a POWERFUL run up to earnings, help us !!!</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357576243118</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 11:30:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what does POWERFUL mean any more ??</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1357578011325</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 12:00:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357578256436-50</Id><Topic><Title>"What George Bush has done with the debt is unpatriotic, it's unnacceptable" -Obama</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357576827755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 11:40:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

By introducing Core i and Pentium processors based on dual-core Ivy Bridge design with power consumption between 7W and 13W, Intel brings its highest-performing CPU micro-architecture to devices that previously utilized low-power micro-architectures, such as Intel Atom. In general, this demonstrates the company’s commitment to bring down power consumption of its mainstream chips down to the levels when they become competitive in ultra-mobile segments. At the same time, Intel shows that Atom micro-architectures will from now on be focused around minimum power consumption so to compete against ARM.

Dell has already said it was testing servers based on 32-bit ARM chips from Marvel and Calxeda, but this is the first time it has shown any hardware based on a 64-bit ARM processor. Sixty-four-bit chips are generally better suited to server use than 32-bit parts. Proponents say ARM chips will be more energy efficient than x86 processors that Intel makes for certain cloud and analytics workloads, but the market is in its early stages, with plenty of hardware and software development work to be done. Analysts estimate the first 64-bit ARM servers won’t actually hit the market before 2014. AppliedMicro hosted a session on Thursday at ARM’s TechCon conference, where it tried to illustrate how various elements of the 64-bit ARM server “ecosystem” are coming together. It was joined by representatives from Red Hat and Cloudera, both of whom said they’ll have software ready for testing on 64-bit ARM chips next year. Oracle was also there, pledging a version of Java SE for 64-bit ARM processors, though it didn’t give a timeframe. AppliedMicro CEO Paramesh Gopi, in full showman mode, pulled away a black cloth cover to reveal the Dell server at the end of his talk. He didn’t describe it in any detail but it appeared to be a two-rack-unit chassis with four or five individual servers, or “sleds,” that slide into the frame. The hardware was a prototype, and it’s still unknown if Dell will actually sell an ARM-based server using AppliedMicro technology. Dell is experimenting with ARM components from several suppliers, and it was also at AMD’s event Monday when it announced plans to build ARM-based server chips. “We don’t have any plans to make generally available an ARM-based server right now—that includes the Applied Micro-based prototype you saw,” Dell spokeswoman Erin Zehr said via email. “We’re currently focused on ecosystem enablement—giving developers access to clusters so they can test or write to ARM,” she said. The processor inside the Dell system, which AppliedMicro called an “X-Gene” processor, was also an early prototype. Gopi said X-Gene parts will be ready for customers to begin testing in the first quarter next year, with commercial products coming later in 2013. But AppliedMicro does now have actual prototype silicon, which is a step up from the HotChips conference in August, when it showed a server board with a mock-up chip. It demonstrated its hardware in action Thursday. It showed a website running on what Gopi said was a prototype X-Gene server built by AppliedMicro and located in a remote data center. He streamed a trailer for the new James Bond film, which appeared to run smoothly. “We are literally months away, ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “In Q1 next year, you’ll have not only silicon but also the software I just showed you and systems to go around it.” He was still referring to prototype systems, however. Gopi also unveiled three server reference designs that AppliedMicro has come up with, to show server makers what they can build. They’re dubbed X-Memory, X-Compute and X-Storage, depending on the target application. The X-Storage system is aimed at Hadoop-type analytics applications, and combines a sea of hard disks with a single X-Gene server board. It had a total 36TB of storage, Gopi said. ARM offers two types of licenses for its chip designs. Companies can buy an architectural license, as AppliedMicro did, and design their own processor from scratch. That allows for greater customization, but takes more time and money. They can also buy a license for a finished processor design. ARM unveiled its 64-bit architecture, ARMv8, at last year’s TechCon. The news earlier this week was that ARM has now released its first 64-bit processor designs, the Cortex-A57 and A53. Chips based on those designs could appear by the end of this year.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357598241889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 17:37:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357599116967-86</Id><Topic><Title>7w Ivy Bridge ULV</Title><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1357595375187</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:49:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the update which shows just how unready for prime time ARM 64-bit is although I am sure that was not your intention ;-).

You seem to live in a fantasy world of your own creation. ARM is nowhere in servers apart from glossy press releases. There is no demand for ARM servers as they do not bring anything disruptive compared to 64-bit Atoms and low voltage Xeons today. ARM A9 has no performance, A15 burns too much power and A57 is no faster than a 10 year old Athlon64 and so will not give anyone a reason to change from x86. x86 servers are the majority world server architecture in use today and to pretend they have 'weak support' just shows you are not talking about Planet Earth more like Planet Narnia where that other funny Lion lives.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357600195600</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:09:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357601557256-89</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4: Too Little, Too Late</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357589461848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:11:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is all that will be available, unless NVDA wants to battle for 20nm capacity with their new product.

The move highlights Intel’s more intense focus at the smartphone market. The company is “significantly extending the performance and power savings in Atom processors as we accelerate our mobile offerings in an unprecedented fashion in 2013,” said Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel’s PC client group. Intel’s smartphone offensive is also focused on the emerging markets, aimed at “first-time buyers in emerging markets, as well as with our customers who can deploy more cost-conscious devices without sacrificing device performance or user experience,” said Mike Bell, general manager of Intel’s mobile and communications group. Intel also introduced new lower-power versions of its Core chips for PCs and Ultrabooks, the ultrathin notebook based on Intel’s technology, with “all-day” batter life. In a webcast presentation from CES, Skaugen also said Intel expects touch-based systems for sale at $599 this year.

Bell starts with phones. They have had 7 designs from leading OEMs in 25 countries so far. Lenovo, ZTE, Motorola (2 designs), Megafon, Lava, Orange. They worked closely with Google for optimized version of Android for the phones. Bell notes that the performance of their processors was better than the competition. He also says the battery life is a little better than rival processors from Qualcomm. Today: New smartphone platform to get into value segment. Intel Atom processor Z2420 with XMM 6265 HSPA+ modem. The platform has been code–named Lexington, as rumored. 1.2 GHz. Optimized for Android. They have created a reference platform, as they did last year. Bell says it is designed to be a no compromises, multimedia phone. Lexington has a dual-SIM feature.. FM Radio. MicroSD card slot. Supports Intel Wireless Display technology. OEM partners: Acer, Safaricom, Lava will use the platform. Tablets and ultrabooks: Clover Trail platform announced recently; an Atom-based processor. There are range of platforms on the market today. HP, Dell, LG, Acer, others. The processor is up 1.8 GHz, dual core, 10-plus hours of battery life, more than 3 weeks of standby. (Impressive, but not new.) Sneak peak announcing today: Bay Trail platform. Next gen Atom-based chip; 22 nm technology. More than 2x the performance of current generation. Quad core. Available holidays 2013. Bell hands off to Skaugen, to talk to about PCs, in particular “Ultrabook convertibles and detachables.” In September, announced new lower power 4th generation Intel Core processors, aimed at the convertible/detachable segment. Announcement: Today launching pull in of low power processors, moving low power into 3rd generation Intel Core processors, at #$%$ versus 10 watts announced in September. He is showing off some new Acer and Lenovo convertibles. They’re thin! They’re tablets…and laptops. Today, there are nearly 140 ultrabook designs shipping. Dozens below $750. End of this year, there will be touch-based systems at $599 price point. Will have about 40 touch designs in the marketplace as low as $599. There are 150 million notebooks in use that are 3 years old or more. Gone from inches to millimeters in thickness so far, and will get thinner with Haswell 4th generation Intel core processors in a few months. 4th generation Ultrabooks will be game changers, Skaugen says. Haswell first chip designed to interact naturally with voice and touch. For 4th generation ultrabooks, will be required to have touch. Will have all day battery life. Mandatory Intel Wireless Display. Also will have instant on. Demo: an internal Haswell-based ultrabook reference design. A 17 mm ultrabook. CPU sits behind the display. 13 hours of battery life. Has one-finger detach mechanism to create tablet. 11.6 inch form factor; 10 hours of battery life as a tablet. Should come out in the $799-$899 price range when they launch. Next, all-in-ones, the evolution of traditional desktops. 80% of homes have desktops. 200 million desktops out there are four years old or older. 88% of homes with desktops use them every single day. Intel is announcing a broad all-in-one computing ecosystem, with games, other software for tabeltop PC. Brings the desktop computer to the coffee table. Play Monopoly. Or Poker. Wow, this is the old Microsoft Surface table interface – the old Surface, not the current one – made real. New: Intel announcing premium pay TV experiences for Intel Devices. Comcast using Comcast creating Xfinity home video gateway based on Intel; with full premium pay content without a set-top box. Basically home gateway enables full premium of full pay TV and VOD content without any set-top boxes. With Bougues Telecom in France, they are launching full pay TV VOD anywhere on their network also on an Intel-based platform. Perceptual computing: Give PC human-like senses. Eyes, ears, touch context. One aspect of this is new approach to passwords. Facial recognition instead of typing passwords. Can’t be spoofed with images or video. Looking at multiple points on the face, and intramuscular movements. Also demonstrating after-market 3D gesture recognition system; eventually to be included in the core system. Demo: Portal 2 played with hand gestures and no keyboard. Another demo: show immersive video conferencing; change the background with the person you are talking with; video conferencing with green screen. One more: eye-tracking, in demo with Tobii Technologies. The demo is a “Where’s Waldo” game. Find Waldo simply by moving eyes.

Eul believes it is too early in the evolution of Intel’s LTE/4G to combine it on a single chip with an Atom processor because the two technologies will iterate at different rates precipitated by different market events. We may see Intel’s LTE/4 modems integrated with a future Atom SoC when another shrink to 14 nm takes place sometime after 2014. To close the gap, Intel will apply to smartphones and tablets the significant systems-level design capability that it honed when nearly monopolizing the X86 PC and server business. Intel will deliver smartphone reference designs that will allow manufacturers to produce complete optimized smartphones using Intel’s components. Intel also acquired carrier certification and approval know-how and relationships with its acquisition of Infineon. Eul’s strategy is to take both the components and reference designs through the lengthy and complex mobile carrier certification and acceptance process and share the certifications with smartphone manufacturers to shorten the time to market for a new smartphone by at least six months. Based on the context of Eul’s comments, Intel might even use its vast supply-chain relationships to deliver an Intel-branded smartphone that cuts approval times</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357609018082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 20:36:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357609596512-98</Id><Topic><Title>CES Webcast</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357593313591</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:15:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I ordered an ACER tower with I7 yesterday.

Actually, they’re calling this particular facility the “SurRoundhouse,” which touches on one of the company’s themes: designing immersive computing experiences. AMD senior VP Lisa Su is playing moderator of the event, which will focus on new products for 2013. Here’s a rundown on what they talked about: Launching HD 8000M series graphics processors for notebooks. Increasing performance by 25% in all categories compared to a year ago. Will be shipping with OEMs this year. In APUs – accelerated processing units, which include both graphics processing and and CPU – Su bring out an Asus exec to show off a new notebook using the system form Asus – the U38 ultrathin, to be specific. Su also showed off an HP notebook using AMD’s APU chip. Su discussed a line of APUs called Richland, which provides 20%-40% performance improvement from 2012. Specifically targets sleek and light designs. Can do things like facial recognition for security logins; gesture control; screen mirroring. (Intel announced some similar capability earlier today.) In the low power space, they are focused on a line of APUs called Kabini. This is a quad-core x86 based system on a chip, targeted at ultra-thin and small form factor PCs. Su is comparing a Kabini with an Intel Core i3 processor; the demo shows Kabini running much faster. Systems with Kabini will appear in first half of 2013 Next, focus on tablet form factor, with a processor called Temash. Up to 100% more performance than Hondo, the predecessor chip. Fastest x86 SOC available for tablets. Runs Windows 8 easily. Su shows Hondo outperforming a tablet based on an Intel Clover Trail tablet; but remember that Hondo is the current generation. Temash can run full 1080p. In passing, she mentions Kaveri is a new line that will succeed Richland in the second half of this year. One last thing: the company is partnering with Vizio on multiple form factors, including notebooks, all-in-ones and tablets. Today Vizio announced a 24-inch all-in-one with touch. They announced two thin and light laptops, in 14 and 15.6 inch sizes. Last but not least, Vizio unveiled today an AMD-powered 11.6-inch tablet PC, with full Windows 8, and 1080p touch screen display.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357611430363</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 21:17:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357611505553-101</Id><Topic><Title>CES: AMD Unveils Kabini, Temash Chip Families; Vizio Partnership On PCs, Tabs</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357611430363</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 21:17:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CES: AMD targets tablets, talks up SurroundHouse January 7, 2013, 8:59 PM Advanced Micro Devices Inc. unveiled a new family of chips at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday, including some low-power consuming ones aimed at the fast-growing tablet market. AMD AMD +0.00% , like rival Intel Corp. INTC -0.09% has been playing catch-up in the tablet market where chips based on ARM Holdings designs are the dominant ones. But on Monday, AMD senior vice president Linda Su noted that “CES probably has more tablets per capita than anywhere.” The company unveiled a slew of new products, including two chips designed for the low-power market. One is code-named Kabini, and is set to ship in ultra-thin laptops in the first half of this year. The other is code-named Temash for tablets and hybrid devices. Both are designed to offer long media consumption and full Windows compatibility in a tablet. Su said the dual-core and quad-core version of Temash would be the fastest x86 chip for tablets, and capable of running full Windows 8. “It’s the best of both worlds,” she said. The press were also encouraged to visit the company’s SurroundHouse tent at CES, which features an immersive computing experience, a big theme of the company’s at the show. Some features its new chips will enable include facial recognition and gesture recognition. The company’s big push in surround computing was described recently by its CTO Mark Papermaster as “an environment where computing interfaces are a more natural and seamless part of daily life. It’s a world without keyboards or mice, where flawless voice and facial recognition redefine the PC experience.”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357611505553</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 21:18:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357611715148-102</Id><Topic><Title>The problem for Intel is design wins.

(QCOM), the largest maker of mobile-phone chips, will accelerate the introduction of faster semiconductors to put more pressure on Intel Corp. (INTC) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), which are targeting the wireless market. Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs is showing off the new Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors today in a keynote speech opening the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chips, which will make their way into phones and tablets by the middle of this year, perform 75 percent faster, according to Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf. San Diego-based Qualcomm climbed IHS iSuppli’s rankings of the largest chipmakers in 2012, jumping three places to trail only Intel and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) by revenue. Benefiting from surging demand for mobile phones, Qualcomm has amassed a 42 percent slice of the mobile-application processor market, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. “The pace of mobile is really accelerating and we think we’re driving it,” Mollenkopf said in an interview. “The game is getting more challenging, and the benefit to the consumer is that you’re going to see much more exciting devices in the market.” Mollenkopf said that Qualcomm, which licenses ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology and designs its own processors, is able to beat its competitors on efficiency, delivering the same performance with half the power in a phone or tablet. The new chips are already in 50 different handsets and mobile computers, he said. Mobile Lineup The new 800-series chip has four processors, each capable of running as fast as 2.3 gigahertz, the company said. It also offers the ability to integrate the latest cellular modem standard, called long term evolution, or LTE, something that no other manufacturer can do, according to Mollenkopf. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is the second-largest maker of applications processors, since it supplies Apple Inc. (AAPL) and manufactures the Exynos chip for its own handsets. It’s also one of Qualcomm’s largest customers. Intel, the largest maker of processors for computers, got its start in phone processors last year, featured in smartphones from Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility Holdings and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) The company has yet to grab more than one percent of the mobile processor market. Intel Push Executives from Intel earlier today outlined plans to introduce new lower-power computer and tablet chips, as it targets the shift to smartphones and tablets. Intel is stepping up efforts to compete in the mobile market as investors bet that Qualcomm is better placed to capture growth. Qualcomm last year surpassed Santa Clara, California-based Intel for the first time to become the largest chipmaker by market value. Intel also plans to offer a quad-core version of its tablet chip lineup, code-named Bay Trail, for devices to be sold during the end-of-year holiday shopping season. Nvidia Corp., whose Tegra components power phones and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)’s Surface tablet, also announced plans to upgrade that product last night at the show.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357614024573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 22:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357614103105-105</Id><Title>QCOM:The new 800-series chip has four processors, each capable of running as fast as 2.3 gigahertz, the company said.

(QCOM), the largest maker of mobile-phone chips, will accelerate the introduction of faster semiconductors to put more pressure on Intel Corp. (INTC) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), which are targeting the wireless market. Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs is showing off the new Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors today in a keynote speech opening the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chips, which will make their way into phones and tablets by the middle of this year, perform 75 percent faster, according to Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf. San Diego-based Qualcomm climbed IHS iSuppli’s rankings of the largest chipmakers in 2012, jumping three places to trail only Intel and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) by revenue. Benefiting from surging demand for mobile phones, Qualcomm has amassed a 42 percent slice of the mobile-application processor market, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. “The pace of mobile is really accelerating and we think we’re driving it,” Mollenkopf said in an interview. “The game is getting more challenging, and the benefit to the consumer is that you’re going to see much more exciting devices in the market.” Mollenkopf said that Qualcomm, which licenses ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology and designs its own processors, is able to beat its competitors on efficiency, delivering the same performance with half the power in a phone or tablet. The new chips are already in 50 different handsets and mobile computers, he said. Mobile Lineup The new 800-series chip has four processors, each capable of running as fast as 2.3 gigahertz, the company said. It also offers the ability to integrate the latest cellular modem standard, called long term evolution, or LTE, something that no other manufacturer can do, according to Mollenkopf. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is the second-largest maker of applications processors, since it supplies Apple Inc. (AAPL) and manufactures the Exynos chip for its own handsets. It’s also one of Qualcomm’s largest customers. Intel, the largest maker of processors for computers, got its start in phone processors last year, featured in smartphones from Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility Holdings and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) The company has yet to grab more than one percent of the mobile processor market. Intel Push Executives from Intel earlier today outlined plans to introduce new lower-power computer and tablet chips, as it targets the shift to smartphones and tablets. Intel is stepping up efforts to compete in the mobile market as investors bet that Qualcomm is better placed to capture growth. Qualcomm last year surpassed Santa Clara, California-based Intel for the first time to become the largest chipmaker by market value. Intel also plans to offer a quad-core version of its tablet chip lineup, code-named Bay Trail, for devices to be sold during the end-of-year holiday shopping season. Nvidia Corp., whose Tegra components power phones and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)’s Surface tablet, also announced plans to upgrade that product last night at the show.</Msg><Username>laops</Username><Timestamp>1357620060422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 23:41:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357620395105-125</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Merrifield To Be Announced At 2013 Mobile World Congress</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357446112906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:21:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Until Merrifield has on-chip LTE, Intel's 2 chip LTE solution will be a power-hog compared to Qualcomm's new Snapdragon with integrated LTE.
