It is for very similar reasons that I have big problems with geekbench. Geekbench runs the floating point benchmark on ARM in single-core scalar mode and multi-core scalarmode. On the x86, it runs same AND adds a single/multi-core VECTOR version. Geekbench forces the x86 to stir in the SCALAR modes of the codes EVEN though it would never execute the code in non-vector form. If everyone is so upset about the inequity of these results, why aren't they upset about the extra scalar results geekbench stirs into their 1 composite number. Invariably a benchmark developer is faced with the decision to chose between how work is done by the tools on the system AND how much of that performance is deliverable using other means. It is very tough. I have no problem with saying that the compiler used being part of the result. SPEC has a BASE LINE and an OPTIMIZED runs that can be submitted. The requirement of BASE LINE is that there be no special flags for a particular benchmark. Benchmarking is tough. If AnTuTu needs a C/C++ compiler, then it is written in C/C++. Any OS exposes an "API" or application programming interface that defines the set of function calls that a programmer writes in his source code to "call" the function. SEARCH FOR application programming interface API The OS ALSO defines an application binary interface (ABI) that defines were the function parameters are placed with the OS gets a function call. SEARCH FOR application binary interface (ABI) It is not hard to write a thin translation layer to match a compiler with an OS interface.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373780160089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 01:36:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373781792116-3</Id><Topic><Title>5 years from now is this a 10 dollar stock?</Title><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373753196901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 18:06:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very, very low odds. Intel currently has a book value of $10.35 per share. Intel is carrying 1970 vintage California land and 1980 vintage Arizona land on their books at purchase price. CA land values have increased by 10x during that time. Intel ONLY changes valuation on the books for property IF there is an IMPAIRMENT of the property value. That means they will only LOWER and not raise the carrying value of property and land. Intel's largest portfolio position is their $3.2 billion share purchase of ASML when it was $49. Today it is $86 and rising. ASML provides the technology to the semiconductor industry so they will track the semi industry. Intel has a VERY strong patent portfolio that is carried on the books at zero. The Intel patents have substantial value to many companies. $10 stock. Maybe, but a very long shot. You will only find 3 professional analysts on earth who think Intel is worth less than $20.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373781792116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 02:03:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373783593258-4</Id><Topic><Title>5 years from now is this a 10 dollar stock?</Title><Username>calloway460cc</Username><Timestamp>1373753196901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 18:06:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a word, NO. Intel is a huge, cash-dripping company who makes the best PC processors in the world. Further, its expertise in design has been expanded to producing more powerful, smaller and efficient chips like Haswell and Silvermont. They are the industry leader. This death of the PC is way, way overblown. Who wants a smartphone or tiny tablet to supposedly replace a REAL computer? Not me, and not a good many of others. Kiddies and braindead adolescents who can't pass most of their courses in school are the big smartphone, tablet users. Those with a brain want a real computer, and not these sensationalized gadgets.

In Android you can have native applications and Java based ones. Most Apps are in Java. The OS itself is mostly written in C. No, it's not possible that both benchmarks are valid. The point of a benchmark is to attempt to create an apples for apples comparison, even basic changes to the compile options invalidates the test (or rather the comparisons to other results). Yes, using ICC would (in many cases) generate better code than GCC. As would using different compile options. As would using ARM's own compiler. All approaches would make the code run faster and produce better scores. Basically ARM code would also run faster using a better compiler and turning on switches that enable optimization. ICC 'eliminated' parts of the test through optimization. This is a legitimate way for compilers to improve performance but it 'breaks' the benchmark as all logic needs to be run for the test to be valid.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1373791517719</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 04:45:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373791963566-9</Id><Topic><Title>AnTuTu Benchmarks - More Questions</Title><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1373757513925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 19:18:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM also has SIMD instruction sets (NEON).

As the #1 shorted stock on the NASDAQ, she is waiting to spring a short squeeze. These two effects combined could see a healthy run-up. The strategist sees a return to a 1980’s-style bull market where price-to-earnings multiples stay close to long-term averages of around 15x. With a lot of portfolio managers underperforming right now, expect the ride to be bumpy, with shallow pullbacks.

"but they could actually make x86 scores better" I think the single core and multicore results both have some meaning. For x86_64, that means that running a single and multi core version using the SIMD instructions that have been part of the instruction set since Nov. 2000 Pentium 4, INCLUDING Atom. If you really think that including the lower scalar numbers in the x86_64 results could make the x86 scores better, then I would like you to show the calculations. I have tried to find the equation used for the composite number, but failed. I just don't believe that there is any way including scalar results could improve the score. I do hope that geekbench3 addresses some of the issues that exist but I have little hope that geekbench3 will be any better. I think that it is 50%-50% that geekbench3 will be worse.

In response to which the ARM commanders scoffed, laughed and pointed to their mighty 40nm walls and said, "No one is getting over our mighty walls. No one!" And besides we already have plans to sack your Server cites and level your PC towns. Then the ARM commanders went to the pubs, had a big old time and didn't think about Intel again until they heard that the Intel fleet had set sail. At which time they again scoffed and laughed saying that Intel had never built a power efficient tank or other weapon of mass destruction and that Intel villages would soon be burned to the ground by their new RT attack group and re-built from the ground up by the later arriving ARM 64-Bit Server Force. And they dismissed out of hand the new rumors of Intel's development of the FinFET technology Armageddon doomsday device as something they could easily match and eclipse by improved design of their existing weapons. And then the ARM commanders went back to the pubs, had another big old time and didn't think about Intel again until they heard that the Intel invasion fleet had landed on the shores of not one but many countries and had established beachheads on numerous coastal hotspots. The ARM commanders then began to urge faster construction of their new 20nm and 16nm half-height walls only to discover that both projects had been seriously delayed with no firm completion dates. Further reports indicated that Intel had built a pipeline to all of its beachheads and was putting more and better weapons of mass destruction through the pipeline in waves. This was accompanied by reports that the RT attack group had been vaporized in its first action. The top ARM commander then packed his bags, loaded up his gold and retired to his palatial country estate. Earlier this week, the (remaining) ARM commanders awoke to find Intel camped just outside the city walls.

Have any of these rumor mongrels picked up and used the latest Apple iMac or Apple Air notebook? They have Intel inside because they are the best processors available. It would take Apple years (and more likely NEVER) to be able catch up with an in house version. It very well could turn out that Apple is trying to gain leverage in upcoming negotiations with Intel to provide fabricating services or actual cutting edge Intel processors for all of Apple's high end devices. Remember the rumor that Apple was ready to use ARM inside their top line laptops and notebooks and replacing Intel forever? Never happened and never will. ARM was also rumored to ready to take over the entire server industry by storm and shut Intel out of that market as well. And now we have the latest benchmarks fiasco brewing. According to some guy the benchmarks are skewed in Intel's favor which gave them a higher score and made ARM look like an underachiever. He said the only way for Intel to come out on top was to jimmy the compiler and cheat. Intel builds and run their own fab factories and no one is even close to competing when it comes to the fabrication of micro processors.

[This is what is called in classic business management as "deworsification". It's when a firm diversifies into a related field thinking that because it's related that they understand how to manage it successfully, when really it takes an whole new set of skills and abilities. They then get beyond their core expertise and disaster results. For Apple to get into the foundry business is quite a bit of hubris. Especially given that all they have access to its third or fourth-rate technology. Of course, you might say that Intel is doing the same thing with its web TV venture. But the difference is that a misstep in the web TV business doesn't jeopardized the core business. With Apple, a misstep with foundry does. And that, very simply, is why it's insane. Totally insane. Now maybe Apple thinks that they can afford a misstep that will cost 5 or 10 billion and a couple of years of time to play out. And maybe they can play other angles at the same time. But the risk to their reputation at a time when the perception is that the post-Jobs era is not going well at all, is immense.

That's a great deal of churn in such a short time -- so what the heck is going on? The Difference Between Talking and "Talking" Is Apple talking to GlobalFoundries? Undoubtedly, yes. GloFo reportedly has unused 28nm capacity and the company would love to add Apple to its list of contracts. Sources claim that the current conversation with GloFo is more serious than previous conversations have been and that Apple may be looking to add second-source capacity. This makes a great deal of sense. TSMC's 40nm ramp was disastrous and the 28nm production cycle, while much smoother, still hit roadbumps and snags. At 20nm, the outlook is grimmer -- for the first time in 40 years, 20nm transistor costs are not expected to drop below 28nm levels, period. A second-source option at GlobalFoundries would give Apple flexibility if TSMC has production trouble without forcing it back to Samsung on short notice. It might also be easier to ramp 28nm parts at GF as compared to TSMC, given that Samsung and GloFo are part of the Common Platform Alliance. It's possible that Apple might be looking at GloFo as a partner to pick up some of its older designs from Samsung while it moves newer projects to TSMC, or it might simply want additional flexibility at future nodes. GloFo is still banging the fully-depleted SOI (FD-SOI) drum, which reportedly offers FinFET like performance on planar silicon, but there are concerns about total production cost as compared to conventional bulk silicon or FinFET technology.

The company is Concurrent (CCUR) and it looks ready to explode to new 52-week highs this week. It is paying a HUGE dividend yield of 6.1%! CCUR was the first company to bring VOD to the market in 2000 when they deployed it for TWC and today, VOD is the fastest growing alternative TV viewing platform in the world - with CCUR's VOD delivery technology reaching 50 million households for a 30% market share. 1/2 of all U.S. TV households now have a DVR, but CCUR is about to make today's DVR technology obsolete with new cloud-based nDVRs. CCUR already deployed a form of its nDVR technology for TWC, which is powering TWC's extremely popular start-over/look-back services. Soon CCUR will begin deploying fully featured nDVR services for its pay-TV clients. CCUR's nDVR technology will allow anybody to record infinite television programs over the cloud, without a DVR box - and be played back on any device - including smartphones and tablets. CCUR closed last week at only $7.88 with a market cap of $68.98 million, cash of $22.37 million, and an enterprise value of $46.61 million or just 0.74X revenues and 6.54X operating cash flow. CCUR's main rival SEAC is about to hit a new 52-week high and is trading for 1.78X revenues and 15.92X operating cash flow. SEAC's valuation ratios would value CCUR between $15.41 and $15.52! Major consolidation is taking place in the cable TV industry and rumors are now circulating that TWC may acquire Cablevision, in order to catch up to Comcast's subscriber base. Cable TV operators are facing more competition than ever before and CCUR's technologies are critical to the success of this $100 billion industry! CCUR's fiscal 3Q 2013 EPS was up 450% from the 4Q of 2012 and CCUR's 10-K filing is coming next month!</Msg><Username>wozof477</Username><Timestamp>1373847544455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 20:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373848809403-60</Id><Title>Intel is like a big house cat declawed and deballed</Title><Msg>Avoid its chicanery.

But leave it to the analysts to invent a story about how Apple could buy GloFo on the cheap and pump more Capex in it than Intel has invested in Capex. It's a rumor that would give ARM a fighting chance against Intel.

In fact, ARM used to think of it as an esoteric subject with no basis in reality. Then Intel close rapidly on power efficiency. Now Intel is over-running the tablet neighborhood and will soon be fighting door-to-door for smartphone territory. The battles are now being fought on ARM's home turf. So, ARM really doesn't have any choice but to fight over benchmarks. It's come down to this. It's like hand-to-hand now. And here is how it came to this: Intel (All FinFET): 22nm: Haswell June 2013 14nm: Broadwell: End of 2013/Start of 2014 14nm: Skylake: 2015 10nm: Skymont: 2016 7nm: 2018 5nm: 2020 ARMH Planar 28nm: Production has been increasing but is still insufficient to meet market demand. Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. FinFET 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits. Intel's lead in fabrication and manufacturing is increasing in virtually every area</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373856935673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373857152115-69</Id><Title>What happens when Intel guides over $14 billion and GM over 60% for Q3 and reiterates full year estimates?</Title><Msg>U-P-G-R-A-D-E-S!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373857152115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:59:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373857424299-70</Id><Topic><Title>What We know Now: Game of Thrones Edition</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373832743677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 16:12:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is bringing dragons...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373857424299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:03:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373857812450-71</Id><Topic><Title>What We know Now: Game of Thrones Edition</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373832743677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 16:12:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Red wedding coming up for arm...it's not going to be pretty youtubeDOTcom/watch?v=78juOpTM3tE</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373857812450</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:10:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373857986546-72</Id><Title>The questioin can INTC drop to $19 on earnings? on Lower revenue, Lower earnings and Lower margins</Title><Msg>The questioin can INTC drop to $19 on earnings? on Lower revenue, Lower earnings and Lower margins</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373857986546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373858576300-73</Id><Topic><Title>The questioin can INTC drop to $19 on earnings? on Lower revenue, Lower earnings and Lower margins</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373857986546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's revenues are increasing.

I understand the bear argument that the PC market is going to fall faster than Intel gains in the phone and tablet market, but most analysts are making a rather frank and obvious near term statement, and all are unwilling to state what it should mean for longer term investors. The short term bear thesis is going to depend on when the PC market bottoms out, and by how much. But no one is saying that Intel can't return to being a growth business in the future, but only whether they can hit their targets this quarter or year. Meanwhile, the bull thesis looks 2-5 years out, and sees things getting better and better.
