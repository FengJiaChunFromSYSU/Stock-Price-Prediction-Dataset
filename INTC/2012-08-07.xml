Aren't companies required to disclose loss of large customers immediately? If we take Samsung's foundry business, Apple provides 75% of the revenues. However, it will be a minor part of Samsung's total revenues. Then again, Samsung is registered only in Seoul, London, and Luxemburg. Not sure what rules apply to them.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344314153000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:35:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344317063000-3</Id><Topic><Title>First Ultrabook under $600 as a new wave of price cuts looms</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344302455000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 21:20:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>High performance laptops now in the iPad price range.

GS James Covello continues to be fixated and wrong about Intel margins. Aug 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the U.S. semiconductor sector to "attractive," citing healthy supply and attractive valuations and raised its rating on Freescale Semiconductor Holdings Ltd , Applied Materials Inc and LSI to "buy". Semiconductor unit shipments have been 10 to 20 percent below normalized demand since the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in healthy supply levels at customers, Goldman analysts wrote in a note to clients. The brokerage expects lean supply to mitigate lower near-term demand and eventually drive a strong cyclical recovery. Goldman downgraded Atmel Corp to "neutral" from "buy," citing weaker-than-expected demand for its smartphone touch controllers. It retained chipmakers Altera Corp and NXP Semiconductors NV as its top picks after beat-and-raise quarters. The brokerage also said it continues to expects margin weakness at Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices due to excess supply. "We believe Intel's orders could decline as it has record inventory," the brokerage said. https://research.tdwaterhouse.ca/research/public/Markets/NewsArticle/1314-L6E8J20XY-1</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1344347738000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344347772000-12</Id><Title>More Elusive</Title><Msg>Romney's tax return or Obama's birth certificate?</Msg><Username>bozoweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344347772000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:56:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344348289000-13</Id><Topic><Title>More Elusive</Title><Username>bozoweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344347772000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:56:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Signed by Romney.

Information on pricing and technical characteristics of the device is to be announced later,” RIA Novosti quoted Yulia Dorokhina, Megafon’s press secretary, as saying on Monday. Fighting to win market share Intel confirmed that it was planning to release a smart phone featuring its processors on the local market in an effort to win back the mobile devices market, which was largely held by rival processors ARM. Devices based on the Intel Atom processor have already been released in India and Britain. The Intel-powered smart phones all run on the Android operating system. Under 20,000 rubles Earlier, Intel’s regional director for Russia, Dmitry Konash, said that the company was holding talks with all of the major mobile providers over distributing its products. He said that operator-provided Intel smart phones could be sold for less than 20,000 rubles even before any mobile provider subsidies were taken into consideration. The Lava XOLO X900, which runs on the Intel Atom (Medfield) processor and sports a 4-inch display, 8-megapixel camera and 16 GB of memory, recently went on sale in India for approximately $400, while the Intel-powered LePhone K800 with a 4.5-inch display, 8-megapixel camera and 16 GB of memory, just appeared on the market in China for a little over $500. http://themoscownews.com/business/20120806/190045995.html</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344349131000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:18:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344349891000-16</Id><Title>INTC is UNDERPERFORMING</Title><Msg>so what's new???</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1344349891000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:31:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>47</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344350040000-17</Id><Title>Can INTC Squeeze a Dime Out of Today's Rally?</Title><Msg>The Magic 8-Ball sez: "NO WAY!"</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1344350040000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:34:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>47</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344351244000-18</Id><Title>Intel Insider Selling</Title><Msg>http://wallstcheatsheet.com/investing/intel-evp-sells-50k-shares-and-4-insider-trades-grabbing-attention-now.html/?ref=YF</Msg><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1344351244000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:54:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344352722000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Insider Selling</Title><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1344351244000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WS Cheatsheet shows the 50k trade by Arvand Sohani.

So cost of production (which impacts margins) is critical for Intel continuing to deliver good results. When will Intel reach cost-parity with ARM-based vendors? Are they already there? Or, will they reach such parity at 22nm or 14nm? Once Intel reaches cost-parity or lower cost than ARM vendors, the ARM camp has to compete more aggressively to win business. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes at that time. (2) Intel Smartphones Running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean: Intel Medfield runs Gingerbread, Jelly Bean shoud be here soon (MIPS Karbonn phone has been introduced running 4.1 Jelly Bean, Intel can't be far behind). (3) Intel Tablets running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean: No Android-based Tablets yet, hopefully the same 4.1 Jelly Bean compatibility is what they are waiting on...if so, again, they can't be far behind. (4) Performance/Battery: Intel-based phones have been introduced showing they can compare well with current devices. New Atoms featuring dual cores for Tablets is key to show better performance vis-a-vis Tegra/Snapdragon/Exynos. When will these new Atoms come out?</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1344371275000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:27:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344371701000-48</Id><Topic><Title>When does INTC get to $50?</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1344364775000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 14:39:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow</Msg><Username>boiled_n_oil</Username><Timestamp>1344371701000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:35:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344372155000-49</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Flopping like a Fish out of Water.

They were a thorn in the side of their largest competitor. When this competitor had enough they went into the small company's largest two accounts and gave them a price below the small company's cost. The large company was known as Exxon Mobile. The small company is gone and the two years are up and today Mobile gets their price. What you will see next year is consolidation. Samsung, Apple and Qualcom will survive, I am not so certain about the rest. I love how D.A.N. tells stories about TSMC's flying through 28nm to 20nm. Nobody can inflict as much pain and damage in the industry as Intel. If Intel wasn't such a big threat he wouldn't waste his time thinking about Intel. Sooner or later Intel will fill capacity, get their price and their margin. And they will go 'Exxon' on any company that dares stand in their way.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1344377467000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344378898000-51</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Insider Selling</Title><Username>wallisweiner</Username><Timestamp>1344351244000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Proof !

Romney also paid zero in 2010, which is why he released an UNSIGNED copy of the 2010 forms.</Msg><Username>lucy.spam</Username><Timestamp>1344395771000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 23:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344397608000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Release your collage records Oshow</Title><Username>democratsoutoftouch22</Username><Timestamp>1344391875000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:11:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rombumble showed a 104-page UNSIGNED document that he says is his 2010 taxes. The document is signed by the preparer but must be signed by the TAXPAYER. Take a look. What page of the "final" 2010 tax form 1040 did Mitt sign? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm???????????????????? Why did Rombumble have loss carry forwards left for his 2010 taxes? Because he had more than enough to cover all his income for 2008 and 2009. I know how to read the forms. You should ask someone at Fox to help you understand them. Better yet, watch something other than Fox and Rush. Get a true fair and balanced view. Only watch Fox 50% of the time. YoBama released his birth certificate DURING the 2008 campaign. Not good enough, EXCEPT for the Republican Party and John McCain. YoBama released his birth certificate AGAIN Apr. 27, 2011. Not good enough, EXCEPT for the Republican Party and John McCain.</Msg><Username>lucy.spam</Username><Timestamp>1344397608000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 23:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
