Customers have always decided with their own money what level of computing power they want and what price they will pay for it, marketing had very little to do with it. 'ARM doesn't really have competition from Intel in mobile because unlike Intel's view of the real market picture, the competition for mobile is not on performance as Intel would have us believe but better battery life and better integration of features such as radios and graphics subsystems. Intel has never played this game before. Its used to dictating terms and that shows in its approach to this market too.' Medifeld beats the latest Snapdragon on both javascript performance and overall application battery life in the exact same phone. The next phone chip still at 32nm, CloverTrail+ will have dual-core with 4 total threads, LTE, and a 533 MHz SGX543MP2 which will match any other phone chip in graphics performance.

Its best case scenario is Motorola which is backed by Google of Android fame not Samsung which is still behind Apple in terms of market image. Its improvements in performance are not going to be enough to compete with the industry leading design powerhouse on the overall customer experience. The current dynamic suggests it will become a fringe player with say 10% of the mobile chip market optimistically speaking. Not very lucrative considering how much competition it will face from established players for that 10%.

But I think they will - by extending the SKU's up and down. Intel will target a CPU/SoC against each competitive CPU/SoC and offer price/performance advantages to OEMs (Intel has repeatedly and successfully done this against AMD). Intel's competitors will have to compete intensely with its lower-end SKUs. I recall Microsoft got into trouble by talking about cutting-off the air supply for Netscape by making the browser available free for commercial use. Intel will seek to do the same to its competition by keeping margins to a minimum for the lower-end SKUs and let its competition bleed - while delivering higher-end SKUs for good, decent margins. (Lower margins/prices benefit consumers, so to my knowledge, a manufacturer keeping margins/prices low are not a basis for anti-trust laws to kick in.) The icing on the cake might be Intel keeping its usual margins on lower-end SKUs due to its process/node advantages while bleeding the competition dry. While Intel will sell a lot of lower-end SKUs, it will also sell higher-end SKUs for good, decent margins. Intel has repeatedly pointed out how their own Celerons and Pentiums (lower-end) don't find favor with a lot of buyers who want to move up the chain to a higher-end CPU since it is a item purchases for 2-4 years of use. So I expect Intel to continue selling huge volumes of higher-end SKUs as well. We'll see how this all plays out.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1350655689208</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:08:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350656263273-31</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>mariannazvn308</Username><Timestamp>1350651374373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:56:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very informative.

Do you think if you repeat a lie enough times it suddenly becomes true ? There are analysts who do detailed Intel sku price/volume breakdowns like Mercury and they are usually found repeated on sites like Investorvillage. Why don't you go look one up before opening your mouth and proving you're a fool rather than just letting us suspect it. Also Intel has never truly been a monopoly in the x86 industry, when AMD brought out Athlon and Athlon 64 it caused a major shock to Intel prices, profits and marketshare. It recovered by outdesigning and outfabricating AMD which is exactly what it will do to all the ARM pretenders who covet its profits. AMD has been in Intel's palm ever since Core 2 Duo and it has skus as cheap as ARM now but which are still better performing yet still they have no effect on Intel's pricing. If AMD couldn't do it then ARM has no chance with relatively anemic designs like A15 and S4 which can't even beat Atom.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350656571679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:22:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350656847659-33</Id><Topic><Title>NYK2OH gets his tail kicked by Marsavian, part 1</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350649302914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:21:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The reason Intel is a $100B company is because it makes chips for $50 and sells them for $300. If they start selling chips for $100, they will be a $2 stock." [Your ignorance of Intel never fails to impress. Intel's management of pricing and margins is the most sophisticated in the world. They are masters at managing capacity and shutting down excess capacity. They have well-developed, highly-evolved systems for doing this. And this is why what you suggest will never happen. And, of course, you have failed to note that prices on the highest end of technology are being raised. This is exactly what TSMC is doing for its non-state-of-the-art 28nm production. And guess what? The predominant share of Intel's business is going to be 22nm very quickly because the Intel ramp is so superior to that of TSMC and the ARM world. You don't know enuff to be even a moderately good shill. Study up. Until then quit posting. You just embarrass yourself, Chump Street Boy...] "Intel's operating costs are far higher than its competition. The only thing keeping it afloat is monopoly pricing in the 8086 CPU market. That pricing power is eroding and THERE IS NOTHING INTEL can do to get it back." [Well there's that shill approach of using a lot of CAPS to make up for lack of knowledge. Again, companies pay for the high end and pricing there is not eroding. What will be eroding is ARMs pricing since it is not state-of-the-art...] ''But that's OK - in your fantasy world, I'm sure everything works out just fine." [Intel's fabrication will insure that all works out fine. It's all about the fabrication, shill child...] [PS. Hey, Wall Street - where's the MISS??? The huge honking miss you projected.

And here is where WS goes stupid is Intel the ONLY one that has to deliver super high margins in mobile? TSMC makes a good portion on DEPRECIATED production lines - Intel can use "traditional" CPU business to cover depreciation - those ARM fan boys should take agood look at TSMC 2013 capex projections - ARM has far more challenge to maintain its margin structure because in the past they were spoiled - just 12 months ago process technology / manufacturing was no issu for ARM. No suddenly TSMC chasing FinFets and EUV. TI exiting mobile - how come nobody asked WHY - because TI realized they can make better returns in Analog rather sitting in the ARM SoC frying pan. QCOM and NVDA have to choice (to fall back on alternative business- sink or swim. It's well documented that QCOM CEO is VERY concerned about fabless economics going forward From: Will Finfets Affect ARM? Next year is slated for the introduction of Atom-based handset SOCs from Intel out on its 22nm finfet process, will that make Intel's wireless chip-sets competitive? No, says ARM's CEO Warren East. "We expect the 22nm process will give them some advantage in power consumption, but whether that advantage is sufficient to make them competitive remains to be seen," Warren East told me a couple of weeks ago, "they're saying the process will give them 20% more power efficiency but they're a lot more than 20% less efficient than ARM." Asked the same question, Mike Bryant replies: "Unlike in small systems where it is key, in big systems, which smartphones most definitely are nowadays, the instruction set used is far less relevant with only 10% to 15% of power dealing with it. So even if ARM waved magic dust on their instruction set, which isn't perfect anyway, they can only optimise 10% to 15% of the power used. More power goes in moving data around the chip, and most goes to moving data on and off the chip to memory and peripherals." "ARM programs can actually use a few percent more codespace than Intel but let's say they are the same," adds Bryant, "next of course the data either processor has to be moved around - be it pictures, voice data, HTML or just the call set-up protocol, is identical for each processor. Finally the video data has to be transferred onto the display and for all the hype ARM's Mali is about the same as GPUs from Intel or Nvidia, though there are slightly more efficient solutions from Imagination Technologies or Qualcomm's Adreno." "So for a pure ARM system against a pure Intel system, 85% of the power usage is independent of the processor instruction set and dependent purely on the process technology," concludes Bryant.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1350658204165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350658268661-42</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>mariannazvn308</Username><Timestamp>1350651374373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:56:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just joined.

Now the nearest Atom SoC rival to these ARM chips is the 1.7W 1.8GHz Clovertrail arkDOTintelDOTcom/products/70105/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z2760-1MB-Cache-1_80-GHz Even assuming perfect descaling of performance with clockspeed decrease (unlikely) i.e. 1.80/2.13 = 84% you would still get 1.21, 1, 1.54 advantage factors for Atom so it still does not get beaten. Now this Clovertrail part has an on die memory controller which means the ~20ns latency associated with desktop Atom's FSB is removed so that will more than make up for the 16% clock decrease in many cases. So it is true what I said, Atom is not beaten by current ARM chips on integer performance (which is the most important for commercial applications) and definitely won't be per core by any planned ARM chip for the foreseeable future.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350664266902</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350666148534-65</Id><Topic><Title>Protect your 401k don't let them turn them in to 201k's again</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1350660918330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 11:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And just how do we do that: Sell everything now?

What’s really changing is the shader loadout; Intel will offer Haswell in 10, 20, and 40-shader flavors (GT1, GT2, and GT3). The chip will also be offered in variants that include up to 128MB in on-package RAM, a feature that provides the GPU with a small dedicated pool of memory. Intel isn’t talking much about the GPU changes, but the company has stated that the new GT3 configuration offers “up to 2x” the performance of Ivy Bridge’s HD 4000 graphics. Even a conservative take on that promise spells trouble for AMD and Nvidia. According to figures from Anandtech, Trinity’s GPU is an average of 18% faster than Llano’s across a range of 15 popular titles. Compared to Sandy Bridge, Trinity was almost 80% faster. Against Ivy Bridge, it’s just 20% faster. Given what we know of Haswell’s GPU shader counts and performance targets, it shouldn’t be hard for Intel to deliver a 30-50% performance boost in real-world games. If it does, Trinity goes from the fastest integrated GPU on the market to an also-ran, and AMD loses the superior graphics hole card it’s been playing since it launched the AMD 780G chipset four years ago.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1350672470033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 14:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350672937950-98</Id><Topic><Title>NYK2OH gets his tail kicked by Marsavian, part 1</Title><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1350649302914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:21:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even assuming perfect descaling of performance with clockspeed decrease (unlikely) i.e. 1.80/2.13 = 84% you would still get 1.21, 1, 1.54 advantage factors for Atom so it still does not get beaten.

The reality is even the A9 can beat Atom in floating point.

SMD: Will EUV make 10nm? And if it doesn’t, what effect will that have on Intel? Bohr: For a process module as critical as lithography, Intel always has more than one option we pursue. In this era, the options are either EUV or 193nm immersion with multi-patterning. SMD: How about directed self-assembly? Bohr: That’s not a universally usable approach. You still need to define some layers with direct patterning, not a self-assembly technique. That’s a niche direction that will not replace these mainstream lithography techniques, but there may be some layers where it can complement the normal patterning techniques. SMD: What’s your opinion about the future of the foundry business? Bohr: The traditional foundry model is running into problems. In order to survive, the foundries will have to become more like an integrated device manufacturer. Even some of the chief spokespeople for the foundries have said something similar. The foundry model worked well when traditional scaling was being followed and everybody knew where we were headed. In this era, where you continually have to invent new materials and new structures, it’s a lot tougher being a separate foundry and maskless design house. Being an IDM, we have design and process development under one roof. That’s really a significant advantage. SMD: Can even Intel afford to be an independent IDM? The cost of building state-of-the-art fabs at future nodes is astronomical. Bohr: Yes. We have the volume and the products that can fill multiple fabs. SMD: But you’ve also opened up your fabs to at least a couple customers. Are you planning on extending that? , Bohr: Our motivation is that we know we have great process technology, and partnering with other strategic companies can be a win-win situation. We can sell our technology and make more money off what we’ve developed, and they can have some very compelling products. It’s not Intel’s goal to be a general-purpose foundry, but we will be partnering where it makes strategic sense. SMD: Is Intel sticking to bulk CMOS or will move to new materials such as fully depleted SOI? Bohr: We see more advantages in bulk than SOI. I won’t say SOI won’t be in the future. There may be some device structure that is better done in SOI than bulk. But I don’t see than happening right now. When we first announced that we were making TriGate or finFET devices at 22nm, we said we’re making these devices on SOI, as well. But we think there are cost advantages to doing TriGate on bulk rather than SOI. That’s our plan for the foreseeable future. SMD: What comes after the current finFET? Bohr: The finFET is scalable to 14nm. SMD: But if you’re at 22nm, 14nm isn’t very far away, so you’ve got to be working on the next step. Bohr: For Intel, you’re right. For other companies, it’s many years away. For 10nm, which is where I’m spending most of my time these days, I know we have a solution. I can’t elaborate at this point. SMD: At 10nm aren’t you running into quantum effects? Bohr: Everything gets different and tougher, but the problems are solvable—at least at that generation. SMD: How far ahead can you see? Bohr: I know we can get to 10nm. Beyond that, our research group is working on solutions for 7nm and 5nm. I have confidence we’ll have solutions for those. But by the time we’re down to 5nm we’ll be looking at non-familiar devices and device structures. That’s what we’ll have to do to get down to that level. SMD: Where do stacked die fit into your roadmap? Bohr: 3D stacked die have advantages, but only for certain market segments. You have to be very clear about what problem and what market segment you’re trying to serve. For a small handheld application where a small footprint and form factor are key and power levels are low, it probably makes good sense to use 3D stacking. For desktop, laptop and server applications where form factor isn’t as valuable and power levels are higher, 3D stacking has some problems that make it not an ideal solution. SMD: Along those lines, does Intel see the smart phone and small mobile device market as a key direction? Bohr: Intel is very serious about getting into the smart phone and tablet markets. We are a very different company from what we were five or six years ago. We are developing process technologies, but also products, that span a much wider range of performance and power than anywhere in our history. We’re not just after the high-performance desktop. We’re developing products that support 100-watt server chips down to sub-1 watt smart phone chips. SMD: There are a number of interesting techniques Intel is working with, such as near-threshold computing. How will power management start changing inside these chips? Bohr: When you’re talking about developing a smart phone chip that is ultra low power that also provides improved performance features that the market expects, you have to pull every trick out of the bag. You need great transistor technology, great package technology, great CPU architectures, the ability to turn off parts of the chip when you don’t need them so you’re saving power, the software links with the chip design so the software knows when to throttle power down. You need transistors, CPU architecture and software to be effective in that space. SMD: How many cores will be required in the future? Bohr: It depends on the market. In the server market, the more cores you can pack on the better. But in desktops, laptops and smart phones, there’s probably a limit to how many cores are practical. It’s not one. It’s probably several. SMD: But less than eight? Bohr: Yes, probably less than eight. But when you talk about the number of cores and computing engines, it depends on whether you’re dealing with traditional computing tasks where four cores are better than two cores. If you’re talking about execution engines in a graphics processor, clearly you want more cores. SMD: What does this do for Intel’s platform strategy, particularly as you go after many markets with very specific needs? Bohr: Even for Intel there are probably an optimal number of chip designs. It’s not like in the past where we tried to make one size fit all or have one chip serve multiple markets. But on the other hand, trying to design and manufacture dozens of very different designs in a generation is also impractical. There’s an optimal number of designs, although I don’t know what that number is, that can best meet the market requirements. You want to make as few iterations between the different designs as you can or re-use the cores or some of the circuit blocks between the different chips so you’re not completely redesigning it. SMD: Are there other materials being considered for transistors? Bohr: Our research group has been publishing papers about using 3-5 materials http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_materials for the channels. You deposit indium phosphide or gallium arsenide layer on top of silicon to make a transistor on the surface. It’s still a silicon wafer, but you’re looking at depositing more exotic materials. That’s new and different and it may happen, but it’s not yet fully resolved how good that approach may be. SMD: Has the priority for what you’re designing into a chip changed? Is it still all about performance, or has power overtaken that? Bohr: Ten or 15 years ago, performance was the main goal in developing a new process technology. That really has gone away as the No. 1 priority. We still strive to provide a performance boost with each new technology, but there’s much more emphasis on improving power or efficiency on each new generation. We do that by reducing active power for the work a chip does. That’s a much more important goal for us today. Part of the reason is that the market has shifted from desktop applications to more mobile products. The first transition was from desktops to laptops. Now the move is to put things into smart phones. Today’s consumer wants computing power he can hold in his hand in the form factor of a smart phone and a tiny battery. He wants the performance he had on his laptop only three or four years ago. That’s what we shoot for. SMD: That shifts the biggest challenge to the architecture, right? Bohr: Yes. Whether it’s low-power, low-leakage transistors or a more efficient core architecture—or linking that with more efficient software. SMD: What becomes the next big bottleneck? Bohr: We have lots of challenges. Lithography is the key challenge in making transistors smaller. Whether EUV will happen on time or we have to extend immersion using multiple patterning. But when you make transistors smaller they don’t become less leaky. In fact, the opposite is true. You have to continually invent new structures and materials to allow feature-size scaling, which is critical for active power reduction and for cost. SMD: But wires don’t scale well. How do you deal with that? Bohr: RC delay gets worse as you scale, compared with transistors, which tend to get faster as you scale down. The industry has had 20-plus years of struggling with that problem. One way we’ve addressed that is that we’re no longer striving for very high operating frequency, especially in the phone market where 2 or 2.5GHz would probably be sufficient. That’s one advantage. The other advantage is that the average size of the chips is smaller in these laptop and cell phone applications so you don’t have interconnects traveling a long distance across a large chip. Instead, it’s a more compact chip so the signals don’t have to go as far. But even with those chips, we still have a challenge of performance from the interconnect. We have to be clever about what pitches we choose. Some of the lower layers are dense pitch, where density is important. Some of the upper layers are coarser pitch, where performance is important. We’re also continuing to drive down interconnect capacitance by employing lower-k dielectrics. SMD: Is the interconnect becoming more problematic? Bohr: If you talk to a designer 10 years ago you would have heard the same thing. Maybe now they’re saying, ‘This time we’re really serious.’ SMD: How about new interconnect technology? Bohr: It’s hard to replace copper and low-k other than by making lower k. But at least in the low-power cell phone market, stacking chips does help to minimize some of the interconnect issues, particularly between the logic and the memory chips. SMD: You’re referring to through-silicon vias? Bohr: Yes. SMD: So if Intel is planning to get into that market, the company is experimenting with that technology right now? Bohr: Yes, and we’ve been public about exploring TSV and 3D technology for a couple years. Although there are some challenging technology aspects, the real issue is cost. Doing TSVs and stacking chips—especially these custom Wide I/O chips—is expensive. So this might be a better engineering solution in terms of density, performance and power, but will the market bear the added cost? Not all markets will bear the higher cost.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350675392115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 15:36:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350676180395-116</Id><Title>The only reason that Intel is surviving to this point....</Title><Msg>Is the fact that a #$%$ is running a AMD!

In 2013, foundry CapEx is expected to fall 1% to 20.9 billion, according to the firm. TSMC will see its CapEx jump from $8 billion in 2012 to $9 billion in 2013, but Samsung LSI’s CapEx will fall from 8 trillion won in 2012 to 6 trillion won in 2013, according to the firm. “We model GlobalFoundries CapEx inching up slightly to $3.7 billion in 2013 from $3.4 billion in 2012, and UMC CapEx moving slightly higher to $2 billion in 2013 from $1.8 billion in 2012,” said C.J. Muse, an analyst with Barclays. Muse also predicts total CapEx will fall about 5% in 2012, compared to flat in the previous forecast. He lowered his overall CapEx outlook for 2013 to minus 10%, compared to flat to minus 5% in the previous forecast.

GlobalFoundries, which earlier this year passed UMC to become the No.2 foundry, has rapidly narrowed the technology gap enjoyed by TSMC over its foundry rivals. GF actually has had a significantly higher percentage of its sales coming from 45nm and below process technologies than TSMC (55% vs. 26% in 2011, 65% vs. 37% in 2012), thanks to its MPU-centric focus.

Pretty funny. He was talking about AMD. WEDNESDAY Anders said that Intel was a BUY. Why Intel Is a Buy Right Now By Anders Bylund Oct 17th FRIDAY Anders decribed AMD. I Give Up On This Zombie Stock! By Anders Bylund October 19, 2012 Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD ) just reported a disastrous third quarter. How bad was it? Let me count the ways: •Sales plunged 25% year over year, but we knew that already. •The year-ago period's $0.15 of non-GAAP earnings per share morphed into a loss of $0.20 per share. •AMD had to write off $100 million of chip inventory that nobody wanted to buy. AMD isn't fixing this by working harder to create great products. The company is running in the opposite direction by... •...firing 15% of its workforce in a cost-cutting panic. The new goal for operating expenses is to break even at quarterly revenue of roughly $1.3 billion, and it'll take about four quarters to get there. Just to rub salt in the fresh wound, rumor has it that AMD's guillotine will fall in exactly the wrong place, with most of the cuts coming from the engineering department -- the one place where AMD could save itself by investing more and getting better. Say it ain't so! I hope that rumor is totally false. Sadly, it seems like exactly the thing a purely financial dude like CEO Rory Read would do. Predecessor Dirk Meyer was an engineer himself, and would never have gotten AMD into this unholy mess. Look, bad things happen to good companies. But the great ones roll up their sleeves and fight back. AMD's cost-cutting instinct reminds me of a zombie's fixation on brains.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1350685249658</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 18:20:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350686778912-136</Id><Topic><Title>Who gets the dividend?</Title><Username>pawtp</Username><Timestamp>1350668258340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 13:37:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you short a stock for the dividend?

Those were the peaks after the bubble of a bunch of fools thinking the computer age was new (it was in 1985 and before) collapsed in on itself starting in March of 2000 with the semiconductor stocks getting the brunt of the collapse, by March 2003 the markets bottomed and INTC and the SMH rallied to their recovery peaks in 2004, price levels not seen since those peaks and well above where they are now. By 2009, the SMH had INTC had fallen well below the March 2003 lows. As even any die hard long has to know, during this minor overall market correction, the SMH now sits well below it's May high which was above the overbght high hit when INTC last hit close to 27.50, the semis have dramatically underperformed the market. As sure as night follows day, there will be another recession, and when it comes, the semis will do what they have been doing for years, dramatically underperform the market. Brag all you want about have a 5 figure number of INTC shares from under 21.00. It's a mere .29 above that level, a net cost of sitting on ones hands of 8.00 times the number of shares owned. and anyone who has been holding INTC for 20 years should be horsewhipped or worse, for not selling at the peak of the idiotic bubble of 2000 when INTC was 80 and the SMH 100.00. I am not saying INTC is a sell at current levels, I am saying there is no such thing as a good long term investment in any semiconductor stock, and there will most assuredly at some point likely in the near future, be another recession. In the near future, if the markets head back up, I'll go long again, likely the QLD. When they go down, the SQQQ.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1350702507064</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:08:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350703844790-156</Id><Topic><Title>intel should buy amd</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1350688642783</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:17:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A quick and dirty look at revenue / headcount: QCOM 19/21 INTC 53/104 TSMC 19/36 and AMD (fabless) 5.6/11 that's the real zombie part Bain capital should buy it and sell it in pieces</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1350703844790</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:30:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350705453913-157</Id><Topic><Title>Intel at this price - Excellent Long term investment, sketchy short term investment</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1350693818035</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 20:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wdblahblahblah, guys like you are worthless to society. Brag? How about your idiot #$%$ bragging about buying Intel at 19.58 last year, selling it 20 cents later at 19.78 at MAX Capital gains and then yelling at Longs for not doing the same. How much did that trade net you after Max taxes, Dork? You CAN'T invest, so you can't speak about investing. Thanks for dodging the question about those that INVESTED (foreign word to tools like) in Intel 20 years ago and held or even bought 20 years ago and sold at 70. You're a deadbeat.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1350705453913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:57:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
