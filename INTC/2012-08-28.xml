GS is prepared to screw with the whole world economy to make money (e.g. sub-prime crisis, oil price manipulation etc), you think they care about your outrage in trying to downplay INTC in comparison to these global machinations ? The Vampire Squid's human tentacles will just laugh at your letter and throw darts at it for amusement. GS doesn't control INTC anyway, it is the widespread fear that tablets/phones will kill Intel processor growth that is doing that as evinced by the recent DELL/HPQ results. Until that fear is fully assuaged INTC will always have a headwind against it. Silvermont/Airmont will eventually assuage that fear as its superiority is demonstrated against the latest ARM A15/S4 products and INTC will then appreciate to its true valuation which is around $50. Until then save your breath and outrage and treat these dips as buying opportunities.</Msg><Username>mas77795</Username><Timestamp>1346155160210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346156592126-6</Id><Title>Top Haswell chipset is Z87</Title><Msg>Haswell comes in Q2 2013 and we have already mentioned the launch window in a few previous articles. The new platform is supposed to last through 2014. It uses the new LGA1150 socket, requiring new chipsets and new boards from the current 7 series chipset tailored for Ivy and Sandy Bridge Core processors. The new overclocking king of Haswell chipsets is simply called Z87 and is represents the top breed of Intel’s 8-series desktop chipsets. It can support either PCIe 1x16, 2x8 or 1x8+ 2x4, something that should satisfy most gamers. The new chipset comes with integrated voltage regulators, I/O port flexibility (SATA,USB 3, PCIe ), comes with integrated triple display support via Haswell processor, HDMI, DVI, DP and eDP as well as good old VGA. Intel will introduce Rapid Storage Technology 12 that includes fast sync streaming, Lake Tiny tech, UEFI fast boot support, SATA 6 Gb/s support, Raid 0/1/5/10, rapid recovery technology, smart responsive technology as well as TRIM on Raid 0 SSD configurations. It doesn’t come with small business advantage technology support, Intel has the H87 for small business users, but it does include 14 USBs of which 4 are USB 3.0 ports. Of course, 6 SATA 6Gb/s, eight PCI express 2.0 5GT/s. two DIMM modules per channel are supported and the new chipset should also be good for overclocking. Let’s not forget the Gigabit Ethernet MAC. Of course this chipset should be ready by Q1 2013 to meet the launch of the Haswell CPUs scheduled for Q2 2013.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346156592126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 08:23:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346156946955-7</Id><Title>Haswell starts from $184</Title><Msg>Quad-core Intel is working hard to prepare the groundwork for its next generation of Core processors. Codenamed Haswell, this will be Intel’s fourth Core generation. Haswell should debut in Q2 2013 to replace current generation Ivy Bridge processors and it looks like Haswell will start at $184 for tray and $195 for boxed desktop parts. The most affordable Haswell replaces the current Core i5 3470, a 3.2GHz quad-core with a turbo clock of 3.6GHz at 77W TDP. Of course, Haswell parts should end up better spec’d and faster but we don’t know the exact numbers just yet. At first glimpse it looks like Haswell is coming to the desktop space only as a quad core processor, as so far we only seen it replacing quad-core Core i5 chips and not the dual-core Core i3 market segment at launch. This can change if necessary but we believe that Intel is drifting from dual-cores to quad-cores in this market segment, leaving duals to the more TDP sensitive notebook market. We hope to see the Haswell in action just a few weeks from now as Intel prepares for its biggest event this year called IDF, scheduled to kick off on September 11th 2012.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346156946955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 08:29:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346157182694-8</Id><Title>Intel/McAfee building quite the porfolio</Title><Msg>SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- McAfee today announced the availability of a free public beta of McAfee Social Protection, a new app for Facebook that protects users’ photos from being shared without their permission.

I'm too busy to talk to you. I just got back from TSMC where my lips were attached to Morris Chang's rear. I couldn't hear what he was saying so well from down there, but I think he said that TSMC is making 28nm processors at full speed, and they are making 100% of what is being sold. That is until next month when the iPhone5 will debut with an ARM 20nm processor from TSMC. I think that's what he said. His English is a bit rough and I couldn't hear that well. So don't quote me. Even though I am probably wrong you can find it on my blog. You know the address! That picture on the blog is a picture of my new car, it's a sweet ride. Maybe you guys can drive it sometime as you park it the restaurant. Oh, that lady next to the car, that's my hot wife. She's a sweet ride also. Yeah, we've been together 20 years! And you said that Russian mail order bride marriages never last? But for you Intel fans out there I wrote my junk about Intel that isn't true. It's a follow up to the story I posted earlier this year about Ivy Bridge having leakage problems. Of course that story's been all over the news every night for the past few months. Wait, it hasn't? Am I the only one who has the nerve to say it? Well, you know my motto, 'If I print it, it has to be true.' Well ladies I have to run, I have to think up my #$%$ to say about Intel on my board. All it would take is for Intel to pay me a little attention. If Paul Otellini only would just take me to a ball game, buy me a red balloon, give me an Intel cap, and let me complain about Intel the entire time I would be happy. Until then I will act like a scorned high school girl spreading gossip on my website, come by and visit, you know the address!"</Msg><Username>armsuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1346173236455</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:00:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346176998133-45</Id><Title>FORMER PAID PUMPERS</Title><Msg>are now out scouring the public roadways for deposit bottles and cans.

Well, with the exception of Symantec. Anti-virus software doesn't work and will never work. It's just a way of saying, "our computers and operating systems are flawed, so we might as well make money off the problem." And, I have forgotten more about computers than you will ever know, so skip the pompous grade 8 rant. INTC is a dead company. _________________________ Poor Lucy.

Consumer growth is being primarily being driven by entry level products. Vendors such as HP, Lenovo, Asus and Samsung registered more than 50 percent growth in the consumer segment. Ultrabooks are still finding it difficult to penetrate the market. However, with the availability of the new Intel processor and declining price points, we expect adoption to increase in coming quarters.” Gartner expects PC shipment growth to continue in the third quarter of 2012 owing to the festive season and education buying, coupled with some more fulfilment of the Tamilnadu Government order. Mobile PCs, which grew 54 percent compared to the second quarter of 2011, helped drive overall market growth. White boxes (including parallel import), which accounted for 45 percent of the overall desktop market, declined 18 percent in the second quarter of 2012 in comparison to the second quarter of 2011.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346205159370</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 21:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346205766000-81</Id><Topic><Title>Calling All Longs!</Title><Username>friendawq5580</Username><Timestamp>1346160614000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 09:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am very happy to be a new member.</Msg><Username>latricia_chelsea</Username><Timestamp>1346205766000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 22:02:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
