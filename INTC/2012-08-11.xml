The contracting volume on this up move is alarming. But we have seen similar situations happening many times in the past several years. In those cases, stocks went against the negative technical divergence and kept the uptrend going longer than many traders had expected. On one hand, the Fed's QE put more money into the system. On the other hand, the sluggish economy kept the sentiment in a downbeat mood, allowing stocks to climb a wall of worry. What will the current rally lead to? It was based on the expectation for more QEs. That expectation will need to be met with real action in the not too distant future before the market gets disappointed. For now, it's probably not a good idea to make big bets in a thinly traded market. have a nice weekend.</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1344669977000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 03:26:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344686477000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Obama will CORNHOLE Romney...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1344666524000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 02:28:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're a freakshow!</Msg><Username>bob_dylan_64</Username><Timestamp>1344686477000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 08:01:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344688308000-12</Id><Title>anyone</Title><Msg>INTC Do you exceed the $ 30?

So JFK, when he was fighting for his nation in WW II, did not enjoy liberty? All those people who voted in FDR 4 times and then defeated the Japanese and Germans did not enjoy liberty? You are indeed a sicko puppy. I want to help old people and young people and to spend less on weapons and you therefore call me names. People from Iowa all the way over to the East coast in the North voted for this Pres and they do love America. They are certainly more free than are those in the deep south. Although the old south is switching over slowly now. OB won Virginia and North Carolina last time and will certainly win Virginia again and likely North Carolina too. So you think you on the right are the only patriots? Did you on the right march to fight for freedoms and the right to vote for women? Did you fight for the African Americans and their rights? The OLD GOP did but this new one does not. It is as if the GOP has been taken over by the extremes of racial hate and ignorance--you for example. But I do not doubt your love of our nation. I know we just disagree. So why do you doubt ours? My family was here in the mid 1600s and unless you are a Native American, your just a newbie to this nation so shut the pluck up . Romney 5 wife Mormon boy--his father was born in Mexico and I do not know where the pluck Romney was born. But I do know OB's mother was a native born white lady with a family history back to the late 1600s. So OB likely has family history here in America before yours you teabaaaging nimmmrod. Yet you post that OB is not a citizen--you know he is. Liar. You post that he raised taxes when you know--like all of us who make money, that he cut them.

These days, voters seem to be even more likely to consider themselves Democrats than Republicans. There has been a five percentage-point Democratic advantage, on average, in Fox News polls this year. In this poll, the Democratic edge is nine points. That may or may not be on the high side, although it is similar to other recent national polls conducted by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, which puts Democrats up 11 percentage points and the Pew Research Center, with Democrats up by 13 percent.

Rubio, Sandoval, Pawlenty or Portman would have been very good. Congress has a nationwide popularity level of 15% and the Ryan pick gives Obama more free reign to focus on how dysfunctional Congress is during his campaign. Ryan is best known for having the most conservative voting record in Congress (which is great for the base but toxic for independents) and for creating the most controversial budget proposal in modern history (axing federal programs like Medicare, which is a little ironic because Ryan has only worked as a federal employee since he was 22 and has no real world experience- Rand Paul is a much better tea party rep because he has actually worked outside of government). I seriously cannot understand why Romney would do this. Ryan is attractive and likeable but so was Sarah Palin. So Saturday Night Live wins. Letterman wins. Big winner? Dems from Wisconsin can vote against him and make him lose his home state making a horses Rump of him. Then they can vote him out of office. Poor Old Mitt. He tried ut like his father, he fell short.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1344722567000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 18:02:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344722732000-55</Id><Topic><Title>Saving Congressmman Ryan?

Many simply hate it. And now Mitt Romney is chained to the Ryan budget like the Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier characters in "The Defiant Ones" (remember, for all their attempts at escaping, they ended up back on the chain gang). Lastly, in choosing Ryan Romney has managed to paint a picture of a candidate lacking enough backbone to stand up to the right-wing of his own party at a time when more than mere conventional wisdom says he should be tracking toward the political center. The electorate has probably already been questioning Romney's commitment to any stand he makes on any issue, so at odds are his recent statements with a record as governor of Massachusetts that includes the very health care provisions that he now vows to overturn nationally as president. Even if they don't recognize the original quote, voters may already suspect that the inescapably millionaire Romney eminently satisfies Oscar Wilde's definition of a cynic: someone who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1344722898000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 18:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344723720000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Saving Congressmman Ryan?
