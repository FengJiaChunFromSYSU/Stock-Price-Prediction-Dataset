The company has raised about $14 million to date. It raised $3.5 million during its first financing round, including funds from the Kutliroffs. A second round in 2011 generated $3.8 million from the U.S. investment fund Artists &amp; Instigators, which according to its website invests in “creators who are crafting game-changing businesses.” A third financing round, also in 2011, raised $7 million and was led by Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital. Jim Moore, a technology mergers and acquisitions executive, commented on the possible acquisition in VentureBeat: “In this case, using depth of field camera data for gesture input will allow people to control their computers without touching them.” “It is [the] early days for this technology as the application builders will need to build this into their interface and functionality,” he said. “But the possibilities are enormous.” From Haaretz</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364705590604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 00:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364706222624-3</Id><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Msg>Looking like a water slide.

There used to be a time when Intel would make an announcement and major allignments in the industry would change in direct consequence. Today, its mostly yawns. The reason for this has been a string of recent tall claims that have not been backed up with products that met those claims. As a result, while Intel is still making major claims about its mobile aspirations, the industry for the most part recognizes these as aspirations and also realizes that Intel is not in a position to dictate to its customers in mobile. Intel is used to doing this from its PC heydays. This is one reason for the series of missteps that have sullied its reputation as a company that delivers. If you go inside, you find that the problems with Intel have become systemic. It doesn't have the nimble decision making ability in a dynamic business environment that some of its smaller and smarter competitors such as ARM do. As an example look at the CEO change that has just happened and is in the process of happening at both these companies. From an investor's standpoint, Intel appears much like it appears to other players in the industry -- someone that has lost their reputation for quality.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1364735451130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 09:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364735899824-11</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for this report</Msg><Username>steven_swanson</Username><Timestamp>1364735899824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 09:18:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364739147910-12</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome report !</Msg><Username>amandawashington143</Username><Timestamp>1364739147910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:12:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364741365104-13</Id><Title>GoodDigger - A15 (28nm) power draw...</Title><Msg>"ARM's A15 (28nm Process) supposidly delivers ATOM like performance at moderate power consumption (1.9W)" -GoodDigger- 3-30-13 'supposedly'... so an A15 at 28nm actually hasn't actually been measured for power consumption...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364741365104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:49:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364742791948-14</Id><Topic><Title>Help Wanted</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364683616193</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 18:46:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nuff #$%$! thank you,Happy Easter one &amp; all!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364742791948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:13:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364742981055-15</Id><Topic><Title>GoodDigger - A15 (28nm) power draw...</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364741365104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LSI Introduces 16-Core ARM Cortex-A15 Processor for Network Equipment.

Highly-Parallel Stream Computing to Open New Doors for Mobile Chips, Reduce Their Complexity [03/28/2013 07:14 PM] by Anton Shilov Nowadays application processors for mobile devices pack a lot of various hardware, including general-purpose processing cores, graphics cores, image processors, controllers and so on. End-users demand improvements in all aspects of usage, hence mobile chips are getting incredibly complex. With the rise of system-on-chips powered by modern graphics architectures that support GPGPU technology, the need for many special-purpose components will vanish, but the doors to new features will open. Thanks to the fact that contemporary graphics processing units (GPUs) feature a relatively high number of comparatively simplistic processing units, it is possible to use them for highly-parallel general-purpose (GP) tasks. Such usage model is called GPGPU and it is on the rise on personal computer these days. Thanks to the fact that the latest ARM Mali T600, Imagination PowerVR 6 and Qualcomm Adreno 300 support GPGPU through OpenCL application programming interface, they can be used to make better photos of videos. Provided that the GPUs are not too power hungry, their usage eliminates necessity to integrate special-purpose hardware, such as image processors or video stabilizers, thus, reducing cost of the chip. “You might be able to save some cost somewhere in the SoC by cutting out a bit of hardware that you had and run it on the GPU instead. So cost reduction and an improved capability. So maybe they will cut out some of the ISP and they will do it on the GPU because the silicon is already there, it is power efficient, it's a quicker way of doing [it], you get a cost reduction, performance goes up,” said Ian Smythe, director of marketing at ARM, in an interview</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364743572382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364743650114-18</Id><Title>I like the way the whole industry is moving towards GPGPU tech.

As for why Intel would move into the foundry business, the simple reason is money. Unless Intel can break into the mobile market in a big way, the only real avenue for continued revenue growth is increasing its foundry business. The problem with becoming a foundry, though, is that it gives Intel’s competitors (Qualcomm, AMD, Samsung) access to the very same advanced CMOS processes that have allowed Intel to gain such a dominating lead in the PC market. The profit margins for foundry work are lower, too: Whereas Intel’s gross margins are around 60%, TSMC’s gross margins are around 48%. According to one analyst, if Intel did manage to bring on Apple as a foundry client, the production of iPad and iPhone SoCs would net Intel an additional $4.2 billion in revenue. $13 billion of capital expenditure doesn’t seem quite so crazy, when you look at it like that. At least as far as the industry analysts are concerned, moving into the foundry business is the only real route for Intel. With the value of its stock dropping 19% over the past year, Wall Street would seem to agree. I think we should probably wait and see how Merrifield and Bay Trail do, though, before jumping to any conclusions about Intel’s future as a foundry.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364744626089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:43:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364744658958-24</Id><Topic><Title>Apple/Intel deal may already be in place</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364696468449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 22:21:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Possible, esp with Bay Trail coming out for 4th quarter.

Only TSMC is lagging behind, everyone else (GF, Samsung, Intel, probably IBM) will all be on 14nm in the same year. well at this moment Samsung is 4 months in on the production line for their 14nm high energy IC line as reported by EEtimes, and almost a year in on their 10nm flash NAND (which I think is not the full power IC line, just NAND/DRAM). Samsung's 14nm was developed jointly with IBM, GF, and someone else, so it makes sense that the others can't be that far behind Samsung. Intel is almost a year in on their 14nm production line: yes they lead, but not any "full generation" like they used to. The division I am referring to in these examples is from production line ramp up to full production. Usually it takes a year to get the line online once you start getting the first samples, and then up to a year from there before sales from the production line begin. Some companies, like AMD, don't start selling til almost a year after their production run. Others, like Intel, start within a couple of months at most. So intel might get out the door first, but it still won't lead whole generations like it used to. Samsung is already beginning to sell eMMCs based on their 10nm. That's NAND only, but it shows how much things have changed.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364744844414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:47:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364745043374-27</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Still Trying to Make Us Believe Its Atom Chips Are Superior to ARM.

Clovertrail+ is reported by independent reviewers to match or outperform commercially available ARM products. Further, Intel's Haswell Core architecture is scheduled to ship before Tegra 4, and Intel's next generation 22nm Atom Baytrail is expected ship to vendors, very shortly after Tegra 4, in time for this year's holiday buying season.

Intel has met his match. It won't be easy to compete with Samsung. and this past screams from analyst are interesting: On the one hand, it’s unlikely Apple would do what Intel wants, which is to shift from using a processor core based on designs from Intel competitor ARM Holdings (ARMH): We believe a move by Apple to make broad use of x86 in their iOS line is unlikely. We believe that Apple gains significant advantages from their vertically-integrated stack of semiconductor design, software, and hardware – note, for example, that their iPhone 4S, while manufactured at a mature 45nm node, is better on power and performance than virtually all other devices today in a testament to their abilities (Exhibit 5). While access to 22/14/10nm from Intel would provide significant advantages, we believe a move to x86 on iOS would therefore be a non-starter as Apple would lose their ability to optimize the full platform as it currently does with their internal ARM architecture. However, given the ongoing patent battles with Samsung, Apple has a real need to consider alternatives, the authors write. They might be compelled to consider Intle if Intel could grant a similar “Chinese Wall” between its own processor development and the tabbing of chips for Apple, as long as Intel could gain insights that would benefit its own mobile chip design. The authors suggest Intel could manage a favorable profit margin on foundry services for Apple that would be comparable to its overall net profit on its own devices, despite having higher costs than the biggest foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): Consequently, our analyses suggests that overall foundry net income as a % of revenue could be in the ballpark of 20% or so (Exhibit 15), not hugely different from our current model for Intel as a whole (~23% in 2014), assuming a foundry R&amp;D opex burden at 1.5x the rate of TSMCs (e.g. typical foundry R&amp;D, plus an additional amount to cover design services etc that Samsung provides to Apple, assuming that process R&amp;D etc can be leveraged from Intel’s core business) and minimal incremental SG&amp;A (we assume ~1%) […] Our base-case modeling suggests entering into a foundry relationship with Apple could drive in the ballpark of 30-35 cents in EPS upside, relatively material (our current 2014 EPS forecast, for instance, is $2.97). The authors cite multiple issues that would be raised that Intel would have to get past: Accelerating the performance and/or value proposition of Apple’s iPad via better process technology could increase the risk of PC cannibalization, certainly an undesirable outcome. A similar dynamic could conceivably play out in the mobile space, where Intel is attempting to make their own efforts. Apple’s iPhone is already viewed as being markedly superior to most other platforms; should Intel’s process technology make it even more compelling it may hamper Intel’s own efforts to penetrate the space with their Atom offerings. We must also be cognizant of the fact that such an arrangement with Apple would open Intel up to significant customer concentration and, potentially, risk given what would likely be dedicated capacity should Apple decide to (again) change foundry partners. Finally, we struggle to see a scenario where the return on capital will ever be as good as Intel’s current business; given they currently earn two margins – a manufacturing and design margin – on their products, their return is extraordinarily high.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364745251284</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364745476335-29</Id><Topic><Title>How painful would an Apple Intel foundry deal be for Intel shorts?</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1364744092338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:34:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>before bashing begins, here is 10nm proof: Samsung Electronics unveils 10nm-class embedded memory card (Xinhua) 15:30, November 16, 2012 SEOUL, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Electronics, the world's No. 1 memory chip maker, said Thursday that it unveiled the 64 gigabytes (GB) embedded multimedia card (eMMC) based on 10 nanometer (nm)-class process technology. The 64Gb high-performance NAND memory using its 10nm-class technology was applied to the new 64 GB eMMC that went into production late last month, according to an e-mailed statement. Embedded memory is the key memory component in mobile applications for smartphones and tablets. Advanced eMMCs will allow users to access high-density and high-resolution contents such as full HD video, web browsing and gaming on their latest mobile devices, Samsung said. The new memory solution has a random write speed of 2,000 IOPS (input/output per second) and a random read speed of 5,000 IOPS. Sequential read and write speeds are 260 megabytes per second (MB/ s) and 50MB/s each, up to 10 times faster than a class 10 external memory card. "The new high-speed, small form factor eMMC reinforces Samsung 's technology leadership in storage memory solutions," said Kim Myungho, vice president of Samsung's memory marketing division.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364745476335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:57:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364745592475-30</Id><Topic><Title>How painful would an Apple Intel foundry deal be for Intel shorts?</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1364744092338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:34:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel will only do foundry work for selected few. Intel has stated in the past that they would not do foundry work that would enable their competitors ie. Qualcomm, Samsung and nVidia. In the case of Apple though, one can argue that it really isn't enabling competitors. Fabbing for Apple makes sense because their SoC is not being used anywhere else other than Apple's own products. And since their products are so popular, the revenue generated makes it worthwhile. Intel can still continue to push their own SoC for phone/tablet makers. In fact, by fabbing and enabling Apple, it is a good strategy to get phone/tablet makers to start using Intel's SoC in order to compete against Apple. This is of course assuming that Intel's SoC will be superior starting at 22nm and beyond.</Msg><Username>iltm_29</Username><Timestamp>1364745592475</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:59:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364745843854-31</Id><Title>Change is always happening but we do not see it.</Title><Msg>The Earth rotates once every 24 hours as it revolves around the sun once every year.

A new CEO from outside Intel is coming to turn the boat into a new direction and to make it a space craft. The new CEO will sell Intel TV. She or he will shrink the Intel chips to 10nm and smaller leaving all other chip makers far far behind. But while in the past, Intel would simply sell these chips into a market of similar devices, these new chips will be made specifically for product for individual products for individual companies. Intel super Fabs will be used to make chips with or without Intel chip designs. Hardly is the end near for Intel. It has reached an inflection point and will explode forward.

What is true of Intel today was true of GM in the 1980s and 1990s. There was model proliferation and lack of differentiation between Chevy, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick and Cadillac cars. Eventually the customers woke up and ditched the Cadillac that was really a Chevy marked up by a couple thousand dollars. Many Intel processors are just a few percent lower in power or higher in performance than the next of kin that costs $100 less. It burns the PC OEMs who must manage the transitions and communicate to customers the non-benefits of these kissing cousins. In contrast, a great part of Apple’s success has been to draw distinct lines between products and thereby avoid offering consumers too much choice.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364747283159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364747392232-43</Id><Topic><Title>How painful would an Apple Intel foundry deal be for Intel shorts?</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1364744092338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:34:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They aint leaving one bid industry playa for another. wow you is road roast.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1364747392232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:29:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364747621863-44</Id><Topic><Title>What is up with this board?

This was especially true in the U.S. where partners could not rely on AMD to supply the needed parts in quantity and in time. Moreover, the pressure Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could place on OEMs and the constant upheaval as the company slashed costs and restructured didn’t help matters either. One market, however, has been cared for well: India. In Q4, AMD surprised a number of people with significant increases in market share all across the notebook segment in India, taking a 31% share of commercial notebooks. A lot of the credit goes to the current Managing Director of AMD India Ravi Swaminathan, who altered AMD’s strategy in the country completely by courting strong relationships with local OEMs, government agencies and institutions. He took advantage of the downsizing at Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) by hiring former senior executives to beef up its negotiating ability. And then he turned around and courted H-P as a major client, which landed AMD a sizable portion of a 1,500,000 unit order with A4-equipped notebooks. He also worked to negate Intel’s brand advantage with government agencies by getting benchmarking added to the qualifying process, which then gave them the opportunity to do honest price-to-performance evaluations and win contracts on that basis. India, like many price sensitive emerging markets, is extremely important to AMD’s turnaround story.

A Bloomberg report on Thursday cited unnamed sources saying the two companies were close to a deal. In December, Intel CEO Paul Otellini said the company was open to building chips for companies that were not directly competitive with its key PC- and-server-chip business. Critics say that Intel missed an opportunity to dominate the low-power chips powering fast-selling cell phones and tablets where ARM is king. This deal, if it pans out, means Intel would build Cisco-designed chips for Cisco networking hardware and become a player in the $30 billion custom chip making business. A move into the made-to-order chip business would also mean facing off with Taiwan Semiconductor, a foundry that makes chips for customers including Qualcomm, and which appears ready to take on Samsung for Apple’s chip business. Intel had no comment in the Bloomberg report. A Cisco spokeswoman reaffirmed to me that Cisco and Intel have worked together for years — Cisco’s Unified Computing Systems (UCS) servers run Intel chips for example — but would not comment further. But this deal would validate the notion of Intel as a manufacturer of special-built chips to run things other than servers and PCs.</Msg><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364748338183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:45:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364748392151-54</Id><Topic><Title>GoodDigger - A15 (28nm) power draw...</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364741365104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another product in the ARM A15 camp... but still no numbers for an A15 at 28nm...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364748392151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:46:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364748400564-55</Id><Title>Samsung won't ruin its good named over ARMH</Title><Msg>Samsung confirms no Windows RT tablets for US markets, blames tepid retail demand By Zachary Lutz posted Jan 10th, 2013 at 10:47 PM</Msg><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364748400564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:46:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364748451051-56</Id><Title>Intel over 30 by 2014</Title><Msg>You heard it here first.</Msg><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1364748451051</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364748454687-57</Id><Topic><Title>How painful would an Apple Intel foundry deal be for Intel shorts?</Title><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1364744092338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 11:34:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's that allias nuff your feminine side?

All these reports refer to using Intel’s leading-edge 22-nm tri-gate process. However, at CES a couple of weeks ago, my eye was caught by a 200-mm wafer on display at the booth of a little company called Nectar, who were pitching their fuel-cell based USB charging system. They claim that the charger can top up an iPhone battery at least ten times before the fuel pod has to be changed. The whole device can be held in one hand: The cell uses butane fuel in a silicon-based power cell, and by the look of the image below the cells are ~22 mm square. continued at ; chipworksDOTcom/blog/technologyblog/2013/01/31/intel-foundries-mems-for-fuel-cell-start-up-nectar/</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364754269083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:24:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364754304249-94</Id><Title>Help Settle A Stock Bet - WHO WON?</Title><Msg>In early 2011, Bob and Bill make a $100 bet on Citibank's stock. Bob held 100 shares at a price then of about $4.50 per share. He likes Citibank. he thinks it is a good solid financial institution and that it will bounce back from it's recent decline. Bob says that the stock will increase in value over the next year and bets Bill that Citibank will move up to $30 by Jan 1, 2012. Bill doesn't like the financial sector or Citibank's prospects over the next year and thinks it improbable that Citibank will recover, certainly not to anywhere near the $30 level. Bill takes the $100 bet. On May 6th 2011, Citibank conducted a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. On May 5th Bob had 100 shares at $4.48 per share. On the 6th he had 10 shares at $44.80 per share. Bob feels that he won the bet since the stock reached the price objective he stated and that how it achieved that objective is irrelevant. Bill feels the stock reached the price objective through company manipulation and achieved no actual increase in value, an implied if not stated component of the bet. Had no reverse split occurred, the stock on Jan 1, 2012 would not have been above $30. Since the possibility of a reverse split was never discussed when the wager was agreed upon, based on the information above and what you reasonable believe to be the understanding of each party regarding intention and meaning of the terms of the wager-- who won the bet?</Msg><Username>jorlev1164</Username><Timestamp>1364754304249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:25:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364754409967-95</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Foundries MEMS for Fuel Cell Start-up Nectar</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364754269083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INtel slowly being forced to open its fabs... but the added revenue will be sweet setting up INTC for a buy....</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364754409967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364754478618-96</Id><Topic><Title>Apple/Intel deal may already be in place</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364696468449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 22:21:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read the article #$%$..they will be lucky to get 14nm by 2015!

I don't expect for them to get either one for the following reasons: 1.) Intel likely set the bar pretty low for Q1. So, I don't see Intel having trouble getting over it. The shills expected an earnings warning last quarter and didn't get it. They expected one this quarter and didn't get it. It's them that doesn't get it. 2.) The economy has continued to gradually improve. This will likely affect Q2 guidance the most. 3.) Intel's gameplan has evolved and there is starting to be some recognition of this. Absolutely nothing positive has been included in the stock price. Mr. Market is still working on the "PC is dead" stupidity and is unable to see any of the many other positive factors in Intel's future. 4.) Intel's roadmap looks fabulous for the next two years and ARM has nothing to match it. Haswell, Bay Trail, Airmont, and the like will come in waves, each lifting Intel's mobility future. 5.) ARM's fabrication is going absolutely no where. They are stuck at 28nm while Intel gears up 14, 10 and 7 nm. 6.) Intel's foundry efforts are bearing fruit. The Altera deal changed many attitudes about Intel's future. 7.) Intel has many big deals that could break their way. I would be surprised not to hear about some of them in the next conference call. 8.) Intel's tablet future has improved dramatically. 9.) Intel's web TV venture has a chance to be a real break-through and has a chance to generate excitement and profits, while lifting everything in the Intel ecosystem. 10.)

They started down this path without gauging the impact that Haswell, Bay Trail and Airmont will have on the rest of the year and guidance. They started down this path before understanding any ARM good news is going to be few and far between. They started down this path before realizing that the ARM era is over with ARM being stuck at 28nm for years and years while Intel moves on to 14, 10 and 7nm with superior power efficiency over ARM. They started down this path before the strength of Intel's foundry business was clear. We still have Cisco to come and one big mobility player that hasn't yet been announced. And on top of that it's the quiet period and they still can't find an issue that gives them any traction.

It said it has worked with customers over the past few years to develop its Hadoop distribution, and that this is actually its third release of the software. Still, it's a significant announcement that moves Intel deeper into the software industry. Like many other open-source providers, Intel will now sell support and maintenance services for its distribution, Boyd said. Hadoop includes a dozen or so open-source projects that work together to make it easier for users to store, manage and analyze large amounts of data. It's become the go-to software platform for companies mining Web logs, transaction histories and other data in search of added value. ... But Intel says the core components of its distribution remain open and compatible with other implementations of Hadoop. If customers choose Intel's distribution, "they're not getting locked into a technology," Boyd said. At the same time, Intel has developed some of its own tools that will not be released as open source. They include a deployment and configuration tool called Intel Manager for Apache Hadoop, and a tool for tuning cluster performance, called Active Tuner for Apache Hadoop. Customers who run Intel's Hadoop distribution on servers loaded with Intel hardware, including its processors, solid-state drives and 10 Gigabit Ethernet cards, will see a 40 percent performance boost over users who don't go with an all-Intel platform, according to Boyd infoworldDOTcom/d/big-data/intel-releases-hadoop-distribution-primed-its-own-chips-213546</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364776117336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 20:28:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364778651144-139</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE to build a foundry ???

The company is working on a set top box for introduction in 2013. Intel TV has long been a rumor in Silicon Valley but Intel finally confirmed the effort in February. The idea is a set-top box, sold directly to consumers, that works with a service that combines live TV, video on demand, and a catch-up component similar to the BBC's iPlayer that lets viewers watch anything that aired on BBC within the last week. This may sound like just another set top box, such as the one you've already got on top of your TV from a cable company, but there are significant differences. Intel TV is independent of what broadband pipe you use. Intel TV won't care if you use coaxial cable, fiber optic cable or wireless access. You'll be able to switch providers with no effect on your TV service. You'll be able to move across town or across country and keep the same TV service -- just as you do now with your phone number when you switch service providers. It's built around the concept of cloud-based content from the beginning. (Not surprising given the number of server chips Intel sells already.) So a user might have access to every program for seven days (the BBC model) without having to record them on a home DVR because the content would be available in the cloud. And, finally, the service would be device neutral with delivery to every display you own from computer to TV to mobile phone."
