The adjusted close of $24.19 is the price of Intel stock adjusted for the dividend paid over the last 10 years. $29.81 was the close and the adjusted close $24.19 compute $5.62 in dividends in the past 10 years. The "lame dividend" argument is not too lame if Intel was bought in the last couple years at prices below $20 or even if its sole purpose is for income. People follow stocks and participate in the discussions for personal profit. The only other reason that I can think of is for entertainment. Are there any other reasons? It really does not matter what the Intel price was 10 years ago does it? It matters what the Intel price is tomorrow, next month, next year, ... and what the prospects are for tomorrow. It is hard to make any money on the past. I buy the stock and keep a core position. Sell puts after a sell off and sell covered calls (buy-writes) after a run up. It seems to be a steady predictable source of income. The share price seems to be reacting (not controlled) to option activity (strangles and straddles) that seemed to be timed to the dividend payments.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343587626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 14:47:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343588168000-19</Id><Topic><Title>INTC July 2001 Shares Prices</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1343583149000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 13:32:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it is actually worth more --------- YES!

Those are your words. I asked how important the price 10 years ago was. Is it important to me? I purchased shares around $20 for several accounts last year. Is the price 10 years ago important to me and how should I use it for determining the price next month? I don't know why it has much importance to me. I am long Intel shares for the long term. I have a core position and trade additional shares around that core position. I write put options after a sell off. I write covered calls after a run up. I think that Intel, when priced at $20, with its prospects was a good buy for me and my objectives. I am up about 20% + those unimportant dividends. I will probably not buy any more Intel above $25 unless something changes. I will trade the options around the dividend cycle. They seem predictable and have been kind to me.

I know of people who did make the mistake you made. It is unpleasant and explains some of your anger. However, for me, I converted cash into homes for my kids and bought their homes at $50k. Now at $60k they are up 20% + the dividend of having their own home, including the mortgage and real estate tax deductions. When homes were selling at $100k, I told them that homes were too expensive and they should not buy. I enforced my position by not agreeing to help them. I can't offer you guidance on your home, you will have to look at your objectives and make that decision yourself. I don't know all the facts that influence your decisions.
