I'm saying Apple stock has collapsed because they are not doing anything and not working with anyone. Tim Cook has decided to play it safe and it's turned out to be a disaster. But they could at least be on the cutting edge of performance by doing a deal with Intel instead of trying to eek out an existence on ARM's pitifully fading fabrication.

If someone wants to design a CPU part they have no choice. ----- Not true. Even today you still have options, such as MIPS. If you want to leverage the ISA and the ecosystem for mobile, then ARM is a good choice. ---- ANYone with any capability like Apple and QUalcom will actually desing their own CPU's using only the instruction set. ---- Indeed. Why do you think that is? ---- ARM has historically also been low power only because the they have provided low performance CPU's. Power goes up exponentially with performance. You can not fairly compare powerformance per watt at differnet performance levels. ----- No. ARM's first chips where for high performance PC's/Workstations. The low power profile was an accident rather than by design. Yes, you can compare performance/watt across the whole spectrum. From the highest performing server chip to the lowest micro controller that is capable of running your workload. ----- Intel has an enormous manufacturing advantage. Don't you think a 50% power advantage and 50 cost advantage will make a differene in the market? ----- Perhaps, but Intel has to deliver on this manufacturing advantage - and it needs manufacturing advantage as it's SoC's are that much larger . Historically, Intel's LP processes haven't been as good at the foundries. ----- What is the problem with Smasungs big/little anyway. Seems to be some problems there. Pretty stupid design compared to Intel standards Intel will better control dynamic voltage and frequency in future chips and better optimize performcnce and power without having to have two different CPU's ----- Big/Little is a good concept on paper and if it works in the real world then it will have the best power/performance curves of any SoC. It could change the CPU design off future of power constrained devices - if it works:)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1366281828960</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 06:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366282919222-22</Id><Title>quite a few SA, Motley Idiots, IBD, and Blankenphart articles bashing Intel</Title><Msg>The formula is: (1) I believe that things are really bad for Intel.

Intel may be struggling on the PC side of its business, but the chip giant is making aggressive moves in the data center and enterprise computing sector. After buying networking silicon vendor Fulcrum in 2011, Intel introduced a few products and hinted at its plans, but on Wednesday at the Open Networking Summit it revealed its SDN strategy and took the gloves off. Intel is showcasing its networking silicon, but it’s also offering two reference designs — one for new switches and one for new servers that would use Intel’s new chips. It’s also showing of a software layer called the Intel Data Plane Development Kit for OpenVSwitch that will accelerate packet processing on Intel’s CPUs instead of on dedicated network processors. One of the reference designs is aimed at the data center and the top of rack switches made by Cisco, Juniper, Arista and Force10 (owned by Dell), and the other is more of a punch for Cisco and Juniper in that it’s aimed at service providers. In fact, at the event Intel said Verizon was testing a prototype version of its reference design.</Msg><Username>joseywales_outlaw</Username><Timestamp>1366290288954</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:04:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366290388907-31</Id><Topic><Title>Intel gonna help.......and hurt Cisco????</Title><Username>joseywales_outlaw</Username><Timestamp>1366290288954</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:04:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With these offerings, Intel is putting Broadcom, a popular maker of merchant silicon, on notice that it’s going directly after its business. That’s not surprising. The only question is how low Intel will go in pricing to put the hurt on Broadcom. But it’s also providing designs and capabilities that could obviate the need for special-purpose silicon that Cisco and Juniper currently rely on in their high-end boxes. Intel has gone after special purpose hardware before when it took on Sun and IBM in the server world with its x86 chips for personal computers. Intel’s moves into the networking world are a symptom of the broader shift in computing. On the consumer side, mobility is changing the devices we use. In the enterprise, considerations of power consumption can now trump performance. In fact, super chips like the ones Intel traditionally sells can cause their own challenges in a virtualized world because using all of that capacity requires data center operators to virtualize the hardware and complicate their lives. On the enterprise side the architecture to support our computing needs is changing as well as the workloads. The business considerations are changing too. This is a trend that’s shifting the ground underfoot all of the large IT vendors. So to see Intel going after its fellow chipmakers is perhaps unsurprising, but to see it going after Cisco’s and Juniper’s markets is like watching a rat resort to cannibalism during a time of starvation. IT companies aren’t starving yet, but they are under stress, as Intel’s lackluster earnings indicate. The very real disruptions caused by a new generation of computing and web infrastructure are going to eat away at the margins and business models supporting today’s giants.

The difference is pretty large. Silvermont core in Bay Trail removes this. You page to disk when you run out of memory. Nanosecond memory accesses become microsecond disk accesses.

There is a large short interest that needs to be burned off. I doubt there will ever be a squeeze since options are so liquid. Intel appears to be chewing up 25m shares per quarter. With 22 trading days per month on average, that is about 1/3 mill per day (330,000 shares) buy back. Intel buy back is shaving points off the bottom prices. Now through June 2nd, Intel will be making a number of product introductions around Haswell, Atom and Phi. Good news. Intel CEO at/before May 16th should churn the market for a couple days but will remove uncertainty. I expect that within the next 3 months, the BOD will announce a small dividend increase. It is important for dividend paying companies to be able to say "increased dividends EVERY year for the last x years". The amount will be small becasue of uncertainty. There is active option trading that drains the BETA from Intel stock. Yesterday the APR $22 calls trade over 60k contracts. The open interest dropped by 2k from 176k to 174k. That means buying and selling. Because of the huge 174k open interest, I expect large volumes to either roll out or for Intel to day close to $22 until Monday. Friday close at $21.99.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366292912934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:48:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366293076485-40</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts will soon experience starvation of Intel shares.</Title><Username>imbluesclues</Username><Timestamp>1366292181222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:36:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the big risks to shorts is that Intel has likely already concluded a new significant strategic partner and foundry deal (see PO's comment in the conference call) that is presently confidential but could get announced at any time convenient for the strategic partner.

(INTC), the world’s largest semiconductor maker, forecast second-quarter sales that may exceed some analysts’ estimates as strong demand for server chips helps make up for a slump in the personal-computer market. Revenue in the current period will be as much as $13.4 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts (INTC) on average had predicted sales of $12.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Improving demand for powerful chips at the heart of corporate networks will blunt the impact of falling PC sales and help Intel boost revenue for the year, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said. While a consumer shift to smartphones and tablets from PCs contributed to Intel’s third straight decline in quarterly revenue, its server-chip sales have benefited from the increased Internet traffic these mobile devices bring. “PCs and notebooks are being replaced by tablets and smartphones,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group Inc. who has a hold rating on Intel shares. “That is impacting the consumer side, but it’s not impacting servers and is actually driving heavier server traffic.” Intel shares fell less than 1 percent to $21.72 at 10:40 a.m. in New York, compared with a 2.7 percent decline for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Annual Forecast Intel is sticking to its projection for 2013 revenue growth at a “low single-digit” percentage, Smith said.

I would guess that the baseline 60m to 80m shares is mostly inverse ETF. PQQQ inverse QQQ alone accounts for 227k shares and it is a relatively small fund at $195m NAV. The remaining 230m - 80m short shares (150m) could be hedged quickly with options. These 150m shares short could be accounted for with 1.5m call and put contracts. On Nov. 3rd, 2011, 1.7m call contracts traded and the stock moved less than $1. There is not much risk being short Intel.

Until there are signs that Intel has either truly turned things around, he says there is very little opportunity for an investment. By Joshua M. Brown, Guest blogger / April 17, 2013 Joshua M. Brown Joshua has been managing money for high net worth clients, charitable foundations, corporations and retirement plans for more than a decade. . Sure, at ten times earnings, why not? Only it's more like 12 times forward earnings given the drop in gross margins and operating income The Street is now expecting on the heels of last night's call. Revenue growth is stangnant-to-collapsing too, depending on the season. There is a piddling amount of growth happening in one small area of the business, but where it counts there is only deterioration in both demand and pricing. After posting a year-over drop in revenue of 2.5% (and a 6.7% sequential drop from Q4), Intel is now forecasting single-digits sales growth for full-year 2013 but I'd take the under on that. And despite this, the stock is inexplicably selling for almost 2 times sales - I can't imagine why this should be the case, I can only come up with "for old time's sake" as it's a Dow component and a former darling.

And it is merely an also-ran in the future of computing - mobile - where it must contend with entrenched giants Qualcomm and ARM Holdings. It is in Intel's DNA to be the incumbent and ward off smaller foes like AMD, it is not accustomed to fighting uphill. Recent announcements about making in-roads into software and "wireless TV" sound like the flailing of a desperate company in pursuit of new growth opportunities, I'm not sure why anyone should expect them to automatically find success in these "foreign" markets. The current CEO just reported his last quarter and is now heading in retirement. It was a weak quarter but he did not lower guidance on the call. How much would you like to bet that the company spared him the ignominious exit and that a warning is coming sometime between now and the next quarter? We already know that the PC market contracted by 14% in just the first quarter of this year, and Intel's PC revenues are four times the size of its decent data services business. Intel has played the expectations game extraordinarily well over the last few years - they've beaten the consensus estimates by an average of 10% going back to the July 2011 quarter. Unfortunately, this has not translated to any kind of benefit for longs - the stock has been down an average of 4.2% in the week following these reports. In other words, nobody's been fooled. The armchair value investor looks at the stock and says it's "cheap" and pays a nice dividend.I can cite a million examples of formerly cutting edge technology and industrial companies that shrank for years even as they always looked undervalued and paid a decent yield.</Msg><Username>aintezbeinred</Username><Timestamp>1366299556544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:39:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366299804130-77</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 cause INTC drop</Title><Username>joesmoe_y2k</Username><Timestamp>1366296138297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So many desktops and laptops being used to type "The PC is dead".

Unfortunately, this does not signal underlying strength at the business. The company now sports a $11o billion market cap, has $17 billion in cash and about $13 billion in debt. This is a net cash position of under $4 billion, nothing special. The question is whether or not this type of ongoing return of cash to shareholders is wise given the fact that Intel is in a strategic transition and attempting to tackle brand new lines of business with heavy capex spending requirements. Besides, it's not as though the buybacks or dividends are bringing investors in or helping the stock price - Intel is down some 20% over the last year in the midst of an "everybody wins" broad market rally. The bottom line is that Intel is a very well-managed, gigantic company and has gotten by lately with tight inventory controls and conservative guidance. This is why the reckoning has taken place in slow-motion and value investors have been crushed gently rather than in sharp, jagged falls. But I do not think the positive sentiment surrounding this company and its vaunted legacy in the high-tech pantheon has been sufficiently washed away yet. There is still way too much belief that Intel can seamlessly compete in mobile and cloud. There are still hopeful longs who believe the turnaround begins any day now. This can be seen in the valuation, in my opinion, and in the media's hesitance to talk about the company the way they now do Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. Until there are signs that Intel has either truly turned things around or has become more detested, I see very little opportunity for an investment here. This is precisely what a Value Trap looks like.</Msg><Username>aintezbeinred</Username><Timestamp>1366300195770</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:49:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366300279508-80</Id><Topic><Title>Time to invest in Intel?

The OS is an option. Few corporations have committed to Win8 because of additional OS support costs and lack of HW to take advantage of the touch interface. Companies are waiting for touch system choices and their own internal qualification to make the conversion. They will make it when their is an advantage. Now, IMO, they are simply waiting for the Haswell touch systems before making the change. WinXP to Vista conversion was for 64-bit support. That happed at an expected, moderate pace. Vista to Win7 conversion was for stability and performance. That conversion happened OVERNIGHT. Win7 to Win8 conversion is driven by TOUCH and a NEED for touch. Otherwise Win7 works fine and is an option when buying systems. Windows 8 caused no problems for Intel. Microsoft just decided they wanted to go ARM and did want any help from Intel.

At retail stores nearly all systems are offered with W8. In reality, consumers have very little choice but to buy what Microsoft pushes to the retail channel - at least if they want WIndows. Before W8 launched even Intel's CEO made the comment that "Windows wasn't ready for prime time" or something very near that. His comment was an understatement compared to what the industry and the public was to learn about Metro. There is no question that W8 halted or delayed sales of existing desktops and notebooks without touch. The disconnect between what the OS was promising relative to what the user could realize was enough to do it. And yes, anyone that could have waited this long will probably wait for touch and now Haswell.

What to make of this? I think we'll get another Intel big announcement pretty soon...] Intel's CEO seemed to throw cold water on a chip deal with Apple in Tuesday's earnings conference call -- though it really depends on how you read his comments. When asked about making processors based on the ARM design -- such as Apple's A series chips -- Paul Otellini was quick to dismiss the idea. "No," was the short answer from Otellini. The longer answer stipulated "ground rules" where Intel "would not enable a chip competitor." But Otellini did seem to leave an opening for his successor, depending how you choose interpret his comments about the foundry business. "It would be great if we could form a strategic relationship with a customer so that it went beyond just a single foundry transaction," he said, meaning that Intel would like to be more than just a garden variety contract manufacturer. Otellini also said in the call that Intel's foundry business has passed the first stage and hinted at announcements to come. "I've described the strategy before as a crawl, walk, run strategy. We're past crawling. We're in the mode of collecting serious customers...as you'd expect in this business, and there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly announced," he said. Whatever the case, Otellini will be gone in about a month and his successor may have very different ideas.

Otellin also commented that that the foundry business would not be meaningful for couple of years. This means a strategic deal with Apple would be Atom based and therefore not foundry. It is hard to imagine how Apple could be so late in making a decision here because it would take a while to convert designs. It must be that Apple is prepared to use Intel's standard processors. They would not have to announce any decision until new Apple products were announced. I also think the "no" is a stronger position then a few months ago.

You get to the dimensions that we are at today, and reverse engineering destroys the part in a way that you can't analyze it. So, you know there's Hafnium in there, but you have no idea how we use it, what the proportions are. So, it's becoming more difficult for everybody to, sort of, ride the coattails, either as equipment manufacturers or as device manufacturers." Don't know if he means 22nm or 14nm. Don't know how much weight to put on this statement but if true it seems like it would be a gamechanger.

Yes - today's pop is a short squeeze, so it's partly artificial. However - it would not happen if overall market sentiment was as negative in the long term as many pundits imply. Also - I agree that margins will go down some. However - I still believe businesses and institutions are going to opt for windows tablets (intc) over other tablets in the long run - simply because of legacy issues (not necessarily because they are MSFT fanboys). I think they will be willing to pay more (although how much more remains to be seen). I think if intc can just get back onto a trajectory of growth they will be rewarded with a decent multiple. I'm thinking 30ish in a couple years.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1366319804471</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:16:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366319969728-132</Id><Topic><Title>"Pundits"</Title><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1366311855349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:04:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clarification: 30ish as in stock price - not PE ratio.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1366319969728</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366322020555-133</Id><Title>Boston suspects look like two young middle easterners</Title><Msg>Gosh I'm shocked.

Lora Ho - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance Well, based on our current estimation, it will be roughly second quarter 2014. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Morris Chang quote, A few comments on 20-nanometers and 16-nanometers, FinFET. On 20-nanometers, risk production has started in the first quarter, that is last quarter. Engagements with the customers are on schedule, have scheduled 20 product tape outs for this year from multiple customer, many of these tape outs will drive high-production volume and yield progress on 20-nanometer is on track. On 16-nanometer FinFET, we have said several times that this is a change in cadence in our new technology introduction. It used to be 2 years per node and in the case of 16-nanometers FinFET, it follows just 1 year, by 1 year, the 20 SoC. So it is a quickening of cadence and that is because of market request, market requirements, customers' requests. Compared with the 20-nanometers, the 16 FinFET has same metal pitch but tighter front-end FinFET design rules. The reason we can introduce it so quickly after the 20 is because the 16 FinFET can leverage the learning from 20-nanometers in interconnect and in double patterning. The yield improvement of the 16 FinFET is ahead of schedule. It is on track to begin volume production within 1 year from 20-nanometers.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366339627712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 22:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366339650835-154</Id><Topic><Title>Half Intel and Half Apple?</Title><Username>agermangymnast</Username><Timestamp>1366334227280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:17:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's be a little more specific.

By Ellyne Phneah | April 19, 2013 -- 02:52 GMT IBM reportedly is in active discussions to sell its x86 server hardware business to Lenovo, in a deal that could be worth up to US$6 billion. According to a report Thursday by technology integrators publication CRN, which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter, the deal would encompass IBM's System x line which includes Intel and AMD-based tower, rack and blade servers. IBM is seeking US$5 billion to US$6 billion for its x86 server business, revealed a high ranking industry executive tracking the deal who spoke to the publication on the condition of anonymity. Lenovo emerged as a desirable candidate because IBM is only interested in selling its x86 server business to companies it does not view as a threat to other parts of the business, the executive said. Lenovo fits the bill because it does not have in-house storage, networking or converged infrastructure offerings, and does not have much of a footprint in the data center space. continued; zdnetDOTcom/ibm-reportedly-in-talks-to-sell-server-biz-to-lenovo-7000014244/</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366341085695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 23:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366341170655-158</Id><Topic><Title>Now that ARM is a gonner, Analysts will say AMD will take marketshare.

Apples problem is that intel based Tablets, phones, Notebooks, Convertables are already here on the market and selling head to head with better features against Apple offerings. Other problem Apple is facing is that intel based superior products will be getting even better, very much so, in the very near future.

Samsung uses gate first / TSMC gate last which as far I understand is not transparent. so they need to adjust design which takes time. TSMC needs to provide fab space, order equipment (which can have up to 9 to 12 months lead time). Apple decision to go with TSMC (which I assume they will) has been made on info/data that was available 12 to 18 months ago - making this decision based on today's data might be different. A lot has changed over the last 12 months to Intel's advantage. Intel demonstrated successfully that they can come with a SoC that is competitive. Apple has very large work force of designers - if Apple would enter a strategic partnership with Intel Apple's internal structure would/could be affected. Maybe Apple design team and Intel design team can come up with something that merges the best of Apple's world with Intel's world. Apple's main enemy is Samsung - so Intel and Apple could forge an alliance to go specifically after Samsung while Intel by itself could persue its own SoC in emerging markets (Intel would go after the Mediateks of the world and after QCOM)</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366342215672</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 23:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366342840764-164</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC call, 20nm production</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366339627712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 22:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great job - dig into TSMC CC - how many analysts that follow Intel attended the TSMC call?

Covello demonstrated first hand how clueless he is not understanding at all what TSMC is doing. TSMC first quarter 2013 capex run rate was $10 billion - and how much additional revenue did TSMC get in Q1 (based on absolute sales numbers) ?</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366342840764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 23:40:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366343481878-165</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC call, 20nm production</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366339627712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 22:47:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly mid-2014 is the Initial 2% REVENUE production.
