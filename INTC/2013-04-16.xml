Since Intel did not warn, we can assume that Intel will beat 0.41 tomorrow. Now, if you go back to last conference call, Intel stated that they expect revenue to grow by low single digits. If Intel grows just 2% this year, we are looking at a record year in revenue of over $54 billion. This is very achievable, with new products such as Haswell, bay trail, clover trail, Merrifield; and deals with Altera and soon to be announced Cisco deal (worth $1 billion). Intel also stated that they expected margins to remain flat for this quarter due to 14nm upgrade cost. So if Intel meet their target of $12.7 billion for Q1, then for sure this quarter will be substantially higher. And Q3 and Q4 will be huge since margins will be back to normal. This means analysts are forced to increase their estimate for Q2 and for rest of the year.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1366085750467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:15:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366085956534-4</Id><Title>89% less energy, 80% less space and costing 77% less</Title><Msg>Whatever ARM advantage has left must be 5X smaller.

The ASUS Taichi features back-to-back displays both able to support FULL HD 1080p resolution. The outer 1080p display is also a touchscreen, allowing you to close your ultrabook and use it as a tablet if you want. You are able to use a stylus to interact with the touch screen. The ASUS Taichi 31 was announced last year, and it garnered much attention for its dual displays. However, the ASUS delayed the availability of this ultrabook, much to the disappointment of potential buyers. ASUS never stated why it delayed the availability of the Taichi 31, however it still released the smaller, 11.6-inch Taichi 21 to the marketplace, which went on sale in October 2012. The ASUS Taichi 31 boasts some impressive specs. It has two 13.3-inch Super IPS+ 1080p displays, an SSD drive, your choice of a Intel Ivy Bridge i5 or i7 processor, dual-band WiFi, two USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth 4.0, a 5MP rear-facing camera capable of recording 1080p video, a front-facing camera capable of recording 720p video, and Windows 8. This ultrabook hybrid is also claimed to be able to survive up to 7 hours on a single charge thanks to ASUS’s Super Hybrid Engine II technology.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366087589687</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366087622449-8</Id><Topic><Title>ASUS Taichi 31 ultrabook with back-to-back 1080p displays finally launches</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366087589687</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:46:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From Slashgear</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366087622449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:47:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366087696232-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel should get some good lookin babe for CEO.

This makes 20nm economically unattractive. We therefore think 20nm could be a node that ramps more slowly than 28nm. We also do not see this problem going away. While TSMC is accelerating 16nm development to entice customers to move ahead, our concern is that the risk/reward is becoming more skewed towards the negative.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366088648065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 01:04:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366088718213-13</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts Earnings Worry Poll - Final Edition</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366083910044</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:45:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brought to u by the 29 to 21 dream team...follow them to 17...Keep up the cruddy work walmart wally. you are a discredit to investors anywhere.</Msg><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1366088718213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 01:05:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366089314571-14</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts Earnings Worry Poll - Final Edition</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366083910044</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:45:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC has been buying back a lot of stock, and trying to support the shares.

Smartphone/tablet market share improvement and 10.) Something else:____________.......something revolutionary, way ahead of schedule. Roadmaps are good for production and product cycles, though maybe intel says too much about the product and it's future ability. These statements dampen demand for older product lines. Plus detaied roadmaps tend to provide short side amunition to discredit or plant uncertainty in customer minds before the product launch, plus the launch tends to be another just what I expected, yawn, event. Does Apple disclose full features of it's phones/tablets prior to the launch? Lots of speculation, with always a suprise unexpected feature, to get the media buzz. I Would rather Intel just launch Haswell, avoton, other with more fanfare regarding an unexpected feature that is that much better power consumption (than ARM). Yet Intel tends to deliver just what they say they will on their road map, yawn, easy pickings for ARM camp to counter. Heck, why dosen't intel spell out on it's core processors which is Tri-gate (eg,Core7-3D) ditch the "i" as it is meaningless. The term "3D" is recognisable to the end user consumer, though few will understand the benefits, most will want the new "3D" processor, as opposed to a non 3D ARM processor. Demand for intel PC products is feeding from consumers, not OEM's. MHO: Intel marketing needs to do a lot better, they are a shambles, and have dragged intel PC product lines into commidity likenesses. All in all, tomorrows results are a marketing exercise, rather than an actual result announcement. If intel wanted to just announce, simply just publish the result. So for me the most fearful thing that intel could possibly do to shorts is simply marketing themselves better, saying less about future product specific features, saying more about how surprised they are about yeilds, performance gains, power consumption. People and markets love and reward positive surprises (hate and penalise negative surprises).</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1366093600086</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 02:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366093679587-25</Id><Topic><Title>Fab u less</Title><Username>dominateamerika</Username><Timestamp>1366044483483</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 12:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lu is not particularly concerned about Intel (INTC) who is LU ?

Die bondout pads are located around the edge of the die. There are some tricks that you do to increase the number of pads (offset second ring) but the problem Intel most likely enountered is the die size is too small rather than some purely marketing reason. If you add another address line, you have to have an extra bondout pad available. If you have exhausted the pad limitation, you have to make the die slightly bigger to handle the extra bondout pads. The extra die size increases cost. Cost (die size) versus benefit is the likely tradeoff.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366118933911</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 09:28:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366119082959-43</Id><Topic><Title>The "happy ARM days" are over</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1366088648065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 01:04:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You epitomize the stupidity of the ARM crowd. ---- If you say so;) ---- So you think rising prices and slow performance increases for ARM Soc's are going to work out good when competing with Intel chips that will be declining in cost with substantially increasing performance and battery life ---- If you say so;)</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1366119082959</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 09:31:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366119375775-44</Id><Title>How will that 4% dividend look</Title><Msg>after this turd drops to 19?</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1366119375775</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 09:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366119671364-45</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic article.

Yes, there are issues such as a common BIOS model but other points that Pike makes are rather dubious. As an example, no one knows the best approach to manage these microservers. When you've 10K nodes in a cluster (x86 or ARM) the current VM approach doesn't work.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1366125033219</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 11:10:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366125041767-78</Id><Topic><Title>(Ha, ha, ha...)

Ericsson (ERIC) just announced they are paying Microsoft (MSFT) nearly $200mm to acquire their Mediaroom multi-screen IPTV software in order to increase their multi-screen reach by 11 million pay-TV households to 16 million for a 25% multi-screen market share. CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen software is superior to Mediaroom and CCUR has already signed multi-screen deals with the #1 largest cable TV companies in Japan, Germany, and the UK. These three huge CCUR multi-screen clients have a total of 14.8 million subscribers, which will put CCUR second in this space behind ERIC. CCUR only has 8.72mm shares outstanding and is currently $6.16 with a market cap of $53.715mm. CCUR has $24.6mm in cash and no debt. This gives CCUR an enterprise value of only $29.115mm, which is less than half its annualized revenue of $66.4mm and only 3.5X its cash flow from operations over the last 3 quarters alone! CCUR's video business, which has also captured the #1 largest video-on-demand (VOD) market share with a reach of 50 million households, is currently receiving no value at all! CCUR spent $15mm just to acquire their Media Data Intelligence business, which tracks 35mm pay-TV subscribers and holds a 35% market share in the markets it serves. CCUR also has a "real-time" ultra high performance computer technology business with annualized revenue of $27.6mm and 4 of the world's top 5 defense manufacturers as clients. This business is probably worth $25-30mm on its own. CCUR's multi-screen/VOD video business with $33.8mm in annualized revenue is currently being valued at less than zero! CCUR is extremely profitable with its EPS doubling the past two quarters in a row! CCUR pays a huge 3.9% dividend.</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1366128365842</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:06:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366128761630-93</Id><Topic><Title>After market dip</Title><Username>issi2668</Username><Timestamp>1366123847655</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 10:50:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I did use last earnings report to load up sub 21 so I guess I am looking forward to this again.

This news just came out. "Intel April 22 straddle priced for 3.8% move into Q1 04/16 16-Apr-13 11:52:00" First of all the mkts have peaked. There must be a little more room upwards here but after earnings season is over you will see profit taking in May. Secondly the bar has been lowered so drastically that everyone is expected to beat. Thirdly the feds QE's has helped only the elite 1% not the middle or the working class so the consumer is still in the hole. Only the rich have their finances back to normal before the 2008-2009 crash. The divergences in the indexes and the prices is not something one should ignore. If that's the case then the mkt might as well go to 18K on optimism and the fact that the Fed is not gonna slow down on asset buying anytime soon and create a bubble again. The CPI numbers this morning that inflation is at 0.2% is a bunch of fluff. Uncle Ben must be getting groceries from St. Felix's Pantry and living in a shelter overnight with Wally and Lucy Nuff. There will be better entry points to get into intel rather than todays price of 21.80.

Based on documents we received, the Coby MID1054 will run on an Intel Atom Z2460 1.6GHz. It’s only a single-core processor but has Hyperthreading so it acts like it’s dual-core. The last device we saw running a Z2460 is the Motorola Razr i XT890 and the benchmarks were really good. Coby MID1054 specs: 10.1-inch capacitive WXGA LCD @ 1280×800 pixels Intel Atom Medfield Z2460 1.6GHz Hyperthreading 1GB RAM 8GB internal storage up to 32GB via microSD card USB 2.0 port mini-HDMI port WiFi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 2.0 2MP rear camera 0.3MP front-facing camera Android 4.0 ICS Li-Po 5,150mAh battery We’re not sure about the graphics but it could also be a PowerVR SGX540 just like the Razr i. Coby promises up to 8 hours full HD video playback on a single full charge. We’ll check out a demo unit tomorrow and share with you performance and benchmarks. The unit is expected to be released in the Philippines this June and will retail for about Php12,995.</Msg><Username>aladieistight</Username><Timestamp>1366138197694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 14:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366138280517-118</Id><Title>How many you guys holding INTC HPQ ?</Title><Msg>I would dump those 2 if you don't have a good stomach</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1366138280517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 14:51:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366138465719-119</Id><Topic><Title>We all know INTC earnings will be bad...how come no one selling?</Title><Username>warmninja</Username><Timestamp>1366134035704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:40:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"analysts bet on Intel future (mobile &amp; server)."

There are really just two big areas of price to be concerned with ahead of results. It woud take a move above or below the range high and low to change the direction of the stock significantly from where it has been in the last two months. On the upside, the 200-day moving average is strong resistance at $22.51. A breakout above this price level that persists would get the stock back on a bullish footing, with next resistance at $23.37. The downtrend that was in place before the move up in recent months would not resume until or if price breaks the 52-week low at $19.23. In between that low and the 200-day, the stock would just be marking time, heading sideways. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>dellyabq</Username><Timestamp>1366141103662</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366141518781-134</Id><Title>Looks like INTC is going to miss the 55 cents by a lot.</Title><Msg>Looks like INTC is going to miss the 55 cents by a lot.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1366141518781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366141575954-135</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like INTC is going to miss the 55 cents by a lot.</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1366141518781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:45:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could be since 41 cents is the forecast.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366141575954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:46:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366141665077-136</Id><Topic><Title>Be very careful</Title><Username>kn592</Username><Timestamp>1365687526585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well I have said enough.

Intel says it's keeping its sales and margin forecasts for this year, even as first-quarter PC sales plunged 14 percent from a year ago, as measured by research firm IDC. The chipmaker also met analyst forecast for the just-ended quarter. It earned $2 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the January to March period. Revenue was $12.6 billion, slightly below the midpoint of its own forecast. Investors were relieved, sending Intel shares up 2.4 percent in extended trading Tuesday, after the release of the report.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366144966694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:42:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366144981721-202</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Down Again on Another Big NASDAQ Day</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366144169779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:29:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not Dana, and you deciding that everyone that sees you as ignorant is just one person when millions can see this board just shows how arrogant and ignorant you are.

After July it looks good.</Msg><Username>kemlikis</Username><Timestamp>1366145900488</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366145990630-219</Id><Topic><Title>Somebody tell me again why inline results and guidance is good news.</Title><Username>jctuttle13</Username><Timestamp>1366143065906</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:11:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will tell you look for the price tomorrow and you will know that results are not good at all this is going tomorrow down 2%</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1366145990630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366146194852-220</Id><Title>Intel CFO: Haswell Chips to Be in Devices This Quarter -Fox Business</Title><Msg>Intel CFO: Haswell Chips to Be in Devices This Quarter -Fox Business Last update: 4/16/2013 4:39:05 PM (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires April 16, 2013 16:39 ET (20:39 GMT)</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1366146194852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 17:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366146276462-221</Id><Topic><Title>Somebody tell me again why inline results and guidance is good news.</Title><Username>jctuttle13</Username><Timestamp>1366143065906</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:11:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, we will see what the guidance looks like in the conference call but on the face of things.

With Haswell and Baytrail and dual boot Windows/Android tablets Intel should be able to make huge gains in the tablet market. And yes, Microsoft couldn't have made things worse for existing PC sales than its action to force Metro on all devices without touch. If Microsoft gets its act together Intel and Microsoft have a very real opportunity to transform the tablet space by year-end. Intel should also be able to make good inroads into the smartphone market but that will follow Merrifield and to some extent LTE.

In Apr 2011 Intel was trading at $19.83. It took a GS downgrade and lower rating on May 16th to stop the uptrend at $23.41. Two years ago today, it would have been a really dumb idea. A better idea would have been to wait until May 16th when the downgrade occurred. Of course, Intel only spent 1 week below the $19.83 and was above that level the rest of the time.

The price of Windows 8 touch devices will sink to price points that penetrate inexpensive tablet territory. Those new "innovative" designs will be based on Intel's upcoming quad-core "Bay Trail" chip, Intel executives said today during the company's first-quarter earnings conference call. "If you look at touch-enabled Intel-based notebooks that are ultrathin using [Bay Trail] processors. Those prices are going to be down to as low as $200," said Intel CEO Paul Otellini. The Bay Trail chip is a complete redesign of the Atom micro architecture and is expected to get Atom chips closer to mainstream Intel chips in performance. Otellini also said he expects more standard ultrabook designs based on the upcoming Haswell chip to come in as low as $499.

Merrifield powered phones will rule the roost in terms speed. There could be a Merrifield inside Apple in the near future. 3. Intc upped its q2 revenue guidance to 13.4 B from 12.8B. 4. Current atom z2760 tablets and ultra books seem to be selling well (a subjective opinion) according to number of reviews on amzon, bestbuy, and dell. 5. HP plans to introduce a W8 tablet/ultrabook, which shows their confidence in that product. 6. Their data center server processors are doing well and have a good future. 7. Intc may introduce their set-top box later this year; the buzz is that its a good product, although it is not going be cheap and is geared for those who want something better and can pay for it. Actually, I am disappointed as I hoping for some kind of cheaper, a la carte service. Also, it requires an internet connection on top of the fee for their service which means it will cost more than your typical bundled cable/internet/phone service.

"That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before," said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. "They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning."] From Intel's CC; Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein You spoke before about your increased confidence now versus last year. But if I’m just looking over the last three months, we have weaker results in Q1, which raises the operational bar for the second half, on both top line and gross margin, which suggests you’re even more confident in that back half ramp than you were three months ago, even in the wake of what looks to be pretty challenging market data. You’re also taking capex down, though, which would belie that increased confidence some. I was just wondering, could you help me identify the sources of that increased confidence in that back half ramp versus where you were three months ago, as well as help me rationalize that with the cut to the capex outlook. Stacy Smith First of all, just to make sure I’m not oversoaking things here, you really just need seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low single digit revenue growth. So I don’t think we have a hugely high bar out there, and I went through a dissection of where I think the revenue comes from.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1366164407097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366165101673-332</Id><Title>Intel foundry business</Title><Msg>"And the third, that we have not mentioned on the call yet today, is that it would be great if we could form a strategic relationship with a customer so that it went beyond just a single foundry transaction." Who fits that profile ? MacBooks didn't both Apple and Intel work closely together to make Applebooks ultrathin and what about the USB drive...it certainly would not apply to ALTR nor CSCO (that's just a foundry deal to make chips) - strategic relationship is different. I think Intel and Apple work on FinFet - there are other goodies Apple could benefit from like 2.5D or 3D In terms of the business, as Stacy said I think last quarter, it will not have a significant revenue impact to the company for two to three years. That’s the design cycle for these products. And in the case of someone like Altera, the products tend to run for quite some time. So think of that as something that will start two-plus years from now and run for quite a number of years thereafter on several generations of technology. No, it hasn’t. I think the ground rules that we’ve laid out, I have three that I was looking at. One would be value-based pricing, to take advantage of our technology. The second is that we would not enable a chip competitor. No, it hasn’t. I think the ground rules that we’ve laid out, I have three that I was looking at.

The logic is simple: if management itself is not confident on growth prospects, it will not replenish its asset base (already at a record old age across the world) and will not invest in projects that have a high hurdle rate but only after several years of gestation. Instead, management will merely opt to use the company as a cash cow in the here and now, extracting as much shareholder value is possible with dividends and buybacks while the future viability of the company... well, that can be some other management team's concern.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1366165248352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366166013116-334</Id><Title>The most interesting point in the cc was when..</Title><Msg>some anal-cyst starting projecting into 2014 and there was sudden silence, then PO said "we haven't discussed 2014."
