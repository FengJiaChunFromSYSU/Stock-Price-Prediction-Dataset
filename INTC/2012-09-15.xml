Too bad all you stock jockeys have no clue as to how important the fabless semiconductor ecosystem is in all this. TSMC is the center of that universe. Add Samsung in there as well. They will pass Intel soon enough. That will be a painful day for all." *** Hahahahahahaha. Wow, a new record for cluelessness. To wit: 1.) ARM has already gone fabless, shill boy. It's why their fabrication is falling apart. The fabless semiconductor ecosystem is a trainwreck and apparently everyone knows it but you. The reason? Money. Fabs now cost about $10 billion each. Since none of those wonderful fabless ARM shops contributes, the foundries lack capital. That's why there are only two decent ARM foundries left. One (TSMC) is falling further and further behind and Samsung competes with its customers and sues and is being sued by them. Neither is a good choice which is why the fabless model is totally broken. There simply aren't good choices for ARM shops. And on top of this they don't have the needed capacity, which is killing companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm. 2.) These wonderful foundries aren't going to pass Intel. They are falling further and further behind in the technology race. They are struggling with 28nm, won't have 20nm for years and have nothing after 20nm except for more delays as they try to tackle EUV and 450mm. They don't have FinFET and won't for years. In the meantime Intel already has functioning 14nm and plans for 10 and 7nm. 3.) IDF clearly indicated where Intel is going and it's an impressive roadmap. A shame you didn't know what any of it meant. In 2013 Intel will take total control of the fabrication space. And this is why the pit boss should never let you paid shills talk about technology or fundamentals.Say the stock went down at some point in the past or will go down at some point in the future and leave it at that. Because that's all you can say without embarrassing yourselves by making posts like the one above. But, hey - everyone needs a laugh. Saying TSMC is the center of the universe is as reliable laugh line as exists in the tech business. And what's hugely funny is that you said it with a straight face. If you are looking for a serious line then try: TSMC is the center of the ARM fabrication crisis universe.

Previous generation microarchitecture, including Ivy Bridge, has only 6 execution ports. Haswell acquired two additional ports. It means that theoretically the future processors will execute the code considerably faster, as they will theoretically be able to execute up to eight micro-ops simultaneously per clock. Of course, these instructions should be specifically selected, because the execution ports aren’t universal. They added the fourth port for integer and logical instructions, which is a dedicated special port, and unlike the first three doesn’t get blocked during AVX instructions execution, for instance. As a result, Haswell makes it possible to execute up to four integer operations per clock. It is a very important improvement, because Intel’s processor decoder can deliver up to four-five instructions per clock to the execution units. In other words, they have completely eliminated a potential bottleneck in the new microarchitecture design. They also introduced an additional Branch-unit, which should significantly improve performance with high branch code. They also added a special port exclusively for store address commands. This enabled Haswell to do 2 loads and a store every cycle. Moreover, they offer two ports for floating-point (i.e. AVX2) operations. As a result, the peak performance during 256-bit commands execution via first two ports alone doubled compared with the previous generation processors. This modification was necessary because AVX2 instruction set includes principally new FMA-instructions (Fused Multiply-Add), which consist of two operations at the same time – multiplication and addition. Of course, executing those using old resources could cause significant delays, that is why they Intel provided two separate execution ports just for these instructions. As a result, Haswell allows executing two complex FMAs every cycle per core. By the way, do not forget that AVX2 instruction set also supports integer operations with 256-bit vectors. They are performed by separate execution units. Haswell’s performance during floating-point calculations should be very impressive. Twice the speed over Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge as well as over processors on Bulldozer microarchitecture achieved due to new FMA-instructions make Haswell a great “FP number cruncher”." anandtech[dotcom]/show/6263/intel-haswell-architecture-disclosure-live-blog</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347706570199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:56:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347706928181-13</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone 5 Has 32nm A6 Chip</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347509400784</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 00:10:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wonder why Apple sticks with 800MHz and then 1.2GHz with their chips when Intel starts with 1.6GHz goes to 2GHz and probably even beyond that next year.

Is this due to the process lead?' It is primarily due to having one Atom core with multi-threading go up against two separate ARM cores without multi-threading. Intel is banking on having the best single-thread performance and having two threads on one core compete against two separate ARM cores. Intel has traded clockspeed for core count in the same power budget knowing its multi-threading will not leave it embarrassed in multi-thread work and it certainly has worked in giving it the best java performance of all smartphones from the start.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347707985925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 07:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347709735385-15</Id><Title>Intel Discloses Future Plans for Atom System-on-Chips for Tablets, Smartphones.</Title><Msg>At the Intel Developer Forum, Intel Corp. officially disclosed its plans concerning the future of Atom-branded system-on-chips and microprocessors aimed at smartphones and tablets. As Atom devices made using 22nm process technology are over a year away, the world's largest chipmaker plans to offer Clover Trail+ refresh for existing offerings, providing dual-core SoCs for smartphones and even higher-end solutions for tablets. The first solution to be available from Intel shortly is the next-generation Intel Atom system-on-chip code-named 'Clover Trail', which was architected specifically for Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 8. Clover Trail is made using Intel's 32nm process technology and will be based on Saltwell micro-architecture. In many ways, Cloverview processor will resemble Atom Z2460 'Medfield' and Atom Z2610 'Medfield' chips, but will feature two x86 cores, improved graphics adapter and 1.80GHz burst clock-speed. To make Clover Trail/Medfield more appealing to manufacturers, Intel plans to offer Penwell PoP (package-on-package) system-on-chip with up to 2GB of integrated LPDDR2 memory. The first Intel Atom 'Clover Trail' will power Microsoft Windows 8-based lightweight tablets and convertibles that Intel promises to provide 'outstanding battery life and always-on technology in sleek designs'. Intel articulates the advantages of Intel-based Windows 8 devices, noting that Intel Atom- and Intel Core-based tablets and convertibles will deliver a range of new features from enhanced media capabilities, security built for enterprise vertical market solutions, and support for the breadth of applications written for Intel processors, thus retaining the software investment of IT and consumers. 'We believe Windows 8 on Intel architecture will deliver the best experience, performance and compatibility across computing platforms,' said David Perlmutter, chief product officer of Intel. Sometime next year, Intel plans to reveal Atom Z2460 'Medfield' with up to 2.0GHz burst clock-speed as well as Atom Z2580 'Clover Trail+' platform for smartphones with two x86 cores as well as graphics performance improved by two times. The Cloverview+ system-on-chips for smartphones should provide significant performance boost for Intel-based smartphones and therefore will be used inside superphones with ultra-premium features. As previously reported, in late 2013 Intel plans to release its Bay Trail platform with code-named Valleyview system-on-chip, which will be made using 22nm process technology and which will offer a lot of new technologies and new features. source: Xbitlabs</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347709735385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 07:48:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347709826192-16</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone 5 Has 32nm A6 Chip</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347509400784</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 00:10:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That makes a lot of sense.

Intel will have FIVE factories produciing 22nm by the end of the year and 14nm by the end of next year. Anyone who doesn't think this is going to totally change the competitive landscape doesn't know enough to have an opinion...] There was one thing missing from the Intel Developer Forum this week: an executive holding up a wafer of 14nm SRAM and crowing about how the company is well on the way to the next big advancement in process technology. After all, it was three years ago that the company held up its first 22nm SRAM wafer (albeit without any information on what turned out to be the Tri-Gate or FinFet transistors). But Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr gave an update on the company's technology process. He said that the 14nm process is in full development and on track for "production readiness" at the end of next year. Bohr said the company is currently manufacturing 22nm chips in three factories: D1D in Oregon, Fab 32 in Arizona, and Fab 32 in Israel. D1C in Oregon and Fab 12 in Arizona are on track to start 22nm production by the end of the year. One interesting thing he mentioned is that the company has approximately the same defect density at all of its fabs thanks to its "copy exactly" methodology. All of the 22nm production to date has been Intel's CPU technology, but the company is prepping a variation on the process for its SoCs designs, presumably including the 22nd Atom SoC mobile architecture known as Silvermont, promised for next year. Many things are the same in the CPU and SoC designs, including the Tri-Gate transistors, which Bohr said work well on analog devices despite skepticism from some in the industry. Among the big differences with the SoC process is that it needs to focus on low-leakage transistors for better battery life; support dense upper-level interconnects; and support high-voltage connections to legacy I/O devices at 1.2, 1.8, and 3.3 Volts. Bohr explained that Intel is able to do this through thicker oxide layers within the transistor. He noted that in practice, different circuits on the same die may use different transistors, combining high-voltage and low-voltage transistors (with thick and standard oxide layers.

What does this mean? It means that long before 5nm goes into production, Intel and ARM will have swapped P/E ratios. And there is nothing ARM can do about it. Nothing. They don't have FinFET, they don't have 14nm capability, they don't have enough R&amp;D money, and they don't have enough capital to build fabs. They are losing the fabrication race today and it's only going to get worse. ARM has two competitive foundries. That's it. And they are fading fast. Just look at Apples' iPhone 5 32nm "new product"...] Bohr said the company is still working on new process technologies on a two-year cadence, using a components research team to identify promising new technology, as well as development and manufacturing teams. As he's done before, he shared a slide that listed many of the items in research, but cautioned against reading too much into it, saying these are just a sample of research directions. When asked about extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which the industry has been awaiting for many years, he said it is unlikely to be ready for Intel's 10nm production. He would like to have EUV then, but can't bet on it. He knows he has an immersion lithography solution that works at 10nm, using multiple layers of patterning. Still, this might be ready for 7nm production for Intel, which seems to be around the same time as Intel is hoping to move to 450mm wafers. EUV is very important to Intel's future, which is why the company recently invested in lithography maker ASML. Where will this end? In another presentation, Bohr said classical silicon chip scaling hit its physical limits ten year ago, but the industry has always found ways around that. Thirty years ago, people were forecasting that chip scaling would end at 1 micron, but we've gone well below that. He said he can see a clear path for scaling to continue for at least the next ten years, through the 10, 7, and 5nm generations. He noted that over time, the cost per wafer has gone up, but as transistor density continues to double following Moore's Law, the cost per transistor continues to go down each generation at a steady trend.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347727873558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:51:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347728635531-45</Id><Topic><Title>IDF: 14nm Production on Track for Late 2013; Paths to 10nm and Below</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1347727491262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're very convincing.

Gold said he expected Intel would have convertible ultrabooks running the parts to show at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Pat Moorhead, principal analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, noted that the future processors may actually be even better than the advertised 10 watts. During his morning keynote, Intel product chief Dadi Perlmutter ran a future Haswell part and a current-generation Ivy Bridge chip through the Ungine graphics benchmark. The Ivy Bridge chip chugged along at its advertised 17 watts while the Haswell part matched the third-gen Core chip in performance at just 7.842 watts. Moorhead also suggested that with these new chips, Intel might be able to enable convertible ultrabooks with profiles as thin as 12 millimeters —not terribly far off from the original iPad's 10mm profile. "Thinner convertibles will be much more comfortable as they will be almost as thin as a tablet, but they'll also have the added utility of a keyboard and trackpad," Moorhead said. Such devices could be ideal for users in the market for a single, all-in-one mobile computing device rather than a tablet that servers as a companion to a laptop, he added. Intel could have a pretty serious competitive advantage with the new Haswell chips, Gold said. "It's unlikely that AMD's going to be able to match Intel's Haswell with an x86 part at that power draw. ARM will be able to, but then it won't be an x86 chip," he said. "So you're downsizing the power, potentially creating much thinner devices, using less battery or the same battery with extended battery life, possibly using less materials and thus lowering overall costs. All of that is really good stuff."'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347741860150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:44:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347741869262-70</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell microarcitecture</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347706570199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:56:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't view it as "sanbagging" as much as there is no easy, accurate way of saying: "X" is yy% faster than "Z" because their are many things that affect the equation. At a first level, the relative performance will be affected by whether the code: are the same binaries compared or recompiled? makes a difference. is the application being compared small or large? makes a difference. is the comparison taken at the same number of cores, frequency, power consumption, .... ? makes a difference. 1. Some of the Haswell features will improve performance on the same binary bits. 2. Some of the Haswell features will require recompilation. 3. Some of the Haswell features will require source code modification. The newer compilers will generate the instruction sequences to take advantage of the new execution ports "on purpose" rather than Haswell removing stalls from old binaries. If customers are lucky, a recompile might even kick in AVX2 or other new features. Most of that code has already been "tuned" and will have to be changed to take full advantage. New features like the Haswell transactional memory will require some work to incorporate. Any software that makes heavy use of locks will likely see a much larger than 10% improvement. If you look back at each new CPU, Intel has generally said that it is "10% faster".</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1347741869262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347742525159-71</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks Wallis, intc_inside, and others...</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1347728858760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:07:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reviewing the IDF announcements gave me great confidence in where Intel is at the moment and where they are going. Here are the dynamics to pay attention to: 1.) Intel has recognized that mobility is the major growth area and has total re-organized priorities to address this. They have changed the timetables for all mobile strategies and moved them to the top. 2.) This is totally clear when you see Intel has favored power consumption issues over performance issues. This is why performance on Haswell isn't any greater. Instead of being a bad thing, as the ARM paid shill fanboi indicated, this is a very good thing. Intel needs to put the power consumption issue to rest and they are doing exactly that. In 2013 Intel will move past ARM on power consumption efficiency and that will be the end of that. What was ARMs most competitive characteristic will be gone. A real game changing event that will occur in 2013. Of course, don't expect Wall Street or any of the cockroach shills on this board to note that this is going to happen. It's the end of the road for them. 3.) The companies that went with Intel early on in smartphones and mobility will look like geniuses by the end of 2013. This early adoption is going to put them in the catbird seat for superior performance and power consumption efficiency that ARM will not be able to match. Again coming in 2013. With Intel already having a competitive product, imagine what additional advantages the new processes in 2013 will bring. 4.) ARMs fabrication is toast. Two to three years til 20nm volume production. And then after that - nothing. They are looking at at least 4 years to develop 14nm. This will give Intel three years of having their way with the market with their 14nm production. Three years! It is now and will continue to be all about the fabrication. Intel has it, ARM doesn't. And in four years Intel will be doing volume production on 10nm and getting 7nm ready. No company that has to be on or even near the cutting edge of technology will be able to rely on ARMs fading fabrication. 5.) The ARM roadmap after 20nm is a big, huge VOID. They will likely have to do EUV and maybe even 450mm at the same time. It took TSCM a year to get 28nm yields up to a decent level. Intel ramped 22nm like a champ and will do the same with 14nm. They are already producing product. Expect all these things to prevent TSMC from reaching volume production on 14nm for years and years and years. It's so far out in the future with so many massively complex issues for them to solve that it's not even worth guessing when it might happen. Bottom line is that when it does, Intel will be at least 2 product cycles ahead. Intel is going to own mobility and that's because of its advanced fabrication and manufacturing. Otellini has commented on Intel coming in to a "golden age". This is what he is talking about. He knows ARM can't keep up with Intel's fabrication cycles and that will determine how mobility will play out. 6.) Bottom line is that we are in a bit of a lull while Intel builds traction with their massive efforts in mobility. Wall Street has screwed the pooch by assuming this is the new normal. It's not. It's just the lull before the competitive landscape changes forever. It's not about talking smack like the ARM CEO loves to do. He can talk all he wants. It won't do a thing to diminish Intel's rapidly growing advantage in fabrication. Intel's efforts have gone exactly where they needed to go. Years of preparation are coming to fruition. Game over, ARM. The war is lost.

The new iPhone 5 features 4G LTE, which is going to dramatically improve Internet speeds for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone owners. (Sprint subscribers are left waiting for LTE to arrive where they live.) But globally, the iPhone LTE picture is a disaster. There are two different iPhone models. The AT&amp;T iPhone will work on LTE on T-Mobile USA and in Canada, but not in the rest of the world. The Verizon/Sprint iPhone will work in some European and Asian countries. No iPhone will work on the existing LTE networks in Austria, Brazil, Columbia, Denmark, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland, as iMore points out. The phones will still roam where they can't get LTE; they'll be on 3G, which isn't fatal, but it's a night-and-day difference in terms of speeds. The incompatibility is because there are way too many frequency bands being used for mobile phone networks right now. Apple's a popularizer and refiner of technologies; they're not introducing any radical new RF breakthroughs here, so they're stuck in the same LTE band whirlwind that everyone else is. Between Apple's two models, it's already supporting seven different LTE bands, known as band 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 17 and 25. But European operators have three more bands they use: 7, 20 and 38. They may also use band 8 in the future. Some Asian operators appear to be on Band 40. Here at home, Sprint also plans to use band 26, and some smaller US carriers have band 12. It's a mess. It means phone makers have to put together lots of different models for different countries, and those units will have trouble roaming well in other countries if they travel. It also means small carriers on obscure LTE bands, like 12, have trouble getting phones that work well with their networks because there are no huge carriers placing large orders for them. Can Intel Fix Apple's Problems? Fortunately, across the street from the iPhone event, I saw a potential solution. Intel's Developer Forum was going on just across the street from Apple this week. Up on the second floor, the company was showing off the four relatively lackluster Intel phones so far, as well as a modem technology that could really change things. Intel's XMM6260 modem, which has been in the market for a while, uses a single power amplifier for multiple bands, and it can be extended in software to support as many bands as necessary. It doesn't support LTE or CDMA, which is part of why we haven't seen it in many U.S. products. But the point here, an Intel engineer told me, is that the company will be able to put an unlimited number of bands on a single LTE modem, possibly as soon as late next year. Intel's modems will be able to mate with processors from Samsung, Nvidia, TI, and others. Apple used its modems up until 2010, when it switched over to Qualcomm in part to get Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Modems are only half of the solution, though. Dermot O'Shea, co-founder of antenna firm Taoglas, said antenna design gets difficult when you're covering such a wide range of frequencies. Active antennas for smartphones, which have just started to hit the market this year, can adapt to different bands without being huge, although they add to the cost and complexity of smartphones. We're likely to see more of them next year. Between active antennas and multi-frequency power amplifiers, it looks like phone makers are starting to get their hands around the riot of LTE frequencies; they're just not there yet. Maybe we'll see them in the iPhone 7.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347743807094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:16:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347744008509-75</Id><Topic><Title>ULTRABOOKS ARE A HUGE FLOP</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347718284823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:11:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you don't like the stock why are you here? --------- I'm here because so many of my friends, fans. and followers are here.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1347744008509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:20:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>26</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347745389439-76</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell microarcitecture</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347706570199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:56:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>getanid read why NVDA is bust.

But what about October 2012 ? Since the news is more about convertible or hybrid tables, I'm thinking that Win 8 on Atom doesn't have the fast screen refresh rate needed for touch tablets and that the feature matrix of the convertible tablet is the diversion. An Atom PC convertible tablet without a fast screen refresh rate is just a Netbook re-hash. I have to recommend an Ivy Bridge Ultrabook PC with an 11.6" screen for those who need a carry computer. Look for 1.8 pounds weight and get a fitted sleeve for it. Of course, look for news in October .</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1347752529504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:42:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347754288689-88</Id><Title>yahoo board</Title><Msg>haven't been able to post for maybe 1 or 2 times in 5 days now. #$%$ have they done to these boards?</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1347754288689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347755898008-89</Id><Title>Thieves are trying to steal your shares</Title><Msg>Never fails.

If you look at history, when this happens, Intel cuts costs pretty effectively (expense and employee count reductions), and uses its massive cash position to buy and integrate strategic acquisitions. I would look for these kinds of actions again. I'm a buyer on weakness, and would not be dismayed to see the stock below 20 - my horizons are much longer term with INTC. Its competitive position is a huge moat protecting long term thinking, IMO.</Msg><Username>qniform</Username><Timestamp>1347767019309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 23:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347767268933-105</Id><Topic><Title>BUT Intel?
