That's important for Santa Clara-based Intel, which for years got the cold shoulder from phone and tablet makers because its power-hungry chips shortened the battery life of mobile devices. With its new chips, Intel could find its way into a few more of those gadgets, the study by Bernstein Research analysts said Monday. But they cautioned that the development doesn't mean the world's biggest chipmaker is headed for a huge boost in revenue. Bernstein noted that the ARM camp has such a commanding lead in phones and tablets that Intel probably won't make much of a dent in those markets for a couple of years -- even with its energy-efficient chips. Moreover, Bernstein determined that the performance of ARM-based chips has increased enough to be suitable for low-end notebooks, which could begin to challenge Intel's dominance in the personal computer market. Both chip types "are very close in terms of power efficiency and processing power," the report concluded. As a result, it said, "the competitive fight between the ARM and Intel camps will therefore heat up meaningfully as early as 2013, with likely damages on both sides and no winner." For its study, Bernstein compared Intel's chip in a Motorola RAZR phone and a RAZR phone with an ARM chip. It also compared both chips in similar tablets outfitted with the Windows 8 operating system. "In smartphones, Intel is competitive in terms of power efficiency," the analysts concluded, and the company "poses a credible threat to ARM's dominance" in tablets. But it also said ARM's chips have become more powerful, making them "a very compelling choice" for consumers looking for low-end notebooks. "Overall, there is no stand-out difference in power efficiency or performance between the two camps," the report said, adding that it all points to "more direct competition" between Intel and the ARM chipmakers. Nathan Brookwood, of the market consulting firm Insight 64, agreed that Intel will have trouble making headway in mobile devices. Besides its late start in those markets, he noted, the dominant smartphone suppliers -- Samsung and Apple (AAPL) -- prefer to make their own chips. In addition, he said, other mobile-device makers like ARM chips because it's often easier to mix and match certain features with them than with the kind Intel sells. Another problem for Intel is that ARM chips tend to be cheaper, so the Santa Clara company may need to cut its prices -- and its profit -- to compete, according to a note Raymond James analysts sent their clients. They said Intel's gross margins -- money left over from revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold -- has been 62 percent to 65 percent in recent years. But as Intel ramps up its competition with ARM chipmakers, the analysts warned, "mid 50 percent gross margins are an increasing reality."</Msg><Username>sanjitkumar23</Username><Timestamp>1355807275255</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 00:07:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355807956178-2</Id><Topic><Title>Is it too late for INTC to warn?</Title><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1355801442078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 22:30:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Wouldn't it be better to not warn, get a one time hit to a stock price after bad earnings and be done with it?" Early warning is sort of required by the SEC. When Intel idled capacity, they were required to warn because of the material impact it imposed. "The overarching theme of this guidance – whether formally outlined in binding SEC pronouncements or non-binding Staff interpretations, or informally expressed by Staff members in speeches – is the importance of providing “early-warning” disclosures of material risks and uncertainties that, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on a particular company’s liquidity, capital resources or operating results.

In smartphone, they will be debuting a new dual core medfield SoC with LTE 4G support. Devices with this SoC will be superior to iPhone and Samsung's galaxy s3/note2 in both performance and battery life. I know that may be difficult for some of you to believe but we will see soon enough. Some of you may argue that phones with ARM's Cortex A15 will come out, but I don't think so. An example of the A15 is Samsung's Exynos 5250, which has TPD of 4W and cannot go into a phone. Unless TSMC or GF can quickly move to finFet any soon, A15 in phones just will not happen. Even with big.Little configuration is questionable. On small tablet, Intel will come out with Clover Trail+ which again will be superior to competition (Exynos 5250). Contrary to media's #$%$ about tablets canabalizing the PC and that tablets are the end-all be-all form factor; in 2013, we will witness the emergence of the real end-all be-all form factor - the convertible form factor. Convertibles combine touch capabilities like a tablet, but has attached keyboard and mouse pad to do real work. Some examples of convertibles are the Lenovo Yoga or Dell's XPS 12 convertible. Convertibles will be the form factor that will replace both the larger tablet (eg. iPad, Nexus 10) and the current ultrabook type. With the new 7W Ivy Bridge and Haswell ULV processors (4W possible), convertibles with be thinner and lighter than they currently are, making them much more portable.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355822606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 04:23:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355831458209-10</Id><Topic><Title>Intel will position itself on high-end devices - will play out in 2013</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355822606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 04:23:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with almost all of what you said...but will add the following it: Intel will position itself on high-end devices...and the middle and the low-end. Intel will provide the whole range! Atom Z2000 is a mass-market part. There have been news articles already that Intel is readying with suppliers to provide a sub-$150 smartphone for the India market. There have also been articles that Intel has a Smartphone reference design called Intel Lexington/Zeeya Beach for Africa and other markets. Intel will and should not cede the low-end which can provide entry points to other suppliers in future. Also, by providing high-volume mass market parts, Intel can keep its fabs running at full capacity. Every additional part that provides acceptable margins will share in the cost overheads - more importantly, it is one less chip sold by the competition - increasing their overheads and costs on their remaining volume!</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355831458209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 06:50:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355835542379-11</Id><Topic><Title>Awesome Improvement for INTC.

The U.S. government is able to borrow gigantic mountains of money for next to nothing. U.S. consumers are still able to get home loans, car loans and student loans at ridiculously low interest rates. When this low interest rate environment changes (and it will), it is going to absolutely devastate the U.S. economy. Without low interest rates, the U.S. financial system dies. When it comes to borrowing money, it is the rate of interest that causes the pain. If you could borrow as much money as you wanted at a zero rate of interest for the rest of your life you would never, ever have a debt problem. But when there is a cost to borrowing money that changes things. The higher the rate of interest goes, the more painful debt becomes. The only reason that U.S. government finances have not fallen apart completely already is because the federal government is still able to borrow huge amounts of money very cheaply. If interest rates on U.S. government debt even return just to "average" levels, it is going to be absolutely catastrophic.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355839250481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 09:00:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355839468291-15</Id><Topic><Title>Intel will position itself on high-end devices - will play out in 2013</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355822606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 04:23:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In smartphone, they will be debuting a new dual core medfield SoC with LTE 4G support.

The dual core medfield (existing Medfield is @ 1020) will have no chance (performance) if they are up against the 5250 in phones and will struggle against Apples A6 (@1584), or the Exynos 4412 (@1600-1900 depending on clock).

A major part of this success is due to the Macbook's ability to support multi-platforms ie. it can support both Mac OS and Windows. Now, ask yourself - would Apple be silly enough to convert their macbook lines to ARM ? Taking it a step further, now that Windows 8 supports touch; if Apple wants to continue with their multi-platform support, don't they need some sort of touch device that can support Windows 8? This is why the recent rumor of Apple switching to Intel's processors for their iPad holds a lot of weight. I believe a "MacPad" is also in the works...this is the killer device!</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355844730826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:32:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355844846489-32</Id><Topic><Title>Lets look at the FACTS is INTC in smart phones no not real, Is INTC in the best selling tablets no not real and PC are not selling NOT GOOD FOR INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355843112604</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:05:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have any FACTS that say anything different, If you have any FACTS let me know.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355844846489</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:34:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355845048703-33</Id><Topic><Title>Lets look at the FACTS is INTC in smart phones no not real, Is INTC in the best selling tablets no not real and PC are not selling NOT GOOD FOR INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355843112604</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:05:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not always I told you that NOK was breaking out you can do what ever you want</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355845048703</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:37:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355845217221-34</Id><Topic><Title>Lets look at the FACTS is INTC in smart phones no not real, Is INTC in the best selling tablets no not real and PC are not selling NOT GOOD FOR INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355843112604</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:05:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shock!!!!! not two new threads to inform me??????????????????

As a result of the charges, all the executives in question have agreed to not act as corporate officers and will all pay a fine. Ashman, who also spent nearly two years as CFO for The Huffington Post, will reimburse TheStreet $34,240.40 along with a $125,000 penalty. He will be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director. Barnett and Alwine have agreed to penalties of $130,000 and a 10-year bar. None have formally admitted to the allegations. According to comScore, the property has experienced year-over-year growth of 13 percent from November 2011 to November 2012, topping out around 7.4 million unique visitors last month. Update: TheStreet has responded to Adweek's request for comment with the following statement. “We are pleased to put this matter behind us,” said Elisabeth DeMarse, TheStreet’s chief executive officer. “We remain deeply committed to adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance.”</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1355865936848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:25:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355866317516-126</Id><Title>Intel Corporation (INTC) and 3 Other Big Bets from Paul Tudor Jones</Title><Msg>Google Inc (GOOG), Intel Corporation (INTC) and 3 Other Big Bets from Paul Tudor Jones By Marshall Hargrave Published: December 17, 2012 at 4:47 pm Paul Tudor Jones founded Tudor Investment in 1980 and has amassed a personal net worth of over $3 billion since. Thanks to his success, Tudor has the ability to charge above-average fees - a 4% management fee on AUM and a 23% performance fee - compared to the typical 2-and-20 structure. Tudor recently filed its third quarter 13F with the SEC, which reveals the public long-only equity holdings of the firm. In reviewing Tudor’s filing, we found five big-name stocks that the fund was loading up on. These five increases were focused on the tech and pharma industries, with each stock seeing at least a 100% increase from one quarter earlier (see Tudor's newest stock picks). Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) saw Tudor increase its stake over 500% last quarter. Intel is down over 30% year to date on continued PC sale weakness. Despite this stagnant segment, Intel does expect to grow revenue by 1% next year, with data center growth countering slowing PC sales. The chip-making giant pays quite the dividend, yielding 4.4%, which is even more impressive when you consider it is only a 35% payout of earnings. We see interim growth as being limited due to an expected decline in PC growth, but remain confident in Intel's dividend given its $10 billion in cash on hand. Intel is still one of the top ten tech stocks loved by hedge funds (see all 10 here).</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1355866317516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:31:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355866960935-127</Id><Topic><Title>Intel worth at least 25 as it gets aggressve with ATOM to win Mobile world</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1355856888579</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 13:54:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The new CEO's main mission should be to put ARM out of business, just like they did with AMD.</Msg><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1355866960935</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:42:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355867366859-128</Id><Topic><Title>Good keep taking it higher I need to short it again</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355856816877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 13:53:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coinmaker/nuff/toofunny, etc has to be one of the biggest #$%$ bags on the planet, seriously, (and undoubtedly, the greatest and most conspicous fool I've ever come across).</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1355867366859</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:49:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355867551619-129</Id><Topic><Title>Good keep taking it higher I need to short it again</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355856816877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 13:53:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you get paid by the post?</Msg><Username>zags97</Username><Timestamp>1355867551619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:52:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355869840761-130</Id><Title>Just Recommended on CNBC</Title><Msg>Best tech play for 2013.

Instead, Ellison is looking to sell high-margin "engineered systems" designed to run specific Oracle software products. These are known as the Exa line of hardware products and include Exadata, Exalogic, and Exalytics servers. It also includes the Sparc SuperCluster, a high-end, general-purpose system for running databases and apps.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1355892671911</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 23:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
