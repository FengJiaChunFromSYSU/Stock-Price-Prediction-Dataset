The uninitiated simply dismissed the introduction of 128GB as nothing more than the evolutionary process of Apple adding more memory. Such commentators are myopic and are looking only at the consumer market as it exists today. The reality is that Apple’s introduction is a defensive move against an onslaught by Haswell in the corporate market. iPad is the leader in the corporate market but the lead is in danger of slipping away to Haswell based devices. Haswell is the code name for an upcoming microprocessor architecture. Haswell will replace the currently popular Ivy Bridge architecture by Intel. Haswell is expected to come close to the ARM architecture by ARM Holdings used by Apple iPads. Apple’s press release about the new iPad introduction made it apparent that the device was directed at the corporate market by extensively highlighting AutoCAD by Autodesk. My research and analysis shows that the growth rate of the larger iPad in the corporate market is slowing. Part of the problem is that iPad does not run all of the software that corporations need. Most notable is Microsoft Office. Microsoft just launched Office 2013 without support for iPad. How important is Office? Just take a look at these statistics: $24 billion in annual sales Over 1 billion emails a day Data in petabytes using Office Microsoft will introduce Surface Pro based on Haswell and so will the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Haswell is expected to generate a flurry of detachable designs that can be used as a standalone tablet or a tablet with a key board – all with the power of a PC and ability to run most programs that corporations use. Unless Apple innovates at a faster clip, or is able to negotiate with Microsoft for Office support on iPad, Apple is in serious danger of losing its lead in tablets in the corporate world."

With the abundant bandwidth available at enterprise IT installations, running your document preparation software off of the cloud may not take a big hit from its native counterpart. Given that iPad have been around for quite w hile now, it's likely they've figured out how to stay productive without needing the laptop (the Haswell solution) in several cases. But, where cost is no object as maybe the case at several Enterprises since their loaded with money, Haswell is the clear winner. It'll be interesting to watch this enterprise rivalry play put in 2013.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359612758133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 01:12:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359612987719-8</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's 128GB iPad Defends Against Intel's Haswell Assault On ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359608791223</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 00:06:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tell it to aapl investors from 700 to 450. lol</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1359612987719</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 01:16:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359612991238-9</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's 128GB iPad Defends Against Intel's Haswell Assault On ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359608791223</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 00:06:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If office on a tablet was so important in the enterprise then Win RT would have actually sold enough to NOT seem like a joke. 1 million at best.

Intel is looking to ramp up the introduction of Atom-powered smartphones to the market, with the latest in the form of Acer's Liquid C1 smartphone which was unveiled today. Southeast Asia will be early beneficiaries of the chipmaker's efforts to advance its smartphone plans, given that Thailand has been designated as the launch market for the Liquid C1. A senior Intel executive added he will be "disappointed" if it takes three months for the handset to make its way into many of the region's other markets. .... Today, with its Liquid C1 smartphone--which is powered by Intel's Atom Z240 processor, codenamed "Lexington"--for the Thai market, Acer's announcement marks the ninth smartphone powered by Intel in nine months, he said, adding this showed the company's commitment to the smartphone platform. Acer's Liquid C1 smartphone will be available at the retail price of 9,990 baht (US$335.27) in February. ..... The Atom Z240 processor was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, and is targeted at the "value smartphone" market. According to Intel, the new processor brings high performance for quick Web browsing, rich multimedia, and Android applications experience. Mike Bell, vice president and general manager of Intel's mobile and communications group, said the low-power Atom platform enabled it to address new market segments and broaden its expanding portfolio smartphone offerings. zdnetDOTcom/sea-to-see-intel-powered-smartphones-in-near-future-7000010537/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359634862885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 07:21:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359638515119-13</Id><Topic><Title>At some point, you begin to wonder...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1359602488087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 22:21:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read Russ Fisher and skip all the other SA drivel.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1359638515119</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 08:21:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359639969251-14</Id><Topic><Title>Intel &amp; Acer launch Lexington-based new smartphone in Southeast Asia - Acer's Liquid C1</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359634862885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 07:21:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Picture of the phone: zdnetDOTCOM/sea-to-see-intel-powered-smartphones-in-near-future-7000010537/</Msg><Username>smokinghotblitch</Username><Timestamp>1359639969251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 08:46:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359640792325-15</Id><Topic><Title>At some point, you begin to wonder...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1359602488087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 22:21:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting situation where I somewhat agree with att4glte. The time for doubt was in the last 2 to 3 years. Unfortunately for shareholders, Intel management kept hopes alive (misled?) with half-truths by waving Moorestown-based LG phones and lip-servicing Nokia/MeeGo prospects during conferences and press events. If they did not know that Moorestown will not succeed, they should have. But things have changed over the last few months. Intel is in Smartphones now. And investing heavily in R&amp;D and capex. As Mike Bell has indicated earlier today in the Acer/Intel launch of the new Lexington-based Liquid C1 smartphone, a few years back RIM could do no wrong. A few weeks back, Apple was invincible. Things change very fast in technology, especially in the mobile space and market share for individual vendors rise and fall rapidly. Qualcomm is due for a fall, Intel's integrated design/manufacturing will provide extremely price/performance competitive SoCs to make that happen. I am more confident now than I was even last year.

Hands on With Acer's Iconia W510 x86 Windows 8 Tablet by Anand Lal Shimpi on 6/3/2012 11:14 PM EST It's clear that touch and ultra thin form factor x86 are going to be two major themes of this year's Computex, and on a larger scale two major themes of Microsoft's battle against Apple later this year. It's very telling that Acer isn't showing off any ARM based Windows 8 tablets at the show. Full x86 compatibility is going to be a big feature for dockable Windows 8 tablets as an iPad alternative. TUESDAY .... STARTING TO PAY OFF Acer shares jump on optimism over tablet computer sales 2013/01/29 12:17:12 Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) Shares of personal computer vendor Acer Inc. moved sharply higher Tuesday morning as investors held high hopes that the company’s shipments will increase with the launch of its low-cost tablet computers, dealers said. Optimism toward Acer's tablet computer shipments spurred many bargain hunters to pick up the stock, which had been a laggard among the local PC firms, dealers said. As of 11:15 a.m., shares of Acer had climbed 4.37 percent to NT$25.10 (US$0.85), with 24.39 million shares changing hands. The benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange was up 0.71 percent at 7,769.54 points. "Strong buying in Acer shares emerged soon after the local bourse opened, amid optimism about Acer’s new tablet computer," MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said. "It seems that many investors are buying into Acer's upbeat assessment on the gadget it released yesterday." Speaking to the press Monday, Scott Lin, Acer's senior vice president and president of its greater China operations, said the company is planning to unveil more affordable tablet computers later this year. Lin said Acer decided to introduce more low-cost tablets in light of the success of its 7-inch Inconia B1 model, which was released earlier this month at a price of NT$4,990. Within 10 days of its release, the tablet had sold 7,000 units and its monthly sales in Taiwan are forecast at around 10,000 units. The global shipments of the Iconia B1 model are likely to hit 400,000 units a month, according to Lin. "Like other listed companies in Taiwan, Acer tends to give positive leads to stir up buying interest in its shares," Tang said. "Compared with other PC firms, Acer has been lagging behind it PC peers in valuation, but its strategy is working now because the local bourse is awash in liquidity." Acer shares came under pressure after the company announced a NT$3.5 billion intangible asset loss in its 2012 accounts, which many analysts said could keep the company in the red for the second consecutive year. Tang said his brokerage has downgraded its forecast for Acer's 2012 results from NT$0.44 in earnings per share to a loss per share of NT$0.8, in view of the asset write-down. "I doubt Acer’s efforts to sell low-cost tablet computers will boost its bottom line significantly as the pricing could depress the company's profit margin," Tang said. Taking that factor into account, Acer could post only about NT$1.28 in EPS for 2012, Tang said. "I suspect the current buying in Acer shares is simply for trading purposes,” he said. “The stock may encounter strong profit-taking selling as it moves closer to NT$27.00."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359646492084</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:34:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359646755903-22</Id><Topic><Title>Intel &amp; Acer launch Lexington-based new smartphone in Southeast Asia - Acer's Liquid C1</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359634862885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 07:21:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Staff Portland Business Journal "We're still awaiting news of who will take over as CEO of Intel Corp. when Paul Otellini steps down in May, but we did get a glimpse into part of the mobile strategy that will likely be a major focus for the new chief executive.

That to me is saying nobody wants windows mobile on a tablet. Even if it does sway a few people keep in mind legacy apps have a different form factor than mobile apps so having them on a touch based device is somewhat of a moot point. Those apps were made with the intention of using keyboards and mice to navigate them. So, the only demographic in the enterprise left where a windows 8 tablet has some appeal (with an x86 proc) is to for those who want a device that is a "hybrid" essentially eliminating the need for 2 devices. However, that has some serious drawbacks because essentially you'd be paying for weak laptop and a mediocre tablet. As an enterprise power use why would that appeal to me when I can spend that money on a nice laptop and an iPad and exchange documents via the cloud for slightly more money. This way I get two devices that do two different things really well. Remember, Intel fanboys, that touchscreens aren't new to windows and intel - they've been around for quite some time and have yet to cause anyone to take notice. Without the software ecosystem x86 tablets and smartphones have little or no benefit over ARM - windows RT showed us that.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1359657213554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:33:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359657582697-45</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's 128GB iPad Defends Against Intel's Haswell Assault On ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359608791223</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 00:06:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good lord!!! It seems difficult to drive this point how this this bunch. The kind of performance you would gain from a tablet does little good when you don't have a software ecosystem to back it up. Nobody wants a tablet that runs a mobile OS that is DOA. I am not comparing an iPad to a 'hybrid' - I am comparing a good laptop and an iPad to a hybrid. That is what everybody in my enterprise does and it works very well. There is no benefit in having a windows 8 convertible as the legacy software doesn't work well with tablets and the new metro OS is a dud, so why bother with an expensive solution that does the job of 2 devices relatively poorly when you can spend that across two devices that do each job very well?</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1359657582697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:39:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359657786483-46</Id><Topic><Title>why is intc down today ?</Title><Username>lilies778</Username><Timestamp>1359656865027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:27:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The billionaire boys are enjoying taking your money, they manipulate it down and buy cheap shares, then run it up and sell, rinse then repeat... if you're not a billionaire, you're doomed in this market...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1359657786483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:43:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359658167941-47</Id><Topic><Title>why is intc down today ?</Title><Username>lilies778</Username><Timestamp>1359656865027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:27:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ex dividend.

Eurotech, which took the wraps off its Aurora Tigon cluster at the Cineca HPC datacenter and is in pole position to sit on top of the Green 500 list in May, said it scaled back the clock frequencies of the Xeon E5 processors in order to attain higher performance per watt characteristics. The firm also showed results that indicate CPU performance gains hit a plateau after 3GHz. Giampietro Tecchiolli, CTO of Eurotech presented results using the HPL benchmark that showed not only that CPU performance gains plateaud after 3GHz but power consumption increased. Tecchiolli said the upshot of this was a measured drop in performance per watt as CPU frequency increased. Tecchiolli confirmed that Eurora's Aurora Tigon cluster uses Intel Xeon E5-2687W processors that have frequencies scaled down, though he wouldn't give exact figures. He added that most of the compute power, especially in the publicised Linpack figures, comes from Nvidia's Tesla K20 GPGPU accelerator boards rather than Intel's Xeon chips, therefore running the CPUs at a lower frequency has a relatively small peak performance hit. Geoff Ballew, senior manager of Nvidia's Tesla Compute business unit told The INQUIRER that its Tesla GPGPU accelerator board can also have its clock speed tuned to specific applications within certain parameters, though he wouldn't say whether customers are having to do so right now in order to attain high performance per watt figures. Ballew said Tesla clock speeds can be altered in order to meet overall system power budgets put forth by datacentres. That Eurotech, and presumably other HPC vendors, are having to underclock CPUs in order to improve performance per watt characteristics is deeply worrying for the future ability of x86 CPUs to push HPC performance into the exascale region. However Eurotech's figures suggest that since accelerators are doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting, lower power ARM cores could find their way into HPC clusters acting as little more than job schedulers, making a Tegra and Tesla HPC cluster seem all the more feasible once Nvidia adopts the ARMv8 architecture.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1359664265305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 15:31:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359665832864-79</Id><Topic><Title>HP Envy Spectre Ultrabook Core i5 14", 128GB SSD - $724</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1359653320194</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 12:28:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, the Samsung 13.3" Series 9 weighs 2.7 pounds.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1359665832864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 15:57:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359666216414-80</Id><Topic><Title>FACE FLOP tanking</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359580368990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:12:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If only Waldo had sold INTC at 19.00, taken his loss, and bght FB the same day at the same price last November.

He faces the opposing forces of lacking intelligence and the desire to appear market wise so he finds himself forced to post lies in a feeble attempt to hide his ignorance. That is where we come in. We act as his conscience, showing you how his actual trades have always been money losers and his follow up posts by necessity must be lies. Here is a fine example of how clueless about stocks Raystock is. He posted on the RIMM message board his purchase of 50000 shares at $48.50/share and called the seller an idiot for selling too cheap "I bought 50,000 shares at around 48.50 today by raystock48079 . Apr 29, 2011 11:05 AM . Permalink I got a good deal. Some idiot sold me his or her shares real cheap. Now I am in the money" The stock currently sells at about $13/share!!!</Msg><Username>mister_quarter</Username><Timestamp>1359687863295</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 22:04:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359688542762-120</Id><Title>Intel will show off more dual-core Android smartphones at Mobile World Congress next month - Z2580</Title><Msg>Intel showed us it could create a competent mid-range smartphone with decent processing power and battery life to spare, and then the company decided to create a somewhat slower SOC for poorer countries like Africa. Next month at the Mobile World Congress expo in Barcelona, however, the chipmaker's pulling out the big guns: We'll see a bunch of Android devices with the Atom Z2580, a much faster piece of silicon. Intel actually announced the chip a year ago, but it should be a major step up. Where last year's Z2460 had a single-core processor with the aging single-core PowerVR SGX 540 graphics and only HSPA+ radio support, the new Z2580 has two CPU cores (with two threads each), two far faster PowerVR SGX 544 GPU cores, and a speedy LTE or faster HSPA+ connection in supported markets. Intel says it should have double the performance of the previous Atom across the board. We already spotted the Atom Z2580 in this Lenovo 5.5-inch IdeaPhone K900 at CES early this month, but the device wasn't ready for a serious test. At MWC, we should be able to give you an idea how this latest Atom and the competition stack up. thevergeDOTcom/2013/1/31/3939142/intel-dual-core-atom-z2580-android-smartphones-at-mwc-2013</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359688542762</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 22:15:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359689116078-121</Id><Topic><Title>I was able to get the stockholders to sell today as posted</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1359672449262</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 17:47:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember, a stopped clock is right twice a day.
