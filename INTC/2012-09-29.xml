The inability to follow through on yesterday's rally suggests that near term momentum is in the bears' favor. The weak economic data, coupled with earnings warnings from INTC, NSC and CAT, have investors worried about the coming earnings season. This is likely to keep a lid on any rally in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, the uptrend started in June is intact. The S&amp;P 500 has multiple support areas to keep downside contained. The first support comes in at 1430, followed by the 1418-1422 area. The 50-day moving average, which currently stands at 1412, could also serve as a support on pullbacks. The QE tailwind and the fundamental headwinds could stop the market in the mid-air until we get a better fundamental picture. have a nice weekend.</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1348894101208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 00:48:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348895460947-4</Id><Topic><Title>I warned ya, but the worst is yet to come!</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1348890513719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:48:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your over re-acting.

We are not sure what to make of it because for the most part, Intel refuses to say anything specific. The silicon itself is a variant of Penwell, the phone chip Intel release in January. The differences between the two are a second core, four threads total, and the GPU is now an Imagination SGX545, upgraded from the older SGX540. The video encoders and decoders have been upgraded in ways that Intel will not talk about, but they now support Microsoft specific formats that the rest of the industry shuns. There is also a power management controller that is Microsoft specific, but Intel won’t even admit it, much less say anything about the functionality. How fast is the chip? 1.8GHz max turbo with a TDP of 1.7W, but Intel has been seriously downplaying that number. Why? They want to talk about the lowest power mode, and it will be interesting to see how many sites blindly parrot back that absurdly low but otherwise meaningless number. On a more humorous note, Intel is on it’s third generation Atom DX10 hardware, but still can’t get it working, Clover Trail is still DX9.x. SIGH. The competition is all DX10 or DX11, and has been for years. We would love to say more about the chip, but Intel refuses to say anything more technical than what we put above. Really. They had a technical press and analyst briefing at IDF, and the entire talk was about how wonderful Windows 8 was, less that 1/4 of the slides mentioned an Intel chip, much less said anything useful. Sad doesn’t begin to describe that debacle. Luckily, there were lots of pictures of the chip to show off, you know how Intel is proud of their silicon manufacturing capabilities. Just kidding, Intel refused to show the chip in their briefing, afterwards, and in a Twilight Zone turn of events, would not even hand out a press picture to print. Really? Is this what the company has sunk to? Are they that afraid the financial press will realize they can’t compete with ARM on anything much less die area? To put a humorous twist on matters, Intel did hand out a rendering of the chip, basically a 3D model not to scale, but we won’t waste the bandwidth on it. So, once again, Intel won’t talk about silicon, but is really proud of their silicon. They are better than the competition, but won’t say how or why. They are better suited for the job, but won’t tell you anything specific. Anyone get the idea that this chip abjectly sucks? If you did get that impression, you would be right. Why? It is huge. Seriously, it is massive. The little brother Penwell is 82mm^2, bigger than most of it’s ARM competition and on par with a full Core iSomethingmeaningless. Unfortunately, it is also larger than it’s ARM competition while being notably lower performing. To compound the problem, Intel’s Atom parts are on a 32nm process, the competition is on 40nm. Intel is larger, less efficient, immensely more costly to make, and incompatible with everything that matters. Back to Clover Trail, this joke of a chip is bigger yet. Double the core count and massively increase the GPU size, and what do you end up with? Increasing the size of the two largest units on the chip may not double the area, but it won’t be far off that mark. Clover Trail is massive, so big that it is not economically viable in the markets that they are fighting for. That promise from the last financial analyst day of good margins on Atom in the phone/tablet market would go up in smoke if Intel released the die size, and they know it. Intel can’t compete in tablets and phones. To make matters worse for this chip, it is running Windows 8. If you recall, the little brother Penwell ran Android at a snappy pace with half the cores, likely half the GPU power, and far less memory. Clover Trail runs Windows 8 at barely tolerable speeds even with the massive hardware hacks Intel put in place to fake performance. Bloat the die size, add in vastly more DRAM and storage because Windows needs at least 10x what Android does, and suck far more power to do so, and this is somehow a viable product? You need a bigger battery to simply attain parity on power driving up the BoM cost yet more. Then there is the software costs. Microsoft threw Intel under a bus with WART, if you buy the ARM version of Windows for about 2x the cost, you get Office for ‘free’. If you buy the x86 version of Windows 8, you get the OS for a little less than half the price, but without office. You then have to buy the full version of Office to put on it for $125 and up, way up if you want Outlook. That puts any Clover Trail machine at $170 for the software alone before the bloated hardware costs to store and run everything. How big is the Windows base install again? How big is the Office install again? How big is an Android install with an office suite? How much does Google Docs add to the mix? What is the cost on the added hardware and storage? You can buy a full Nexus 7 for $30 more than what Microsoft gets for the software on a Clover Trail tablet, and that is before the added hardware costs. The Nexus works better, has better battery life, and is not a security nightmare either. This chip is simply not competitive, and Intel knows it. Microsoft knows it too, if you recall, they announced two tablets called Surface. These were designed based on essentially unlimited budgets, numbers that no OEM would sanely consider if the line was ever meant to be profitable. Given the best of everything, what did Microsoft choose? Not Clover Trail, not even any Atom, they picked a Core iSomethingmeaningless for the x86 surface, that should be a red flag to onlookers. But it gets far worse. This chip is a locked down nightmare. It has been said that Intel is locking out Linux, and all other OSes for that matter. Intel denied it, and said it was a driver issue and the like. They are being flat out dishonest, Intel representatives have directly told SemiAccurate that this SoC is Windows only. There are Microsoft specific hardware features, and there never will be drivers released for any other OS period. Nor is there any intention to do so. There will be other CPUs with similar code names that may someday get non-Windows drivers, but not this one. To make matters worse, it will have a locked bootloader. Microsoft controls what you can put on this device, what drivers you can load, and what software you can load. Intel could have stopped this monstrosity, but didn’t even tepidly condemn it. Internally, they know it will fail, SemiAccurate has seen their sales estimates last summer, but won’t do anything to make the devices bearing it even marginally palatable. Intel does not want to sell Clover Trials because of what it will do to their margins. You can see this in their policies. How do you make a product successful? You get people to develop for it. You get it out there and hope the next big thing that comes out of nowhere has your chip in it. It is a standard x86 CPU with a standard Imagination GPU, so this is a good start. You just buy a development board, dive in to the documentation for a weekend, and start banging out code. With Clover Trail, there are no development boards, nor is there any way to actually get one without a multinational corporation behind you. There is no documentation either without the same backing. Neither are going to change, like we said, Intel does not want to sell Clover Trail, they are desperately afraid of it. In the end, Clover Trail is a dog. It is tied to a millstone OS that bloats the software cost, the BoM cost, and power requirements. It has neither the CPU performance of the smaller die Core iSomethingmeaningless nor the power savings of ARM CPUs. It is vastly more expensive to manufacture, and no one wants it. There is no up side for Clover Trail, and that explains Intel’s silence perfectly.S|A</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348925939047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 09:38:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348926031318-22</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH can not be dethroned by INTEL: Read on scream.............INTel will be single digits in 2013</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348925420985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 09:30:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel earned 12 BILLION the last 3 months.......12 BILLION!

Your word is OK. Your mid-Aug timing was very unfortunate. You purchased it just before the DELL warning. The market and analysts reacted strongly to the Intel Q3 warning because Intel also pulled the plug on their full year forecast. The analysts were free to forecast Intel results anyway they want. The next information will come at the earnings call. What is your downside target expectation for INTC? Do you have any lower "bail out" target than $26? Do you have a time limit on your patience? I was just curious. I am not happy that the stock dropped but I have shares for the longer term. I am long most of the time. I get shares called away and buy them back with put options so I am constantly changing my cost basis up/down and extracting value.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1348930466739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 10:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348932009229-35</Id><Title>Have You Seen This Article On Intel?</Title><Msg>Soon-to-be TEEN QUEEN, INTC, will attend the senior prom this year with Yahoo Message Board Pumper-Ringleader, Wallis Weaver.

And ARM doesn't...] Up to now, most sources stated the upcoming 22 nm replacement for Xeon E5 and Core i7 39XX to have 10 cores per die. Post IDF, a very credible source says it was 12 all the while, just the yields weren't sure of. Well, now they are. Compared to the Sandy Bridge 32 nm E/EP part (there is no EX Sandy Bridge at all, remember) which has 8 cores and 20 MB L3 cache, and only 6 cores and 15 MB L3 in the crippled desktop version, there's now much more in its plug-compatible follow-on. The original estimate for the Ivy Bridge E/EP die was 10 cores and 25 MB L3 cache, again keeping the same 2.5 MB L3 per core proportion as the Sandy Bridge EP die. However, the sweaty blue blooded man who we befriended at IDF, had this to say recently after the show: there were 12 cores on the die all the while, but they weren't sure how they yields would go, that's where the 10 core presentations came about. Now, the yields look good, and there will definitely be full 12 core / 30 MB L3 cache bins available, even at high frequencies for the workstation use - but at a premium price, of course. If such a part runs at, say, 3.2 GHz inside the 150W TDP envelope, it'd give you well above 300 GFLOPs in peak DP FP per socket, providing a 600++ GFLOPs DP FP dual socket workstation. Do remember that Intel's workstation CPU warranties cover reasonable work day use, not 24-hour day, 365-a-year use like server CPU's though. As for the gaming CPU SKUs, let's hope at least 8 out of 12 cores will be enabled.

Smith, Intel’s director of tablet development at the launch of Clover Trail, its latest Atom-based SoC. The PC giant designed the dual-core, dual threaded 1.8-GHz chip in tandem with a handful of partners who worked on a full tablet reference design for the chip. The 10.1-inch tablet design came with a full Intel software stack of BIOS, drivers and firmware for Microsoft’s Windows 8. Intel, Microsoft, Lenovo and one unnamed customer created the reference system and shared the bill of materials with six other OEMs.. Acer, Asus, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung and ZTE showed systems, each with minor variations, most ready to roll for the formal launch of Win 8 at the end of October. Tom Butler, Lenovo product marketing manager, which helped define the reference design, shows its ThinkPad Tablet II. Asus, Lenovo and Samsung also showed tablets with Wacom digitizers for pen input with a stylus. Acer and HP tablets docked into keyboards that housed a secondary battery. Asus showed a model with an 11.6-inch LG display delivering 600-nits brightness. The Acer tablet supports 3G and near-field communications. All the systems include keyboard docks that essentially turn them into small notebooks. “I think [the Win 8 Atom tablets] have a very different proposition from the Android and Apple folks in providing a single device that does the content consumption tablets are good at and creation that PCs are good at,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of Inside64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “This is a really good start for Intel in tablets,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy (Austin, Texas). “Enterprise IT will be taking a very serious look at these tablets and potentially pause their iPad rollouts."

LONDON — Texas Instruments Inc. claimed to have fulfilled a promise made in 2002 to produce a single-chip mobile phone. The company announced that Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia would incorporate a single-chip solution based on TI's Digital RF Processor (DRP) technology in future mobile phones. In 2002, when TI announced its intention to integrate the bulk of handset electronics on a single chip, TI's so-called single-chip cell phone solutions were planned for 2004. They were intended to include wireless software protocol stacks, the digital baseband, applications processing functionality, the analog baseband, power management, RF and embedded memory.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1348947664676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 15:41:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348948473213-66</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel's Clover Trail SoC a "bloated nightmare?"   Posted on September 28, 2012 - 12:03 by Trent Nouveau</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348925758650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 09:35:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>".just like your comments in regards to TriGate defect density" Hmmm... what did I say ???

Intel's new tablet reference design demonstrates the effectiveness of the new mobility strategy. And it has a dockable keyboard option. It represents the best blend of entertainment platform along with real computer capability. It should be a strong performer - especially in the enterprise market. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 2.) Intel's smartphone strategy continues to get traction with Intel replacing ARM chips in a major smartphone release. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 2.) Intel will roll-out strongly into the US market in 2013 when LTE capabilities are finalized. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 3.) Windows 8 is coming up next. A lot of people have waited for it. Expect a bump for Intel. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 4.) With Windows 8, new form factors will arrive: hybrids, detachables. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 5.) The iPhone 5 is a "just good enough" iteration. Just enough to get them down the road but leaving them totally exposed in regards to future developments. And then there is the map fiasco. 6.) Apple has no good ARM fabrication choices. Samsung and the lawsuits and no state-of-the-art. Or TSMC and limited capacity and no state-of-the-art. 7.) If Intel offers its state-of-the-art technology to Apple competitors, then Apple will sail into a huge competitive headwind. 8.) If Apple decides to stick with ARM fabrication, they will be unable to stay on the cutting edge of performance and power consumption efficiency. 9.) Wall Street doesn't understand the underlying dynamics within mobility. It's all about the fabrication and Wall Street just doesn't understand fabrication. This has led to significant misjudgments. And Wall Street pricing in a ridiculous $7 billion revenue miss. 10.) Intel has built for the future. ARM is relying on the past. 11.) 14nm is the tipping point. The point at which there is no compelling reason to ever use an ARM processor again. Intel 14nm will have vastly superior processing power along with greater power efficiency. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 12.) The turn is happening now and will pick up speed throughout 2013. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 13.) The UK variant of the Motorola RAZR M phone is powered by an Intel chip instead of a Snapdragon S4. Just the beginning of the ARM replacements with Intel. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero. 14.) Intel price points look better and better. Today's deals listed in other posts show notebooks and lap tops starting in the $300-400 range. Expect real impact on ARM tablets. How much of this is already reflected in the stock price? Zero.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1348961077715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 19:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348961581519-85</Id><Topic><Title>Singhlion2001.......answer the question.

The other three announced partners, and there are said to be other unannounced partners, are Achronix, Tabula and Netronome. Netronome is a network processor company from Santa Clara, California Intel's home town, with whom Intel has been working for five years on development but onlt signed up for foundry services earlier this year. Under the agreement, Netronome also gets to use Intel's own EDA tools. Achronix and Tabula are FPGA companies.

All the way up shorts are thinking it is overvalued and they short it.

The sustainability of the moat is not always apparent, and a permanent decline or elimination of what once was a durable competitive advantage can be quite devastating to a stock price. Currently, many large-cap technology companies are being looked at with extreme pessimism, as emerging "cloud" and mobile technologies are changing the game in a radical way. Intel Corp. (INTC) is caught up in the forefront of this battle, as the company's unquestioned dominance in PC chips offers little comfort in an environment where tablets and mobile phones are in some circumstances replacing the need for PCs or notebooks. I believe that the market is mispricing this risk, and in turn is providing an extremely compelling long-term total return opportunity in the equity. It would be difficult to name three companies with a better R&amp;D and manufacturing track record than Intel over the last 20 years. In a constantly changing industry, Intel has fought off numerous charges from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), etc. Intel didn't always have the best product, but it utilized its industry leadership position and strong financial condition to allocate enough resources to eventually thwart off its competition in key areas. Intel is facing one of its fiercest tests, as the shift to mobile computing has caught the company behind the curve as formidable competitors ARM Holdings PLC (ARMH) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) arguably have superior mobile chips. Intel cannot afford to be left out of this emerging ecosystem. Currently, Intel is trading at $23.18 with a market capitalization of $116.1 billion. This is only about 9.8 times trailing twelve month (TTM) earnings of $2.36 per diluted share, and about 2.4 times book value. Intel's financial performance over the last decade has been superb, with revenue having doubled from $26.274 billion in 2002 to TTM of $54.527 billion. Meanwhile, EPS has grown from $0.46 to $2.36, while the share count has dropped from 6.759 billion to 5.2246 billion. ROE and ROIC have improved a great deal to the mid-20s % range, but even at trough levels have remained in the mid-teens. Intel has leveraged this financial performance to enhance its durable competitive advantage. Over the last five years, capital spending has totaled just over $30 billion. Intel's R&amp;D spending over the last five years could have bought two ARM holdings, one NVIDIA, and an AMD at current market capitalizations. As John Wooden said, "Don't mistake activity for achievement", but fortunately for Intel its robust profitability has certainly verified that these expenditures have been well worth it. Intel's new Atom chip has closed the gap in mobile to ARM and Qualcomm, and I can assure you that the company will give those companies the fight of their life on that front. Intel's in-house manufacturing is clearly unparalleled and its competitive advantages in scale, talent, finances, and important vendor/client relationships allow it to build on that advantage on almost a daily basis. In times when it has trailed, Intel's track record shows that it does not give up easily. Intel recently lowered guidance, causing the stock to drop, despite a relatively buoyant equity market. At current prices Intel yields about 3.9%, and has an earnings yield slightly above 10%. While a slowdown in emerging markets where much of Intel's PC chip growth is occurring is a short-term setback, the introduction of Windows 8, and the assumption that the macro-economic picture should eventually get over these dramatic issues, gives me confidence that there are still years of phenomenal profitability in store for Intel on that side of the equation. Keep in mind that mobile chip makers aren't nearly as profitable as Intel is on the PC side, so it seems logical to derive that Intel will have more resources to throw at what seems certain to be a constantly changing and evolving technological ecosystem. Even more encouraging is Intel's Data Storage and High-Performance Computing businesses. This group, which develops technology for various applications ranging from cloud computing to mission critical servers and high-performance computing, has shown explosive revenue growth. In addition the margins are exceptional, and it seems likely that this unit should lead Intel's near-term profit growth. Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ending December 31, 2011 were as follows: (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue . . . . . . . . $ 10,129 $ 8,693 $ 6,450 Operating income . . . . $ 5,100 $ 4,388 $ 2,289 Source: Intel 10-K This core profitability should enable Intel to make key acquisitions such as McAfee in security software, and I believe that tablet makers will be reluctant to shut Intel out of the mobile ecosystem, as is evident by Intel's recent deal with Motorola Mobility. Also, because everybody just assumes the PC is dead, it is quite likely that Intel will face decreasing competition on that front, enabling the company to shift resources in faster growing directions. Intel's capital allocation has been excellent relative to the technology industry, and I think the company would be wise to issue more long-term debt to finance an even more aggressive stock buyback at current levels.

I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time, and am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. “When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! “Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, (bringing his fist down on the table) I will rout you out." Remind you of anything, folks? Like the recent observation that taxpayers will ultimately have lost bigtime on the GM bailout while the administration’s union cronies made out like bandits? Or like the way that every single Wall Street banker and investment banker has continued to live in high style (including outrageous bonuses) as the country’s middle class withers away like Lenin’s state was supposed to? Maybe Andy Jackson wasn’t such a plebian Yahoo after all. Could a blueprint for our own future be hiding in this now-neglected bit of history? An interesting thought for today.

LOL Good-Bye Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It by PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS There was a time when the pen was mightier than the sword. That was a time when people believed in truth and regarded truth as an independent power and not as an auxiliary for government, class, race, ideological, personal, or financial interest. Today Americans are ruled by propaganda. Americans have little regard for truth, little access to it, and little ability to recognize it. Truth is an unwelcome entity. It is disturbing. It is off limits. Those who speak it run the risk of being branded “anti-American,” “anti-semite” or “conspiracy theorist.” Truth is an inconvenience for government and for the interest groups whose campaign contributions control government. Truth is an inconvenience for prosecutors who want convictions, not the discovery of innocence or guilt. Truth is inconvenient for ideologues. Today many whose goal once was the discovery of truth are now paid handsomely to hide it. “Free market economists” are paid to sell offshoring to the American people. High-productivity, high value-added American jobs are denigrated as dirty, old industrial jobs. Relicts from long ago, we are best shed of them. Their place has been taken by “the New Economy,” a mythical economy that allegedly consists of high-tech white collar jobs in which Americans innovate and finance activities that occur offshore. All Americans need in order to participate in this “new economy” are finance degrees from Ivy League universities, and then they will work on Wall Street at million dollar jobs. Economists who were once respectable took money to contribute to this myth of “the New Economy.” And not only economists sell their souls for filthy lucre. Recently we have had reports of medical doctors who, for money, have published in peer-reviewed journals concocted “studies” that hype this or that new medicine produced by pharmaceutical companies that paid for the “studies.”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348976156336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 23:35:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348976509671-123</Id><Topic><Title>Intel gonna have HUGE Foundry business AND It's normal business over time</Title><Username>conmen_brokemen</Username><Timestamp>1348966819142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 21:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The multi-year deal sees ARM tie itself even closer to TSMC, its chip-fabber of choice, as it looks to capitalise on the company's technology to help it maintain a lead over Intel for chip power efficiency ARM is ramping up its push to get its highly efficient low-power chips into servers by signing a multi-year agreement with Asian silicon manufacturer TSMC. Under the deal, the Cambridge-based chip designer has agreed to share technical details with TSMC to help the fabricator make better chips with higher yields, ARM said on Monday. TSMC will also share information, so that ARM can create designs better suited to its manufacturing. By working closely with TSMC, we are able to leverage TSMC's ability to quickly ramp volume production of highly integrated SoCs [System-on-a-Chip processors] in advanced silicon process technology," Simon Segars, general manager for ARM's processor and physical IP divisions, said in a statement. "The ongoing deep collaboration with TSMC provides customers earlier access to FinFET technology to bring high-performance, power-efficient products to market," he added. Read this Calxeda and HP unleash ARM server tech Read more The move should keep ARM's chip designs competitive with Intel's in the server market. TSMC's FinFET is akin to Intel's 3D 'tri-gate' method of designing processors with greater densities, which should deliver greater power efficiency and better performance from a cost point of view. By tweaking its chips to TSMC's process, ARM chips should deliver good yields on the silicon, keeping prices low while maintaining the higher power efficiency that comes with a lower process node. ARM's chips dominate the mobile device market, but unlike Intel, it doesn't have a brand presence on the end devices. Instead, companies license its designs, go to a manufacturer, and rebrand the chips under their own name. You may not have heard of ARM, but the Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia chips in mobile devices, as well as Calxeda and Marvell's server chips, are all based to some degree on based on ARM's low-power RISC-architecture processors. 64-bit processors As part of the new deal, ARM is expecting to work with TSMC on 64-bit processors. It stressed how the 20nm process nodes provided by the fabber will make its server-targeted chips more efficient, potentially cutting datacentre electricity bills. "This collaboration brings two industry leaders together earlier than ever before to optimise our FinFET process with ARM's 64-bit processors and physical IP," Cliff Hou, vice president of research and development for TSMC, said in the statement. "We can successfully achieve targets for high speed, low voltage and low leakage." "We can successfully achieve targets for high speed, low voltage and low leakage" — Cliff Hou, TSMC However, ARM only released its 64-bit chips in October, putting these at least a year and a half away from production, as licensees tweak designs to fit their devices. Right now, there are few ARM-based efforts pitched at the enterprise, aside from HP's Redstone Server Development platform and a try-before-you-buy ARM-based cloud for the OpenStack software. Production processes AMD, like ARM, does not operate its own chip fabrication facilities and so must depend on the facilities of others. AMD uses GlobalFoundries, while ARM licensees have tended to use TSMC. However, both TSMC and GlobalFoundries are a bit behind Intel in terms of the level of detail — the process node — they can make their chips to. Right now, TSMC is still qualifying its 20nm process for certification by suppliers, while Intel has been shipping its 22nm Ivy Bridge processors for several months. Intel has claimed a product roadmap down to 14nm via use of its tri-gate 3D transistor technology, while TSMC is only saying in the ARM statement it will go beyond 20nm, without giving specifics. Even with this partnership, Intel looks set to maintain its lead in advanced silicon manufacturing. "By the time TSMC gets FinFET into production - earliest 2014, it's only just ramping 28nm [now] - Intel will be will into its 2nd generation FinFET buildout," Malcolm Penn, chief executive of semiconductor analysts Future Horizons, told ZDNet. This puts Intel "at least three years ahead of TSMC. Global Foundries will be even later." Intel has noticed ARM's rise and has begun producing its own low-power server chips under the Centerton codename. However, these chips consume 6W compared with ARM's 5W. At the time of writing, neither ARM nor TSMC had responded to requests for further information. Financial terms, if any, were not disclosed.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348976509671</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 23:41:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348976875066-124</Id><Topic><Title>Intel gonna have HUGE Foundry business AND It's normal business over time</Title><Username>conmen_brokemen</Username><Timestamp>1348966819142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 21:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Globalfoundries is speeding up the timeline for its 14nm process that will feature 3D transistors, looking to match Intel in both timing and architecture. Globalfoundries is making an aggressive move to challenge Intel in chip manufacturing, with officials announcing that the company will be ready by 2014 with a 14-nanometer process that will include a three-dimensional transistor architecture similar to Intel's Tri-Gate method. Globalfoundries' 14nm-XM (eXtreme Mobility) process will include a 3D FinFET transistor technology that will enable higher performance and greater power efficiency in mobile devices like smartphones. It also will come only a year after the foundry begins offering its 20nm process. If Globalfoundries can hit its target of 2014 for the 14nm-XM, it will leapfrog over other foundries like Tawain Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and dovetail with Intel's plans to roll out its 14nm chips that same year. The foundry's 14nm-XM architecture will include a combination of a 14nm FinFET device and Globalfoundries' 20nm low-power processes. Bringing together parts of varying size to create a new chip might seem odd, but it makes sense, according to Roger Kay, principal analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. "Globalfoundries' architecture might seem like a bit of a mishmash at first glance," Kay said in a Sept. 20 blog post of Forbes. "Putting different size features on different chip planes raises questions as to whether such a design can reap all the cost benefits of a fully 14nm part. For example, the 20nm planes will determine the size of the chip, which will affect both its cost and its power-savings. However, the smaller transistors will make the part more efficient than a 20nm-only unit would be, and the design choice meets all of Globalfoundries' objectives, and, I daresay, those of its customers." Those objectives include a fast time to market, reducing the risk of migrating from a 20nm manufacturing process to a 14nm one, and creating extremely low-power chips. "The 20nm process already ironed out by Globalfoundries is optimized for mobile systems on a chip (SoCs)," Kay wrote. "These chips are designed for smartphones that need to operate all day without recharging. This technology is preserved and carried forward in the 14XM." A key to these capabilities is the FinFET transistor architecture. Intel this year began offering its Tri-Gate transistor architecture in its 22nm Ivy Bridge processors. Intel engineers had been working on the 3D technology for 10 years before announcing it in 2011, with the hope of increasing the performance and power efficiency of its chips and enabling the company to gain traction in the highly competitive mobile device chip space, which is dominated by ARM Holdings. Like the FinFET design, Intel's Tri-Gate architecture essentially moves away from the flat, two-dimensional "planar" circuitry of previous designs and to a three-dimensional structure that enables a greater number of transistors in a similar space. Globalfoundries officials said Sept. 20 that the 14nm-XM FinFET process will bring a 40 to 60 percent increase in battery life to mobile devices, compared with current transistor architectures at 20nm. Other foundries also are moving in the same direction. ARM and TSMC in July announced a deal in which the two companies would work together to develop 64-bit ARM-designed chips that will feature TSMC's FinFET technology starting with 20nm chips. Globalfoundries and ARM in August announced a similar agreement to optimize ARM's SoC designs for FinFET processes. United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) also plans to use FinFETs starting at 20nm. However, neither TSMC nor UMC are expected to get to this point until 2014, giving Globalfoundries an edge. Globalfoundries was created in 2009 when Advanced Micro Devices spun off its manufacturing business. Now the foundry contracts with other "fab-less" chip vendors like AMD-which no longer has its own fabrication facilities-and ARM to build their products. The rapid growth in the sales of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices has put a premium on high performance and low cost in SoCs. "The transition from 20nm to 14nm represents an important inflection point, and at Globalfoundries we have introduced a new technology that takes full advantage of the latest advances in device architecture while keeping the bigger SoC product-level picture in view," CTO Gregg Bartlett wrote in a Sept. 20 blog post. "With our new 14nm-XM offering, we have accelerated our leading-edge road map to deliver a technology optimized for the fast-growing smart mobile computing market. 14nm-XM will give customers the performance and power benefits of three-dimensional 'FinFET' transistors with less risk and a faster time-to-market, helping the fabless ecosystem maintain its leadership in mobility while enabling a new generation of smart mobile devices." Endpoint Technologies' Kay said Globalfoundries had several advantages in being able to fast-track its development of the 14nm-XM process, including 10 years of work on the 3D transistor architecture that IBM undertook and gave to the Common Platform, a chip design group that includes Globalfoundries, IBM and Samsung Electronics. One benefit is being able to leverage the capabilities of high-K metal gate (HKMG) technology, which cuts down on the amount of electrical leakage as chips get smaller. "It was critical to master this technique, which Intel has had since 2007," Kay said. "It was only in 2010 that AMD was able to get HKMG up and running in its 32nm processors, which have both processing and graphics on the same piece of silicon." Development of the 14nm-XM technology already has begun in Globalfoundries' new Fab 8 in Saratoga County, N.Y., and the foundry is making early process design kits (PDKs) available now. Tape-outs by customers of the new SoCs are expected to happen next year, according to officials. While Globalfoundries' 14nm-XM technology will come out the same time as Intel's 14nm chips, the fact that they are SoCs aimed at mobile devices like tablets and smartphones plays to Globalfoundries' strengths, Endpoint Technologies' Kay said. Intel dominates the PC and server chip markets, but it still is trying to get some traction in mobile devices. Meanwhile, Globalfoundries, TSMC, ARM and others already have strong positions in the mobile device space. "Globalfoundries has come from way behind to nip at Intel's heels," Kay wrote. "The 14XM will hit the market in volume in mid-2014, right on top of Intel's 14nm processors. And Globalfoundries and its customers have the pole position in high mobility, offering an ultra-low power mobile SoC with a whole ecosystem around it rather than just a processor. â&#128;¦ A race that had almost gotten boring is suddenly exciting again."</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348976875066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 23:47:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
