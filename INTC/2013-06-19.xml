They are turning bad Intel assessments into an art form. In the meantime we are seeing more and more people voicing recognition of the tipping point having been reached. There were the comments by Numis and Bernstein on ARM: "Numis downgrades ARM Holdings (ARM.LN) to reduce from hold and cuts target price to 700p from 920p as it sees the company losing market share to Intel Corporation (INTC). Cuts forecasts of ARM's CPU share in the smartphone market to 72% from 86% in 2014 and beyond. Says the balance of 28% goes to Intel, however there are scenarios where Intel could gain up to 40% share if it enabled some breakthrough devices at the likes of Sony, Amazon and Motorola. Numis reduces its forecasts of ARM's share in the tablet market to 70% from 80%." "Analysts at Bernstein Research warned in a note to clients that they found "a great deal of evidence that with its current products, Intel is competitive against ARM" before going on to conclude that "we can't stress enough how much we are worried about current expectations for ARM." And these weren't the only comments. There were numerous comments along the same line. Today we had a lot of rumors about Intel working on an iWatch. Hopefully we will see some real news announcements soon.

Justin Rattner, Chief Technology Officer at Intel, revealed that the chip giant has several “experimental devices” undergoing testing at its laboratories, including one in a wrist-bound computer display. “The watch is kind of — if you want to put the time on it, that’s fine,” said Rattner, according to VentureBeat. “But if you’re talking about texting today, wouldn’t it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?” Intel is also working on technology that pre-emptively knows when you want to use it, which it calls contextually aware computing. This could be employed in its smart watch to help attract customers or it might be licensed out to other firms. Apple's iWatch has been the source of much speculation for some time now, but other major technology companies have also jumped on the wearable computing bandwagon, including Google, Samsung, Sony (pictured above) and most recently Acer, which has set 2014 as the deadline for its wearable technology debut. What is most interesting is that there were rumours last year that Intel was involved in Apple's design process, which suggests the two may be pairing up for this. The language Rattner used, however, hints that Intel is hoping to expand further into the smart device market on its own grounds.

Even if the market corrects 20%, INTC goes to 20, the shorts still need more than a week to cover (a week of buying). Then we're back to fundamentals, market share, fabrication, future guidance, back to school, holidays, dividend raise, and Chinese New Year.... and 14nm. This is a race to $30.

The first can take awhile. That’s to build a reputation with integrity, hard work and a little luck from time to time. The other is to find the right angle to make a big score in a hurry. Neither method is easy. In fact, there are few businesses where the road to success is strewn with so many failures. Nor is there anything inherently wrong with either path. After all, building wealth is what investing is all about. Every once in a while, however, something reminds me how many unscrupulous people are willing to do anything for a quick buck. This week, it was the latest attempts by TRC Capital to convince fearful investors to part with solid dividend-paying stocks at below market prices, including PPL Corp (NYSE: PPL), PG&amp;E Corp (NYSE: PCG) and Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE: PEG). Privately held TRC has been around a while. And as a brief Google of its name makes clear, it’s had a wide range of target stocks over the years, ranging from Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) to Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK). TRC’s trademark strategy is to launch an unsolicited “mini-tender” offering to buy a small percentage of a company’s stock BELOW the market price. TRC then sells any shares tendered and pockets the difference. If the share price sinks below the offer price, TRC can walk away. In fact, it can legally keep investors from backing out, literally locking up their shares until it’s profitable to buy them out. All of the companies listed above have gotten the word out that TRC’s offer is not official. And they’ve urged shareholders to reject it. One can only wonder, however, about investors in companies that didn’t send out press releases, or what happened to those who didn’t get a warning. “Unscrupulous,” you say? Surely, yes. But there’s nothing inherently illegal about what TRC is doing. Its offers are always for less than 5 percent of companies’ common stock. That means they’re exempt from following Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are only subject to anti-fraud rules under Regulation 14E. There’s still disclosure required. For example, TRC is forbidden from making untrue statements or omitting material facts from offerings, meaning it has to disclose the details including any lock-up provisions that prevent investors from pulling out. The catch is only someone who really reads the fine print is going to catch them all. And as anyone who’s ever read a prospectus knows, it’s easy to overlook some crucial detail. The key is as long as TRC says exactly what it’s doing in its offer sheet, investors who are later dissatisfied with the terms have absolutely no legal recourse. In other words, it’s your fault if you don’t read it before you sign. What makes mini-tenders like TRC’s so insipid is that back office systems of many brokers don’t distinguish between them and legitimate tender offers. Investors instead get both offers, with no guidance or indication that there’s any real difference. Worse, the fact that mini-tenders are only for a small number of shares no doubt convinces some investors that they have to act quickly, before others take up the available slots. The temptation to jump is particularly acute in a volatile market like this one. At least, that was definitely the implication from several inquiries I received this week regarding a supposed TRC mini-tender offer for Pembina Pipeline Corp (TSX: PPL, OTC: PBNPF). Pembina is a Canadian pipeline and energy infrastructure company that’s the exclusive transport services provider for the Syncrude partnership. Run by the Canadian unit of Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), Syncrude is the largest producer of oil from Canada’s tar sands and has big plans for expansion. Pembina makes its money from capacity payments, meaning it gets paid even if Syncrude’s facilities are shut down. That’s an extremely valuable franchise by any measure. The company also pays a generous monthly dividend of around 7 percent and has held its ground during this year’s selloff. The stock now trades near an all-time high. I’ve been unable to independently confirm TRC’s offer for Pembina. But even if someone wanted to sell this stock, they’d be far better off selling at market. I fear, however, that some may succumb to the temptation, just as other are doing for the three utility stocks listed above that have responded publicly to TRC mini-tenders. If I sound strident here, it’s because I am. About 35 years ago, an elderly relative of mine–a widow–was sold an “annuity” by a man who knocked on her door, falsely claiming to be affiliated with a large Christian denomination. Attracted by the high yield offered and wowed by his sales pitch, she took him at his word–rather than asking for documentation or clarification–and lost her savings that had been invested in solid dividend-paying stocks. It was a heartbreaking thing to later learn about. But it did teach me two very valuable lessons. First, always read the fine print, no matter who you think you’re dealing with. Second, the investment business attracts people with no compunction about cheating others. That, in my opinion, is what TRC Capital does, quite legally, for a living. And the right answer to any “mini-tender” offer from them or anyone else should be “no thanks.” That doesn’t mean to ignore every tender offer you receive. Holders of Progress Energy Inc (NYSE: PGN), for example, should certainly vote “yes” and tender their shares to would-be acquirer Duke Energy. Owners of Xcel Energy’s (NYSE: XEL) preferred stocks will be stuck with illiquid securities should they fail to tender their preferred shares this month, per the offer they should now have in their hands. These are offers that must comply with SEC Regulation 14d. There’s no question about being cheated. The only criterion for tendering or not tendering is the economics of the deal in question, which in both cases is positive. It also doesn’t mean ignoring every offer that is not governed by Section 14(d). Take for example a takeover offer for a foreign stock you own. Unless the company trades as an American Depositary Receipt in the US, odds are the offer will not be filed under Section 14(d). That’s the case for Daylight Energy (TSX: DAY, OTC: DAYYF), which has a CD10.08 per share all cash offer on the table from giant Chinese energy producer Sinopec. The takeout price is more than twice where Daylight traded before the offer and so is definitely advantageous to shareholders, even though it’s not covered under SEC Regulation 14d. You wouldn’t know that, of course, unless you read the fine print on the offer, and therefore know what if any conditions apply before you tender your shares. But mini-tenders should always be avoided, period. And that’s particularly true in a volatile market like this one, where the unscrupulous are all too ready to prey on investors’ fears.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1371650693840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371651006409-33</Id><Topic><Title>Intel puts the crosshairs on ARM</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371582486673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 15:08:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wallis, ARM does not supply chips, period, hence the quoted line about Samsung not choosing ARM to supply chips is nonsense. Samsung chose not to make their own chips using ARM IP. The ARM revenue stream is from IP royalties, which may or may not correspond one for one to chip sales. Apple, for example, does not sell chips at all, yet is a big source of ARM revenue by designing chips itself that use ARM IP. Don't you know that? ARM doesn't compete with Intel, Qualcomm does. The fact that Qualcomm chose synthesizable ARM cores to put on Snapdragon is practically beside the point. The business model difference between Intel and ARM is huge, wallis. Intel does not sell any chip IP that I'm aware of, and ARM doesn't sell any chips.</Msg><Username>firstofmany</Username><Timestamp>1371651006409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:10:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371651033387-34</Id><Topic><Title>This will see 23 before it sees 27</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1371612977330</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 23:36:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reminds me of a phishing scam.

I am also very bullish on the new Pentiums/Celerons based on Bay Trail-M, as this should drive users back to full, fanless Windows 8 PCs w/ touch. Also, AMD's announcement that it is dropping out of the 2P/4P race (not explicit announcement, but nobody would buy their parts going forward with the nonsense they are spouting about ARM) means that Intel will gobble up another 2-3% market share in traditional servers in addition to the huge upside from "Avoton" and "Rangeley" being first to market in this micro-server craze, and with the best technology. No, Intel is strong buy. I just think we don't see dramatic Android tablet share for Intel until the 14nm generation with Airmont, where Intel will likely do what they did with SNB- IVB transition and try to take leadership in graphics.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371663544638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371663641439-67</Id><Topic><Title>The Snapdragon 800 benchmarks look very impressive</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371651138585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>intel_fanboy &amp; mas, Don't disagree with you that CPU performance is more important, especially since Bay Trail will have a solid (but not leading) graphics engine. But I worry that OEMs in this space care more about GPU than CPU, particularly given the trend in the notebook space in which evne Intel is focusing more on GPU than

"We can't just support an Nvidia ARM platform," explains Sumit Gupta, general manager of the Tesla Accelerated Computing business unit at the company. "There are ARM CPUs coming into the enterprise market, and by next year there will be a whole bunch of them, and we want to connect GPUs to all of them. This will open up CUDA to more customers. There are many, many more ARM chips sold every year than x86 processors, if you count all of the chips sold into smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and Nvidia wants to tap its programming environment into those chips. The reason is simple: generally speaking, ARM chips suck at math relative to x86 floating-point units – and certainly compared to GPUs. "The ARM CPUs coming to market either do not have floating-point math or have very low-performing floating point units," says Gupta. "We think GPU accelerators are going to be, in effect, the floating-point units for ARM processors."</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1371671070329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:44:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371671157175-97</Id><Topic><Title>10-year yield approacjing 2.5% - thanks Mr. Bernanke</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371668442700</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:00:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can he not be more clear...

Intel had a strict power budget for Bay Trail which is basically the same as Clover Trail and not only the gpu was curtailed to fit but more importantly hyperthreading had to be dropped all together which is a bigger loss. Still Bay Trail's gpu is going to be in iPad4's class so really that is quite a jump anyway from Clovertrail+ and remember that some games are cpu rather than gpu dependent. At 14nm and 10nm these things can be looked at again but I think you may be placing too much store on this as Intel does not have to win every benchmark, it just needs to produce a good well balanced chip and it appears to have done so.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371677916535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 17:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371678314683-126</Id><Title>This is the beginning of the march toward 19</Title><Msg>23 at the end of the week and then down from there.</Msg><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1371678314683</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 17:45:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371678961333-127</Id><Topic><Title>The Snapdragon 800 benchmarks look very impressive</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371651138585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mas, Yes, yes, but Intel is coming in from a complete loser position to trying to break into a market. It needs to show clear perf/watt and performance leadership if it is going to gain any significant market share while maintaining any semblance of pricing power. The much faster CPU is great, and I think that this will be wonderful for enterprise users, but this GPU is going to be trash compared to whatever Apple has in its next A-series chip or Qualcomm's Sapdragon 800. Now, if Haswell-Y fits into a S800 power budget that's one thing, but S800 fits into a phone. Intel may now finally have the CPU lead, but being this behind on GPU is simply inexcusable given the 1 node process advantage. It will cost them dearly in the Android tablet market, and if Merrifield does not use a more advanced GPU core (or simply more EUs of Gen7), then I expect that we will be here talking about Intel trying to gain significant share this time next year with Airmont based Cherry Trail...or, heaven forbid, Goldmont.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371678961333</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 17:56:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371679410555-128</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH @ $37.17</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371674218681</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:36:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it has more to do with the constant bashing this board has seen from those who are long ARMH and AMD....its gets quite annoying after awhile.

Bay Trail's gpu was designed years ago and is a good fit for its cpu, did you even know what S800's gpu was going to be like last week ? 'and if Merrifield does not use a more advanced GPU core' It's the same but unlike this S800 development platform it won't be throttled in a phone. Why don't you wait until actual S800 devices turn up with real world performance power profile restrictions before passing judgment ?</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371695916216</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371696505356-140</Id><Topic><Title>The Snapdragon 800 benchmarks look very impressive</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371651138585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'but this GPU is going to be trash compared to whatever Apple has in its next A-series chip' It will be about 20-30% better than the A6X so it won't be 'trash' under any objective analysis.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371696505356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:48:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371697670319-141</Id><Topic><Title>A good assesment about ARM</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1371694936290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing is.

I think the real high end competitor is going to be, as you suggested, Haswell-Y, while Bay Trail is really meant for very low cost 7" and 10" devices. If that is the case, then Intel's strategy is correct, particularly as higher performance gfx can be a good way to upsell to Core.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371698100539</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 23:15:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371698213095-143</Id><Topic><Title>The Snapdragon 800 benchmarks look very impressive</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1371651138585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mas, Good point re: throttling.
