The other angle is Intel is building up these leading edge capacities to bring costs down dramatically. If my understanding is right, each node results in a reduction of costs by a third. With fully depreciated 22nm (and later 14nm) processes, Intel costs would be so much lower than any of the ARM vendors. This would help Intel sell at highly-competitive prices (possibly even lower pricing than any of the ARM vendors) while being able to defend itself against charges charges of "dumping" - selling below cost - which is a huge anti-trust issue.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359724412616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 08:13:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359726236749-8</Id><Topic><Title>Hold this equity:</Title><Username>miltonsala</Username><Timestamp>1359725728366</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 08:35:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buffett doesn't have a stake anymore unless he just bought back in, which I'm now aware of that he did..

There are probably two ways to arrange the HW. 1. SMP: where you have a CPU with a lot of cores. 2. Accelerators: where you add boards to the system that you use to speed execution of the code on (commonly some kind of ARM GPU solotion: Eurotech). When you add Accelerators, there are two ways to run the benchmark. 1. run entirely on the accelerators (Eurotech because accelerator is different from host) 2. run on both the host CPU and the accelerators. For the Eurotech configured machine, they are using the host CPU to shuffle data. Lowering the frequency on the host CPU and therefore the power it consumes makes sense because they are running the benchmark on the Tesla accelerators. They displaced a Xeon + Phi machine from the top. The Xeon + Phi configuration can run code on the host Xeon only, Phi only or both Xeon and Phi using the OpenMP API. Intel released a new C and Fortran compiler last January that supports these execution modes. For floating point code, a big difference will be the FMA instruction support where a FP multiply and add happen together. FMA makes a big difference in FP code. For the Green 500, Haswell will not make much of a difference, since much of the work is done on the accelerators. Putting the FMA on the Phi would make the big difference.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359730384149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 09:53:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359730832805-18</Id><Topic><Title>Where is Intel's massive Manuf.

Intel pointed out that touch will be a necessary feature for Haswell-based ultrabooks, but refused to comment on processor subsidies. The sources believe the strategy will help accelerate the penetration of touchscreen notebooks, but some players are concerned that the adoption of touch panels will push consumers away due to pricing. The sources also pointed out that a shortage of touch panels due to weak yields is the main obstacle delaying the standardization of touchscreen notebooks and they expect touchscreen notebooks to only account for 10-15% of total notebook shipments by the second half of 2013.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359731783777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 10:16:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359731825539-20</Id><Title>I will use my power to keep INTC from closing over 21.23 today</Title><Msg>You will see that I will be right again today.

You have an interesting definition of a monopoly. This Intel notice was likely just a reminder. In early Aug 2011, Intel established the $300m Ultrabook fund. In order to get support from that $300m fund, the vendors would have to meet the Ultrabook spec published in Aug 2011 too. That spec says that Haswell Ultrabooks should have a touch screen. If you have a Haswell laptop without a touch screen, you have a Haswell laptop. If you have a system that meets the Ultrabook spec, you have an Ultrabook. Since Intel contracted for touch screen panels last year to insure the supply chain (after the hard drive debacle), Intel OEM's will get first access to panels to build Intel based machines. That is what Intel did last year when they tied up the panels. If the Intel OEMs want a piece of the $300m fund, they have to qualify for the funds by meeting the requirements set up in Aug 2011.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359733811718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 10:50:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359733954402-27</Id><Topic><Title>Intel demands Haswell ultrabooks be equipped with touch screens,</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359731783777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 10:16:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>61 only posts hit and run when ARM is up.

It has nothing to do with a monopoly or not. It has to do with trademark laws. Every company has these rights. If a company wants to use the word "UtrabookTM" to describe their system, they have to meet the requirements. If they decide not to put the word "Utrabook" on their system, they can do what they want. If they have an AMD CPU they will call it an Ultrathin. That is trademark law and has nothing to do with being a monopoly or not. If a company wants to put an "AMD" sticker on their machine, they better have an AMD product. AMD will tell them to remove it. If a company wants to put an "Qualcomm" sticker on their machine, they better have a Qualcomm product. Qualcomm will tell them to remove it. You can call Intel a monopoly if you want.

It would normally be better to buy a couple weeks after. A couple things to consider that seem different. Intel has sold off substantially from $29+ to where it is today. Intel has $5b - $10b left for share repurchase. 200m share short position when 50m to 100m is the normal range. Announcements pending on CEO, Haswell, phone products at Barcelona, .... If you plan on buying, a 1/3 to 1/2 position at these prices and a more if it drops after dividend. You can also buy deep ITM calls at near zero premium. Just one example: The July $15 option is $6.30/$6.35 which means your cost is $15 + $6.35 = $21.35 with Intel trading at $21.33. You can exercise the option anytime you want, like just before the May dividend if you want to get it. The deep call means that you control Intel for only $6.35 instead of $21.33 so you have less risk.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359744676639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:51:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359746766976-56</Id><Topic><Title>When 2 buy INTC?</Title><Username>jsf34062</Username><Timestamp>1359741572602</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:59:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would wait for it to settle down after divy.

There was a concern that Ultrabooks won't be able to come in under the $1000 mark with compelling performance and features, but such worries will soon be put to rest. Intel today announced a $300 million "Ultrabook Fund" to help drive innovation in this new category of devices. The Intel Capital Ultrabook Fund aims to invest in companies building hardware and software technologies focused on enhancing how people interact with Ultrabooks such as through sensors and touch, achieving all-day usage through longer battery life, enabling innovative physical designs and improved storage capacity.

Yes, Qualcomm is doing great today but things change. These companies that make phones have no loyalty. They simply want to sell their phones and they will buy components from any company that makes the ones that allow them to make the best phones. The advantage of an Intel CPU in a phone will become huge in early 2014. It will be able to do everything a qualcomm chip can do while doing it much faster and with lower battery power drain. Needless to say that the coming Intel CPU shrink to 14 nm will mark the end of Qualcomms great run where it dominated nearly 100% of the world's smart phone market. Yes--it is true that Qualcomm will make better and better chips but its chips will not keep up with Intel in performance. AMD makes better and better chips for Computers but they are simply way to far behind what Intel makes in order to compete now. So the funny thing about the Intel doom and gloom sayers is that they are saying Intel will NEVER get into smart phones in volume and that Intel's large Computer market will be replaced by Smartphones and tablets. The stock reflects these views. BUT--if Intel were to get to 20% share in the smart phone market in 2013 and then 50% in 2015, the stock would explode up. If Intel were to move to over 80% market share of phone with its CPUs, we would be looking at an Intel share price a little higher than now would you not think? Good luck.

The product line is showing its age and innovations are getting fewer and further between. Samsung and Android just keep ringing Apple's bell. But there's an easy way with minimal risk to fix all of this. Apple just needs to do the two-step with Intel: Step One: The iWatch Bring out the iWatch in partnership with Intel. This from the Chinese web site originally reporting that an Apple/Intel iWatch development was in process: "From the supply chain news that Apple is building a Bluetooth smart watches, responsible for the design by Intel, is expected to be listed in the first half of next year. Supply chain, said Intel is designed for Apple Bluetooth smart watches, this product is RiTdisplay 1.5-inch OLED screen, other aspects of the supply chain, with a rhenium ocean of OGS encore indium tin oxide transparent conductive (ITO) glass." From PCMag: Report: Apple, Intel Working on Smartwatch for 2013 Step Two: Convert the rest of the product line to Intel's advanced fabrication Apple only has two choices in fabrication and both are flawed. Samsung would be the logical choice if they didn't compete with their customers and if they had a clear path to 14/16nm FinFET. They do and they don't. Samsung and Apple are getting a divorce. Rule Samsung out. TSMC would be a logical choice except for four reasons. First is that they don't have the capital that Samsung does and will therefore have trouble staying in the massive CapEx game in the future. Second is that they have struggled with ramping even 28nm production. Third is that they don't have a clear path to 14/16nm FinFET. And fourth is that there is significant uncertainty that they will be able to meet Apple's massive demand. Intel has none of these problems and their fabrication roadmap extends far into the sunset while ARMs fabrication roadmap ends right after 20nm Street. Apple desperately needs something to distinguish its products from the rest of the ARM world. Intel has the technology to deliver this. Conclusion It would be the Oregon/Arizona Two-Step rather than the Texas Two-Step but it would put Apple squarely back in the game and take their stock price over $1000 while pushing Intel's over 40.

Many of us who grew up in the ‘80s and ‘90s are used to them by now. Back then, smartphones did not exist. Apple would not invent its iPhone until 2007, so watches and pocket clocks were the way to tell time. If you did not purchase a watch, you hoped that the clock on the wall was not lying this time. I can remember how cool I thought I was because of the calculator watch. These were good times. Today, watches have become more of a passing ‘90s fad that needs to “stay dead,” according to some critics. As someone who grew up in the ‘90s, I shared this sentiment early on when I kept hearing stories about Apple creating an “iWatch.” When rumors started surfacing that Google wanted to create a smart watch as well (to go with its augmented-reality glasses), I was even more skeptical. Why should these tech giants return to a ‘90s fad in order to take consumers into the future of technology? Can they not come up with something else to take its place? Google’s driverless cars are the kind of earth-shattering tech that captivates me. “Let’s move forward, not retreat,” I was thinking to myself. At the same time, however, the “car” concept is not innovative. While Google’s driverless concept is, the vehicle itself is not. Cars have been around for my entire 28 years of life; to find out how innovative cars were when they first arrived, you’d have to ask someone’s relative who remembers an older family member driving a Ford model-T when it became America’s vehicle. My grandparents were born in the ‘30s, so they would remember more about that era than I would. While cars have been around for approximately eighty years (read that right: EIGHTY!), society has not exhausted the potential of the vehicle. Within the last few years alone, we have learned that cars can utilize safety technology to prevent accidents and minimize vehicle damage upon impact. Cars can also alert drivers as to when they must stop and refill their gas tank to avoid car death in the middle of the highway. As of this moment, Apple has decided to take Siri to Chevy vehicles with its “Eyes Free” program so that drivers need not look at Siri or the iPhone screen while driving. Drivers can thus stay focused while Siri does all the work that drivers need to do. Google’s augmented-reality glasses are an innovation that capitalizes upon the invention of glasses in the past. There are those who, like me, are visually challenged and always need a pair of glasses to wear on a daily basis. Now, with Google Glasses, consumers will be able to do ordinary things (like set appointments, order concert tickets, send texts and emails, and post new FB, Google +, and Twitter statuses) better while on the go. Telling your glasses to “send a new Facebook post” is more effective than to walk around with your hands touching the virtual keyboard on a smartphone screen. With this technology, Google will eliminate the need to use your hands on small display screens, where you type an email and rely on autocorrect because of large fingers or fast typing. Assessing all this, it seems reasonable that the iPod would be replaced by the iWatch. While iPods are not selling like iPhones and iPads today, many runners and fitness gurus rely upon the iPod Nano and the iPod Touch to play their collection of music while jogging, hiking, playing basketball, and other sports and outdoor activities. This is the reason why the iPod Nano was so popular as a wristwatch concept back before the iPod Touch emerged from Apple’s production line. Now, you need not worry about your iPod Nano, iPod Touch, or iPhone being the target of thieves; they’ll have to pry it off your arm to steal it now! I was once a skeptic of the iWatch, but I am no longer. I have a tendency, as do many consumers, to want to keep items such as the watch in the past and immortalize them. At the same time, who knows how much benefit the watch can provide consumers in the future?

Intel Labs is teaming up with researchers at the University of Texas, Carnegie Mellon and other universities to develop processors that configure themselves depending on the workload, an idea that could result in significant performance and energy efficiency gains in CPUs. In a Jan. 30 post on the Intel Labs blog, Chris Wilkerson, a senior staff research scientist at Intel Labs in Oregon, wrote that a collaboration between Intel and University in Texas researchers in particular as resulted in the “development of MorphCore, a CPU that ‘morphs’ between two configurations. One configuration tailored for high performance single-threaded workloads, and a second for higher throughput multi-threaded workloads.” Such transformable CPUs could result in designs that increase performance by as much as 10 percent and energy efficiency by 22 percent over traditional chips, according to simulations of MorphCore run by researchers, he wrote. Most software runs in single-thread environments, where the CPU takes care of one task before moving onto the next. However, a growing number of applications—particularly in such environments as supercomputing and high-performance computing (HPC)—can be run in parallel, where the workload is broken up into tasks, and the CPU processes the tasks simultaneously. Over the past few years, organizations have been leveraging GPU accelerators from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in their high-end systems to help run compute intensive and highly parallel workloads in an effort to increase the power of their supercomputers while keep power consumption in check. Intel officials in November 2012 introduced their Xeon Phi coprocessors, x86-based chips that run with traditional Xeon processors to give systems a performance and energy efficiency boost while offering users the benefits of working with familiar Intel Architecture tools. Intel Labs’ efforts around transformable CPUs would create single chips that could handle both single- and multi-threaded workloads, according to Wilkerson. In the blog, he noted that single-thread applications require high-performance CPUS that can throw all the available resources at the instruction thread that is being run, including large register files that can re-order instructions that can run when they’re ready, rather than having to wait until the preceding instruction is complete. Meanwhile, when processing multiple instruction threads simultaneously, CPUs can often delay work on a thread that has stalled, turning its attention and resources instead to the other instructions being processed. Buffers that enable instruction re-ordering aren’t needed, and not using them not only keeps the CPU performance high, but also enhances energy efficiency by ensuring that power doesn’t continue to be consumed while dealing with a stalled thread, he wrote. The University of Texas’ “UT’s MorphCore addresses this problem by modifying the design of a high performance CPU to permit shutting down some buffers and repurposing others,” Wilkerson wrote. The CPU’s throughput mode splits the largest of the buffers, the physical register file, into equal partitions, with each partition storing the architectural state of one executing thread, he wrote. Doing so simplifies renaming—which assigns buffer space for fetched instructions—and the throughput mode also cuts power consumption by turning off the load buffer and much of the store buffer, essentially “sacrificing memory reordering in favor of reduced power.” Wilkerson said the results are CPUs that can handle whatever workloads are thrown at them. He compared this to a vehicle that can either be an SUV when the power and capacity to drive around family members or friends are needed, or be quickly transformed into a motorcycle to save on gas when only a single person is driving. “With these [MorphCore] and other promising ideas developed in collaboration with Intel’s academic partners, processors in the next 5-10 years may offer the best of both worlds: high performance to minimize delay and deliver the best user experience; as well as throughput mode to maximize efficiency when single thread performance is less important,” Wilkerson wrote.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1359771509615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 21:18:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359771796976-88</Id><Title>Intel Unleashes Rack Server Design with Silicon Photonics Interconnections</Title><Msg>Intel Unleashes Rack Server Design with Silicon Photonics Interconnections. Intel and Facebook Collaborate on Disaggregated Rack-Scale Server Architecture [01/16/2013 04:27 PM] by Anton Shilov Intel Corp. on Wednesday announced collaboration with Facebook to define the next generation of rack technologies used to power the world's largest data centers. The companies also unveiled a mechanical prototype built by Quanta Computer that includes Intel's innovative photonic rack architecture to show the total cost, design and reliability improvement potential of a disaggregated rack environment. "Intel and Facebook are collaborating on a new disaggregated, rack-scale server architecture that enables independent upgrading of compute, network and storage subsystems that will define the future of mega-datacenter designs for the next decade," said Justin Rattner, Intel's chief technology officer during his keynote address at Open Computer Summit. Intel Reveals Silicon Photonics Technologies for Servers The new architecture is based on more than a decade's worth of research to invent a family of silicon-based photonic devices, including lasers, modulators and detectors using low-cost silicon to fully integrate photonic devices of unprecedented speed and energy efficiency. Silicon photonics is a new approach to using light (photons) to move huge amounts of data at very high speeds with extremely low power over a thin optical fiber rather than using electrical signals over a copper cable. Intel has spent the past two years proving its silicon photonics technology was production-worthy, and has now produced engineering samples. "The disaggregated rack architecture includes Intel's new photonic architecture, based on high-bandwidth, 100Gb/s Intel silicon photonics technology, that enables fewer cables, increased bandwidth, farther reach and extreme power efficiency compared to today's copper based interconnects," added Mr. Rattner. Silicon photonics made with inexpensive silicon rather than expensive and exotic optical materials provides a distinct cost advantage over older optical technologies in addition to providing greater speed, reliability and scalability benefits. Businesses with server farms or massive data centers could eliminate performance bottlenecks and ensure long-term upgradability while saving significant operational costs in space and energy. Silicon Photonics and Disaggregation Efficiencies Businesses with large data centers can significantly reduce capital expenditure by disaggregating or separating compute and storage resources in a server rack. Rack disaggregation refers to the separation of those resources that currently exist in a rack, including compute, storage, networking and power distribution into discrete modules. Traditionally, a server within a rack would each have its own group of resources. When disaggregated, resource types can be grouped together and distributed throughout the rack, improving upgradability, flexibility and reliability while lowering costs. "We are excited about the flexibility that these technologies can bring to hardware and how silicon photonics will enable us to interconnect these resources with less concern about their physical placement. We are confident that developing these technologies in the open and contributing them back to the Open Compute Project will yield an unprecedented pace of innovation, ultimately enabling the entire industry to close the utilization gap that exists with today's systems designs," said Frank Frankovsky, chairman of the Open Compute Foundation and vice president of hardware design at supply chain at Facebook. By separating critical components from one another, each computer resource can be upgraded on its own cadence without being coupled to the others. This provides increased lifespan for each resource and enables IT managers to replace just that resource instead of the entire system. This increased serviceability and flexibility drives improved total-cost for infrastructure investments as well as higher levels of resiliency. There are also thermal efficiency opportunities by allowing more optimal component placement within a rack. The mechanical prototype is a demonstration of Intel's photonic rack architecture for interconnecting the various resources, showing one of the ways compute, network and storage resources can be disaggregated within a rack. Intel will contribute a design for enabling a photonic receptacle to the Open Compute Project (OCP) and will work with Facebook, Corning, and others over time to standardize the design. The mechanical prototype includes distributed input/output (I/O) using Intel Ethernet switch silicon, and will support the Intel Xeon processor and the next generation, 22nm system-on-chip (SoC) Intel Atom processor, code named "Avoton" available this year.</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1359771796976</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 21:23:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359771873910-89</Id><Title>VMWare Boss puts brakes on ARM server revolution (laughable revolution)</Title><Msg>VMware Boss Puts Brakes on ARM Server Revolution By Cade Metz 08.30.12 3:08 PM</Msg><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1359771873910</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 21:24:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359774051669-90</Id><Title>Security in servers is where Intel has a huge lead.

If building an Ultrabook is best for them, that is what they should do. If not building an Ultrabook is best for them, then they shouldn't. Why does INTC get to define what an Ultrabook configuration is? They supply a chip not the product. I guess they have a trademark on the name right? In any case, I can't see why any OEM who chooses to use an INTC chip for their own design they believe there is a strong consumer demand for should have to pay a price (in the sense that they don't get the ultrabook 'discount') to build that product instead of the one INTC thinks they should build. I say BOO to INTC for trying to mandate what consumers should want.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1359775678887</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 22:27:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
