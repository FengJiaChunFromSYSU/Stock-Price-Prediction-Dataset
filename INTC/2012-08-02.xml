It can't fix the "fiscal cliff". Neither can they do much about the Eurozone debt crisis. What the Fed along with the President and his administration did lately was to pass the baton to ECB; pressuring the ECB to print more money. We'll have to wait till tomorrow to find out what "whatever it takes" (ECB President's pledge) brings. Technically, the bigger stocks have held up well. The short term momentum readings of both the DJIA and the S&amp;P 500 stayed bullish. But the smaller stocks as well as the transportation shares, which tend to lead the intermediate term market direction, continue to do poorly. The negative divergences between the major indexes and their technical indicators are still in place which doesn't bode well for stock prices on an intermediate term basis. In the near term, it will continue to be a macro driven market. have a nice day</Msg><Username>littlestew58</Username><Timestamp>1343888204000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 02:16:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343891434000-3</Id><Title>SELL Chick-Fil-A, BUY Intel...</Title><Msg>Join the 'culture war'.

However I also think that Apple will stick with Samsung. What you said makes too much sense and will be the topic of discussion in business schools ten years from now. It will fall under the topic of "bad business decisions." Though I wouldn't be happy about it, part of me is hoping that Apple pulls off an upset by having purchased every 28nm CPU that TSMC can manufacture. If they had a six month ramp up to build inventory it would put their phone into the zone of interesting. I am afraid that this won't happen. Apple probably asked around to vendors "What's the node you can make in the tens of millions starting in July?" Samsung said "32nm" and Intel said "32nm for sure, 22nm maybe, we are talking X86, right?" and TSMC said "We are selling wafers that have a few working 28nm on them, it's like gold mining, you never know what you'll get." Apple will stick with Samsung and run with 32nm for the next two years. They don't perceive hardware as making or breaking their destiny they'll be fine with this decision. In those two years Intel will be in mobile at 22nm and the early stages of 14nm. We're about to find out how unimportant hardware really is. Whatever decision Apple makes will look like the right one. Apple is going to make the iPhone5 with a larger screen and give iPhone users many of the benefits that Android users now take for granted. Sales will be amazing for this phone, and it will be the "must have" phone of the holiday season. Apple's management will be satisfied. Over the next two years people will go to phone stores looking to buy the iPhone and walk out with an Android instead. It will happen again and again. With emerging markets where phones cost many weeks salaries they may be a bit more skeptical about spending the extra money for the iPhone. If Apple doesn't have a phone that sets the bar and establishes them as the market leader based on solid hardware you will see their market share erode as Intel heats up in mobile over the next couple of years. The smartphone market will escape Apple as smartphones become commodities.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1343924012000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343925054000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Going Higher!</Title><Username>nikoliaaxa764</Username><Timestamp>1343911301000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:41:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow!!!</Msg><Username>mauritazic019</Username><Timestamp>1343925054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:30:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>21</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343926006000-26</Id><Topic><Title>HP and Dell to launch Windows RT tablet PCs at the end of October</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343885807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 01:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry for the inconvenient truths... ________ The inconvenient truth is that you blast people for doing something and then do the exact same thing yourself.

Which is conservative and prudent. However, from time to time, Apple has made big decisions and switches - and they have benefited vastly from these moves. Further, Tim Cook would want to establish himself as a leader by making bold decisions. If Intel's new Atoms (to be released later this year), process and manufacturing roadmaps are convincing, I would bet that Tim Cook wouldn't hesitate too much to pull the trigger. Also, though he currently decries hybrid/convertible laptops, I wouldn't be surprised if they have some skunkwork projects inside Apple working on them - of course, these machines would need high performance leading back to Intel.

Intel will trade near the $26 option strike plus/minus a dividend and end up near the strike. The nearest strike price ($26) has gravity because option premium is highest right at the strike and then drops off as you move away from it. Something like a bell-shaped curve. Being near the strike allows the option market maker to deal with the fact that the put and call options will change value after the close by a dividend (22.5cents).</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343933744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343937290000-35</Id><Topic><Title>SELL Chick-Fil-A, BUY Intel...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1343891434000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 03:10:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>record day for chic, you're wrong. last day for div here</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1343937290000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 15:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343937324000-36</Id><Topic><Title>INTC getting crushed today on the ARM tablet news?</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1343931468000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:17:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my INTC is up</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1343937324000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 15:55:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343943824000-37</Id><Title>Ex div tomorrow</Title><Msg>I bought today at close and sold $25 covered call.

Many people think they can buy the shares, sell a near call and get the dividend. It is likely you will have some or all your shares on Monday but you will not know for sure until the options settle on Saturday evening. If 10,000 call options are exercised, they are allocated to the brokers proportionally. The broker then allocates the exercises they are responsible sprinkles them over those customers who are short the calls. You will keep the 88 cents and then get $25 for any assigned.

They do it for all dividend stocks. When you write your call, it becomes part of the general population of calls at that strike price/month. The options clearing house then proportionally spreads exercises across brokers having customers with those options. Your broker will then allocate the assignment by some algorithm acrosss their customers. Even those who sold calls months ago are at risk if the premium was low enough today. I usually close out option positions when the premium gets down near a dime. I like to sell put options on Intel. I try to sell puts for a dollar and then close them out after they leak down. I bought back 50 $26 Aug put contracts today I had sold. Sold for $1.10 and bought back for 42 cents. I figured after the drop tomorrow, there will be some premium back on them. http://www.theoptionsguide.com/dividend-capture-using-covered-calls.aspx</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343947705000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:48:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343947746000-45</Id><Topic><Title>HP and Dell to launch Windows RT tablet PCs at the end of October</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343885807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 01:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are really desperate......ARMH is dog meat. http://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/1542-how-apple-samsung-duel-will-lead-wintel-2-0.html</Msg><Username>magicjackassss</Username><Timestamp>1343947746000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343948823000-46</Id><Title>My blitch is down 50% on this Intel/Cisco swap</Title><Msg>And he's been defeated.

The HOLDERS of any options can request option exercise, any day up to and including expiration. The HOLDER makes that request to his broker. The broker has some time to get the request to the option clearing house. The option clearing house accumulates the special requests and distributes them proportionally across the WRITERS. If half he options are requested, each broker gets a 50% request. The broker then reacts to the OCC request and takes action on individual accounts. The action on individual accouts will be reflected when the brokerage runs their books and pushes out the action. It just takes some time for this chain of events to ripple through the organizations. It is not a bad trade. You have the potential for a (dividend - commission) trade with a maximum risk of a commission loss. You have also learned the lesson the same exact way I did. 8-) What always ticked me off was when I just got part of my position assigned. The OCC and CBOE both have lots of learning material. I would expect "some" shares to be assigned but I would not be surprised if none, part or all your shares were assigned. I am still trying to figure out the arbitraging game. There are numerous ways to pull it off. I just like to observe it and was surprised that so few options traded hands.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343951134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 19:45:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343954184000-50</Id><Title>Liberal Barney Frank getting married!...to a man</Title><Msg>Hector got cornholed by Barny, You Libs are the TRASH of the earth.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1343954184000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 20:36:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343954520000-51</Id><Title>Analysts just met with Intel, 33-39 Target</Title><Msg>http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2012/08/02/intc-wells-longbow-see-upside-on-servers-new-products/?mod=yahoobarrons</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1343954520000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 20:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343958579000-52</Id><Topic><Title>How the Apple-Samsung Duel Will Lead to Wintel 2.0</Title><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1343945915000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:18:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I for one hope that Samsung wins all lawsuits against Apple.
