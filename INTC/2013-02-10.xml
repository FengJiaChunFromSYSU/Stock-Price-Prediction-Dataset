So what are we left with? mainstream and entry level. Many have 1000 dollars to spend on a laptop. But no one wants to pay for #$%$. Thats why Apple have a 90%+ market share on computers over 1000 dollars. Customers are willing to pay Apple above $1000 computers for few simple reason: iOS, nice laptop design, many cool applications, long battery life, slim, etc. and less much relevant about CPU inside. It is very easy for Apple to switch to ARM based laptops and computers when the right time comes. Therefore, Ultrabook sales will be terrible as netbooks until Intel and its OEM figures out how to improve sales. There is one common problem with intelligent people: if you do not learn your past mistakes, most likley Intel will do it again. AMD has been cursed. AMD is a great company and has finally made a wise strategic moves with huge progress to survive. Wait until ARM unleashes their computers and servers to mass market. In just 1 month we will have 8 core ARM phones (Samsung Galaxy S4) In 2 days ARM license more cores then AMD produce in a year. In under 2 weeks more cores then Intel sells in a year. ARM license more cores per year then Intel have sold in its lifetime Intel needs to have the next genertion CPU and platform with clean designs. Intel is a great company and time for change before it is too late. Until then, stock is going nowhere but down or at the current level at best.

"So, over the course of development in the past 16 months, initial features of Haswell got lopped off, most notably Crystalwell - the massive 8 GB integrated memory block to feed the new GPUs - which is where a great deal of the performance increase was going to come from. But, at this point, Crystalwell's cost is causing OEMs to scream. Even if Haswell with Crystalwell makes it into actual systems, at what price point will they be selling?" Would 8GB (gigabytes, I am assuming) of integrated memory be reasonable on a CPU to "feed the new GPUs"? Or does he mean gigaBITS for 1gigabytes? If Intel puts 8gigabytes in the package, that is too much just for "feeding the new GPUs". 8GB is enough to feed the GPU and to provide respectable system memory. If Intel is putting the system memory on the SoC Haswell, that could explain the high pricing and the reason the OEM's are screaming. The Haswell definition of the Ultrabook specifies a "Haswell microarchitecture SoC (10 or 15 W TDP)". The spec uses "SoC" which Intel uses to describe "anything in a single chip". The Haswell Ultrabook spec does not have dimensions or a RESUME spec defined. This could be Otellini's "major screw up" or it could be a successful example of what Intel is really capable of doing.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1360530131499</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 16:02:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360530372698-17</Id><Topic><Title>Some serious criticism taht's a little scary</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1360523031963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 14:03:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, you're going to listen to Tom Luongo?

Hmmm. Wonder why they aren't playing? Because they can't. This fantasy that performance doesn't matter and that they don't need to compete is just that - a total fantasy spun by people who want to pretend that their fabrication crisis isn't going to change everything in the marketplace.

The logic is remarkably easy to follow when the pieces are all in place. Ultimately it's all about the money. Here's the single most important piece of information: At 90nm there were 19 ARM foundries. At 65/55nm there were 16. At 45/40 there were 12. At 32/28nm there were 8. At 16/14nm there will be three. That number could drop to one (Samsung). Regardless the trend is incontrovertible. The fabless model is broken. There is no other reason for a decline from 19 to 3 foundries. And why are the number of ARM fabs dropping like a rock? Money pure and simple. The fabless model doesn't provide nearly enough money for CapEx or R&amp;D. The ARM foundries have therefore tried to get by with "just good enough." And it has resulted in disaster with no access to FinFET (insufficient R&amp;D spending) and insufficient manufacturing capacity (insufficient CapEx availability). And a drop in the number of ARM foundries that if you extend the trend line drops to zero. And here's your proof: 93 fabless Series A Semiconductor Fundings in 2000, 42 in 2004, 16 in 2006, 16 in 2007, and 3 in 2012. Funding for foundries has dropped like a rock and the number of foundries has dropped in a corresponding manner. No money. No fabs. Not rocket science. Here are the results or perhaps the symptoms of the breaking of the ARM fabless model: 1.) Fewer fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Large fabs acquiring small ones, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 40nm, it was 40 to 50, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Because of extremely high cost in process technology and SoC development, the relationship between fabless companies and foundries has become sensitive. 9.) Foundries will select their customers very carefully, and the criteria for acceptance will involve financial returns as well as technical capabilities. So, the rich will get foundry services and the rest of the ARM shops will be left hanging. So much for the ARM hoardes helping to compete with Intel. 10.) There is also the complementary factor that, with the increasing cost of implementing SoC designs at most advanced technology node, only a small number of fabless companies can participate. 11.) Whenever the partnership between a fabless company and foundry established, it would not be easy to change, as the change means high cost that should be paid by both parties. In other words, when an ARM shop makes a deal with one of the few remaining ARM foundries, then they are STUCK, and can only get unstuck by the application of large sums of money. And then who will they go to? One of their other one or two choices, if they even have that many? 12.) At 20nm and 14nm, the foundry business model will probably be slightly changed. An IDM-like collaboration between fabless companies and foundries will be expected. So the ARM foundries are going to have to become virtual IDMs (like Intel) in order to compete as these levels. Expect higher costs and lots of problems on implementation. 13.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 14.) Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines. There will be the need for collaboration between fabless company and foundry on understanding the process variations. 15.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries. There is the need to anticipate potential yield problems and address them at the design implementation phase, and DFM factors have to be carefully analyzed. 16.) Fabless companies will need to build stronger process and product engineering and DFM expertise. It means a extra cost of 50-100M USD per year. Conclusion The fabless fabrication model has been in decline for years. Now the absence of adequate R&amp;D spending has shown up to finish it off. No FinFET, no state-of-the-art technology, no roadmap beyond 20nm, no future. Along with insufficient manufacturing capacity. Does anyone really think that something will happen to increase the number of foundries up from three rather than down to one? Nothing in the trends, dynamics or funding suggests that anything other than a continuation of the trend is possible. Pull the curtains. Que the lights. The ARM show is over...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360534306737-20</Id><Topic><Title>Some serious criticism taht's a little scary</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1360523031963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 14:03:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have purchased AMD products in the past and might even do so again.

Or did they do it on purpose to stimulate consumer lust for a gadget so hot they simply can’t get it. The appeal of Surface Pro is certainly clear. It’s a fully functional PC in tablet form, which docks to create a very capable Ultrabook. The reviews have suggested it isn’t the greatest choice if you spend most of your computing time using the device on your lap, and battery life leaves room for improvement, but otherwise the Surface Pro seems to be the convertible device to beat. Irregardless of Microsoft’s guilt when it comes to artificial scarcity, the company is certainly dominating the conversation, and that’s never a bad thing. Will regretful consumers return their purchases en masse the way they did with Surface RT, or will OEM’s sit up and take notice the way Microsoft intended? It will probably take more data then we can collect this weekend to determine for sure, but it certainly sounds like the Surface Pro is the good news story Microsoft was hoping to lead with to help promote Windows 8.

I think non-gamers face similar trade-offs. When Intel introduces 3 flavors of their CPU, most people go for the one in the middle not the top so there's obviously some truth to the fact that you cant arbitrarily keep selling up performance. At some point a consumer is going to ask you what difference it makes in real life scenarios. As Intel know really well, unless there's some killer apps that really demand the performance, its a tough sell. These days, the biggest volume of apps is being made for mobile phones and tablets. Desktops and laptops are being left behind -- look at the dismal app support for Windows 8, and that is after Microsoft has pumped billions of dollars of seed money.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1360544335235</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 19:58:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360544751890-33</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Is Toast: Here's Why</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where do Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm and NVidia get their chips fabricated?

[Yes, it's very profitable being a foundry - that's why the numbers have shrunk from 19 down to 3. Because it's so profitable. That's why all the funding has dropped out. Because it's so profitable. You never cease to amaze with your ability to look at black and call it white and vice versa. Has anyone ever told you that baldface lying is a bad thing? Apparently not. Apparently you will say anything or make anything up to earn your ten cents a post from the shill boss. [This is not an analysis from before mobility, dufus.

The image above showed the AnTuTu benchmark result of XiaoMi Phone 2 and Lenovo K900. The XiaoMi Phone 2 scores 21958 points but the Lenovo K900 scores 25481 points. It is clear that the Lenovo K900 higher performance than the XiaoMi Phone 2. Even you dont agree, at least AnTuTu Benchmark showed the figures. The Lenovo K900 is powered by 2.0GHz Intel Atom Z2580 and 2GB of RAM while the GPU is PowerVR SGX 544MP. The Intel Atom Z2580 is a dual-core processor with four threads. The important thing is the AnTuTu Benchmark result above does not represent the complete result. It is said that the benchmark belongs to Lenovo K900 prototype. Thats why the 2D and 3D scores are lower than the XiaoMi Phone 2. The complete Lenovo 900 should score more than 30,000 points.
