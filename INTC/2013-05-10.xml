Here's an article from Barrons back in March 27. Stock was trading less that $22 at the time. Covello, who has a Sell rating on Intel shares, and a $16 price target, thinks a 3% climb in the shares through yesterday was all about investors expecting Intel would cut some of the $13.5 billion in spending it has planned for this year. After spending 100% of operating cash flow in seven of the last eight quarters, on capital spending, on dividends, and on share repurchases, net cash fell from $20 billion to $5 billion from Q4 of 2010 through Q4 of last year. Covello thinks PC inventories are too high, and that Intel has been unnecessarily contributing to that inventory build-up: If Intel were to significantly reduce capex to about $7-$8 bn, then we would likely be less negative on the stock. As we have written previously, the primary reason for our Sell rating is our view that Intel’s robust capex has created excess supply. For example, Intel’s 4Q12 fab utilization was about 50%, and PC OEM inventory is near a multi-year high (Exhibit 2). We do not believe a small capex reduction would be sufficient to fix the supply problem, as Intel already added significant capacity with its capex increase to $11 bn in 2011 and 2012 from about $5 bn on average in 2007-2010. In addition, our hardware team expects 2013 PC units to decline slightly yoy. Stock has gained over 11% ever since. So much for his reasoning and sell rating.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1368159432438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:17:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368159441167-4</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368136737282</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:58:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My bad I thought you wer talking about Intel.</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368159441167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:17:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368159730135-5</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368136737282</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:58:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I enjoy Wallis's contributions as well. He's a wealth of valuable information. I disagree however with the valuation of ARMH. It seems that for every hour of R&amp;D they do they add three hours of spin and hype to the market. They have enough talking points that they release over and over again to people who are more or less clueless investors. It's not simply good enough to invest in large established companies, everybody has to look for the rising star that nobody's really heard of in the real world. Do people know ARM? Go ask any teenager who has a phone about what processor is inside and they'll probably say "I donnu, Intel?" The unknowing have more dollars than sense to put into the market. ARM is going to run up, then drop back, then run up and drop back and run up over and over again. It's a Yo-Yo stock that can be influenced by hype and ignorance. And those two things aren't in short supply. I'm looking forward to seeing Intel cross the $30 threshold. Honestly, it probably would be there now if it wasn't for Windows 8. Also having a press friendly CEO who speak in sound bites would be more helpful. But I do foresee an improving world economy just in time for Intel's new 14nm FABs. The newer technology means newer possibilities for phones and tablets.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1368159730135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:22:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368160930284-6</Id><Topic><Title>Where are we headed, Marsavian?</Title><Username>wdblowfish</Username><Timestamp>1368033792056</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:23:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I always felt an interesting move Intel could do is to more or less drop the prices of 22nm and 14nm SoC's down to a point that it would be cost prohibitive for ARM to pay for the 20nm nodes. Intel could pick up market share while keeping ARM at bay. Then it could resume more normalized margins when ARM isn't a serious factor in a few years. Some variation of this idea probably is the strategy for taking over the high end phone and tablet market. I think the way that they'll get by with doing this is with a serious rebate program where sales are counted in one quarter and the rebates paid the following quarter. With growing sales quarter over quarter the rebates paid out will get diluted.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1368160930284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:42:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368161435309-7</Id><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Msg>It isn't surprising to see stocks pull back from an overbought condition.

They know what they have bought and are happy taking the risk that they do. Myself, as an intel investor am happy with the direction and pipeline of products intel has or will release in the very near future. Like I said before, intel's past marketing has been abysmal. Their advertising agency needs a boot in the butt. Like the PC, intel HAS to market their Tablet and Phone chips better to the PUBLIC. Ie intel Inside 3D Atom processor.......forget about Z2736, Z6716U, means nothing to the public, only techno geeks get that language.......make the public aware of intel 3D processors, irrespective of the model or the device. in the end it's the customer and consumer that decides how they spend their money. OEM's will buy the components, whatever the price premium, as long as that is what the CONSUMER desires it and is willing to pay for it. Apple is a classis example of a consumer paying $500 for a computer, desiring and adding the Apple logo for an extra $100.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1368162564696</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 01:09:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368163188409-9</Id><Topic><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1368161435309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you f**u**c&amp;&amp;ke**n idiot.

I have had the pleasure of working in multiple nations and I have seen a little of this world. You love movies? Then go and watch the top movies from other nations and you will see the best the world has to offer. I am not saying great movies are never ever made in America but they are few and far between would you not agree? The American movie business makes movies for those who are 12 to 20 in age and they insult even them with the simplicity of the movies. When was the last time America was not fighting a war somewhere? The vast majority of time from WW II to the present America has been at war. Is that not sick? other nations are not at war are they. Japan? NO Germany? NO Russia? NO China? NO Then you wonder why it is the world thinks negatively about Americans? Perhaps when you act like an #$%$, you become unlikable. The great music of today is out of other nations too. The 1960s had American music all over the world but not now. Oh well. Look at the jerks on TV on CNBC. Ricky Santelli, a proud backer of Mussolini know doubt, I WAS telling us how the markets would crash and America was doomed if OB was re-elected. Now the jerkoffff is smiling as the market hits new record highs and the American economy recovers. Well--it is about time American understand how stupid they have been and what jerks are running the nation in our Congress and in the white house. OB is a little better than Bush but that is like saying the smell of a skunk is a little better than the stink of a dead pig. They both smell bad do they not. Intel will hit 40 this year. A GREAT COMPANY STILL IT IS. It is still run from beautiful Northern California. By the way---it only takes a 5% change in the population from right to left to turn the nation back in the correct direction. But OB is no Liberal is he. He is fighting wars we do not need to fight.

Next comes a big jump to a 14nm fab process with Airmont and another unnamed 14nm processor currently in the pipe. Silvermont, and Intel’s upcoming 14nm processors, shows the company still has a mobile fight left in it. This should sooth investor’s fears that Intel and x86 might struggle for relevancy in a post-PC world. Intel’s move down to a 22nm multigate FinFET fab means that Silvermont should perform faster for a lower TDP than its ARM-based competition. FinFET means the chip will feature Intel’s proprietary 3D transistors, which allow the chip to have more transistors per square inch than its competition from the likes of NVIDIA or Qualcomm. Intel is also including out-of-order execution (OoOE) functionality on the chip, which allows for instructions to be processed in a non-linear fashion as soon as data is available rather than in a linear format as found in the program’s code From vr-zone</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1368197171693</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:46:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368197367053-37</Id><Title>Shorts</Title><Msg>After giving up five bucks since November, shorts now go to work on six.

One worker says he found harassment Commentary: Workplace is no place for a kick in the rear Henry Palacio, a 50-year-old Intel Corp. employee in Rio Rancho, N.M., was busy making chips last summer when one of his co-workers stuck a “kick me” sign on his back. He thought he’d felt something. He asked a safety rep if something was stuck on his back. The safety rep said no, but with a grin, so Palacio sought a second opinion. He turned to a trusted co-worker, and when he turned around to show his back, another co-worker yelled, “Don’t read it. Just do it.” Bloomberg Enlarge Image You can guess what happened next: Thwack! A big ol’ foot, right in the keister. You won’t believe what happened after that. Palacio then asked the same co-worker, who had just kicked him, the same question yet again. Thwack! Then he asked a third time. Thwack! By now, Palacio’s co-workers on the “Intel Hitachi Shift 7” were really laughing. He turned to another co-worker, a man who had welcomed him when he first arrived in New Mexico from California in 2008. This co-worker had even purchased Christmas gifts for Palacio’s children. And when Palacio turned again to show his backside, thwack! He was kicked a fourth time. So what did Palacio do after being kicked four times? He turned around to let it happen yet again. “He’s had his butt kicked enough,” said another co-worker, who finally intervened and then removed the “kick-me” tag. Phew! My own rump grew sore just reading these details in the workplace-harassment lawsuit Palacio recently filed against Intel and seven of his co-workers.</Msg><Username>madmoneycramer</Username><Timestamp>1368199204660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368199420023-48</Id><Topic><Title>Inside Intel?

Intel seems to be buying back about 300k shares per day. The 1mil shares being shorted each day for the last year has stopped. Some short covering has started and there is 150mil shares above historical normal levels shorted. Value investors step in and are nibbling when the Intel yield goes above 4%. Analyst upgrades are starting to flow back in with the smaller ones first. There will be a lot of Intel new product news in the next few months. There are a number of fundamental issues that will make the RSI artificially high and fool the pure chartists into thinking INTC is overbought. The 50-day just crossed above the 200-day.

As for example, the API management features offered by Aepona are capable of tracking location, type of device and other features linked to a mobile connection that can act as a foundation for communication service providers to enable transaction like one-time payments for services. Mashery also provides software to aid partners in managing API features that have been implemented. A number of software offered by both the companies is meant for mobile platforms and transactions taking place on mobile platforms. They fit in the growing focus of Intel in tablets and smartphones. Intel has mentioned that the unit can be merged into its Services Division. The purchases come a week after Intel hired the former chief of the software department, Renee James as the president of the company. James, being the second in command to the CEO, Brian Krzanich, will be helping in moulding the company’s future in terms of software, hardware and services. Intel already offers a variety of programming tools. Some of them are associated to its x85 hardware products. The company also owns a synchronized operating system for embedded products, Wind River. Intel also has an AppUp application store that can help app developers in selling their applications designed for mobile devices as well as PCs.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1368215822376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:57:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368215993986-100</Id><Topic><Title>Crime rate in Chicago with tight gun restrictions is about the worst in the nation</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1368195056859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:10:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did Romney do?

Lose 10% in value to gain 4% in dividends. Ok, I repeated it while owning INTC at $21.14 to be exact at the time. Everytime I said 4% dividend, the stock went up 4% itself. So I said it three times like you said, and the stock went up 4% each time. I didn't lose 10% in value so far like you said I would, but gained over 12%. And the quarterly dividend was a nice little bonus. So I decided to say it for a fourth time, and low and behold we are about to gain another 4% on the stock as it reaches $24.75.

Funny thing is the Stock market loves him and is making new records almost daily now. Did you happen to know that Dallas voted for him. Houston voted for him, San Antonio voted for hit too. In fact, every major city in the Nation was won by the President.

This new technology targets tablets, smartphones, microservers, network infrastructure products, storage and other areas such as entry-level laptops and in-vehicle infotainment. Silvermont sports 5x lower power consumption over current-generation Intel Atom processor cores in terms of its energy efficiency rating. The new chip microarchitecture also (unsurprisingly) represents a boost in terms of performance as it sits in Intel's 22nm (nanometre) Tri-Gate SoC process in terms of its engineering. Intel's Silvermont technology is aimed at low-power requirements in market segments from smartphones to the datacentre. Web application developers may have their interest piqued here as Silvermont-powered microservers could be used to serve HTML web page components to millions of users. "Silvermont is a leap forward and an entirely new technology foundation for the future that will address a broad range of products and market segments," said Dadi Perlmutter, Intel executive vice president and chief product officer. "Early sampling of our 22nm SoCs, including "Bay Trail" and "Avoton" is already garnering positive feedback from our customers. Going forward, we will accelerate future generations of this low-power microarchitecture on a yearly cadence."</Msg><Username>fourteennanometer</Username><Timestamp>1368234662454</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:11:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368234690484-139</Id><Topic><Title>Silvermont offers three times the performance and is as much as five times more power- efficient</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367862637252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:50:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Every investor should understand the significance of Silvermont</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368234690484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:11:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368234731330-140</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf: Intel Drops An Atomic Bomb On ARM's 'Abomination'</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367878857308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's new Atom is the bomb</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368234731330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:12:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368234767077-141</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's baseband inside Galaxy S4 (Exynos Octa)</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1367883875196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:44:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>next year 2014, will be the year Intel takes the smartphone market by storm</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1368234767077</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:12:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368234820496-142</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo k900: Rumor has it the 5.5-incher will look to take the whole Asian continent by storm</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367871232557</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:13:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kobe Bryant is promoting the k900.
