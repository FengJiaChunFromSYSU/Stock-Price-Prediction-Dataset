From the article "Is Samsung Making a Team to Rout Apple?": "Microsoft’s software still plays a big role in the business and consumer worlds. Tablets that can run Windows software thus hold a particular advantage. Being able to run Android apps just adds frosting to the cake, because Google has a far more massive library of mobile apps than Microsoft does. The expanded capabilities along with the more recognizable brand of processors could help all these companies push back against Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-sustained dominance in the tablet market." "The blend of Android and Windows could even turn the tides in the smart-device war. Recently, Asustek showed off its own device that was capable of running both Windows 8 and Android. The new crossover tablets may put up a strong fight against Apple and do damage to the dominance of the ARM chip designs in the mobile market." "Samsung will also make a few traditional PCs using Intel and AMD chips. It’s not clear if any of the AMD chips will find their way into Samsung mobile devices though, so the company may not benefit quite as much as Intel. Microsoft and Intel are sure to benefit from the increased support and exposure, putting Apple in a difficult position, as it now has some of its greatest rivals — Samsung, Google, and Microsoft — all gathering together in opposition."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371969237226</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 02:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371977854718-5</Id><Title>Two dishonest derivative large players; one not US</Title><Msg>Look at the tell signs on both the NASDAQ/NYSE.

Intel doesn't own or control the broadband transport the consumer needs to get the service. The service does not leverage Intel's fabs or chip making expertise. Video streaming technology is a commodity available to any startup that wants to enter the business. Interfaces are easily built, and if user interface was the determining factor of success for delivering live TV Apple or Google would have already done it. Cable operators are streaming video content already and there is nothing Intel can bring to them at the service level cable operators can't do for themselves.

After all, it offers two displays without disturbing the traditional laptop ‘clamshell’ design. It is almost nothing like traditional ultrabooks we have come to know and love in the past couple of years, and we mean that in the best possible way. The brushed aluminium unibody exterior of the ASUS Taichi lends it a premium look and feel, something that is matched only by the Samsung Series 9 ultrabook. The keyboard deck and the bottom panel are very well put together. However, the same doesn’t follow through completely for the lid, which has a tad too much glass because of the second display — housed on the opposite side of the inside screen. The hinge is quite taut, but you can’t risk applying too much pressure anywhere on the lid while holding the Taichi, for the fear of messing around with the device’s external display. Despite being built well for the most part, the ASUS Taichi demands delicate handling around its screen.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371997438770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:23:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371997514315-11</Id><Topic><Title>ASUS Taichi, twice as nice</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371997438770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:23:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Having said that, the dual display on the Taichi is quite neat, and offers a unique user experience. Once you have the Asus Utilities set up, you can set the display mode to either/or/both the 11.6-inch screens. Close the lid, and the second display automatically comes on, giving you a Windows 8 tablet experience. The primary display isn’t a touchscreen, but the one that sits in place of the lid is. It comes with a stylus as well, which is handy when you want to use certain apps and save handwritten notes directly on the secondary display. The full HD resolution does make the text a tad too small in default Windows mode, but re-adjusting font size to 125 per cent makes it comfortable for use. The screens reproduce text well with crisp, sharp words and a comfortable reading experience. HD videos look very good, too, and fast motion scenes are handled very smoothly. ASUS has mastered the art of packing in excellent keyboards in small spaces, like with the VivoBook, and the one on the Taichi is well spaced out with adequate travel allowing for quick typing and a comfortable typing experience. Performance from the Intel Core i7 processor is excellent, and though 4GB of RAM is a tad less for a machine costing over a lakh, it doesn’t create a bottle-neck performance-wise for business and style-savvy users as long as they aren’t planning to run the latest game or dabble into 3D animation or rendering tasks. The battery will last for four and a half hours with ease, with the screen brightness set at 60 per cent. You do pay a lot of money for the Taichi, and some may consider its price overkill, but for high net worth individuals and business executives looking to flaunt a unique ultrabook in the boardroom, the ASUS Taichi strikes a good balance between pure show-off value and overall usability.

Aviad Hevrony, the front end design manager for Intel Israel’s Cloverview team, Told the Times of Israel that Intel HQ counted on the 100-strong Israeli team to come up with a system on a chip (SoC) design that could be used in a lightweight tablet/convertible device — allowing use as a standard tablet, or attaching it to a keyboard for laptop-style use. Intel Israel delivered, he said, and the result is a big win for Samsung, which last week released its ATIV tablet line, the world’s thinnest tablet powered by Windows 8, with the ability to run Android apps. In an exclusive interview at Intel’s Jerusalem campus, Hevrony, along with other senior members of the engineering team, discussed the technical challenges involved in producing the system, their hopes for the future of Intel, and their pride at leading the company in what team members said could be a turning point in the tablet balance of power as Intel-powered tablets begin to present a formidable challenge to Apple, which still dominates the tablet market with its iPad line.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999080784-13</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple’s lead has been seen by many analysts as practically unchallengeable, but the Intel team believes that as the market gets to know the Samsung tablets better — along with the even faster, thinner, and more capable designs the company is working on — consumers will respond accordingly. Key to the development of tablets, netbooks, and light laptops are SoCs, the integrated circuits that use a single chip to provide most of the electronic, computing, memory, and basic software that a device needs to run. The SoC replaces individual chips, allowing devices to run with less energy, and enabling engineers to build smaller devices, since most of the chips that would otherwise be needed are replaced by the SoC. Intel Israel has been working on SoC systems for over four years, said Hevrony. “At first we started with netbooks, which were seen as the next big thing for the market. But a year later the iPad came out, so we realized we had to get into tablet design.” The team shifted gears and began to develop for tablets, using the new expanded Atom SoC standards developed by Intel to compete with others in the space. That standard was called Cloverview, and as the team began working on the design, Intel began shopping it around to vendors, among them the usual suspects in device production, including Acer, Lenovo, Asus and Samsung. The Cloverview and Cloverview Plus SoC, completed in 2012, is already being used in dozens of devices.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999080784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:51:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999143420-14</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But the toughest challenge was yet to come. Out of all the vendors, Samsung is probably the one that has its sights set highest, seeking to pose a real challenge to Apple. Encouraged by the positive market reception for its smartphones, Samsung has been seeking to unseat the iPad as the market leader — or at least pose a credible threat to it. Samsung released several tablets during 2012, all of which were lauded by critics but were not quite there just yet. With its newest tablets, though, Samsung believes it has a winner: A tablet that can not only run Android apps but works as a Windows laptop/netbook, as well. It was a great idea for Samsung and a great opportunity for Intel, which shopped its design to the Korean giant, winning the contract for the SoC. But in the SoC world, the more ambitious the promise made by top brass, the more of a challenge for the nuts-and-bolts engineers charged with fulfilling those promises. “The challenge was definitely a formidable one,” said Hevrony. “We had to come up with a fast SoC that ran at relatively low power, designing it from start to finish in less than two years. But even more challenging was the fact that we had to make it work with Windows, supporting hardware and software that a PC user would use.” This, in a sense, was the most difficult part of the equation, per instructions from Microsoft headquarters, said Roman Biberman, the team’s Cloverview pre-silicon verification lead. Last year, Microsoft released two versions of Windows — 8 and RT — and while the adoption rate (the number of customers migrating from previous versions of Windows) for the former has not been great, critics have slammed the latter for its lack of support for legacy hardware and software.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999143420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:52:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999182737-15</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“When we say that our SoC can run Windows 8, that implies it can do everything Windows 8 can do, supporting everything the operating system supports, even on a computer,” said Biberman. “We had to check for even relatively rare use cases — such as using a USB headphone that connects to a USB hub.” You might not think you’d need that for a device that has a standard 3.5 mm audio jack compatible with all standard headphones, as well as Bluetooth capabilities to allow Bluetooth headphone use — but the team needed to test for that, regardless. “If it has the Windows symbol on it, you have to support all peripherals,” said Alex Gruzman, the Cloverview team’s head of infrastructure and design automation. Supporting those peripherals also required a rethink of power management, usually the bane of small devices. The more a device can do, the more power it requires, and the bigger a battery is needed, but the bigger the battery, the heavier and thicker the device is. That wasn’t an option, as Samsung and other vendors using Cloverview were searching for a lighter option than the iPad. The only way around that is to optimize power management — meaning to efficiently allocate the power that the device’s battery provides in a way that will maximize the time the device can be used. Intel, as well as other companies, has been working on power management for devices for a long time, and the Israel team was able to leverage previous advances (such as those in the Medfield devices, the system used in devices before the release of Cloverview) to maximize power use in the new system.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999182737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999226600-16</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But since the Windows world is so vast, said Gruzman, the team had to be very careful in its power management work. “Basically we had to come up with a reference design for vendors that would support everything, and combinations of everything,” he said. “Vendors don’t know what the customers are going to do with their devices, and they may decide not to support all uses, peripherals, or behaviors, but from our point of view we had to be ready for all possibilities.” The result, said Hevrony, was a system that the team could be very proud of, and one that Samsung chose over the alternatives, such as the chips from Qualcomm and Marvell based on designs from ARM (Advanced Risc Machines) that have been used in a plethora of phones and devices. “Some analysts are saying that the use of an Intel SoC constitutes the beginning of an ‘alliance’ between Samsung and Intel against Apple,” said Hevrony. “As an engineer I of course can’t comment on that, but as the new tablets are a flagship product for Samsung, it seems to me that this was an important decision for them.” And the fact that Intel Israel was the lead for the development of the SoC shows the confidence of the home office in the local talent. “The development was not solely Israeli; other teams, especially in Bangalore India and Austin Texas, were deeply involved,” said Hevrony. For example, he said, verification was handled in Israel in the lab headed by Rani Ayalon, pre-silicon verification manager, but the validation was done in Bangalore, under the direction of Avshalom Mizrahi, head of validation in Israel.</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999226600</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999249118-17</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“In this project especially there were no borders,” said Gruzman. “We did a lot of traveling between offices, and there was a good feeling of family between all of us.” But the imprimatur of the Israeli team is clearly there, said Hevrony. “We are global citizens of Intel, but we are also very proud to strengthen Intel Israel, and especially Intel Jerusalem. We have some 600 workers here in all the departments, and the more successful we are, the better it reflects on all of us here.” And the system has indeed been successful so far. “I have yet to read a negative review of our SoC,” said Hevrony. “Everyone seems to like the new Samsung devices. We worked hard, put in a lot of late nights, but in the end we accomplished what we set out to do, on schedule. It’s not just about technology — it’s about people power, the capable and intelligent team we have here that may just have helped bring about a revolution in the tablet market.”</Msg><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999249118</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371999865267-18</Id><Topic><Title>Intel catching up fast in Tablet Market (Samsung)</Title><Username>onemanshillshow</Username><Timestamp>1371999033394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 10:50:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read the article, idiot.

Waldo thinks a net loss holding INTC over the last year beats a hold of ARMH for a 10.00 gain on 25 in a year. Three years, at least, of non stop INTC pumping, and INTC's up a whopping .19 since the idiotic call that anyone who owned INTC at 24 in June 2010 would be fine in 6 months, right before it dropped to the 17's.. Way back then, ARMH was 12.50. But congrats Waldo, in bizarro world, a gain of .19 beats a gain of 22.50 over 3 years everytime.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1372001895816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 11:38:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372003325533-26</Id><Topic><Title>500 Million PCs Forecasted To Ship In 2013 On Surging Tablet Sales</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1371088618231</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:56:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An Intel spokesperson said it best a few weeks ago: Intel is not a PC company-Intel is a CPU company.

The informed take is that its a buying opportunity. Certainly with Intel that's the case. We know that the new Samsung ATIV Intel products are making a big splash and are another important benchmark for Intel and Intel's relationship with Samsung. It appears that Samsung has every intention of using Intel's technology to go one up on Apple. The Samsung retina display feature leaves Apple in the unusual but growing more usual case of playing catch-up. We know that Intel is working on an iWatch and we expect to find out with whom and when by the end of the year. We know that Intel continues to plug away with the Web TV project and we expect it to roll-out by the end of the year. We know that the case for the tipping point with ARM having been reached grows stronger daily and that Intel deserves a much, much higher P/E ratio and stock price. And we know that everyone will be watching ARM closely this week to see if the average (from the last 5 weeks) $2.80 weekly drop will continue...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372016757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 15:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372016897751-59</Id><Title>2013 Retina MacBook Pro with Intel Haswell Benchmark Teases Fall Release Date</Title><Msg>Apple trying to keep up with Samsung.

Look at Intel Viiv, Intel Web Hosting, Intel Supercomputers, Intel videoconferencing. This is just a small sample of efforts Intel killed and they all had products launched and all had more synergy with Intel's core business than live TV streaming. There's another questionable aspect of Huggers' comments about potential partnerships with MSOs. So far it's only Huggers saying it. Not a single top five cable company has said they want a partnership with Intel.

It might not seem likely but neither did the fifteen dollar decrease over the last 37 days. What has produced this hugely dramatic change? Increased perception of competition from Intel is quickly eroding ARM's P/E ratio. That's what. Why hasn't Intel's P/E gone up dramatically? It would only make sense. Well, you would have to ask the statistically-challenged analysts at Wall Street's largest firms. They seem to be totally unaware that the tipping point and the end of the ARM era have arrived.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372022656536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:24:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372023234871-64</Id><Topic><Title>ARM/Intel Stock Price Differential Facts - The Last 37 Days</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372022656536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your differential will be negative soon.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1372023234871</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:33:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372023991871-65</Id><Topic><Title>Variety: Intel Staffing Up Call Center for Internet Cable TV Service</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371948349108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:45:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it is you that have no objectivity.

In a keynote at the Intel Developer Forum in Taiwan, Anand Chandrasekher Intel's senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Ultra Mobility Group said that technology innovation would be the catalyst for new user experiences, industry collaborations and business models that together will shape the next 40 years. He said, "As the next billion people connect to and experience the Internet, significant opportunities lie in the power of technology and the development of purpose-built devices that deliver more targeted computing needs and experiences." Chandrasekher cited the Intel Atom processor, the upcoming Nehalem processor, and the upcoming Moorestown platform (scheduled for release in the 2009-2010 timeframe) as prime examples of such innovation.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1372032551796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 20:09:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372034945467-71</Id><Topic><Title>ARM/Intel Stock Price Differential Facts - The Last 37 Days</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372022656536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"your differential will be negative soon."

The product will enable an enterprise's data center to process a big data workload. In this article, I will explain how the rise in the global data center IP traffic will enable Intel to increase its data center group revenues by 2% with the new product. This factor will enable Intel to improve its price multiples. Why will the company accomplish the feat? The global data center IP traffic is showing a growth. According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, the worldwide data center IP traffic will quadruple over the next five years. Consequently, a data center will need the solution capable of processing a big data workload. Intel will benefit because its new product has the capacity to cope with this requirement. This will translate to an increase in revenue for its data center group and improved price multiples. Financial Intel's sales growth is inevitable. Its data center group is well-positioned to know the apt solution in a data center setting. This accounts for its revenue growth on a year-on-year basis in 2012. In the full-year results, the group reported revenue of $10.7 billion, up 6% from 2011. In the fourth quarter, the data center group reported revenue of $2.8 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 4% on a year-on-year basis. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the data center group reported revenue of $2.6 billion, up 7.5% compared to same period in 2012. Intel And The Big Data Development Intel has carried out a number of initiatives to strengthen its data center group over the past few years. It created the Intel Distribution for Apache Hadoop to provide a data management solution for any enterprise application that analyzes a massive amount of a diverse data. Intel collaborated with Dell and Revolution Analytics to establish the Big Data Innovation Center in Singapore.
