And since the set-top box will have a WiDi receiver, you can use your WiDi enabled smartphone, tablet or PC to watch stuff from the internet on your TV....ie. Netflix or youtube. Plus WiDi will allow for a new breed of smartphone and tablet apps and games that allow you to interact with your TV. For example, apps that allow you to pick and choose shows to record or games that use your smartphone as a controller.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363147636844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 00:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363147999210-2</Id><Topic><Title>I think Intel Web TV service will be a huge hit</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363147636844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 00:07:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plus, with WiDi, you can watch Live tv from any device connected to your home network.

If they make inroads in any or all these markets, their revenue can easily double from what they are now. As for their traditional markets: Server market continue to increase as more and more devices get connected and more servers are needed to serve them. PCs may have slowed down due to introduction of tablets, but they will be making a comeback due to Windows 8 (and Chromebook OS) and introduction of touch. This, plus the fact that newer PCs are hybrids (act as both tablet and laptop form factor) giving them a much better value proposition...why buy 2 devices when you can buy one and have the best of both worlds? Furthermore, Intel is beginning to enter the 7" tablet and phalet market eg.

It's a good thing Intel's future isn't dependent on this product. For your first claim to be true the consumer must already be paying for cable Internet service or equivalent from Verizon FIOS. If the consumer has an HDTV package from their cable company they can already watch live TV. Intel's Web TV doesn't offer a la carte selection of programming nor does it lower the cost of content to the consumer. It may offer several options of bundled programming but the cost to the consumer isn't expected to be any less than what they already pay the cable company. WiDi uses a short range wireless technology to deliver video to another device in the same room - but not to other rooms in the house. There is a noticeable delay from the time the material is displayed on the source device and the WIDI client. The delay makes it less useful for applications sensitive to timing and interactivity. Intel Web TV can't compete against Netflix or most other movie streaming services in affordability because the movie streaming services are already built into most Smart TV's and virtually every DVD player already, while consumers have to go buy another box for the Intel service. Further, Netflix starts at about $8.00 a month and the Internet service will cost just as much as the cable's HDTV package. Those typically start at about $80 a month and more. I also note you failed to mention the reasons why consumers won't even consider putting that device in their home and that is the built-in camera designed to turn the occupant's privacy &amp; behaviorial profile into a revenue stream for sale to third parties. Intel is #$%$ a lot of things right, especially in CPU's and SoC's for mobility. However, Intel's Web TV is misguided and presently on a trajectory for failure.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1363180768376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:19:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363181109149-18</Id><Title>bacbacker is Wallisweaver flooding the board</Title><Msg>Shameless/Gutless.</Msg><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363181109149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:25:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363181157847-19</Id><Title>PEIX ---- in play</Title><Msg>just in time for the growth train</Msg><Username>nxb_gal</Username><Timestamp>1363181157847</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:25:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363181633670-20</Id><Topic><Title>bacbacker is Wallisweaver flooding the board</Title><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363181109149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:25:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally or Ashraf.

The Intel SSD's will command a premium for some time to come. SSD performance has historically degraded over time as the wear algorithms redistribute data on the drives. The Intel SSD drive wear algorithm has been designed for constant access over time. High end servers will pay a premium for this performance. Intel will not be as attracitve in the retail market because of the pricing. Why do servers pay a premium? The expensive servers are priced on their performance. The performance metrics they use are typically database application benchmarks like the TPC results which have to run steady state for long periods of time. If the system performance degrades because of the SSDs, then the vendor will have to add drives (and cost) the equivalent system. Intel SSD = extra server system performance = lower server cost (not price) and higher server profit.

First Intel helps control the ARM market then they promote newer Intel technology to their current ARM customers. You can think of it when larger retailer A buys smaller retailer B. Of course they say that retailer B has a long history in the community and they would never close it, lay off employees, etc. Then a few years later they close down stores, lay off employees and change the name of retailer B to retailer A. Happens all the time. Intel may look like any other ARM FAB, for now. Intel will enter the low end mobile market by using ARM's own technology to leverage position in the marketplace.

AnandTech seems to be a fairly impartial and technially compentent organization. They point out that they have compared an ARM cluster (780W power supply) with a Xeon Sandy Bridge Supermicro server (1280W power supply). SInce they measured the power consumption at the wall, they are really comparing a Supermicro server design with a newly designed cluster optimized for low power. What this means is that there will follow up comparisons where the measurements are refined or more comparable systems are used. I was surprised at the high price of the ARM cluster until I got to the part about using SSD drives. They are removed for the test but that is the reason for the big price difference.

' More like intellectual laziness ;-) ' It's why the MIPS multithreaded cores weren't big sellers.' Disagree, there as many MIPS chips produced each year as there are x86 all without an entrenched captive market like x86. No way in hell would that many be produced if advanced features like 64-bit and multi-way multi-threading were not there to counter the considerable financial and software support that both x86 and ARM enjoy. 'I suggest you read up on the ARM64 bit ISA.' wwwDOTrealworldtechDOTcom/arm64/2/ "The one surprise in ARMv8, is the omission of any explicit support for multi-threading. Nearly every other major architecture, x86, MIPS, SPARC, and Power has support for multi-threading and at least one or two multi-threaded implementations. While initially billed as a technique for servers, it is helpful for a variety of software. However, multi-threading is very difficult to validate, and the engineers at ARM may have simply felt that handling the transition to a 64-bit architecture was challenging enough. Certainly, should the lack of multi-threading become a significant competitive disadvantage, it can be added in the future."</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1363192534449</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 12:35:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363192878293-71</Id><Topic><Title>Calxeda's ARM server tested</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363183120879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you Marsavian, So what then prevents another company from building a multi-threaded CPU ??

After all Intel would in effect be admitting that at the current time they don't have something ready to go to market that is better than ARM. In effect Intel would be just another ARM FAB which was something Lucy predicted a couple of years ago. Since you brought up the stock price of ARMH here's how stocks work. There is a P/E ratio (price/earnings). Intel floats around between 10-15%. Currently Intel's is in the low 10 What this means is that stock is selling at ten times it's annual earnings. ARMH on the other hand is selling at 74.32 (and falling). The higher P/E ratio means that the stock market believes that in the future the stock is going to be more valuable than it is right now, thus the premium. Intel fabbing ARM is like the 62 year old man offering an 8 year old girl a ride home from school on a hot day. It may look like a kind gesture, but to his parole officer it doesn't. he know's he's a child molester and what he's up to. Institutional investors know exactly what Intel is up to and how this may affect the earning stream of ARMH. They know that long term Intel won't fab ARM. It would just be a stopgap measure to get orders going in the factory until something better comes along from Intel.

Yes, but they need to build on their strength rather than get distracted with a project that tries to make a business model selling-off consumer's privacy to the highest bidder. Today nearly all Smart TV's today use ARM chips. The very first thing Intel needs to do is leverage the performance of its new Atom chips (Clovertrail Plus) to convince TV and DVD makers to put Atom chips inside their devices instead of those from ARM. There are a lot of reasons device makers may want to make the switch. Intel's chip performance is a big benefit because even new Smart TV's are too slow to be really useful. Because of this only about 15% of people who own Smart TV's even use the Smart TV feature. If Intel gets its chips inside TV's, DVD players and related devices it can offer many of the benefits reportedly available in Intel's Web TV box but without the extra box, the extra cost and without spying on anyone.

Nokia did the same thing last year to raise $220 million and the phone maker and former rubber boot manufacturer is another one which is not doing too well. Last year Bernstein Research‘s Stacy Rasgon called AMD “un-investable,” following the announcement of its terrible Q3 2012 numbers and the sudden loss of its CFO. Michael Silverman, an AMD spokesperson, told Ars Technica that things were not as bad as all that. There had been all sorts of good things happening at AMD in the six months including the recently announced Sony Playstation 4 APU semi-custom part win, the Richland mobile APU part and lots of other good announcements. He did not explain why the outfit still had to flog its buildings if life was so great.

The report was published on Chinese tech site QQ Tech. If we compare with its predecessor Z2460, Intel’s new hyperthreading, dual-core processor, is said to be faster with doubled performance in computing and tripled in graphic. This will not have an effect on battery life, which will maintain its competitive standards. This hugely profitable collaboration between ZTE and Intel was established especially by the steady expansion of ZTE in the European market. The very first phone from ZTE, the Grand X IN, was roped in a lot of revenue as it was the best selling Android phone in Austria. The smartphone has also hit the shelves in other EU countries such as Germany,Poland,Hungary,Romania,Greece,Sweden, and Norway, among others. Ao Wen, general manager of ZTE’s Europe mobile unit has stated that Grand X IN was the top-end product of ZTE in Europe and the company has successfully managed to introduce the model due to their tie-up with Intel. He further added that future cooperation with Intel is definitely on the cards and that Intel will continue to lend support for ZTE’s development in the high-end smartphone market. Hendrik Unkel, Intel’s marketing and business development director is also quite positive about the collaboration between the two companies. He said that this venture with Intel has led to a positive impact on Intel’s newly designed smartphone processors. High performance, competitive battery life, along with their whole brand value will be recognized by the customers.

No way in hell would that many be produced if advanced features like 64-bit and multi-way multi-threading were not there to counter the considerable financial and software support that both x86 and ARM enjoy. ---- I was talking about MIPS (the company) own threaded cores (all 32bit). These went up against ARM's cores at the time and MIPS's own single threaded designs from the same family and the fact is that they weren't big sellers. Why? The cost (die area/power and licence/royalty fees) didn't justify the real world benefits for many work loads. The 64 bit MIPS cores are a different breed, and designed for specific workloads (such as networking) but not of these are from MIPS (the company). ---- wwwDOTrealworldtechDOTcom/arm64/2/ "The one surprise in ARMv8, is the omission of any explicit support for multi-threading. ---- Has to be said, the article is a good read (although I did spot some other errors) but the author is confusing implementation of an ISA to the ISA itself.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363206558773</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 16:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363207883934-115</Id><Topic><Title>Calxeda's ARM server tested</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363183120879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How... ??

The fact is, NONE of the ARM server guys are going toe to toe with Intel on a CPU V CPU basis. In other words any workload that is remotely CPU bound is going to remain in Intel's hands. For IO bound work loads, it's a different matter. If the IO interfaces stay the same it doesn't matter how good Intel's CPU design is, or what node (22, 14, 10 etc) the CPU is built on, the CPU is still bound by that IO interface. This Calxeda server is all about the IO bandwidth on a single node NOT the ARM CPU. This is the ARM Server story - the IO fabric all on the SoC. To answer the question directly. There is nothing in the 32bit or 64bit ISA that stops a (hardware) multi threaded design. As a side, there is nothing stopping someone adding their own instructions to the ARM ISA something that Marvel has already done for some of it's designs.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1363207883934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 16:51:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363207931400-116</Id><Topic><Title>Calxeda's ARM server tested</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363183120879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His statement is strictly correct.

Intel's next-generation Haswell chips are already in the hands of system builders and could be launched within the next month, sources have told PC Pro. An executive within British system builder, Boston, told PC Pro that one of its suppliers already has processors based on Haswell, the successor to Intel's Ivy Bridge platform. Reports had suggested that Intel would officially unveil the Haswell processors at the Computex trade show in Taiwan at the beginning of June. However, a separate source has suggested that the processors could be made available sooner, possibly as early as next month. Intel famously builds processors to a "tick-tock" schedule, where a "tick" represents a shift to a new, smaller manufacturing process, and a "tock" is a new architecture built on an existing, proven manufacturing process. Haswell is a "tock", using the same 22nm process as last year's Ivy Bridge processors, but with big improvements to energy efficiency and integrated GPU performance. Intel also expects the coming generation of PCs to bring increased support for its Thunderbolt interconnect technology, with Intel's director of marketing for Thunderbolt, Jason Ziller, looking forward to a "significant ramp" in the number of systems shipping with Thunderbolt ports.

According to IHS, the significant inventory reduction is a welcome sign after inventories reached worrisome heights in the third quarter of last year. "Semiconductor companies reduced their inventories at a faster-than-expected rate in the fourth quarter as they moved to adjust to weakening demand," said Sharon Stiefel, analyst for semiconductor market intelligence at IHS, in a statement. "Many chip suppliers demonstrated great agility in their reactions to the drop in demand. No. 1 semiconductor supplier Intel Corp. was the most aggressive, cutting its stockpiles by more than half a billion dollars—the largest decrease on a dollar basis of any chipmaker." Days of inventory (DOI) held by chip suppliers decreased by 5 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the third. IHS's inventory supply report had predicted inventories would decline by 1.5 percent. Inventory value in dollar terms fell almost 5 percent, larger than the originally projected 3 percent, IHS said Among the chip suppliers that reduced inventories between the third and fourth quarters, the percentage decrease ranged from 5 to 25 percent, IHS said. As a result, each of these companies shaved $60 million to $600 million worth of inventory off of their stockpile, according to IHS. Some companies, however, increased inventories over the same period, IHS said. But the increase in inventories at these companies was generally smaller—between $40 million and $250 million. Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) decreased its inventory stockpile by $585 million during the fourth quarter, or about 11 percent, IHS said. Intel made aggressive moves to cut stockpiles and reduced production as it migrated to 14-nm process technology, IHS said.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363213739280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 18:28:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363214046485-136</Id><Topic><Title>Secret INTC Info REVEALED!</Title><Username>timothy.maldonaldo</Username><Timestamp>1363184916481</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 10:28:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome report, thanks a lot!</Msg><Username>bradleyjames965</Username><Timestamp>1363214046485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 18:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363214671720-137</Id><Topic><Title>I think Intel Web TV service will be a huge hit</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363147636844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 00:07:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that you Gene?</Msg><Username>bhy11141</Username><Timestamp>1363214671720</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 18:44:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363215770092-138</Id><Topic><Title>Calxeda's ARM server tested</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363183120879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 09:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Fact is ARM based servers are shipping" [Gee, wouldn't it be great if they were selling?
