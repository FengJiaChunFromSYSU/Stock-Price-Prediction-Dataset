Over the past four years, R&amp;D expenditures have increased year over year at an average rate of 21.61%, and dividends at an average of 15%. Revenues were flat from 2011 to 2012, and while there was positive cash flow in 2012 compared to 2011 this is only because the Board sliced the rate of stock buybacks by two thirds (from 2011 14,340 to 2012 5,110). And page 23 shows that the 2011 avg repurchased share cost more than the stock currently trades for... so cash has increased, but only because the BOD stopped reducing the shares outstanding via an authorized buyback which was a stupid move in the first place. They bought stock when it was high and not undervalued (by the market). If the trend continues, and the gross margins fall from the current levels, and sales don't materialize fast, there is a possible cash crunch. Mgt has bet the farm on their abiity to exploit Moores law. They won that bet. But revenue (and cash) only comes with sales, and the sales have to materialize... there is too much uncertainty...

Next up: The Samsung Event next Thursday Lots and lots of product announcements and reviews starting to come in. Some great deals out there. We hear about the great Intel roadmap every day. ARM seems to be keeping quiet about its roadmap or lack thereof. The bright spot of the Apple event this week was provided by the Mac Intel upgrades. Intel 14nm FinFET volume production is due in six months. This means, due to the development cycle, that deals have already been signed and undoubtedly more are being discussed.

ABI Research concluded that Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) has succeeded in reducing significantly the power consumption of its smartphone application processor and it now rivals and is often lower than equivalents based on the ARM architecture licensed from ARM Holdings plc (Cambridge, England). Since high-end smartphones require this level of performance ABI said it considers Intel is "well positioned for strong growth over the next few years."

The concept was so far off the road of rational thought that if mentioned in out loud, the response from industry insiders would be public ridicule. Time and technology advances change things. Some review: Until the ARM (ARMH) based mobile business exploded on the scene, virtually all memory, both DRAM and NAND, was used with Intel or AMD x86 microprocessors. It would be fair to say that the Intel x86 microprocessor family spawned the memory business as we know it today. Since bits (ones and zeros) are the ultimate commodity, it didn't take long for memory to establish a boom-bust business cycle with the bust cycles generating negative gross margins. In that environment, Intel wisely exited the memory business. Memory, however, is essential to microprocessor based systems of all types. Microprocessor technology and performance has outrun the ability of memory to keep up, and the microprocessors have run into what is called the "memory wall," which is where further performance progress in microprocessors is impossible without fundamental change in how memory interfaces with the processor and the physical proximity of the memory to the processor. One of the ways to blast through the memory wall would be to integrate the DRAM on the CPU chip. The problem with that is the chip would become so large as to be impossible to manufacture in commercial volumes. So, we continue with memory modules mounted on a mother board some distance from the CPU chip A few years ago, microprocessors consumed as much power as a 100 watt light bulb. Getting rid of that heat was the problem of the time. At about that time, the mainstream DRAM chip was 1Gb. It took 32 of those chips to get the standard 4GB used in PCs. Also at that time, the mainstream NAND memory was about 32Gb. It would have taken 32 of those chips to make a 128GB solid state drive and the cost was astronomical.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371342961740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:36:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371343015572-75</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Does The Memory Business Make Sense?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371342961740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, we have continued with the PC structure of today; a separate CPU in a package, DRAM memory modules external to the CPU and mass storage is still in power hungry, fragile hard disc drives, but we are nearing a tipping point. Today we find that the Intel Haswell CPU chip only consumes about five watts of power. For the same number of transistors, the CPU chip would be 1/8 the size of the chip of, say, 2007. The chip didn't actually shrink that much since the smaller transistors allowed for many more of them in the name of increased function and performance. For example, the Ivy Bridge didn't shrink as much as it could have, moving to 22nm, because Intel added over 400 million transistors to the graphics section. DRAM memory chips have gone through the same shrinking process and now contain 4Gb on the same size and cost chip of the 1Gb chip of 2007. Now it takes eight chips to make that 4GB of PC memory. NAND, of course, has not been left behind. The density is up to 128Gb (yes, that is 128 billion bits), so that a 128GB solid state drive can be built from 8 chips. Solid state drives have become a reality. Most of the Apple (AAPL) Mac product line uses SSDs as standard equipment. The benefits of SSDs are many; low power, low weight, fast boot, high reliability (no head crashes), light weight, much, much higher performance. Okay, so far we have the progress in low power x86 processors (code named Haswell), we have the predictable reduction in size and cost of both DRAM and NAND memory, we have the acceptance and volume use of solid state drives. What else is required for Intel to capture the semiconductor revenue involved in the DRAM and SSD? The obvious barrier is that both the DRAM and SSD would have to reside in the CPU package in order to achieve the performance and power benefits discussed above. All of the memory devices laid out in chip form would be nearly 4sq. in of silicon, far too big for inclusion in the CPU package.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371343015572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:36:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371343061446-76</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Does The Memory Business Make Sense?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371342961740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The answer to the problem is what is called chip stacking. Sounds easy enough, but in reality chip stacking is a difficult technology. The leading methodology is something called TSV (Through Silicon Via). This means the chips are designed to have holes in them in precisely the same place for vertical alignment. With today's technology, it would involve stacking eight DRAM or NAND chips producing, in the case of NAND, a 128GB solid state drive in the footprint of a single NAND chip, or about .3 sq. in. in the case of DRAM, an eight chip stack would result in a 4GB DRAM module with a footprint of about .1 sq. in. The Haswell processor itself would require another .3 sq. in. The total area required for processor, SSD, and DRAM would be .7 sq. in. Many CPU packages are 1 sq. in or more in area, so the chip stacking would make it possible for Intel to make all the major silicon components of a PC and package them in the CPU package safely hidden away from the crazy competition that has characterized the memory industry throughout its history. In the real world, an eight layer IC stack is a big problem, however, both DRAM and NAND are likely to go through one more shrink, which would double the density and bring both stacks down to a four level height. Four layers would be much easier to build and have higher yield and therefore, be less expensive. Hynix (HXSCF.PK) has already introduced an 8Gb DRAM chip and anything that Hynix can do, Intel can do better. NAND technology will also extend to a 256Gb chip that would enable a four chip stack, 128GB SSD the size of my thumb nail. So the predictable advance of technology has progressed from the point of, "no way" in regard to Intel re-entering the memory business to, "OK, I can begin to see the business rationale from here." The time from a technology "no way" to "OK" has taken about six years of evolutionary improvement.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371343061446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:37:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371343110346-77</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: Does The Memory Business Make Sense?</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371342961740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The key here is the TSV technology. So, where does Intel stand on TSV technology? Twenty-one months ago, Intel demonstrated a Hybrid Memory Cube that was a joint development of Intel and Micron (MU) and based on TSV chip stacking. The HMC is a commercial product. To demonstrate the power of chip stacking, the HMC exhibits 15 times the bandwidth (speed) of current DRAM modules, thus smashing through the "memory wall", and it does this at 30% lower power per bit. So, all of the technology and pieces exist today for Intel to produce a "Compute Module" that would triple the Intel dollar take on each PC. The big question is, "Can they do it profitably?" The in-package 128GB SSD could add no more than $100 to the PC price. Using depreciated 22nm fabs, an Intel 300mm wafer would cost $2000 to produce and have to sell for $5000 in order to maintain the 60% gross margins that we have come to expect from Intel. With the last shrink of NAND, mentioned above, the total silicon area of a 128GB SSD (four 256Gb chips) would be about 1.25 sq. in. About 70 such SSDs could be made from one 300mm wafer. 70 times $100 equals $7000 per wafer, far more than the $5000 target, thus leaving room for added packaging cost and yield loss on a difficult technology. The DRAM stack would require about .37 sq. in of silicon. Given the huge improvement in power and performance, that integrated memory stack should be worth $35 vs. the $25 of memory modules of today. One wafer should produce about 230 of those memory stacks for a wafer revenue of $8000, again far above the $5000 target for 60% gross margins. So, the technology has progressed to the point of feasiblity and it looks like Intel could make serious money on the memory demand that is driven by its processors. So where is the capacity? Intel is operating nine wafer fab facilities currently and is running at less than 50% of capacity.

Later this year, Fab 42 and D1X will ramp 14nm technology. Those fabs are so large that they could handle all of the PC, server, and all the mobile SoCs that will be used on earth for the foreseeable future. When those new fabs come on line, Intel will have about 6 million wafers worth of unutilized, depreciated fab capacity. That is almost exactly the capacity required to manufacture the amount of memory discussed above. Of course, I can't claim that this is the future Intel business plan, but all the technology and profit pieces are in place if it should make the decision to re-enter a captive memory business. It is ironic that the original Intel business strategy, which was to use the proprietary x86 microprocessor to "persuade" customers to give it the high volume memory business in a package deal, could return. This time there would be no persuading, the processor would simply come with the memory "installed," kind of like and engine and transmission "installed" in a new car. When I can see a full business strategy cycle over 40 years, and it makes sense, I know I am getting too old. Source: Intel: Does The Memory Business Make Sense?

"The benchmarks were impressive but the real surprise was the current consumption recorded during the benchmarks;" ABI Research engineer VP Jim Mielke said when announcing the results, "the new processor not only outperformed the competition in performance but it did so with up to half the current drain."

What was of most interest, however, was that the Lenovo K900 hit its numbers using significantly less juice than did its two 5000-scoring Galaxy S 4 competitors. "Of the three," ABI writes, "Intel stood out with only 0.85A of average current vs. 1.38A for the Samsung Exynos Octa, and 1.79A for the Qualcomm APQ8064T." Mielke praised Intel and offered his opinion as to why the ARM chips sucked more power. "Intel did significant work to bring the current drain down on their well-recognized high-performance processors, but the competitors did not help themselves," he said. "The ARM architecture used by nearly all of Intel's competitors is well known for its low power performance but in bringing the processing power up closer to PC levels, the current drain has taken a significant hit." Earlier this month, The Reg had a conversation with Intel spokesman Bill Calder, who expressed high confidence in his company's ability to enter the smartphone market. "The myth that Intel will never be able to get power down low enough to get into phones is gone," he said. "That debate is over." If ABI Research's benchmark testing is to be trusted, Calder appears to be correct. Mielke suggested another reason as to why he believes Intel – after years of disappointing products such as Menlow, Moorestown, and Medfield – can become a true competitor in the smartphone market. "Combining the high-end modems (the XMM6360 is used in both the Lenovo K900 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 i9500) with their application processors for high- to mid-tier solutions and single-chip EDGE chips for low-cost phones makes Intel a rare full portfolio provider," he said.

MacBook Air products are ready to ship immediately. The move indicates that Apple and Intel’s relationship has become stronger, contrary to market speculations that the relationship is waning. In late 2012, Bloomberg had reported that Apple is internally designing an ARM-compatible processor to ditch Intel’s Core processor. At the time, the microprocessor giant was battered by slowing PC sales and pessimistic Q3 guidance. So, it was the preferred target of short-sellers. Anyway, now it’s official that MacBook Air will be powered by Intel Core processors. Apple has promised a day-long battery life and substantially improved graphics. Using Core processors in the device proves that Intel is making exactly the same standard of products that Apple expects for its MacBook line. It means Apple doesn’t see a need to internally develop a low power/high performance chip for MacBooks. Moreover, the most innovative product unveiled at WWDC, the revamped MacPro, will be equipped with Intel’s Ivy Bridge-based Xeon processors, which is considered the greatest product from Intel’s stable. Analysts say that MacPro badly needed an upgrade, and Apple’s focus on performance has fulfilled market expectations. Tim Cook is a genius. He knows that a lag in performance/watt and overall performance can hamper Apple’s market share. If the company can make a MacBook class of processor with unmatched performance, and still allow a day-long battery life, the iPad may be the next Apple product with Intel inside.
