(It's yahoo that should be shut down) If Intel hired a PR firm, the analysts would be all the more skeptical. There's just no winning, given the current level of hysteria. But the good news is that Intel finally has products that exist in the market, which they didn't have prior to these last few months. Before Medfield, there was nothing in Intel's portfolio that they could use for a smartphone, but now Intel has multiple phone designs in the market - and in Q1, Intel will refresh Medfield with the much more powerful CT+. Before Windows 8, there were no touch-optimized PCs or convertibles in the market, but now multiple models exist - and in Q2, Intel refreshes Ivy Bridge with Haswell. Before Clover Trail, Intel had nothing that could target mainstream tablets, but now they have a product - and in the second half of next year, Intel refreshes Clover Trail with the 22nm quad core Silvermont based Bay Trail. No PR firm is going to better articulate the success of these products more than end-user sales. Anand will have his reviews, people will talk about speeds and feeds, and advertisements on TV will be firing. Not much a PR firm can do on top of that. Talk is cheap, and spin is worse, so if that's what you're looking for, try AMD or Global Foundries, and they will sell it to you in spades. Meanwhile, Intel will deliver. They now have products in the market, and it's just a matter of time before they ramp, win designs, and iterate. And the more they do, the more it will leave the ARM guys in the dust, and there won't be anything left for the analysts to deny.</Msg><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1355653758942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 05:29:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355659332960-2</Id><Topic><Title>intc or amat- long term buy and hold</Title><Username>kleinmanstephen</Username><Timestamp>1355625749962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 21:42:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think INTC is the clear winner here. I dumped my AMAT a year ago and very glad I did so given the retreat to $11 and change. AMAT has exposure to solar, if that's what you're into. But it has a lower yield than INTC and a less well established record of dividend growth (they did go from $0.03 to $0.06 in 2005-07).

Both companies are still paying a dividend, that softens the blow while waiting for a stocks to run. The only way to make money these days is to buy stocks of great companies, while they are on sale. Even though chips are down it would be a hard sell to believe that the world will not be needing chips in the future. Both firms are investing in R&amp;D to get better products.

However, American tradition, dating back some 200 years or more largely states that personal problems dealing with children and teenagers are best left to the head of the household. Family problems stay in the family, the reality is that a great many American families have borderline disturbed personalities hiding in the family tree. I think this young man went quietly insane, perhaps a number of psychological problems contributed but at the end of the day whatever moral compass he had broke. Something in him broke and the separation between fantasy and reality was permanently erased. He finally, perhaps fueled by endorphins or drugs, who knows began a rampage that will forever stigmatize him in the annals of history.</Msg><Username>bbkenno</Username><Timestamp>1355664884057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 08:34:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355669439155-7</Id><Topic><Title>So off the fiscal cliff we go.

But, before the dust can even begin to settle on the new-processor-wielding computers, word of a new set of high-power processors has gotten out. A recently leaked document details a new lineup of Intel chips under the name “Haswell” that will be the immediate successors to the current Ivy Bridge chips. The chips will feature higher base frequencies, more threads, increased cache, and a host of other features that all equate to faster, more powerful desktops and mobile computers. And from the sound of it, Apple could be first in line to receive these processors after their expected release mid-2013. Our 20-page proprietary analysis of Apple’s stock is ready. Click here to get your Cheat Sheet report now. If Apple gets the chips, they are most likely to appear in the iMac all-in-one computers, which use the standard electrical power chips featuring the higher processor speeds than the mobile counterparts. While there is no set date for the release of the chips, or their integration into Apple computers, the future does look powerful.</Msg><Username>fvelezdevilla</Username><Timestamp>1355674202861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:10:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355677246434-13</Id><Title>seeking advice on intc long term investors</Title><Msg>seeking to start long term position in intc. with dividend reinvest. please advise if this is a good move</Msg><Username>kleinmanstephen</Username><Timestamp>1355677246434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 12:00:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355677983407-14</Id><Topic><Title>seeking advice on intc long term investors</Title><Username>kleinmanstephen</Username><Timestamp>1355677246434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 12:00:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a no brainer.

The energy-sipping, industrial-strength microprocessor features essential capabilities to achieve server-class reliability, manageability and cost effectiveness, said Intel. The Intel Atom S1200 product family is also compatible with the x86 software that is commonly used in data centers today. This enables easy integration of the new low-powered equipment and avoids additional investments in porting and maintaining new software stacks. Intel continues to drive power consumption down in its products, enabling systems to be as energy efficient as possible. Each year since the 2006 introduction of low-power Intel Xeon processors, Intel has delivered a new generation of low-power processors that have decreased the thermal design power (TDP) from 40W in 2006 to 17W in 2012 due to Intel's advanced 22nm process technology.

Taking a broader view of the segment, there is very little competition for Intel today. AMD continues its painful death spiral, and no other companies seem to have the capability of shipping products into the data center with scale. Nvidia is a peripheral bit player in HPC and has had some success but not enough to lessen its dependency on consumer and workstation discrete graphics for the foreseeable future. Now to be clear, I think competition in the data center is a good thing and sorely needed. Customers need it, and companies like Intel need it to make better products. But let’s face it, Microservers is not even that big of a market anyway, with only a handful of important customers like Facebook, Google and Amazon. If and when the ARM architecture makes it into the data center it has the prospect to offer this competition, but a lot of things need to happen and a number of questions need to be answered first.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355695093859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 16:58:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355695187371-26</Id><Topic><Title>Dis-ARMing the data center – Separating myth from reality</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355694988455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 16:56:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Firstly, ARM has to deliver its new architecture on time with its first ARM V8 implementations with Cortex A53 and A57. 64-bit computing is a baseline requirement to enter the space and today it is, unfortunately, MIA in ARM world.

While Cortex A15 is a tremendous new architecture it has largely limped out of the gate in 2012 and we won’t see the majority of designs until next year. Hopefully, for ARM’s sake V8 will have a smoother birth in 2014. Secondly, ARM will need to build an eco-system in record time. The server world is a complex one, driven by a broad eco-system of applications and workloads that have been optimized over many years to run exceptionally well on X86 processors. Moving these workloads over to a competing architecture is not a trivial matter, just look at the launch of Windows RT on the consumer side to see the pitfalls of lack of application compatibility and low performance. Management will also be a huge issue that needs to be addressed. A rather large number of companies have aspirations to participate in the ARM server market. Calxeda, Applied Micro, Samsung and AMD are all committed to bringing products to market in the coming years and more will follow. With the exception of AMD, very few of these companies have any real expertise in data center management which could be problematic as they try and convince enterprise IT executives to deploy a mixed environment of X86 and ARM.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355695271055</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 17:01:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355695402493-28</Id><Topic><Title>Dis-ARMing the data center – Separating myth from reality</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355694988455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 16:56:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This week, we’re going to see yet another media cycle around microservers as Intel prepares for the upcoming launch of Centerton, the firm’s first server class SoC for the data center.

Can Apple afford to go with TSMC and risk capacity issues in the future? The answer is obviously no. Would a dedicated fab using TSMC be a good investment? seems to me either they go with Intel or build a dedicated fab with TSMC.

TSMC's 20nm is designed for low power at the expense of Performance. Which means that ARM chips manufactured with TSMC will not have the Performance of an ATOM. Intel is in the drivers seat when it comes to Power and Performance. Thats why Apple will go with Intel. Better chips at a competitive price and reliable delivery. No one else can do this.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355719489702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:44:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
