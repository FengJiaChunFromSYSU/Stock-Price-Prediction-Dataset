Remember, for Intel, low power is not yet a cash cow. They have to focus most of their energy on PC client and server, both of which are predominantly high power. They're trying to give it a little more importance but its not where they earn their money from. At this rate, its highly likely that Intel will eventually more out of low power and concentrate solely on high power where they have an advantage.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1358835377581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 01:16:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358835648458-14</Id><Topic><Title>Don't forget about Intel's 4.25% Dividend...</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1358792485154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 13:21:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, yes.

"There are two reasons why Intel had a bad year leading into these results. The first is that guidance was progressively lowered over the year, partly because global GDP forecasts were reduced. To be fair to Intel there isn’t much it can do about that and it’s certainly not alone in having hoped for a better second half to 2012. The second reason is that there is a structural shift towards tablets and smartphones and away from PCs. Throw in the corporate drive towards desktop virtualization and it’s no surprise that PC sales are so weak." So 2012 was a bad year for Intel. Let's see the definition of bad. Is it the $12 Billion in net income? That net, which is after Intel pays the government its income taxes for its huge profits for the year. That's over $10 Billlion which used to be something investors were salivating over not too long ago. Or is it the 62% gross margin? How many other chip makers can say that? Wasn't it not too long ago when naysayers like Goldman Sachs mentioned that Intel cannot even maintain gross margins above the 50% mark? And what did Intel accomplish during 2012 other than its huge profits? It's chips are already in seven smartphone makers, two of which are huge. Lenovo and Motorola. It's chips are already in at least 20 tablets. It's chips are in hybrid ultrabooks that can replace the need for any tablets, which also seem to be flying off the shelves like hotcakes. Not bad at all for a bad year. As for its toughest competitor? ARM has managed to squeeze out total revenues for theyear of about $900 million. A whopping $900 million! And net earnings of about $320 million. WOW! WOW WOW WOW!!! What a great year for ARM. And it may get better for ARM in 2013. While ARM may increase its revenues to over $1 Billion for the year. Intel will only manage to squeeze out net profits, after paying taxes, of only a measly $1 Billion per month. Oh woe is Intel!</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358838056901</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 02:00:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358838897749-17</Id><Topic><Title>Wallis: regarding Intel based smartphones in U.S.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358781714683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for your thoughts.

In the historical world of past x86/Risc processors A15 is an ordinary performance processor. In the historical world of past Risc processors A15 is an ordinary performance/power processor. You will have to wait for X-Gene or A57 for your next great ARM flavored hope. ----- Clearly the A15 isn't a sparc or an alpha, but it has the highest performance numbers of any ARM core today. It has a genuine 40% IPC improvement over the A9 and a much improved memory subsystem giving it performance increases beyond the 40% IPC. The questions of die size and power consumption remain and we'll only know after a couple of iterations of SoC designs if the A15 is going to be a true power dog or not (the A9 and Krait both had power issues when first launched). As for the comparison with the 847, another set of benchmarks: Geekbench: Acer AO756, Intel Celeron 847 @ 1.10 GHz 1 processor, 2 cores: 2140 Integer Processor integer performance 1694 Floating Point Processor floating point performance 1840 Memory Memory performance 2779 Stream Memory bandwidth performance 3480 Samsung Nexus 10, ARM ARMv7 @ 1.70 GHz 1 processor, 2 cores:2494 Integer Processor integer performance 1547 Floating Point Processor floating point performance 3546 Memory Memory performance 2718 Stream Memory bandwidth performance 1684 You can see the A15 stacks up against the 847 rather well, much better than the Javascript benchmarks would suggest (this Acer also has a faster clock 1.1GHz than the Chromebook's 0.8 GHz). As the chrome environment is basically javascript driven (UI point of view), so these numbers are rather moot. The fact is, the ARM world still has poor Javascript engines and though I know there are various changes coming to the android kernel (and compiler) that will improve the A15 numbers above it's not going to do much with the Javascript numbers.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1358846080966</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 04:14:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358854327870-21</Id><Title>ARM Holdings Cut to Hold From Buy by Benchmark Capital</Title><Msg>ARM Holdings Cut to Hold From Buy by Benchmark Capital Last update: 1/22/2013 6:23:12 AM (END) Dow Jones Newswires January 22, 2013 06:23 ET (11:23 GMT)</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1358854327870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:32:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358858483554-22</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's tough year.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358838056901</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 02:00:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its 1 of the reasons Otellini is gone.

Many of the individual benchmarks have a small code footprint and process the data in a stream. Compression/decompression for example. The results of the individual benchmarks are combined using arithmetic averages. The SPEC benchmarks and most other multi-metric benchmarks use a geometric mean to smooth the impact of one extraordinary result. The Geekbench composite metric can be strongly influenced by very high result in one or two of the individual benchmarks. The set of benchmarks that are executed by the x86 and the ARM based devices are different. The x86 run extra FP benchmark tests that the ARM devices don't. It is not clear how these extra vector tests are combined and what impact Geekbench gives them compared to scalar or multi-thread tests. Geekbench results which are not attributed to a person are the result of the benchmarks running on a machine and then results automatically being submitted. There is no way to know what else was running on the machine and how those programs affected the results. Geekbench gives an idea of how individual sections of the device will perform but does not give any indication of how it will perform if a number of these elements mixed together. Like you point out, you have to be very careful what you compare and how you compare it.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358863673288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:07:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358864262877-33</Id><Topic><Title>0.8 GHz Celeron 847 $199 Acer 7 Chromebook mauls 1.7 GHz ARM A15 $249 Samsung Chromebook in cpu and gpu</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358801906253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:58:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'There is no way to know what else was running on the machine and how those programs affected the results.'

From memory there was only one set of none Javascript in his Surface V Clovertrail review. Yes, Geekbench is far from perfect, but it's the best low level benchmark set we have at the moment. I know for a fact that Javascript performance has little resemblance to the actual performance (potential) of the machine. You can see this for yourself, run the various benchmarks in different browsers (and different versions of the same browser) on the same machine and you will see a wide range of numbers. That said, in Javascript denominated environments (Chrome/Windows 8 Metro) it is the right benchmark(s) to use. ---- As to your general point that A15 is not showing its full strength well surely that is up to ARM and its vendors to show what it can do rather than waste time and effort dreaming up ridiculous marketshare forecasts and making up lies about x86. ---- I assume you aren't talking about me here:) Yes, it's a issue that ARM are trying to address (with the linaro organisation).

For the first time, Intel is poised to challenge both companies in the mainstream graphics market while simultaneously eroding Nvidia’s edge in the GPGPU business. Its low-power, 10W TDP ULV parts will challenge the price/performance ratio of AMD’s second-generation Brazos SoC (codenamed Kabini) as well as any ARM-based Windows 8 notebooks that companies like Qualcomm might bring to market. Let’s take a look at the architecture, starting with the CPU. Wider, deeper, faster Haswell is a logical extension of the microarchtectural improvements Intel first introduced in Sandy Bridge. The new chip adds support for Intel’s second-generation Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX2), which doubles the core’s peak FPU throughput. L1 and L2 bandwidth have been doubled to ensure the execution units stay fed, and the integer and FPU register files have all been enlarged. Branch prediction efficiency also gets a boost. Haswell’s real-world single-threaded performance in unoptimized code is expected to improve by 10-15%. In optimized, AVX2 code, the leap will be much larger; AVX2 includes support for integer vectorization that AVX lacks. The increased FPU capability and additional AVX2 functionality make a huge difference in Haswell’s floating-point performance. The CPU is capable of up to 32 single-precision and 16 double-precision floating point operations per core. That’s twice what Sandy Bridge could achieve; a theoretical eight-core Haswell clocked at 3.8GHz will offer 972.8 gigaflops of SP and 486.4 gigaflops of DP performance. While it’s true that current GPUs exceed these levels, x86 compatibility is one heck of a carrot. Intel’s “good enough” argument sank the big iron RISC vendors of the 1990s and early 2000s, and it’s a real threat to Nvidia’s GPGPU momentum. The chip’s L1/L2 cache bandwidth is vastly increased from current levels; the L1 bus is twice as wide as well. The massive amounts of additional bandwidth are what the chip needs to keep the AVX2 units busy; Haswell should be able to hit a relatively high percentage of its peak theoretical gigaflops rate in real-world scenarios. While Team Green will likely retain the overall performance advantage, a quad-core Haswell with a 4GHz Turbo mode will offer 256 gigaflops of double-precision floating point (512 gigaflops single-precision). That level of single-precision performance is right in the neighborhood of Nvidia’s GT 640. Because Nvidia has historically hobbled double-precision performance on consumer cards, quad-core Haswell could well outperform Nvidia’s GTX 680 and possibly pace the GTX 580 in DP operations. Nvidia could win the battle at the high end, only to lose the war at other price points if Intel chooses to make an issue of it. Worse, there’s the fact that every single Nvidia-equipped HPC system comes with an Intel solution by default. Make no mistake, Intel is playing up the potential Xeon Phi connection; three of the company’s IDF seminars addressed vectorization for both Haswell and Xeon Phi. Haswell’s GPU turns the screws on Nvidia, AMD Haswell’s GPU is a tweaked version of the cores currently deployed in Ivy Bridge. What’s really changing is the shader loadout; Intel will offer Haswell in 10, 20, and 40-shader flavors (GT1, GT2, and GT3). The chip will also be offered in variants that include up to 128MB in on-package RAM, a feature that provides the GPU with a small dedicated pool of memory. Intel isn’t talking much about the GPU changes, but the company has stated that the new GT3 configuration offers “up to 2x” the performance of Ivy Bridge’s HD 4000 graphics. Even a conservative take on that promise spells trouble for AMD and Nvidia. According to figures from Anandtech, Trinity’s GPU is an average of 18% faster than Llano’s across a range of 15 popular titles. Compared to Sandy Bridge, Trinity was almost 80% faster. Against Ivy Bridge, it’s just 20% faster. Given what we know of Haswell’s GPU shader counts and performance targets, it shouldn’t be hard for Intel to deliver a 30-50% performance boost in real-world games. If it does, Trinity goes from the fastest integrated GPU on the market to an also-ran, and AMD loses the superior graphics hole card it’s been playing since it launched the AMD 780G chipset four years ago. Sunnyvale has virtually no room to maneuver. The company’s 28nm Kaveri APU, with its next-generation graphics core based on the HD Radeon 7000 and the new Steamroller CPU reportedly has yet to tape-out. That means it could be the tail end of 2013 before we see the chips, assuming that production goes smoothly. AMD will likely offer a “Trinity 2.0″ update to stem off Haswell’s onslaught, but slightly higher clocks aren’t going to be enough to keep Intel from matching AMD’s performance. AMD’s last bastions are the markets Intel doesn’t really want. It’s an unsustainable position for any company that dreams of challenging the market leader; AMD literally can’t afford the R&amp;D it would take to catch up to its erstwhile rival. You won’t find Nvidia gloating — well, not much. Intel’s literature makes it plain that the company absolutely intends to minimize the value of separate GPUs by incorporating performance where it can and driving the adoption of ever-smaller form factors where it can’t. Barring a major screw-up, it’ll be Haswell, not Kaveri, that crosses the “good enough for enthusiasts” line first. The chip’s 10W power envelope won’t directly compete with any potential Tegra 4-based tablets — that’s what Bay Trail, Intel’s out-of-order 22nm Atom SoC is for. No, Haswell won’t drive AMD out of business or frighten Nvidia into dumping Tesla — but unless Intel completely blows its roadmap, it’ll drive both companies further towards the margins of computing. For AMD, that move is very literal; the company is being forced into the low-end products that Intel doesn’t want to bother with. For Nvidia, it means scrambling to convince OEMs to allocate space for discrete GPUs at a time when Intel’s marketing dollars and consumer preferences are aligned against it. Enthusiast preferences, Intel’s historically weak driver support, and Nvidia’s own brand recognition will help, but the IT industry is littered with the bones of companies that treated their brand as an unassailable bulwark rather than a sand castle. Enthusiasts that care about performance tend to follow it, wherever it goes.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358870611205</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 11:03:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358870866296-55</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's latest processor price list released.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358759648761</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 04:14:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shuddap. you've been pumping dead dogs on multiple boards. loser.</Msg><Username>tansafl</Username><Timestamp>1358870866296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 11:07:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358871506024-56</Id><Topic><Title>Sold INTC and purchased MSFT , because MSFT can sell software without selling new PC's, NOK sold over 5 million smart phones , next tablets and upgrades</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358870282765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:58:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kudos - You sold 'Dead Money for more "Dead Money" Very shrewd investing ..Most impressive indeed !</Msg><Username>pentomic</Username><Timestamp>1358871506024</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 11:18:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358871773258-57</Id><Topic><Title>When do you think it is a good time to buy this stock?

Intel</Title><Msg>Wells Fargo’s David Wong today reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Intel (INTC) and a $28 to $33 “valuation range,” writing that the company’s announcement of 17 new microprocessors using dual-core “Ivy Bridge” architecture shows the company’s chip leadership. Pointing to the latest Intel processor price list, Wong notes that the update “includes a price decrease in one processor as well as the release of 17 other new dual-core Ivy Bridge processors across Intel’s Core, Pentium and Celeron product lines.” He adds that the update ” marks the introduction of Intel’s first Ivy Bridge based Celeron processors; both in the mobile and desktop spaces.” Wong sees the benefits of process technology spreading through the Intel microprocessor line this year, including low-power “Atom” chips for mobile devices: We think that this latest round of processor releases highlights Intel’s ability to leverage its technology leadership through its entire processor product line. No other chip company is able to manufacture logic chips on 22nm technology 3D transistor today. Some memory chips are manufactured on comparable linewidths but no other chip company has the capability to make 3D transistors today. Intel has now pushed the advantages of 22nm manufacturing into its Celeron value line. By the end of this year, we expect to see the first 22nm Atom processors […] As the March quarter progresses, we expect Intel to leverage 22nm technology to build out its Ivy Bridge Ultra-low voltage family (13W TDP, 7W SDP), which we think have interesting applications in tablets.</Msg><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1358879332161</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358879374169-80</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT just might beat AAPL out with the NEW TV and it just might have the new X BOX inside to control it</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358877122926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 12:52:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eather way it won't be AAPL</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358879374169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:29:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358879594159-81</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT just might beat AAPL out with the NEW TV and it just might have the new X BOX inside to control it</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358877122926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 12:52:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and it won't have INTC inside</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358879594159</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:33:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358879858946-82</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT just might beat AAPL out with the NEW TV and it just might have the new X BOX inside to control it</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358877122926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 12:52:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT and INTC were stronger when they were working together.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1358879858946</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 13:37:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358879892834-83</Id><Title>DIVIDEND DATE......</Title><Msg>Does anyone knows the Next Ex-Date??

Anyone with FinFET experience and a pipeline to $10+ billion dollars, please give us a call. ASAP!!!] Shark Bay 2013 is definitely a very exciting notebook platform. As Intel is very well aware of the tablet juggernaut, it came up with a plan to significantly boost its Ultrabook spec. The Ultrabook 2013 spec baseline features now include touchscreen technology, along with a host of other goodies. Touchscreen support is not optional, as it’s a part of a baseline Ultrabook features. Intel also insists on fast wake from S3 or S4, always fresh data w/7 days standby, again a significant step up for a baseline feature. A Shark Bay Haswell baseline Ultrabook comes with U series processors that have between 15W and 25W TDP and it also includes a new Y series processors in the list. The Ultrabook 2013 baseline feature also continues to deliver all-day battery life, sensor / context aware Ultrabook, convertible design, robust Wifi with 2x2 802.11n network and wireless display support. The price of Shark Bay based Ultrabook 2013 products will start from $699 or more, with $999 or more for the higher end ones with recommended features. Shark Bay 2013 recommended features include Responsive voice commands, hardware ready BST 2013, software required HR 13 and you can get more details in our earlier reports, linked below. The existing feature set includes innovative form factors (convertible), Microsoft Windows 8 connected standby support, Full HD display, standalone SSD, always connected WWAN, Facial recognition, CCF 2.0 and vPro for corporate users. A few other features that didn’t get mentioned in the official specification sheet that a few will appreciate are a multi-touchpad and HD camera requirement.

The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six months in advance, jumped to 31.5 from 6.9 in December. That’s the highest since May 2010 and the biggest gain in 11 months. Economists forecast an increase to 12, according to the median of 39 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. While Germany’s statistics office estimates the economy may have shrunk as much as 0.5 percent in the final quarter of 2012, the Bundesbank said yesterday there are indications that a recovery has already begun. Business confidence rose for a second month in December and the country’s service industries returned to growth. The European Central Bank predicts that the euro-area economy will exit its recession later this year. “It gives reason for optimism,” said Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover, Germany. “We should see a considerable economic improvement toward mid-year with stronger momentum. The worst in the crisis seems to be behind us.”</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358896141386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:09:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358896644514-130</Id><Title>Economic News</Title><Msg>Europe: Recovering.

A Greek departure “is certainly a less likely event this year, although not a zero probability.” Joining him in questioning whether the 17-nation euro region was built to last and declaring Greece’s departure imminent, inevitable or in its interest were hedge-fund manager John Paulson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn, Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, Pacific Investment Management Co. Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El- Erian, Kenneth Rogoff and Martin Feldstein of Harvard University and Citigroup Inc. chief economist Willem Buiter. Roubini -- who earned his nickname for correctly predicting the 2008 global financial crisis -- Cohn, Rogoff and Stiglitz are among the skeptics returning this week to the Alpine conference as investors pull back bets against the euro and signal the worst of the three-year debt crisis has passed. That’s a shift in tone from a year ago, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe was “labeled the big headache of the global economy” and then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon called the continent a “time bomb.” “I am confident that the euro zone is broadly on the right track back to financial stability and economic strength,” said Josef Ackermann, a frequent Davos attendee who stepped down last year as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s biggest bank. “The contagion risks of Greece leaving the euro zone were too great for everyone, and European leaders are well aware that a collapse of the euro would be the end of Europe’s status as a leading force in global politics and business.” Betting on the euro’s longevity would have made investors money last year. Those who bought junk-rated Greek bonds in January 2012 earned 78 percent, compared with 4.5 percent for German bunds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358897133552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:25:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358897323639-133</Id><Topic><Title>What am I not understanding...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1358896015169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:06:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>welcome to the world of expectations.

Unlike the Surface RT, which can only run Windows 8-optimized Metro apps, the Surface Pro runs Microsoft's full Windows 8 Pro operating system. That means it can handle all legacy Windows apps. The scant app selection for the Surface RT is a significant weakness for the device. The Surface Pro is remedy to that problem, but it comes with its own drawbacks. The tablet's Intel Core i5 gives it processing power that's comparable to a traditional desktop or laptop PC -- but it's 0.53 inches thick and weighs two pounds. That makes it both thicker and heavier than the Surface RT (0.37 inches thick, 1.5 pounds). It's also got a shorter battery life -- more comparable to an 5-ish hour ultrabook than a 10-hour tablet -- thanks to its beefed up specs, which include 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 1920x1080 full HD display. The Surface Pro can do something else the RT can't: It supports a pressure-sensitive stylus for writing, illustrating and designing by hand. That stylus will come included with every Surface Pro. The Surface Pro comes in 64 GB and 128 GB configurations, which go for $899 and $999, respectively. An "optional" but essential add-on keyboard costs another $100 when bundled with the Surface Pro. Microsoft also said Tuesday that it will start offering the 64 GB Surface RT without a Touch Cover, lowering its $699 price to $599. (Previously, that version was only sold with the cover included. The 32 GB version sells for $499 without a Touch Cover or $599 with one.) The Surface Pro will be available in all the same retail channels as the Surface RT, including Best Buy and Staples.</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1358904600909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 20:30:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358904853273-147</Id><Title>GETANID 61 can't prove he owned a SINGLE share of ARMH up to 42</Title><Msg>His previous posts state that he never even owned it.

For the production of these chips Intel has appointed three factories that are already prepared for 14nm production: D1X in Oregon, Fab 42 in Arizona and Fab 24 in Ireland. Halfway through 2013 Intel should be sending out prototypes for testing. Intel will begin mass production of 14nm chips in 2013 and they should become available on the market sometime 2014. The current 'Ivy Bridge' chips and the 'Haswell' chips that we can expect in June are still based on 22nm. The first 14nm chips that we can expect will be codenamed 'Broadwell'. The advantages of 14nm chips over 22nm chips include lower power consumption, possibly lower TDP, and as a result they will allow for more computing power per surface area.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358906618476</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:03:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358907428367-156</Id><Topic><Title>"Foundries like TSMC can’t advance technology as fast as Intel..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358894251606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 17:37:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is shipping the 22nm SoC chips this year.

No contractual discounts. People do pay full price. for instance, iPhone 5 is listed in the neighborhood of $800 in India.

Apple Trailing China’s Coolpad Shows Need for Cheap IPhone Apple Inc. is being outsold in China, the world’s largest handset market, by a company less than 1 percent its size, highlighting how the lack of low-cost products limits the iPhone-maker in emerging nations. China Wireless Technologies Ltd. is one of four domestic suppliers outselling Apple in China with smartphones tailored to the budget of the nation’s budding middle class. Its Coolpad 8060 retails for 619 yuan -- or just under $100 -- less than 20 percent the price of the cheapest iPhone. China Wireless expects sales to rise 40 percent this year to 28 million phones, helped by low prices and new products such as fourth-generation handsets. Apple, whose smartphone has made it the world’s most profitable company, slipped to sixth place in China from fourth as it struggled to lure consumers earning an average of $577 a month. “Apple, with its current stable of products, is unlikely to rank high as long as the general level of affluence in China is low,” said Magdalene Choong, a Phillip Securities analyst in Singapore who rates the Cupertino, California-based company’s shares neutral.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358914179754</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 23:09:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358914609830-163</Id><Topic><Title>With ARMH on Windows in the grave, Surface Pro set to debut February 9th</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1358904600909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 20:30:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a lot to like about Surface Pro and there's no question about its performance. The initial versions may carry a little more thickness and weight than an ARM tablet but that will soon change as Intel's forthcoming low power processors manufacturers will enable tablets that are slimmer, lighter, faster and have much better battery life. In contrast, six to twelve months from now ARM tablets will still be as limited and useless as they are today.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358914609830</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 23:16:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358916355820-164</Id><Topic><Title>Intel full throttle 14nm in 2014, TSMC 30 percent 20nm by 2015</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358909096416</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:44:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And TSMCs 20nm is planar which means limited performance and economics verses Intel's 14nm FinFET.
