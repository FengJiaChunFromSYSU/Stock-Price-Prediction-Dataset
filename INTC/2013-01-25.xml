The smartphone chip designer is advertising at least three software engineering jobs that clearly state its intentions. Applicants will work on "architecture/design and system prototypes of Qualcomm's new ARMv8-based server SOC ASICs for the power optimized server market," the ads say. "Primary responsibilities include specification, development, porting, integration and shakeout of server platform management software and firmware on prototypes utilizing Qualcomm’s new SOC." The ARMv8 is a reference to ARM's next-generation 64-bit capable instruction set architecture. The ability to handle 64-bit addresses is key for server processors. Qualcomm is at least the eighth company now known to be working on ARM server SoCs. Others with announced or known plans include AMD, Applied Micro, Cavium, Calxeda, Marvell, Nvidia and Samsung. Huawei posted job openings for ARM server engineers last year. However, it was not clear if the company is designing systems, SoCs or both. The companies known to be preparing ARM server chips generally aim to start shipping 64-bit SoCs in 2014. Calxeda and Marvell are shipping 32-bit SoCs for servers today with limited traction, mainly in prototyping systems for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Taiwan’s Mitac. The Qualcomm software jobs appear to be mainly in Raliegh, N.C., although at least one also lists postings in Austin and San Diego, Qualcomm’s headquarters.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359114331568</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 06:45:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359115906549-12</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Fraud Details</Title><Username>ellismike169</Username><Timestamp>1359059161661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:26:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just joined.</Msg><Username>seancarter340</Username><Timestamp>1359115906549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 07:11:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359118185642-13</Id><Topic><Title>Is Anyone Making Money WIth INTC?</Title><Username>newtontodd714</Username><Timestamp>1358014743482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great</Msg><Username>carlwhite879</Username><Timestamp>1359118185642</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 07:49:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359120169164-14</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's conundrum</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1359061441053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 16:04:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The iFad hysteria is indeed over but your thesis rests on several faulty assumptions. First is that the maturity of the U.S. smartphone and tablet market is representative of the Rest Of World. It is not. While U.S. consumers are entering the replacement cycle for smartphones very large populations of the world have yet to buy their first one. Second, you assume the industry is incapable of any new innovation that would create for new products. Innovations are happening in the ultrabook and convertible space that may redefine the traditional PC. Plus smartphones can be made far more powerful and even to the point of running full 64 bit W8 giving users a completely portable desktop with apps included. Then there are wearable computers, voice control, gesture control, embedded devices, smart homes, smart vehicles and many more innovations yet to come. Of all the things to worry about Intel, the lack of new ways to improve lives through technology is not one of them. The better question to ask is who is going to be on the top of the heap in the long run.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1359120169164</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 08:22:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359120880952-15</Id><Topic><Title>More News from ARM Fantasy World</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359089093200</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 23:44:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TSMC has to convince its customers that they will be able to match or closely match Intel's technology roadmap in an effort to persuade them not to jump to an x86 solution.

For the first time in ages, Samsung is cautious on spending and will not increase its annual investment budget. This is because demand for computer chips and the smartphone is still slowing down. The company will have to make less hardware for its rival Apple too, which is also suffering. Samsung, one of the industry's most aggressive spenders, has ramped up capital expenditure every year since 2004. Samsung made an operating profit to $8.28 billion in the last quarter. The 89 percent increase from a year earlier was in line with its earlier estimate. Profit at its mobile devices division, which makes phones, tablets and cameras, more than doubled from a year earlier thanks to smartphone sales.The division accounted for 62 percent of Samsung's overall fourth-quarter profit, up from 55 percent a year earlier.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1359123743203</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359123752922-23</Id><Topic><Title>intel to sell off after going X divvy, probably.</Title><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1359123384041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:16:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dance dance dance with the devil .</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1359123752922</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:22:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359123998829-24</Id><Title>AMD could pass INTC.. from here..

As per the deal Intel would acquire certain assets of Motorola Mobility such as non-Indian intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications. The chip maker would also buy tangible assets of the company located in the US besides getting the rights to hire some American employees of Motorola Mobility, among others. “... the market for cellular base-band processors is competitive on account of presence of major players including Qualcomm, MediaTek, Texas Instruments and Broadcom,” the CCI said in its order dated January 22. Motorola Mobility subsidiaries in India are Motorola Mobility India and Motorola Mobility Chennai. The regulator said the assets of Motorola Mobility which are being acquired by Intel do not presently generate any revenue in India. As per the order, Intel is a recent entrant into the production of components for wireless hand held devices including cellular base-band processors. The company has various subsidiaries in India including Intel Technology India, Intel Mobile Communications India and McAfee Software. Intel and Motorola Mobility had reached ‘Asset Purchase Agreement’ in December, 2012, following which they approached CCI for approval.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1359132839137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:53:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359132851598-64</Id><Title>Do You Want A Stock That's Going Nowhere or One Headed To New Highs?</Title><Msg>*************************************************************************************** Titan Pharmaceuticals: TTNP has a six month implant to treat drug addiction.

My question, a 4% dividend makes the wait a little more bearable, but are there any catalysts other than time that could initiate some short term momentum?

If INTC move back to $25 with the 4% dividend and you sell then you will make about 13-14% on your money. If INTC goes higher than $25 over the year and you sell You will make more.

SO---When Hillary gets elected in 4 years and the Dems hold the House and Senate, will you GOP nuts stop you southern call for States rights?

RIMM (and NOK for that matter) would most certainly be out of business if that was not the case. However, the underdeveloped world does not, and will not, have the means to pay for high-priced phones for many years. The replacement cycle there will continue, but only provided that the phones/tablet are cheap. INTC is entering the phone/tablet market precisely when growth of the high-end (high margin) phone market in the developed world is slowing down, and any remaining growth is shifting to low-cost phones in the underdeveloped world. So commoditization of the overall phone market is happening and growth will be mostly limited to low-margin products. And due to the high-performance of even low-cost phones, the replacement cycle will end much more quickly than it did in the case of PC for the reason I stated previously. Of course innovation is not dead. Samsung has some interesting flexible-screen display technology coming out that will open new markets. I am just not so sure the majority of people will see any urgent need to 'upgrade' their devices, at least, not nearly at the pace they did. I maintain that the phone/tablet space is going to transition to low growth much more quickly than PC's did. And that is a conundrum for INTC along with other companies in the technology space.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1359139971674</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:52:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359139978743-119</Id><Topic><Title>We have starter buying under 21.00 today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1359131960336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:39:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whoops, Raystock forgot that he was not giving any more free info as posted on the qid message board "No more free information on investing by raystock48079 Dec 16, 2009 5:24 AM" Never mind, that was just another Raystock lie</Msg><Username>mister_quarter</Username><Timestamp>1359139978743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:52:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359140038038-120</Id><Title>You better cover your short Raystock INTC going HIGHER and HIGHER</Title><Msg>You better cover your short Raystock INTC going HIGHER and HIGHER</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1359140038038</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:53:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359140129219-121</Id><Title>Can you tell the difference ?

Give their desktop or laptop to some goodwill or recycle it, and just live off of the tablet. And not a tablet with a keyboard, since that should fall under an ultrabook hybrid. I'm talking a pure tablet. And let's see if anyone can live without a PC. Especially those who write these ridiculous articles. I for one know of nobody that has a tablet alone.

A clip from a seeking alpha article about safety of dividend. 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks With Potential For Considerable Growth January 14, 2013 Intel Corporation (INTC), the world's largest semiconductor maker, has 14% of its total assets in cash and equivalents and a ratio of free cash flow to net income of 0.68. The company generates consistently positive free cash flows. Over the past half-decade, its EPS and dividends grew, on average, by 22.8% and 12.9% per year, respectively. The company's long-term annualized EPS CAGR is forecasted at 9.2%. The secular decline of the PC market has weighed on Intel's performance, and the company looks inclined to boost its growth in the mobile device chip business gravitating toward smartphones and PC tablets. This year, Gartner expects weak PC sales, recovering semiconductor sales, and surging smartphone unit production growth and media tablet production. Intel yields a high 4.1% on a payout ratio of 39% of trailing earnings and 58% of trailing free cash flow. We like the company's wide moat, low debt, high dividend, and relative valuation well below the company's historical metrics. Its forward P/E of 12.2x is a large discount to its peers on average.

That means margins are going down.' LOL no it isn't on either account. The biggest competition Intel ever faced was when the relatively cool Athlon64 was released by AMD to face the hot Intel Pentium 4. AMD got to $42 eventually on that processor. Margins have also barely moved as Intel does not need to lower prices for ARM processors. 'The tech guys think Intel also has some kind of monopoly on innovation...don't underestimate hungry players, these guys already kicked Intel's bottom all over the place in mobile. They are now going after Intel's core markets. It will be interesting.' Err no, Intel still has the mobile market it's interested in, notebooks, all sown up. As to phones that is just a sideline for Intel that it is now getting in to. Going after Core markets ? Yes, but they won't be successful. That brand new ARM A57 64-bit chip coming out in a year or so's time has similar performance to that 10-year old Athlon64 according to ARM's own estimates and will be handled with ease by 14nm Broadwell and its descendants.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1359160020110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:27:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359160098914-187</Id><Topic><Title>INTC closed at 20.96 0.04 under 21.00 as posted</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1359152846985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:27:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We love to laugh at Raystock who bought aapl at $661.31 calling it cheap at that price, currently over $200 lower, yet brags about being right about intc by pennies!!!

The Atom Lexington Z2420 chip was one of the attractions at the recently concluded Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The smartphone powered by the Z2420 chip is expected to be available in the coming week for ₹8,999. Previous rumours about the Android smartphone had suggested that the handset fall in the ₹7,000 price bracket. Lava Xolo X500 sports a 3.5-inch display with a pixel resolution of 480X320. The smartphone comes with dual-SIM capacity and Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system powered by Atom Z2420 processor which is clocked at 1.2GHz. The processor incorporates Intel's Hyper-Threading Technology, said reports. The device comes equipped with a 5-megapixel camera which is capable of clicking seven images in the burst mode at six frames per second. The handset packs 512MB of RAM and internal memory storage of 4GB which is expandable up to 32GB through a microSD card slot. It also packs a battery of 1500 mAh. According to NDTV, Lava Mobiles has already shipped the first batch of Xolo X500 units. The company has also launched yet another Xolo handset in the market called Xolo A500. The device runs on Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS backed by a 1GHz dual-core processor and is priced at ₹6,999.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1359167172868</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 21:26:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359167588105-198</Id><Topic><Title>According to Annandtech, Intel's lexington low cost phone is sold for $126</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1359148728914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 16:18:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thoughts on this guy's opinion of the price? ______________________ Alex1 1 day ago $126 dollars for Kenya - is VERY EXPENSIVE phone considering that most people in developing countries live for a $1/day or even less.

About $4.4 billion was of lower technology and probably outsourced. The $45 billion left over was spread over about 350 million x86 processors (client and server) for about a $128 ASP. The average die size was about that of an i5 processor, or about 160 square mm. That average chip probably yields about 140 good die per wafer. The average wafer, therefore, generates about $18,000 in revenue. That means that 2.5 million wafers were run to generate $45 billion in x86 revenue. The company claimed that it was running below 50% utilization rate in the fourth quarter (to burn off some inventory), but the quarter before, 50% utilization was mentioned. So, Intel went out of 2012 with capacity of about 5 million wafers of leading edge technology. That means that Intel could produce $90 billion in revenue at full factory loading. 100% factory loading will never happen, so crank that back to $80 billion. The 2013 CapEx will be $11 billion ex the 450mm spending. The $11 billion will produce at least another million wafers per year or $18 billion worth of capacity that could be on-line by the middle of 2015. (Note: not all the $11 billion will go toward new capacity. About $5 billion is for maintenance of existing capacity, so about $6 billion will go to new capacity. Using the same reasoning, only $21 billion of the 36 billion total CapEx spending from 2011 through 2013 will have gone to new capacity, which is capable of producing about $63 billion in new output. Obviously the company had some capacity, that is still being used, before the $36 billion total new CapEx orgy began in 2011. Anyway you cut it; Intel has about $90 billion of total capacity today, with another $18 billion coming on in about 18 months. What's going on? Intel is noted for its ability to trim output quickly in slow times. Because of this the company didn't get hit hard in the Great Recession. The company is also noted for carrying some extra capacity, so that they never run short of the market on Intel products, but well over 2X the required production capacity is more than a little guard band for the upside. Is Intel management just dumb? I've never known that to be the case. What products need this type of technology? The chips involved need to be very fast, very low power, and physically large. PCs and servers need it, of course, that is the present $45 billion in business. Smartphone and tablet Application Processors and Baseband processors need the technology. That market, from low end to high end, might average $40 per unit with line of sight to 1 billion units worldwide by 2015-16. So there is $40 billion. High end networking chips can use the technology on a foundry basis. The rumor is that the Cisco deal is $1 billion per year. Maybe there is another 1 or 2 billion dollars in that market. FPGAs need the best technology available. Judging from the Altera and Xilinx recent cost of goods, that market is about $1.4 billion total. That's about it. If Intel got every penny of the expected high performance business it would explain the need for the $45 billion of new capacity that is sitting unutilized today. That still leaves $18 billion worth of future new capacity unaccounted for. What would it take for Intel to get every bit of the high performance business available in the relatively near future? The semiconductor industry is all about moving decimal points around. The number of transistors on a CPU chip has grown from 1000s in the beginning to billions today. A million times growth. The CPU clock rate has gone from a few megahertz to a few gigahertz in that same time. The word length has gone from 16 bits to 64 bits. A 64 bit word can carry something like 281 trillion times the number combinations of a 16 bit word! Memory chip size, in my career, has gone from 1Kb to 4Gb, a million times growth, six decimal points. The network business and the FPGA business combined do not move the needle much. A deal in hand from Apple for 200 million "A" something chips, even at $30 each, is only $6 billion, against $45 billion in new capacity? Not even close. In order to render all other technologies obsolete in the mobile market, something miraculous would have to happen. Something like Intel would have to reduce the power of mobile chips by a factor of ten; move the power decimal one place to the left. They would also have to move the speed performance one decimal point to the right, or ten times as fast as the best current technology. It wouldn't hurt if the price on such a device was the same as or less than today's price. The above conditions would be enough to move all of the mobile business to Intel in the short term. Maybe only factors of five would be good enough to make the move. I have no idea whether the immense amount of new capacity is aimed at a run for every dollar's worth of mobile business or not, but $45-63 billion worth of new capacity is a nugget of information that, if I were an analyst, I would ask Intel management about again and again until my voice was hoarse. That huge chunk of capacity needs to be used in the short future; it is a wasting asset. There is something unprecedented about to happen, and it has to happen very quickly in order to use that capacity. By the time whatever this is is known, it will be too late to take a position in Intel to make the really heavy sugar. I'm in Intel up to my ears.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359172589896</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:56:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359172700405-205</Id><Topic><Title>Why Big Deals Are Imminent</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359172589896</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:56:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There is something unprecedented about to happen, and it has to happen very quickly in order to use that capacity.

If they take on an external customer such as Cisco as a foundry, it will take some time before they can re-align their production mechanism to the new chip design during which the plant will remain idle. As a ballpark, it takes 4 years to produce a new chip. Since Cisco already has a design, it may cut that time in half. So for 2 years, the plant will depreciate. If they wanted to utilize this excess capacity as a foundry, they should have been working on it for the last two years.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359172993857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 23:03:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359173697228-207</Id><Topic><Title>According to Annandtech, Intel's lexington low cost phone is sold for $126</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1359148728914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 16:18:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This guy is clueless.

Netronome said that the transistors will "shatter system benchmarks for flow processor performance, power and cost in network and security applications." The company also said that it will be able to take "full advantage of Intel's tools and proprietary modeling capabilities" and ensure that it has "uninterrupted product supply" as it can count of more than just one fab as production facility. Intel and Netronome did not release any numbers that would indicate production volume of network flow processors. Netronome is the third foundry deal for Intel. Previously, Tabula and Achronix announced that their FPGAs would be manufactured by Intel in a 22 nm process. It appears that Nvidia would also be interested in having Intel produce its chips. Intel, however, declined and said that it has no intent helping its rivals.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1359174237479</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 23:23:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359174325865-209</Id><Topic><Title>Why Big Deals Are Imminent</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359172589896</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:56:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It appears that Nvidia would also be interested in having Intel produce its chips. funny - very funny</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1359174325865</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 23:25:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359174547547-210</Id><Topic><Title>Why Big Deals Are Imminent</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1359172589896</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:56:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Netronome is small fish, that takes care of maybe 10%.

Apparently Intel's mostly goes to off setting the dilution from employee compensation and as a result the share count has barely decreased. Since 2008 Intc's share count is down by roughly 600 million. That seems great, but they've spent about 29 billion doing it. How could that be you ask? well unfortunately they've issued about 700 million shares during that time so despite "buying back" about 1.3 billion shares management has seen fit to compensate themselves handsomely during a time the stock price has languished. When will people learn buybacks without significant reductions in out stand share count strictly benefit management and people who sell the stock, not investors. No wonder they are borrowing more money to keep the program going.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359174659231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 23:30:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359175600403-213</Id><Topic><Title>Is the 4% dividend a reason to hold?</Title><Username>jswinning</Username><Timestamp>1359134152570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:15:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Short term catalyst in may the CEO is stepping down.
