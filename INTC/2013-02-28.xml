Today you can buy a touch screen ultrabook, that converts into a tablet. yes, apple revolutionised the Tablet, Yes, Apple revolutionised the Notebook. Yes, apple have a faithful customer base, who love their OS. Problem is that apple are stuck without offering a Tab-book, because either way a convertable Tablet to Notebook will canibalise sales of their tablets. Other problem is they are trying to convince people their ARM tablet is a viable alternative to a traditional notebook. Oh, please, wake up and face the music...ARM based tablets are good for net surfing and the likes. ARM notebooks are DOA. Macbooks are two years past their best before date. Only option for Apple is to release a Tab-book, problem for Apple is that they have already missed the boat on that innovation. Intel is loweing the power requirements for it's range of processors, every day intel is readying for the next step in their Tick-Tock cycle, next step new processor architecture, on a well proven and years ahead process node. Every tick/tock intel is lowering power consumption either through manufacturing process or processor architecture. Intels appears to be increasing performance where desktion performance power consumption is not so critical. Watch intel roll and push aside their competitors. best thing to happen to intel was the ARM tablet revolution, as this has opened up a huge market, that intel is ready to exploit. Intel will have products more powerful, similar power consumption, more usable with respect to software, and time prove this. It will be interesting to see which read warrior wants to carry either a tablet, notebook , or convertable Ultrabook. My thoughts are the convertable's are destined to suceed.</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1362043957602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 04:32:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362050123034-11</Id><Topic><Title>ZDNet Surface Pro coverage</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1361683080991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 00:18:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he fact that you've never heard of ZDNet speaks volumes with regard to your competence, -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- bur he reads playboy</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1362050123034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 06:15:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362051886331-12</Id><Topic><Title>Apple shares slip more after Cook speech</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362025577607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 23:26:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Apple has always had an uneasy relationship with INTEL..." =================== Apple has always had an uneasy relationship with all its suppliers....because the word on the street is that they negotiate like the mafia.

I don't think Apple or Tim Cook can afford to walk away from Intel. Pragmatism dictates that Apple does a deal with Intel. ---- It's pure fantasy to think that Apple will drop their own CPU and their own SoC for a generic Intel designed SoC. Why? Apples CPU is *good* and is very competitive against the competition (including Intel) and their SoC is different from everyone else as it's focus is on high GPU performance and contains specific IP blocks to support Apples functionality (such as Siri). It will not want to loose control of either CPU design or SoC design. We all know that Intel has a 'fab' lead, but it's yet to show that lead in the LP process - it is *behind* the fab's. There is also the question of how good Intel's LP process will be in reality. In the past Intel's LP hasn't been good as the generic fabs (in terms of transistor density, design rules etc) which add cost and add to time to market. Perhaps 22nm will be different, who knows.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1362053418070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:10:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362055175350-15</Id><Topic><Title>Apple shares slip more after Cook speech</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362025577607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 23:26:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, currently Apple CPU is "good" relative to what is available in the market. But we are talking about the future - how Apple can keep iterating and staying ahead of Intel in say 12 months, 18 months, etc. You mentioned 3 issues in terms of Apple using Intel: 1. generic Intel designed SoC 2. high GPU performance 3. specific IP blocks To address all 3, Intel has specifically said that they are open to building custom SoCs - as long as they have an x86 core or transition to x86 over time. So it need not be a generic core. And it can incorporate custom IP blocks. Regarding graphics, Intel has been focusing on this area for huge improvements - to the extent of keeping CPU performance fairly constant - and has indicated huge improvements in the current Clover Trail+ and the upcoming Haswell, Merrifield, and Bay Trail. Regarding LP process, Mark Boyd or another executive of Intel has been quoted as saying that their LP process has been ironed out and doing well. We'll see the results soon enough.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1362055175350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:39:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362055606000-16</Id><Title>INTC continues to #$%$ more of ARM's turf, Sell ARM say Liberum</Title><Msg>The analysts and the media start changing their tune!!! And this is from the UK, home of ARM. Sweet! ================================= Intel Corp seen making real progress "Intel's announcements and our subsequent interaction with company executives at the mobile world congress suggested that it is making slow but steady progress in its bid to gain share in the ARM dominated smartphone and tablet markets," says Eoin Lambe at Liberum Capital. At this years Mobile World Congress Intel launched its Clover Trail + dual core chipset family (Z2580, Z2560, Z2520), capable of running at upto 2Ghz, but still manufactured at 32nm. Intel claims twice the processor and graphics performance for the product at similar levels of power consumption. Customers announcing support for Clover Trail+ included Asustek, Lenovo and ZTE. "Intel's comments suggested that design activity at larger customers is picking up. Last year most Medfield designs were based on the Intel reference platform which is typical with smaller customers. Currently the company says that internal design activity is picking up implying larger customers, though no customers were named," says Lambe. Intel's single mode LTE solution is shipping currently and a multimode solution is expected to ship in H1'13 itself. Both the integrated solution as well as the 22nm solution is likely to ship only by late 2013 or early 2014. Intel is also shipping in over 20 tablets currently. Liberum believe the newly launched Baytrail product is expected to ship in tablets by Q4'13. While Intel has signed up a number of small and large customers in the last 12 months, actual volumes have been relatively small. "However, we expect volumes to keep climbing through new customers as well as more widespread use amongst existing customers like ZTE, Motorola and Asus. We believe this potential market share gain is not priced into ARM's share price and maintain our sell recommendation on the stock," says Lambe. economy-newsDOTcoDOTuk/shares/share-price-drivers/2873-intel-coporation-and-the-challenge-to-arm-543354</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1362055606000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:46:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362057362048-17</Id><Title>heads up eman reports march 12</Title><Msg>yrly revs. 30 million , profitable, new depo machine already running ramp up is about to begin, solid few competitors, look them up and get in before earnings call, this is a keeper if you can for next two years, high beta</Msg><Username>hypotheoryfact</Username><Timestamp>1362057362048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:16:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362058126259-18</Id><Topic><Title>INTC might be the next SEFE!</Title><Username>manuel.cabello</Username><Timestamp>1362053284813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:08:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good potential</Msg><Username>curtis.belser</Username><Timestamp>1362058126259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:28:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362058587007-19</Id><Topic><Title>INTC might be the next SEFE!</Title><Username>manuel.cabello</Username><Timestamp>1362053284813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:08:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very good future</Msg><Username>meadespangler</Username><Timestamp>1362058587007</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:36:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362059291105-20</Id><Topic><Title>Apple shares slip more after Cook speech</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362025577607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 23:26:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" best thing to happen to intel was the ARM tablet revolution, as this has opened up a huge market, that intel is ready to exploit." [As many analysts say that the tablet is cannibalizing PC, your statement is much closer to the truth. The PC may have dropped in sales by about a few percentage points in the past year, but is still higher than the point when the iPad started selling about 2 years ago. PC chips are still selling near 400 million units a year. So they dropped by about 10 or 20 million units year over year, but as you said, Intel has a whole new market to exploit increasing their overall chip sales significantly. As time goes by and Intel improves its mobile chips at an accelerated pace, they may gain well over 100 million unit sales in tablets and smartphones. In fact, Intel is targeting over 50 percent of the smartphone market alone. I don't mention the tablet market, because their will be a cloudy line between the formfactor of the tablets and the laptops due to many being convertibles. And the smartphone market is approaching 1 billion units a year which could give Intel a whole new revenue stream of over $10 Billion a year. Market has Intel not growing revenue at all at the moments for the next 2 years. Of course the reinvention of the PC will allow Intel to maintain a healthy shipment of PC related chips and the huge need for servers to allow smooth performance in mobile products will allow Intel to grow its server base by double digits each and every year for at least the next 5 years. The potential of huge growth is certainly there for Intel, but many analysts still sticking to their stubborn gloomy outlook.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1362059291105</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:48:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362059305931-21</Id><Topic><Title>Intel all in on Linux embedded</Title><Username>wdgrowblaw</Username><Timestamp>1362018058780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 21:20:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As a development tool Intel System Studo is impressive but if they really want to expand the pool of developers using these tools they should really reconsider that $3500 price.

Regardless, the Apple design team isn't standing still either, and the current designs are very competitive against Intel and given what Intel has disclosed about Atom@22nm, I doubt Apple will be losing any sleep:) Just having a better fab is only part of the story. Given the timescales involved in designing/developing new SoC's, Apples is years away from "having to switch" to remain competitive.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1362059513743</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 08:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362060137064-23</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>ericking531</Username><Timestamp>1361967974894</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 07:26:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful, thanks</Msg><Username>victorgray467</Username><Timestamp>1362060137064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:02:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362060652878-24</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>ericking531</Username><Timestamp>1361967974894</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 07:26:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good info</Msg><Username>adamwoods39</Username><Timestamp>1362060652878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:10:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362061074690-25</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>ericking531</Username><Timestamp>1361967974894</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 07:26:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>informative</Msg><Username>b.eric53</Username><Timestamp>1362061074690</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:17:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362061374239-26</Id><Title>More A15 benchmarks (Ubuntu Linux)</Title><Msg>wwwDOTphoronixDOTcom/scanDOTphp?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu_nexus_10&amp;num=1 After spending the better part of the past week running continuous open-source Linux benchmarks on the Exynos5-powered Google Nexus 10, the first extensive benchmark results for the Nexus 10 tablet running the Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview are now available.

The Atom 330 is the only one. All the others are 1c/2t. It was EOLed in 2008. All the Intel CPU on the list support SSE2, SSE3 and SSSE3. The x86 options for "generic" is for a Pentium 4 which also introduced SSE2. That is probably OK. -mtune=cpu-type Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set of available instructions. While picking a specific cpu-type schedules things appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a -march=cpu-type option. For example, if GCC is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu then -mtune=pentium4 generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4 but still runs on i686 machines. The choices for cpu-type are the same as for -march. In addition, -mtune supports an extra choice for cpu-type: `generic' Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors. If you know the CPU on which your code will run, then you should use the corresponding -mtune or -march option instead of -mtune=generic. But, if you do not know exactly what CPU users of your application will have, then you should use this option. As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this option will change. Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation controlled by this option will change to reflect the processors that are most common at the time that version of GCC is released. There is no -march=generic option because -march indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no generic instruction set applicable to all processors. In contrast, -mtune indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of processors) for which the code is optimized.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362067089610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:58:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362067535343-41</Id><Topic><Title>More A15 benchmarks (Ubuntu Linux)</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1362061374239</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:22:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow.

According to a recent JPMorgan note the phone is expected to sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor in the United States, and a Samsung Exynos 5 Octa in Europe and other regions. When Samsung unveiled the eight-core Exynos 5 Octa at CES, it was widely expected that the Samsung Galaxy S IV would feature Samsung's latest innovation. However, according to an earlier report from SamMobile, Samsung seems to have run into some overheating issues with the processor, and Samsung believes the problem will not be fixed in time for the Galaxy S IV launch. Now, we seem to be hearing reports to the contrary again, with murmurs that both chips will be used. It is noteworthy that the Japanese and North American variants of Galaxy S III ship with the dual-core Snapdragon S4 MSM8960, instead of Samsung's own quad-core Exynos 4 that powered the phone in other markets. SamMobile had claimed to have learnt from its sources that Samsung's next generation flagship will come with Snapdragon 600 inside, clocked at 1.9GHz. Other alleged specifications for the Samsung Galaxy S IV are same as what we had heard earlier, including 2GB RAM, 16/32/64 GB storage options, 13-megapixel camera and a removable battery. Samsung has also released a teaser for its Galaxy SIV launch event through its official Twitter account.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1362071359823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:09:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071532726-57</Id><Topic><Title>The TRUTH about Intel Corporation...</Title><Username>wayne.garza</Username><Timestamp>1361975360186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>willis.bachmann</Username><Timestamp>1362071532726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:12:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071923160-58</Id><Topic><Title>The TRUTH about Intel Corporation...</Title><Username>wayne.garza</Username><Timestamp>1361975360186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful information! thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>gore_colleen</Username><Timestamp>1362071923160</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:18:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071943696-59</Id><Topic><Title>CAN'T HOLD 21!</Title><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1361372693275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:04:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>REDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1362071943696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:19:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071999545-60</Id><Topic><Title>I bring absolutely nothing to the table</Title><Username>tiglet3l</Username><Timestamp>1362067015540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:56:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glad I'm not alone in the boat...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1362071999545</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:19:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362072008291-61</Id><Topic><Title>More A15 benchmarks (Ubuntu Linux)</Title><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1362061374239</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:22:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel did the Core D which is essentially two single cores sandwiched with an interconnect.

Now, the Clover Trail+ equipped device has made an appearance at Mobile World Congress, and we were curious to see how Intel’s first dual-core mobile chip is doing in the benchmarks. The device we got to try was a pre-production model, so it’s possible that the software wasn’t fully optimized, which may explain why the UI occasionally felt sluggish. We installed v3.1.1 of the AnTuTu synthetic benchmark, which tests memory performance, CPU performance, and graphics, and proceeded to run it on the sleek K900. You can see the process and the results in the video below. As you can see, the 2.0GHz Clover Trail+ processor that powers the Lenovo K900 is quite a beast. The device managed an impressive 25,138, which is ahead of the quad-core Snapdragon 600, which just made its debut on the HTC One and the Optimus G Pro. The Qualcomm chip managed a very good 22,678 in an earlier test. {It was pointed out in the comment section that at 3:15 in the video, you will see the score for the Glaxay S4 GT 19505 was 24317 which is ranked 15th, K900 was 5th}</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362074593173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:03:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362074808452-68</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein expects SEVERAL YEARS of underperformance.

Because of this the RISC chip needs to run at a higher clock rate than the CISC to perform the same amount of work. Higher clock rate = more heat = more power. The more the CISC instructions matches the workload the more pronounced this effect becomes.

The cunning plan involves a partnership with the Brazilian government, which has made increasing the country’s software output a top priority. The direct investment will go toward increasing staff numbers and resources internally but also paying for research at seven Brazilian universities. The Brazilian government is expected to match Intel’s investment. This follows a statement from President Dilma Rousseff last year which said the Brazilian government would spend at least $254 million to stimulate software development. That figure is seed finance for the scheme and is expected to grow. It does not include Brazil’s national development bank’s initiatives. Brazil is Intel’s third-largest market and its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, has invested approximately $100 million in more than 25 companies in the area.
