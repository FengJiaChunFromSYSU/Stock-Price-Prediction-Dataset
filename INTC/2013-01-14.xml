Apple has asked suppliers Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and South Korean company LG Display Co Ltd, to cut supply, down from an initial plan to order about 65 million units in the quarter, the Japanese daily said. Japan Display's plant in Nomi, Ishikawa Prefecture, where the iPhone maker has invested heavily, is expected to temporarily reduce output by 70 percent to 80 percent compared to the October to December period, the financial daily reported. Sharp's dedicated facility for iPhone 5 LCD panels in Mie Prefecture will lower production in January and February by about 40 percent from the October to December quarter, when it was near full capacity, the daily said. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. [So much for smartphone growth for Apple. I wonder if people are waiting for better products from Lenovo and Motorola with Intel chips. And if Google's Android is taking market share, this could be good for Intel since Google has been working very closely with Intel for over a year now to optimize Android to x86 Intel chips]</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358148708309</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 02:31:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358154317635-4</Id><Topic><Title>CES: Mission Accomplished</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358136645865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 23:10:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>22.5 cent dividend announced on Friday Jan 25th and ex-dividend on Monday Feb 4th.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358154317635</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 04:05:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358160795718-5</Id><Title>ARM Holdings Cut to Neutral From Overweight by Piper Jaffray</Title><Msg>ARM Holdings Cut to Neutral From Overweight by Piper Jaffray Last update: 1/14/2013 2:11:43 AM (END) Dow Jones Newswires January 14, 2013 02:11 ET (07:11 GMT)</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1358160795718</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 05:53:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358163545210-6</Id><Topic><Title>Big Little?

ARM's big/little is different from Nvida's approach in the Tegra3/4. The idea is that normally only the A7's run and when apps change (work load increases) then the A15's light up and the A7's shutdown. This moving between A7 A15 is very quick and can be transparent to the OS. From a tech perspective, it's a very interesting solution to the 'always on' device. Will it work in practice?

Though I would prefer a Windows 8 convertible/detachable that could run Android as well - for work and play. Though the headline and first paragraph indicates that the device could be ARM-based, the second paragraph seems to zero in on x86-Intel being the possible platform. Other reasons why it could be Intel: - The device considered is a convertible which might require higher performance - Lenovo has already moved one of their Yoga devices from ARM to Intel at the recent CES - Lenovo's original plan was to have the device on Medfield Q3-2012 which was a single core SoC...with dual core becoming available, there should be more performance to handle a convertible with decent power consumption/battery ================= Lenovo plans to roll out Intel- or ARM-based Android notebook/tablet convertibles in 1H13 Having unveiled its IdeaPad Yoga 11S notebook/tablet convertible mobile device at CES 2013, Lenovo reportedly plans to expand its IdeaPad Yoga family by also launching Intel- or ARM-based convertibles running on Android OS in the first half of 2013, according to industry sources. Lenovo's planned offerings will target the Android tablet segment, meeting Intel's previous commitment to rolling out Android-based tablets through joint efforts with Lenovo, the sources revealed. Lenovo originally planned to launch a Medfield-based tablet set on Android (codenamed mfld_dv10) in the third quarter of 2012 but delayed the project due to continual rollouts of new iPads and Windows 8/RT tablets as well as a proliferation of low-priced Android tablets, noted the sources. The Yoga 11S will be powered by an Intel Core i5 processor running Windows 8 on an 11.6-inch HD IPS panel with 10-point multitouch. Availability of the Yoga 11S is slated for June. digitimesDOTcom/news/a20130114PD206.html</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1358168991919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 08:09:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358172335884-9</Id><Topic><Title>Apple cuts LCD panel orders for iPhone 5 due to weak demand.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358148708309</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 02:31:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down 16 bucks pre-market.

Apple stock typically rises 50% every year. MM's have to temporarily drive down Apple stock to reduce the value of long term Apple options prior to expiration to deny benefits to retail options traders. So negative hype, negative rumors are very common every January just before options expiration. Just recall what was happening at the same time last year. I think options trading is the single most effective factor which drives (involves heavy manipulation) short term share prices. Yet main stream media and trading text books refuse to acknowledge this factor, instead attributing share price movements to something happening in some corner of the world. The above are just my thoughts - what I think is most probable. It is also possible that today's rumor is true. If true what are implications for Intel? Apple's loss must be coming at Samsung's gain. Not good for Intel either. Apple holding on to market share would keep Intel's hopes alive. But Samsung reduces Intel hopes in smartphones. If Android market share was coming from diverse ODMs/OEMs it would be good for Intel. But it is mostly concentrated in the hands of Samsung which will be in no mood to use Intel SOC's (until and unless Samsung starts loosing market share to Intel-Motorola or Intel-Lenovo partnership. Intel still has has a lot to do for that to happen).</Msg><Username>stocktrade14</Username><Timestamp>1358187105865</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:11:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358187690250-46</Id><Topic><Title>ARMs Bubble Trouble Increases</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358185668041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 12:47:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what would indicate to the market that trades in ARMH that the facts have undeniably changed.

However because mobile devices are enjoying such strong growth the growth rate may mask problems ARM experiences from competition. Several things that could signal an inflection point include; 1). Inability for ARM to capture market share in the Windows world, either RT devices or servers - as East claimed ARM would. For instance, Samsung kills RT product plans, and there is no meaningful ARM based product that threatens Intel's dominance in servers, 2). Intel's progress in delivering power efficient CPU's for servers, ultrabooks, convertibles, tablets and smartphones is happening much faster than many believed was possible. 2013 is the year Intel should see meaningful design wins around its reference platforms that will translate to increased marketshare in smartphones, tablets and convertibles. In a rapidly growing market it is quite possible both ARM and Intel can grow together, the question is how much of that growth will Intel take from them.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358191450728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:24:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358191532729-54</Id><Topic><Title>The only question is......</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1358178277366</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 10:44:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think ARMH is worth $20b but I really don't know how to value it. If I understand basically how they work: ARMH gets its revenue from licenses (once per CPU) and royalties (each part produced). They are still getting residual royalties from licenses that they sold many years ago but those fees decrease as they become out dated. For example, there were 1.7b mobile phones built in 2012. 42% were smartphones. There will probably be an ARMH chip in the low end regular phones and there will always be some non-smartphones that sell rather than smartphones. ARMH will get royalty for them. Intel has ARMH CPU designed into their SSD's. That hurts when Intel has to write a check to ARMH but they are one of ARMH largest customers. ARMH cares about designing a new CPU or one with new features that they can license to a whole bunch of people. So, Warren East will say "Yep, this CPU will do well in the PC class designs!" so he can sell a dozen licenses. At 22 times sales, ARMH is too expensive. At 10 times book value, ARMH is too expensive. By most of the fundamental metrics, ARMH is too expensive. It is just hard to figure out how much sales ARMH will generate before their growth flattens our or even drops. I don't have the capability to value it. ARMH just smells tooooooooooo risky for my taste.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358191532729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:25:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358191864872-55</Id><Topic><Title>The Age of AAPL is Finished</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1358190991324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:16:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's good for Microsoft</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1358191864872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:31:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358192125733-56</Id><Title>Dell up NVDA down</Title><Msg>getanid16 is @#@#. lol</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1358192125733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:35:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358192641403-57</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think INTC is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>marthaije606</Username><Timestamp>1357915910195</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:51:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>his one keeps me thinking</Msg><Username>heather.sears740x</Username><Timestamp>1358192641403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:44:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358193062516-58</Id><Title>WallStreet Idiots Misdiagnose PC Troubles...</Title><Msg>And #$%$ like Rory Read believe them, and base business decisions on Wall Street's erroneous assessment of the headwinds facing the x86 CPU segment. All you read these days is how tablets are killing the PC. It's utter #$%$. How many major US enterprises arm their employees with iPads rather than laptops? How many small to medium firms have replaced the PC with a tablet? Almost none. Tablets and smartphones are having an impact only on discrete segments of the PC market. Specifically it is solely low end consumer PCs and laptops under fire from tablets. The millions upon millions of enterprise PC "seats" are immune to tablet and smartphone growth. The headwinds affecting all PC segments outside of low end consumer have nothing to do with tablets, and everything to do with the economy, stupid. Enterprises defer equipment purchases in times of slowed growth or contraction. They also stop hiring and cut staff. These phenomena are the reason for sluggishness in enterprise PC and laptop sales. These are factors that will dissipate when the economy gains steam. On the other hand, PCs and laptops are dead meat in the low end consumer segment. The iPad is an idiot-simple appliance that even grandma can use. Tech know-nothings gladly surrender the cheesy flimsy clunkiness of a cheap Windows laptop in favor of slick, simple iPads. This is not a phenomenon that will change when the economy gains ground. Rather, improved economics will accelerate the trend away from laptops to tablets in this segment. So what's this mean? It means that relief from sluggishness is right around the corner or at least in sight for Intel which dominates 95%+ of the enterprise PC segment. It also means that the economy's rising tide will not lift AMD's boat, but rather it will sink it all the faster. AMD, unlike Intel, is utterly dependent on the low end consumer segment for the majority of its CPU and APU revenues. That is, iPad is virtually purpose built to take over AMD's bread and butter segment. AMD's key buyers will buy more iPads when their household fortunes improve. There is no light at the end of the AMD tunnel as a result. Sell/short AMD. Buy Intel. Simple.</Msg><Username>stockdeflate</Username><Timestamp>1358193062516</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:51:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358194351891-59</Id><Topic><Title>Dell up NVDA down</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1358192125733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:35:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>getanid16 or getanid61 ?

In a sea of touch-inspired Windows 8 hardware, it’s the first ultrabook convertible with a form factor that gets everything right. The Lenovo Thinkpad Helix The first batch of Windows 8 ultrabooks get high marks for their inspired designs, but aren’t quite flexible enough to truly be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) solutions. Lenovo’s own IdeaPad Yoga came close, but the sensation of feeling the keyboard underneath your fingers when transformed into tablet mode was slightly jarring. Dell‘s XPS 12 solved that problem with its clever rotating hinge design, but I wanted the ability to remove the tablet display entirely from both of those products. Enter the ThinkPad Helix with its “rip and flip” design. Aside from its pedigree of simply being a ThinkPad (I will forever prefer that red TrackPoint to any other pointing device, and their keyboards are exceptional), it improves on the Yoga by boasting a detachable keyboard dock. The 11.6″ display can then be removed and used as a standalone tablet with 1920 x 1080 resolution. The dock interface also allows the Helix to enter “Stand Mode” and collapse all the way down on top of the keyboard — covering it, which was my sole complaint with the IdeaPad Yoga. Aside from its versatility, the Helix has plenty going for it in the specs department. It has mini DisplayPort and mini-HDMI out to satisfy both business users and home consumers. It will ship with 3rd generation Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processors and up to a 256GB SSD (Solid State Drive). Connectivity seems guaranteed with 3G, 4G, or 4G LTE SIM card slots. The Helix even includes NFC and a digitizer pen that supports Windows 8 gestures and converts your handwritten notes into digital text. Combined battery usage is rated at 10 hours — 5 hours from the tablet battery, and an additional 5 with the keyboard dock. Aside from the tech specs, the ThinkPad Helix packs in all of the security and manageability features one expects from Lenovo, and even though the company seems to be marketing this toward business users, the Helix hits every checkbox on my wishlist for a reliable productivity and writing machine.

A video posted by The Tech Report shows off two systems - with one system featuring a Haswell-based Intel chip with integrated graphics, while the second system included an Ivy Bridge-based Core i7 CPU and a discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 650M GPU. Using Dirt 3 as the software it was set at 1920x1080 with all details set to high. Looking at the video, the Haswell chip does rather well and even if we don’t know what frame rates the test uses it looks like it is getting close to its 30fps mark. This is pretty important for an integrated, and more power-efficient method of gaming. While the final retail version of Haswell, will not perform as well as a perfectly-tuned demo by Intel for a show, it is a good sign that things are going to get much better at the lower end of the market.

This decision by Samsung is said to be based on very little interest from its retail partners and not much demand by consumers. While Microsoft has only seen what can only be best described as modest success so far with its Windows RT based tablets, that level of success has made Samsung even more cautious about the investment in developing Windows RT models for the US. Most tablet makers, including Samsung, claim that price is such a big factor in tablets right now that it is hard to build a Windows RT tablet model that can be competitive against Apple and Android models. Despite its decision not to release a Windows RT model now, Samsung claims that it could revisit the decision in the future. We will have to see what happens long-term, but if Samsung can put the brakes on bringing out a Windows RT tablet, we have to think other manufacturers are going to also be cautious, unless the price point can come down, or for some reason demand for Windows RT models surges.

Van den Hove provided the following slide photo as an illustration: Yet, in another EE Times article about Intel’s 22nm IEDM presentation, EE Times quotes Mark Bohr of Intel as saying: "Projections from an IMEC keynote that 14-nm wafers will be 90 percent more expensive than 28-nm parts due to the lack of EUV lithography are inaccurate," The article also quotes Bohr as saying "The increase for 14-nm wafers at Intel is nowhere near that. Cost per wafer has always gone up marginally each generation, somewhat more so in recent generations, but that’s more than offset by increases in transistor density so that the cost per transistor continues to go down at 14nm." So who is right between those two giants? Could it be that both of them are? In a recent blog titled Is the Cost Reduction Associated with Scaling Over? we presented charts clearly supporting Luc van den Hove's (IMEC's CEO) position. The following slide from an IBM presentation includes an NVidia chart (which we also discussed in another blog, Is NVIDIA in a Panic? If so, what about AMD? Other fabless companies? ). Accordingly, it would seem that TSMC wafer costs are in line with Luc and so is the case with IBM. GlobalFoundries, in its recent 14nm announcement, disclosed that the back-end will be unchanged from 20nm. This suggests a similar die size and respective increase in per-transistor cost. Further, STMicro in the Fully Depleted Transistors Technology Symposium (11 December 2012) also acknowledged that their 14nm node will have a 20nm node metal pitch and, just like GlobalFoundries, a similar die size and increase in per-transistor cost. In other words, it seems that the Luc van den Hove keynote is in line with the cost roadmap of the non-Intel foundries! Intel might indeed be different -- something did cause Intel to take what seems like an extreme measure, when it recently decided to invest $4.1B in ASML (Click Here for more details). If, however, Mark Bohr has not been misled by the Intel accounting department, and the Intel process is still providing a nice cost reduction at every node of scaling, then clearly Intel has a true competitive edge relative to all other foundries. I have no doubts that Intel has filed enough patents to protect its unique process advantage, but then I wonder why did Mark say: "However . .. we don’t intend to be in the general-purpose foundry business … [and] I don’t think the [foundry] volumes ever will be huge [for Intel]” (Click Here to see this article). [Not buying this argument. Bohr is just saying there might not be any need to do the foundry thing even if the margins are good. They may have better choices...] If Mark Bohr is right, then with such a competitive edge Intel should aggressively expand its foundry business, which would achieve both a great profit margin and rapid business growth. Now that Intel is looking for a new CEO, its Board should consider this as a major criterion for who should lead Intel into the future.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358213760285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:36:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358214343386-88</Id><Title>Is NVIDIA in a Panic? If so, what about AMD? Other fabless companies?</Title><Msg>Recently I read a very uncommon report title: "NVIDIA deeply unhappy with TSMC, claims 20nm essentially worthless". Quoting directly: “One of the unspoken rules of customer-foundry relations is that you virtually never see the former speak poorly of the latter. Only when things have seriously hit the fan do partners like AMD or NVIDIA admit to manufacturing problems... That’s why we were surprised - and our source testified to being stunned - that Nvidia gave the following presentation at the International Trade Partner Conference (ITPC) forum last November” Figure 1 The only explanation I can come up with is that NVIDIA is in a panic. But first let’s try to understand what the issue is about. It all starts with the diminishing return of dimensional scaling. This time it is about costs. Dimensional scaling requires continual improvements in lithography capability, and is primarily driven by the rapidly escalating cost of lithography, as illustrated by the following chart: Figure 2 Now that the cost of lithography dominates the cost of Fabs and accordingly the cost of a finished wafer, the cost reduction associated with getting more dies per wafer (scaling) becomes neutralized by the higher cost of wafers. This was recently articulated in View Point in EE Times by Dr. Handel Jones and illustrated by the following chart. Figure 3 Furthermore, pure foundry leader TSMC publicly showed the issue as seen in the following chart Figure 4 And accordingly the following charts from NVIDIA present the same trend in a very clear way: Figure 5 Moreover, another chart by NVIDIA shows the higher cost of wafers eating away at the benefits of dimensional scaling: Figure 6 But this is clearly not TSMC’s fault. So why: "NVIDIA deeply unhappy with TSMC, claims 20nm essentially worthless"? And why would NVIDIA care? If the price will stop going down they should be happy to be able to charge more as long as their competitors need to do the same. And it is hard to believe AMD would see different curves from TSMC?? But careful review of the bullet slide above and the bullet slide below might reveal NVIDIA’s underlying concerns. Figure 7 Both slides indicate real concerns and reflect some form of panic. It seems to me that the key words are “Virtual IDM”, which are the only highlighted words of the second bullet slide but do appear also in the first one. “When business ($) gets in the way, apply “First principle”, the principle of one company, one virtual IDM company”. I was not aware of this “First principle”. I thought our first principle is open competition, and individual companies are supposed to work as such and not as one company I believe we have some laws - Antitrust - against acting as one company instead of individual company. Yet, NVIDIA does have one strong IDM competitor - Intel. Could it be that Intel’s costs are different?? I don't know but it does remind me of a previous blog I wrote: Required Change in EDA Vendors’ Role and Reward vs. Scaling Yield. In that blog we tried to understand the implication of dimensional scaling on yield, and more specifically on the systematic yield losses which are design related. The following chart was presented then Figure 8 In that blog we suggested that an IDM would have a significant advantage over the “partnership” of Fabless-Fab-EDA. Looking again on the cost related chart one can clearly see NVIDIA pointing to the importance of yield. But I believe they should not blame just TSMC as it would seem to me that the EDA part is just as important.

Microsoft gave select journalists at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show a preview of its upcoming Surface tablet with Windows Pro, and according to reports, the device—unlike the Surface with Windows RT that preceded it—may actually be what Microsoft officials have been promising: a game-changer. Microsoft surprised the tech world in June 2012 with the introduction of its own tablet running a limited version of Windows 8 and the promise of a 2013 version running Windows Pro. Windows RT launched Oct. 26, 2012, and the next model was to follow three months behind it—which puts us into next week. "It's almost here," David Pogue, who was treated to a supervised hour in a Las Vegas hotel room with the tablet, wrote in The New York Times Jan. 10. Of the Surface RT, Pogue lamented, "It can't run any of the 4 million standard Windows programs. Instead, it requires a new type of app, a more limited, full-screen, iPaddish sort of app, available only from Microsoft's online store. And there aren't many of those apps, although the situation is slowly improving." But the Surface with Windows Pro, which is thicker, heavier, has a better screen, a homeless stylus users are likely to lose, an impressive Intel Core i5 processor and a larger price point—$900, versus the $500 of the RT—is something else. Click Here! "You're looking at an entirely new kind of machine, one with new possibilities," wrote Pogue. "It's a touch-screen tablet, of iPaddish proportions, that runs desktop software: Photoshop, Quicken, the full Microsoft Office, iTunes (and Apple's online movie and music stores). Desktop software on a half-inch-thick tablet. That's a first." PC World's Jon Phillips was impressed by the Surface Props' HD display—which is 1920-by-1080 pixels, compared to the Surface RT's 1366-by-768 mode—as well as its speed and overall power. "When attached to an external monitor, the Surface Pro really does become a full PC—and in this mode, the tablet itself can function as a drawing pad for full-fledged graphics applications, thanks to its included pen," wrote Phillips. He also played a shooter game, Bulletstorm, and had a good experience, though not a "butter smooth" one, and expects it's just a matter of time before these devices' pens, which attach to the magnetic power adapter port instead of slipping into a compartment on the device, "are lost en masse." Techradar's Mary Branscombe was also impressed. Noting that the venting on the Surface Pro is effective, working to dissipate heat and prevent hotspots from forming, she wrote, "Surface Pro certainly doesn't feel like a laptop crammed into the body of a tablet—although it gives you the power of one." She noted that Microsoft moved the location of the microSD slot from the less convenient spot under the kickstand of the Surface RT to the right side of the Surface Pro, beside its video connector port. She was also a fan of the 10.6-inch display, writing that it "looks beautiful, with true deep blacks and vivid, saturated” colors and of the pen's comfortable feel, tactile eraser and even magnetic connection. Which, if it can't slip inside the body of the tablet, she conceded, is an "elegant alternative." These impressions, again, are first ones based on limited encounters. But until Microsoft launches the Surface Pro in the next week or two and people, with time, decide otherwise, "it looks as if the Surface Pro is, conceptually and practically, a home run," wrote Pogue. "For thousands of people, it will be an ideal mobile companion."</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1358214784382</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:53:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358216502409-91</Id><Title>ARMH new 52-week high today...

PhoneArena reported Friday that Lenovo's forthcoming IdeaPhone K900 might establish a new bar for smartphone processors, judging from impressive benchmarks leaked to the internet. Powered by a 2GHz dual-core Intel Atom processor, the IdeaPhone scored upwards of 27,000 points on the AnTuTu benchmark, leaving competitors like the HTC Droid DNA in the dust with a mere 14,000 average. HTC's device is powered by the quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, but Lenovo's benchmark also eclipses the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 with a 1.6GHz Exynos 4412 processor. It remains to be seen how Samsung's next-generation Exynos 5 Octa processor will fare against the dual-core Intel Atom, but the chip has yet to wind up in any currently announced smartphone or tablet. The report is quick to note there's always a chance the Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 benchmarks are a fake - and competitors are likely hoping that's the case. Assuming these AnTuTu benchmarks are for real, the Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 could impress even further when the handset is out of testing and finally released with an Android build optimized for its powerful engine.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1358221736919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 22:48:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358221965967-95</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH new 52-week high today...

Someone in the press managed to discover a deeply, deeply, and I mean deeply guarded secret: Intel's fabrication yields, economics, viability and future are different from those of the ARM foundries. And they published this secret in an article entitled "Moore’s Law seen hitting big bump at 14 nm". To do so, this member of the tech press utilized two parts of the head rarely if ever used in preparing articles to be released to the public. One part of the head is called the "eyes" and is used to gather information about things right in front of the face.The other seldom accessed part of the head (and known to be off-limits to all but a selected few journalists) is called the brain and it is used to process and interpret the information that comes from the eyes. Using this unique combination, this author managed to to figure out what no one ever suspected ever before. That Intel's and ARMs fabrication are NOT exactly alike. And that one is likely to continue for generation after generation producing better and better performance and profits while the other has already reached the level of diminishing returns and will now coast to a stop. This is truly astounding news and a magnificent job of detective work. But don't expect this information to become commonplace. Because it is very doubtful that many people can duplicate this feat of simultaneously using the little-know eyes with the little-known brain to verify that this difference does exist and that this difference is monumental in size. If fact, when put to the test with a group of Wall Street analysts, not a single one was able to focus on information directly in front of them while at the same time analyzing said information. After the test to a person all of the analysts said, "They look identical to me!" Yet now we are no longer blind. Amazing grace, now we can see! Let us be thankful, therefore, that the single member of the press able to manage such a monstrously difficult feat, also managed to publish it for all to see. Hosannas may now be expressed with enthusiasm and exuberance!!! But be warned: It may be another hundred years before this happens again...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358225443073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 23:50:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358225671581-100</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Fabrication: Good; ARM Fabrication: Not So Good - Trouble at 14nm</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358213760285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:36:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ASML is also about 450mm - not just EUV The Elephant Has Left the Room â�?�? 450 mm is a Go!
