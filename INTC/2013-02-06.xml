Tablets powered by chipsets based on Intel’s x86 architecture are emerging as serious competitors to both the iPad and to Android and Windows tablets that use ARM-based chipsets. Microsoft’s Surface Pro is set to go on sale this Saturday (but has already made an appearance in some Microsoft stores.) The software giant miffed its longtime chip partner when it released the ARM-based version of the tablet (Surface RT) earlier than the Intel-based model, but that may all be forgotten as the Surface Pro glides onto the market. Early reviews are positive, suggesting that Intel’s 22nm Ivy Bridge architecture is more than ready to handle hours of video on the 10.6-inch tablet’s 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. While business buyers may be more interested in the fact that the Surface Pro will run Windows apps, they know their employees will be much more likely to use a product that doubles as an iPad-substitute during personal time. Meanhile Intel’s Atom Z2760 processor is showing superior performance to some ARM-based chipsets, particularly when it comes to power consumption during video processing. The Z2760 powers a clutch of Windows 8 tablets that will be competing with the Surface Pro, including the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2, the Asus Vivo VivoTab Smart, the Acer Iconia W510.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360128628409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 00:30:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360129008210-5</Id><Topic><Title>The Time Has Arrived</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360126820379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 00:00:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Their forward P/E is in the 50s.

You could build tons of things with it – maybe. It depended on the size of your kit. Because the bigger kits had more variety. If you had only the standard-issue rectangular pieces, you could build lots of walls and such that went straight up, and perhaps some pyramidy things – up to a point. Actually, that was the one thing you couldn’t build them up to: a point. But, well, everything had a rather right rectangular look. If you really wanted to increase your options, you needed additional square pieces and the wee ones, and then perhaps some specialized rounded bits for corners and cornices and festive filigree. (Of course, then they got all carried away and created kits that were pretty much good for only one thing, but we won’t worry about that). The point being, it’s great to invent the one rectangular piece and show what you can do with it, but you’re hitting your stride when you can fill out the selection in order to enable a wider range of edifice. Intel demonstrated this step at IEDM last month. Having proven a FinFET for their processors, they took the next step to enable things that aren’t processors. And having to do this is a relatively new requirement. There was a time when you built logic on a logic process and analog on an analog process and memory on a memory process and power stuff on a high-voltage process. Problem is, now everyone wants to mix and match all of this stuff on a single monolithic SoC. So the prior logic Lego now must be supplemented with other Lego shapes to enable all of the stuff that will need to be squeezed together on a single piece of silicon. We’ve sort of been dealing with this for a while, the difference now being that, at 22nm, Intel moved from planar transistors to FinFETs – but only the standard rectangular ones (metaphorically speaking – yes, the fins are still more triangularish than rectangular in cross section). So this year they filled out the rest of the kit with the remaining bits and bobs necessary to create a full SoC. The kit includes a collection of six different FinFET options in three families: - High-speed logic High performance (HP) Standard performance (SP) - Low-power logic Low power (LP) Ultra-low power (ULP) - High-voltage 1.8 V 3.3 V The differences between these guys are mostly straightforward, although some of what’s going on is a tad vague. The high-speed devices both have 90nm gate pitch; it’s the gate length that changes: 30nm for HP, 34nm for SP. When moving to the low-power devices, it’s less clear specifically what changes. They spend some time talking about how great the FinFET architecture is for low power, but that’s not helpful – they’re also using that architecture for the high-speed stuff. I suspect one of the big clues is the note of using a fully-depleted fin (given suggestions that, in some cases, fins are being doped… maybe this is well known and I missed the memo…). They also make reference to junction engineering to minimize leakage. The upshot is that, for the same 90-nm gate pitch/34-nm gate length, the Idsat goes from 0.71 to 0.41 mA/µm and the Ioff goes from 0.59 to 0.37 mA/µm. Move the gate pitch out farther to 108nm, with a 40nm gate length, and you get the ultra-low-power device (with Idsat of 0.35 mA/µm and Ioff of 0.33 mA/µm). They say that the performance they get from these low-power devices is a 50% increase over 32nm planar devices and is a record to date for these operating conditions. Then we move into high-voltage territory. OK, to be fair, this is high voltage for legacy interoperation, not for driving the transformer on that pole outside your office. The 1.8-V device can be used for 1.5-, 1.8-, and 3.3-V operation; the 3.3-V device is for 3.3- and 5-V operation (they don’t specify an upper limit… While we’re assuming this isn’t for 500-V devices… it might be fun to try… once… moreso if it’s on someone else’s budget…). They use a different gate oxide for these guys – a “composite high-Κ oxide,” and a look at their cross-section photos makes it clear that the dielectric is thicker than that of their logic siblings. The geometry changes as well: gate pitch is at least 180nm for 1.8-V devices and 450nm for 3.3-V devices. The gate length pushes out to 80nm and 280nm, respectively. They say that they also achieved 50% better drive current on these as compared to 32nm devices. As to interconnect, they claim to offer 8-11 layers using low-Κ and ultra-low-Κ carbon-doped oxide dielectric, but in their diagram they show 2-6 1x pitch layers, a 1.4x pitch layer, 2 2x layers, 2 3x layers, and 1 4x top layer. Using my arithmetic, that gives up to 12… Metal 1 is different in that it requires double-patterning; none of the other layers does. The top layer is also different in that, in addition to routing global power and ground, it’s used for spiral inductors – it’s significantly thicker than the others. They also have added a MIMCAP: this appears to be a capacitor built, not out of diffusion, but using two adjacent metal layers – metal-insulator-metal (MIM). This affords a capacitor that they say can be packed in higher density. Yes, they have regular diffusion and finger capacitors as well and claim that their precision resistor variation is less than 15%. For the analog jockeys. Finally, they have a selection of SRAM cells, including a high-density/low-leakage (HDC) cell, a low-power (LVC) cell, and a high-performance cell for single-port memory. They also have synchronous and asynchronous dual-port cells. And that pretty much fills out the Lego set. Off the top of my head, only DRAM cells are missing – and I don’t hear a lot of folks wishing they could include them in their SoCs. Just like you’re not going to find GaN or SiC power transistors on there. Of course, Intel has gone to FinFET long before anyone else, so it’s not like many of you will be designing using these specific devices. Unless you’re designing for Intel. For everyone else – well, it’s about as useful for building SoCs as Legos are.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360129251192</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 00:40:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360129389714-8</Id><Topic><Title>Completing the Set: Intel Does FinFETs for SoCs</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360129251192</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 00:40:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>[Here's the exciting conclusion for shills, analysts and Wall Street types who wouldn't understand the details anyway...] "Of course, Intel has gone to FinFET long before anyone else, so it’s not like many of you will be designing using these specific devices.

Every HW platform configuration requires unique platform Firmware development to roll, (I.e., integrate), the platform together. This inherently limits the scale one can achieve with this type of solution (note that every ARM solution provider has an army of SW developers who are required to keep "reinventing the wheel" for each new platform configuration). I believe the reason Microsoft limited the number of designs and companies that they were willing to work with on RT was precisely for this reason. They simply do not have the resources to support more than a few "embedded" design efforts on a production level scale. Ever hear of Plug and play? Supposing you need a different platform motherboard sku with varying I/O peripherals from varying vendors. This is a simple matter for the world of plug and play, and not a re-write of the platforms BSP firmware for each little variation! This little detail has been one of the fundamental reasons why the world of PC's has been able to support the scale (and level of compatibility/interoperability) that it has enjoyed for so many years. And the lack of it in RT systems is likely a fundamental reason why Microsoft has placed constraints on the amount of development support they can offer for RT, and further why there are no such co-development constraints in the Surface Pro case. Intel platform architecture possess, no compromise power efficiency, soon to be best in class mobile performance at those world class levels of power efficiency, a wide spectrum of platform cost points, AND the ability to scale easily Intel's future is very bright. For ARM, not so much. Tip for ARM,... Find a niche somewhere where Intel isn't interested in playing. And check in with AMD for advice on competing head to head with a highly motivated Intel.</Msg><Username>bhy11141</Username><Timestamp>1360160557549</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 09:22:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360160588395-25</Id><Topic><Title>I don't know why people keep comparing ARM vs Intel.

Pro has characteristics not found in any Ultrabook, like the size, weight and ability to operate in portrait mode. Far more interesting than Microsoft's first entry into this category is where the category will be headed using Intel's Atom and forthcoming CPU's on Intel's roadmap. What we can expect to see from this category is thinner, lighter, faster and long battery life and we'll probably see superior offerings from mainstream hardware vendors.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360167415468</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 11:16:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360167429556-42</Id><Title>Mark Haines just interviewed Robert Noyce on CNBC ...</Title><Msg>and Mr. Noyce is considering taking Intel private!</Msg><Username>wallus_weener</Username><Timestamp>1360167429556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 11:17:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360167781732-43</Id><Topic><Title>Mark Haines just interviewed Robert Noyce on CNBC ...</Title><Username>wallus_weener</Username><Timestamp>1360167429556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 11:17:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>beeee esssss!

I am definitely seeing signs of resistance around the $44 mark and Stock Consultant confirms this. ARMH had a price upgrade from Merrill Lynch but still had trouble going anywhere fast today. We could be close to a technical peak like AAPL had around 700. Stock Consultant says 'WATCH for possible breakout above 44.29, no resistance in area just above.' so we see how the next few days go. The other thing to look for at Peaks is when a stock does not follow the general market trend, e.g. it does not rise or even falls when the general market is up.

This group, originally set up by IBM to distribute its chip making technologies, essentially takes a basic process created by IBM and its partners, and then moves it to Globalfoundries and Samsung for high-volume manufacturing. Here are the highlights: Development of 14nm FinFET process technology (creating 3D-like transistors) seems to be on track, most likely with the foundries starting production in 2014 and products based on that production likely to appear by 2015. (Intel is already shipping FinFETs, which it calls "Tri-Gate" transistors, on 22nm but Intel is different in that it primarily is its own customer, with a single basic design, and foundries need to support a much wider range of customers.) Note that the Common Platform version of this process, as discussed by Globalfoundries earlier, combines FinFET technology on the "front-end" with the same "back-end" as its 20nm process. While everyone agrees EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography will be necessary sometime in the future, it is taking longer to develop and facing more issues than expected. Now it isn't likely to be used until 7nm production or even later. Where the Common Platform group once talked about making its processes identical from each of its manufacturers so customers could migrate from one to another easily, the focus now seems to be on creating a core process technology and then letting the individual foundries (Globalfoundries and Samsung) customize them for their specific customers. The migration to 20nm and 14nm production will not create as much cost reduction per transistor, as manufacturers have come to expect from new process nodes. (Typically, you get twice as many transistors per node—Moore's Law—but at a slightly higher cost.) But 20nm adds more cost because it will require "double-patterning" of lithography for the first time, and the 14nm node the Common Platform partners are talking about isn't really a full shrink, as it uses the 20nm "back-end." But executives said they expect to be back on the normal economics in the move to 10nm. Here are some details: Mike Cadigan, VP of IBM Microelectronics, talked about how the Common Platform has evolved over the past 10 years. It has gone from a group designed to create an alternative to foundry leader TSMC to one that now includes the number two and three foundries (Globalfoundries and Samsung Semiconductor), based on technology that comes from IBM research and the other companies. In particular, he pointed to a new semiconductor research and development facility in Albany, NY, built in conjunction with the state and partners, where IBM is now working with its top five equipment suppliers on projects such as developing EUV. Cadigan (above) alluded to the difficulty of moving to the next generation of technology. "All of us are on a treadmill," he said, but suggested the Common Platform model gives its members the ability to leverage work done by the members and their partners. "Our industry is vital to society," he said, noting how silicon is driving everything from smartphones to self-driving cars to new healthcare are devices. Later, in a question-and-answer session, he said that there have been significant changes in how the Common Platform group works over the years. The previous process involved IBM creating the basic technology and putting it to work in its East Fishkill manufacturing plant, then passing on the whole process to its partners. Now, he said, once IBM has the basic technology working, it goes directly to Globalfoundries and Samsung, speeding the time to market. IBM Says Chip-Making Facing Major Discontinuities Gary Patton, vice president of IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center, gave the deep dive into the technology, discussing the challenges facing chip makers in the years ahead. "We're at a discontinuity," said Patton (above), with chip making undergoing a major change. He said this isn't the first time the industry has seen such issues, nor will it be the last. The industry reached the physical limits of planar CMOS and gate oxide, so it had to move to strained silicon and high-k/metal gate materials. Now, he said, we're at the limit of planar devices, so we need to transition to the "3D era," both in terms of transistors themselves (i.e., FinFETs) and in packaging using concepts such as chip stacking. In the next decade, he said, we will reach the limit of atomic dimensions and will need to move to technologies such as silicon nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and photonics. To make all this work, it is important that foundries no longer act just as manufacturing companies, but work with their customers and the tool suppliers in a design/technology "co-optimization," in which the process acts more like a "virtual IDM" (Integrated Device Manufacturer). Patton touched on the need for continued research, talking about IBM's research facilities in Yorktown, Almaden, and Zurich and how for the twentieth year in a row, IBM has been granted the most patents. He talked about the importance of partners as well, in particular pointing to the Albany Nanotech Research Facility, which was built in partnership with New York State and Suny/Albany CNSE, along with Sematech and a host of materials and equipment suppliers. A lot of his talk centered on the challenges facing EUV, which he called "the biggest change in the history of the lithography industry." He noted that if EUV is ready to go at 7nm, it will produce crisper images, and thus better performing chips than other technologies. But there are big challenges. To start with, EUV equipment now has only a 30-watt power source and it needs to get to 250 watts for cost-effective production. That would require a nearly tenfold improvement. Another issue is dealing with defect control on the EUV mask. As he described the process, it seems almost like science fiction: You start by spraying molten tin at 150 miles per hour, hit it with a laser in a pre-pulse to distribute it, blast with another laser to create a plasma, and then bounce the light off mirrors to create the actual light beam and make sure it hits the wafer at the right point. He compared this with trying to a hit a baseball in a one-inch zone into the exact same spot in the stands 10 billion times a day. IBM is working with lithography maker ASML and light source maker Cymer (which ASML is in the process of acquiring) to help speed EUV to market. The research facility in Albany is designed to be a "center of excellence" and IBM is now hoping to get tools in there by April. Patton said this will not be ready for 14nm or 10nm production, but may be for 7nm or later. In the meantime, IBM is doing a lot of work with improving yields using multiple patterning, which involves using multiple masks. At 20nm, this involves double-patterning, where multiple masks are used to create the patterns. But to make this efficient requires a lot of work, so IBM has been working with the tool design (EDA) vendors so chip designers can take a standard cell design flow or create a custom flow, but still be more efficient. At 10nm, he talked about using other techniques, such as sidewall image transfer (SIT) and directed self-assembly, where chemistry helps the layout of the transistor. The idea here is that instead of quadruple patterning, you can still do double patterning, which should be much less expensive. Patton also spent a lot of time talking about how new device structures are needed. Existing FinFETs struggle from performance and variability issues, and but IBM is working on creating narrower bands to improve these issues. At 7nm and beyond, he said, new device structures will be needed, such as silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes have the potential to offer a tenfold improvement in either power or performance, but it has its own challenges, such as the need to separate out metallic from semiconductor carbon nanotubes and to place it on the right place on the chip. IBM recently announced that it now has more than 10,000 working carbon nanotubes on a chip. Another area of interest is improving the interconnects, and Patton said that between 4nm and 8nm, the industry will move to nanophotonics. He discussed IBM's recent demonstration of a chip that combines photonics with silicon. Ultimately, the goal is to integrate 3D and photonics together on a single chip. Patton concluded by talking about a chip he'd like to see with three planes: one with logic with about 300 cores; another with memory (with 30GB of embedded DRAM); and another photonic plane, providing an on-chip optical network. Globalfoundries and Samsung Promise Full Production of 14nm Wafers in 2014 Representatives of both Globalfoundries and Samsung talked about how they were meeting the challenges of moving to 14nm and FinFETs. Mike Noonen, executive vice president of marketing, sales, quality and design for Globalfoundries, talked about how the company is introducing a low-power 20nm process this year. It has already announced its 14XM process, which uses 14nm FinFETs with a more cost effective back-end. He said Globalfoundries expects to have early 14nm production this year, with full production of the 14XM process in the first half of 2014. Among other things, Noonen (above) talked about partnerships at 14XM, including working with Synopsys on design tools, Rambus for interconnects, and ARM with its Artisan physical IP. He said a dual-core Cortex-A9 shows 62 percent power reduction or 61 percent performance improvement on 14XM compared with the foundry's 28SLP process. Looking even further forward, Globalfoundries is expanding its Fab 8 in Malta, NY, and hopes to have full production of 10nm (10XM) in the second half of 2015. K.H. Kim, executive VP of Samsung Electronics, who heads Samsung's foundry operations, said that a lot of people in the industry were skeptical of the Common Platform Alliance's "gate-first" approach to high-k/metal gate manufacturing, but that it was "really successful" in helping the company increase battery life and performance for mobile processors. The company is ready to offer 14nm FinFET technology, as sub-20nm planar technologies cannot deliver acceptable performance. Kim (above) said there are three main challenges with FinFET technologies: dealing with process variations, channel width issues, and 3D modeling and extraction. But between IBM, Samsung, and Globalfoundries, Samsung has the leading number of patents and publications in 3D technology and thus the Common Platform group has addressed these challenges. In particular, Kim talked about an "ISDA process development" to address variation and parasitic resistance; creating a development kit through work with UC Berkeley, CMG and tools vendors Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor Graphics; and licensing IP from ARM, Synopsys, and Analog Bits to make it easier for chip designs to create 14nm System-on-Chip designs. Working with ARM and Cadence, he said Samsung has created the first Cortex-A7 designs with FinFETs, and is ready to offer FinFETs to its customers. This year is mainly a year for validation and design, Kim said, with full production coming next year. He also noted that Samsung currently has two foundries, S1 in Korea and S2 in Austin, Texas. It is building a new fab in Korea aimed at 20nm and 14nm production, which is slated to start operation in late 2014 or early 2015. In a question-and-answer session, Cadigan addressed the issues of moving to 450 mm wafers for producing chip, as compared with the 300 mm wafers that are now common. He noted a new consortium developing 450 mm technology in Albany, NY, and said that while the time is still up in the air, he expects industry adoption of 450mm will be "toward the latter part of this decade." He said he would expect EUV to come to the market first in 350mm and shortly thereafter at 450mm. Noonen concluded that session by calling chip-making "the most complex business in the history of humankind," and it's clear that it involves a series of amazing technology breakthroughs.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360195683279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 19:08:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360195772182-106</Id><Topic><Title>getanid61 &amp; Marsavian</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360090860866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 14:01:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FWIW on 9/4/2012 East warned of global slowdown (ARM: Chip industry to slow this year Warren East warns of economic uncertainty) and stock went down with high volume - than October 23 when earnings were reported ARM reported "record backlog".

Miller at PC Mag [You have to love these guys at the Forum, trying gamely to indulge in the belief that they will quickly follow in Intel's footsteps and be no more than two years behind in the fabrication race. Of course, it doesn't change the fact that Intel is already producing its second generation of FinFET while the ARM world is talking about seeing production in 2015 which means no volume production until 2016. This in turn means that ARM is more likely three or four years behind Intel and that FinFET is a disruptive technology that is going to rock ARMs world in a very negative fashion. Naturally the GloFo marketing guy says that they will have 14nm FinFET production by prolly tomorrow afternoon if not sooner. No matter that they can't currently produce 28nm, they expect us to believe that they will successfully jump two process nodes in a year. Wow, I can't believe the guy's head doesn't explode when he says these things. He should be the GloFo Director of Marketing and Comedy. But just read this article and note the massive technical obstacles that the ARM foundries must conquer to stay within 2 or 3 years of Intel. The list is long and daunting. When all is said and done, it's too little, too late. Intel is going to be carving out huge portions of the mobility market and there is simply nothing that ARM can do about it. It's always been primarily about the fabrication and now it's about FinFET. Intel has it. ARM not. Game over...] [I'm just waiting for the parabolic SAR on ARM to flip.

After falling behind Intel, the world’s biggest foundries are all gearing up to produce these cutting edge switches. And to accelerate the process, some have opted to take an unusual step: marrying the new transistors with an older approach to building the wiring that ties them together on a chip.  The hope is that this hybrid strategy will help foundries make 3-D transistors, or FinFETs, available to most of the world’s semiconductor firms by 2014, a good year earlier than anticipated. That could help close the gap with Intel, which unveiled the first commercial 3-D transistor process in 2011 and likely aims to supply the technology, with few exceptions, only to itself. Intel plans to release the transistors in smartphone and tablet chips tailor-made to compete against the foundries’ customers.   Chipmakers are switching to FinFETs because each time they have shrunk their ordinary, planar transistors, manufacturers have seen a smaller performance gain. FinFETs—which effectively turn the transistor’s current- carrying channel on its side to create a fin—carry more current and leak less of it, making for circuits that perform better and use less power. GlobalFoundries, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), and United Microelectronics have all made it clear that they plan to pursue the technology. They aim to introduce FinFETs at the 14-nanometer-manufacturing-process node—a step, more or less, behind Intel’s 22-nm introduction.   To get there, both GlobalFoundries and TSMC have revealed they’ll take a half step. They will replace planar transistors with a denser array of FinFETs, but they won’t advance the manufacturing process used to build the wiring that connects the devices on the “back end” layers of the chip. As a result, although there will be more transistors in any given area, a good number of them won’t be connected and therefore can’t be used. The chips won’t be much smaller than the 20-nm generation, which is going into production now. That means the foundries won’t be able to create more of them on a single wafer to reduce costs. Nonetheless, GlobalFoundries expects the chips it will produce could be as much #$%$ percent faster or 40 percent less power hungry than the 20-nm generation.   For GlobalFoundries, the advantage of this halfway approach is that it will let the company keep more than 7000 design rules that were developed for the 20-nm planar chip, while changing just 60 or so that are needed to describe the fin, says Subramani Kengeri, vice president of advanced technology architecture at GlobalFoundries. “First- generation FinFET is a huge challenge. There’s no question about it,” says Kengeri. “Adding more risks to that by adding other complexi ties that were not necessarily fin- related was not prudent.” All told, the hybrid approach should allow the company to accelerate production by a year.  TSMC, which calls its FinFET scheme a 16-nm process, says its chips are “similar” in size and density to other foundries’ 14-nm offerings. Later this year, both TSMC and GlobalFoundries hope to create small batches of test chips for customers and are targeting full production in 2014, which will put the companies’ releases more or less on the same schedule as that of Intel’s own 14-nm chips.  “I think this incremental strategy is probably a very sound, safe way of not changing too many things at the same time and developing something they can be sure can be production worthy,” says Chi-Ping Hsu, who heads up research and development for the Silicon Realization Group at Cadence, an electronic design automation firm based in San Jose, Calif.  FinFETs are “a huge challenge for the whole industry,” Hsu says. He estimates that his team at Cadence has already spent some 4000 man-years overhauling computer code for today’s generation of chips so that processor operation can be simu lated in a realistic time frame. FinFETs, which boast stronger electrical effects on their neighbors and have dimensions that can’t be adjusted, are an added challenge. Hsu reckons it will cost the foundries and their partners some US $6 billion to develop the manufacturing prowess and the computational tools needed to make 14-nm and 16-nm chips.  Whether the investment will pay off in the end is unclear, says Sam Tuan Wang, chief analyst for semiconductor foundries at Gartner. “People say if Intel can do it, I can do it. That’s not true,” he says. We may not have to wait long to find out.  This article originally appeared in print as "3-D Transistors for All."</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1360210808484</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 23:20:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360212256175-136</Id><Topic><Title>Common Platform Technology Forum: Chip-Making at 14nm and Below</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360195683279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 19:08:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It’s not clear how much chip designers will demand the 14 nm FinFET process which carries significant costs and marginal advantages over a coming 20 nm node."
