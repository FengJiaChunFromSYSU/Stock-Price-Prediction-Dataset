Guess what, everyone I now that bought a tablet....soon after bought a new notebook. YES, it is the sign of the death of the PC. Though, only in the form factor (white/beige Box) that we are acustom to. More so the PC (personal computer), has transformed, grown up transitioned to new and exciting form factors PC (portable computer). Just wish intel or someone could rename the later form factor as it still identifies with traditional PCs...... Maybe call the new form factor Ultrabook....unfortunately too much association with Netbook. Intel again blunders with "Thunderbolt" branding, sounds tacky and electrical. Yet again NUC (Next Unit of computing), sounds too much like SUCK. Better names for this family of products would help intel much better. Regating the "pentium" brand to low end processors, did nothing but hurt the brand image. They would have been better retiring the "Pentium brand" and bringing it back for re-release in a generation or 3. Yet we have Core i3,5,7 generation after generation, with the public recognising the brand though knowing little about the difference between generation 1 to soon to be generation 4 or 5? For heavens sake....intel take a page out of apple's book....iPOD, MacbookAIR, iTAB, iPHONE.

However, overall related costs will increase by at least US$70-80, and while Intel hopes its brand partners to offer their ultrabooks at a price level in the sweet spot of the market, the sources are concerned that the strategy will greatly shrink ODM profits, despite Intel marketing subsidies. Strong demand for touch panels has recently created a shortage of about 20%, causing touch panels' prices to remain sky-high. Since DRAM is also seeing price rises and with Intel raising prices with Haswell, the sources pointed out that related players will need to absorb all the extra costs to allow their devices to stay at the sweet spot in the market. Although Intel recently increased its marketing subsidies by 20% and promised its partners smooth supply for key components such as touch panels, the sources believe these assistance measures will not benefit the overall business of its partners.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365512690012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:04:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365512963583-13</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Creates more Nightmares; OLd Scheme will not work this Time......Margin hell is absolute at Intel next</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365512690012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:04:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is sampling Avoton Atom chips ahead of IDF Beijing Ratching up the fabs ahead of ARM By Lawrence Latif Mon Apr 08 2013, 14:00 CHIPMAKER Intel has said it has working 22nm Avoton Atom chips it is sampling to customers, with production chips expected to be available in the second half of 2013. Intel has been forced to push its Atom roadmap faster than its Core and Xeon roadmaps due to the increased competition posed by the ARM chip vendors that are lining up to compete in the server market. Now Intel has revealed some details of Avoton ahead of IDF Beijing, saying that the chip will be fabbed on the firm's 22nm process node and is sampling to customers now. Intel also confirmed what many already knew, that Avoton will make use of the Silvermont microarchitecture. The firm said Avoton will be its second generation 64-bit SoC and comes almost exactly a year after Centerton Atom chip. Intel wouldn't disclose specific technical details of Avoton prior to IDF Beijing, however the Avoton represents a big step for the firm as it includes both a change in microarchitecture and process node. Intel has previously said that its Atom chips will surpass Moore's Law in order to keep up with ARM chips. Lisa Graff, VP and GM of Intel's Datacentre and Connected Systems Group said the firm will have working silicon on show at IDF Beijing and the firm is happy with the silicon it has powered up in its labs. What Intel didn't talk about is the power consumption of its Avoton Atom chips, however its previous generation Centeron chips had a TDP figure of 6W and given that the firm is moving to what is now a mature process node and a new microarchitecture, one can safely expect the power consumption figures to be lower than the previous generation. Intel's Avoton Atom chips might not yet be able to compete in outright power consumption figures against ARM chips but Intel can rightly argue that its silicon will be in the hands of server builders months before ARM vendors have something that competes in terms of features. This highlights the problem for ARM vendors. While many chip vendors including Intel's historic rival AMD will have ARM based chips next year, Intel will already have its second generation 64-bit SoC out for many months, and has already talked about specific versions of Atom for different server deployments such as storage and network infrastructure. And perhaps most worrying is Intel's seeming ability to develop and produce new Atom chips on a 12 month to 18 month cycle, one that some ARM vendors might find hard to cope with. Intel said that it expects to have final Avoton Atom silicon in the hands of customers in the second half of 2013. µ</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365512963583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:09:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365513616587-14</Id><Title>Return to growth</Title><Msg>I've held INTC for a long time.

CCUR holds a 30% video-on-demand (VOD) market share and is seeing its profits explode from the new rapidly growing multi-screen video delivery boom. VMED is the largest cable TV operator in the UK and CCUR is beginning to power VMED's Virgin TV Anywhere, which delivers TV and on demand content to VMED's 3.8mm subscribers. CCUR already powers the Xvie multi-screen service of Jupiter, the largest cable TV operator in Japan. CCUR's VOD clients include 4 of the 6 largest cable TV companies in the U.S. and that's not including CCUR recently announcing a huge deal to double the VOD title capacity of an unnamed Top 5 North American pay-TV company. CCUR is currently trading for only $7 with an extremely low enterprise value of only $39.8mm, for an enterprise value/revenue ratio of just 0.62. CCUR acquired their media data intelligence division with 5 patents for $15 million. This leaves only $24.8mm in value for CCUR's two main businesses! CCUR's real-time business alone is worth at least $25mm. They power the simulator devices of countless multi-billion dollar automobile manufacturers and defense contractors! It's latest annualized revenues are $27.6 million! CCUR's most valuable business, their multi-screen video business, with annualized revenue of $33.8mm - is currently receiving no value at $7 per share! CCUR's video solutions reach 50mm homes worldwide! CCUR's EPS has doubled two quarters in a row! CCUR earned 2012 non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 and now has annualized non-GAAP EPS of $0.50, which is not including any revenue/profits from the signing of Virgin Media (VMED), CCUR's largest new multi-screen client in history. SEAC is estimated to report 2012 non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 after the close and it's $11.22 per share!

HP and Intel® have been collaborating for a few years on project Moonshot to bring new levels of density, efficiency and TCO for light weight web workloads such as static web and dedicated hosting. Yesterday, HP unveiled their first generation Moonshot systems and I am excited to see that the first and only production HP ProLiant Moonshot servers available today are based on the Intel® Atom® S1200 processor family. HP chose to lead with the Intel Atom™ processor for many reasons. First, HP and Intel have a long history of collaboration and we have brought many innovations to market first on Intel and HP’s platforms. Second, the Intel Atom S1200 processor is the industry’s only available 64-bit SoC with critical data center class features such as full 64-bit software ecosystem support, ECC and Intel Virtualization Technology - all within an ultra-low power 6W TDP. This means that today the ProLiant Moonshot servers using Atom S1200 can drop into any environment and software applications will run seamlessly on the server without porting needed. The lower power you want, with the software applications you need. Third, this SoC was designed for targeted lightweight web scale workloads, including low-end dedicated hosting, simple content delivery, and offline batch analytics making Intel Atom S1200 the perfect SoC solution for HP Moonshot’s target markets."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365524579806</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 12:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365524820309-51</Id><Title>Two generations of Intel Atom SoC to power HP’s Moonshot servers Cont'd</Title><Msg>Cont'd... Moonshot servers with the Intel Atom S1200 are shipping to customers today and receiving great reviews. We look forward to sharing more results from customers going forward as these implementations go public. We also look forward to seeing Moonshot systems that will take advantage of higher density HP ProLiant Moonshot servers using Intel’s next generation Atom SoC coming later this year. The next gen servers will be built on Intel’s 2nd generation 64-bit Intel Atom SoC, code named “Avoton”. Avoton is built on Intel’s leading 3D tri-gate 22-nanometer (nm) process technology and is based on a new microarchitecture codenamed “Silvermont”. It will feature an integrated Ethernet fabric controller and deliver improvements over today’s Intel Atom S1200 in performance per watt and energy efficiency through a combination of new capabilities, new microarchitecture and leadership manufacturing technology. Avoton is now being sampled to customers and the first systems are expected to be available in second half of 2013. Moonshot servers using Avoton will quadruple the density (4 Avoton SoCs per server) vs. the current generation just announced using Intel Atom S1200. Want to see these two fabulous energy sipping SoCs? Here you go. Avoton is on my right, the Intel Atom S1200 on my left. 2013 is and will be a great year for Intel and HP Moonshot. We have not only enabled the first Moonshot system to lift-off but with Avoton we will also bring HP Moonshot’s customers a revolution in energy efficiency and performance per watt to drive major TCO improvements when processing lightweight web scale workloads.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365524820309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 12:27:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365526218650-52</Id><Topic><Title>Secret INTC Info Revealed</Title><Username>johnsoncarlos692</Username><Timestamp>1365169877284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 09:51:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome informations</Msg><Username>karinalobby</Username><Timestamp>1365526218650</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 12:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365527131383-53</Id><Title>Microsoft up big !!</Title><Msg>should bode well</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1365527131383</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 13:05:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365527646698-54</Id><Title>DOW 15K By End April</Title><Msg>when the earnings season is over and the S#!t hits the fan for a 10-15% correction cause the indexes and the stk prices are overdone here.

They can theoretically all be from different vendors. I doubt that many will buy the chassis from one vendor and the CPU boards from another vendor. The big issue will be "which vendor do you call if the assembled configuration does not work properly?" In practice, I think anyone buying these systems will buy a chassis and CPU boards from the same vendor. That vendor can supply CPU boards based on x86_64, ARM, ..... but the buyer will buy all the same CPU boards unless there is a valid reason to mix. He may particially fill the chassis and then populate later but they will all be the same architecture. Purchase price is not the only factor in determining cost of ownership. The processor agnostic design will be bought by many who just want an x86 microserver and these systems will be the cheapest systems. It does less to level the playing field than you would like. Someone spending corporate money will have to have a reason to buy anything other than a chassis containing Intel or AMD x86 boards. The buyer already has SW and training investments that can be levered with them.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365540539540</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 16:48:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365540750106-94</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's New CEO</Title><Username>jtjgmtbt</Username><Timestamp>1365538365433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 16:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes sense.

You write apps to an API that abstracts away both. I didn't clearly understand what HP meant by software defined server configurations, but its clear they've done some work to make it plug-and-play. While Intel may currently be the only option, they may reduce their prices to compete better and have the aura of better software and systems support, there's a strong open source community mobilized around ARM. You can't overlook the power of persuasion of collective developer sentiment against the status quo in servers where Intel currently dominates the data center. There's a lot of people out there who want to see a more diversified compute cluster in the data center. Moonshot is just a step towards making that happen.

The system becomes processor and OpenStack software agnostic. If you can solve your problem with OpenStack software, then you can use any CPU. I am not arguing against diversity. There are people doing stuff for the Raspberry PI, Cuda, PHI, .... I am just saying that when someone writes a check for some hardware, they have a choice. That choice is good for everyone, even Intel. You and I just have different estimates of how many people will write checks to buy one CPU over the other CPU. I have machines in the lab today where someone thought "this new system is cheaper and will do the job". They are all idling. Some are even powered off. What is the performane per watt on a machine that is powered off? Is the performance per watt zero or infinite? Or is it performance per what?

But for those people who won't let go of the story you can ask them the following. "Intel has a GTM over 60% and runs its factories near full capacity. They are going to double their output production from 2012 to 2016 with new FABS. With all this new capacity that is two years ahead of everybody else, running at 14nm and 450mm wafers (eventually) , do you honestly think 1. These plants will sit idle 2. These plants will be making "stuff" at sub 40% GTM? " The "ARM has won the hearts and minds" mantra is meaningless. This isn't a battle about feelings, or teams or ideology.

Cambrios has some impressive wins and has made good progress. Yet this wager seems to be more about Intel's hedging against rising ITO prices than anything else. Cambrios can potentially lower the materials cost in a touch sensor, but it relies on the expensive and time-consuming production processes associated with the ITO touch sensor supply chain. UniPixel is the latest addition to Intel's hand. Intel evaluated every metal mesh solution known to man before teaming with UniPixel. They would have looked at Fuji, LG Chem, Toppan, DNP, Kyodo, Mirae Nano, Atmel and others. But Intel decided that UniBoss was the right horse for the wager. This speaks volumes to UNXL's claims that they have the only truly additive, copper-based product available. It also speaks volumes to the idea that UniBoss involves a highly scalable production process. With Intel's bet, evaluating UniPixel is no longer a game of trying to figure out how much demand there is for UniBoss. We now have volume commitments from Dell and Intel for 12mn units/yr each, and we know that the numbers can get much larger than that - quickly. It's no longer a competition with Fuji, or XSense, or ITO, it's now just a matter of how much UniBoss UniPixel can produce and how quickly they can produce it.</Msg><Username>atomcow</Username><Timestamp>1365548445571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 19:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365548747295-112</Id><Title>More Intel Good News</Title><Msg>Yesterday Intel announced its updated Redwood Ridge Thunderbolt controllers (adding 4K/DP1.2 support, lower power operation and slightly lower BOM cost) as well as next year's Falcon Ridge family of Thunderbolt controllers. I assumed that Falcon Ridge would ship alongside Broadwell in late 2014 but I just got word that the new Thunderbolt controllers will begin production by the end of this year and ramp volume through 2014. I don't have more specific dates than that, but it's still good news. All Intel is saying about Falcon Ridge is the spec includes a speed bump to 20Gbps per lane up from the current controllers with 10Gbps per lane. Intel's own presentation refers to a single channel/two lane Falcon Ridge controller, delivering no additional bandwidth above existing TB implementations (although there may be practical advantages since you can't easily aggregate all TB channels today). I would assume that we'd see even higher bandwidth implementations but Intel isn't talking about any of that today.

Clearly, Intel has a lot more to offer in terms of chip power than just a plain old Core i3, yet the question remains: when will higher-end SoCs make their way into Intel's NUCs? Soon, at least according to a "leaked" product roadmap obtained by Computer Base.DE, which claims the Core i5 iteration of the NUC is currently code-named "Horse Canyon," while the Core i7 model has been dubbed "Skull Canyon." Both systems offers support for mSATA drives, up to 16GB of memory, and optional WiFI/Bluetooth. As Liliputing's Brad Linder notes, Horse Canyon and Skull Canyon are equipped with 17W chips originally targeted at notebooks and ultrabooks. Nevertheless, they do sip less power than typical desktop PCs, while generating significantly less heat, which is obviously important for small form factor units like Intel's NUC. As TG Daily previously reported, Intel packs a Core i3-3217U processor inside its small 4.6 x 4.4 x 1.6-inch NUC chassis. The machine also boasts a pair of HDMI ports, a trio of USB ports, and an integrated ethernet jack. The system supports 7.1 channel audio and even has a mini-PCI Express card slot and a second half sized mini PCIe slot - allowing users to add additional storage via an SSD. The system is equipped with dual memory slots, supporting up to 16 GB of RAM. The little computer ships with an external power supply (although sans cord) providing 65 W of power.</Msg><Username>smokinghotblitch</Username><Timestamp>1365557260767</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 21:27:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365557369642-121</Id><Title>intel tv news</Title><Msg>businessinsiderDOTcom/intel-media-gets-good-reviews-2013-4 adageDOTcom/article/media/intel-cooks-future-tv-a-potential-mess-cable/240723/ Visualize the TV service you've always wanted: a gorgeous interface that does away with clunky (and often ad-strewn) programming grids; a simple remote that isn't a crushing array of buttons; a cloud-based DVR that doesn't require you to hit "record"; algorithms that learn what you like and recommend new shows; an easy sync with social networks; effortless co-viewing with friends far away; video on tablets, phones and other devices with screens; and the seamless integration of traditional TV and what's on the web.

It's more like Intel doesn't want you to hide it in a cabinet it interferes with Intel's plans to use the camera and facial recognition to sell your data to third parties. Intel needs to wakeup to the growing concerns about privacy by consumers and public officials. Because of consumer privacy abuses by tech companies the State of California is considering legislation that will force companies to reveal all the information that has been collected on individuals and what has been done with it. Transparency will definitely put a damper on rampant privacy abuse and the profits companies make doing it. If Intel thinks they can make a better settop box fine, go ahead, but stop trying to pitch the camera as if it's there for any other reason than the real one, which is to generate incremental revenue selling the consumer's personal data.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365564184155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 23:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365564416219-126</Id><Topic><Title>Due Up at IDF Wednesday in China - Starting in about 2 Hours</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1365548228741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 18:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Company Accelerates Expansion of 22nm Data Center Processor Families; Graphics Innovations, Intel® Wireless Display Coming to Next-Generation Ultrabooks NEWS HIGHLIGHTS •Accelerates expansion of offerings across the data center processor product lines based on Intel's innovative 22nm manufacturing technology. •Aims to revolutionize the server rack design by delivering an Intel rack scale architecture for increased flexibility, density and utilization of servers leading to lower total cost of ownership. •Next-generation, 64-bit Intel® Atom™ processor for microservers, codenamed "Avoton," is being sampled to customers with broad availability expected in the second half of this year. •4th generation Intel® Core™ processors are now shipping to customers and will launch later this quarter.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1365564416219</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 23:26:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
