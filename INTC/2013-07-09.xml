Has a single analyst mentioned that Intel's tablet sales are doubling each quarter? Well, no because that would rain on their parade of doom and gloom announcements regarding PCs. Or do you ever hear an analyst saying that servers are dying? Or one analyzing Intel's expanding datacenter revenue growth? Or talking about Intel's SSDs, software or Thunderbolt? How is it that they can leave all of these considerations out of the equation and conclude that all of Intel's future will be decided by PC sales? How can they conclude that a 14 dollar drop in ARM's stock will have NO benefit to Intel? How can they conclude that Silvermont, Haswell, Bay Trail and Airmont will have no effect on Intel's sales and revenues? All I can say is that these are not only not smart people but are not knowledgeable people either. When someone the other day said that they didn't know anyone who uses social media I thought, "Now there goes Wall Street. They are so old and disconnected that they have no idea what is going on in the world of computing". PCs are transcending. But the people on Wall Street aren't.

Without a lot more detailed info, some of which is not knowable to us mortals at this moment, it is very hard to make a model of Intel revenues/margins to answer the near term transitional questions. Ashraff has done some good work there, but at a detailed level it is a process in work. Fundamentally, Intel is traditionally three large organs: (1) PC Client Group at about 70% R and (2) Servers at about 20% and (3) yes there's also "other". By itself this instructs us that a -x% reduction in PC's can be compensated by a +(7/2)x% increase in server demand. I view this is approximately a steady state at present (these two terms approximately offset one another, perhaps slightly negative based upon past few quarters), though projections for server growth are quite impressive (people talk about 12% to 16% per year). This can offset a - 3.4% to -4.5% decline in PC's, but Intel's exposure to PC decline may well be greater than that. Now throw in the 10% of "other" This may include rapidly growing components like Tablets and Smartphones. This is a tiny component of Intel's overall R at the present time, so I doubt it can compensate the first term. So, in the transition, you need to know a lot about the company. This is a very coarse grained model, and one needs to consider management of fab costs, R&amp;D, breakout tablets from phones from PC's in detail, etc. But, in the long term, a few years out, "other" will become 50% of the revenue, Servers perhaps 40% and PC's become 10%. Overall revenue should grow significantly. The view of the analysts is that Intel is dominated by (1) PC's and the rest (2)+(3) is not presently offsetting the decline. They may be right for a quarter or two. But this in no way implies a $20 valuation on Intel, given the future outlook. And, we may find next week that they are dead wrong.</Msg><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1373371522599</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 08:05:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373371671753-20</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P UPGRADES OPINION ON SHARES OF INTEL TO BUY FROM HOLD</Title><Username>jctailman</Username><Timestamp>1372861108408</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:18:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post.

Samsung recently introduced its Galaxy Tab 3 tablets, all of which use Intel's Clover Trail+ line of SoC processors — developed by teams led by Intel in Jerusalem. And while many devices (including those made by Apple, Qualcomm, and many others) have "Israel Inside" technology, the development of Cloverview SoC's had some unique aspects, according to Aviad Hevrony, the front end design manager for Intel Israel's Cloverview team. In an interview, Hevrony and senior members of his 100-plus Cloverview team discussed one of the biggest engineering challenges of their career: developing a chip that would allow Samsung's devices to run both Android and Windows, while supporting low power consumption and light form factors. Intel Israel has been working on SoC systems for over four years, first developing them for netbooks, a market that was quickly eclipsed by tablets, said Hevrony. "After the introduction of the iPad it was clear where the industry was going, so we began trying to develop our own SoC technology for tablets." The Israel team led the effort, with major assists from Intel teams in Bangalore in India, and Austin and Folsom in the US.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373376554201</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:29:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373376926625-33</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's tablet challenge: How Israel helped lay the foundations of its Samsung-led fightback</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373376448421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:27:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC red already</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373376926625</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373376998680-34</Id><Topic><Title>PCs Aren't Dying - They Are Transcending</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373347961135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 01:32:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unquestionably mobile products will become an increasing share of Intel's revenue but PCs (desktops, laptops, notebooks and Ultrabooks) remain the device most use to do real work. The problem for PCs in the first half of the year is that Microsoft did nearly everything they could to kill the desktop and laptop business by forcing the Win 8 metro user interface on the traditional PC market. This made a slightly soft PC market fall into the abyss while the public waits for Microsoft to fix the problem. Fortunately Microsoft will release an improved version by next month and soon thereafter there will be improvements to laptop touchpads to improve the user experience for those not having touch screens. I look forward to using Haswell and Bay Trail tablets but no way will I give up the power of a desktop or a full 64 bit Windows laptop.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1373376998680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:36:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373377023023-35</Id><Topic><Title>Reality Check</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373376082744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:21:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>both 24 one now 23 and one now 38.5 where would you rather your $24 shares were now? idiot.....................</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373377023023</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:37:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373377089717-36</Id><Title>TSMC Moves to Double-Patterning, Double the Cost</Title><Msg>"While TSMC has been using single-patterning lithography based on ArF immersion for the 28 nm and older processes, it will introduce a double-patterning technology, which splits the pattern pitch formed in the first lithography in half, for the 20 nm process."

Arm and Intel can both go up, both go down, or any other way you can think of. There may be some correlation with earnings, but maybe not. It's all perception and how the computers algorithms are programmed. They may be programmed to sell all the semi equipment makers together at a certain level, or buy. I have no idea. The only thing I do know is to buy stocks when they seem 'cheap' and their prospects look 'good'. That's why I bought Intel. It's been stuck in the same place for years now, so I didn't think it would go much lower, and they have a lot of new good stuff coming out. But who knows what the competition is really doing, and at what price, or what the business relationships are, or who owes who a favor. Too many variables and a lot of them are unknown by me. And what is 'cheap'. I took a chance, and so far it isn't paying off. I've made plenty of mistakes, and this could be another one, but it's too soon to tell.

My guesstimate that PC Client goes to 10% is probably over-the-top. I'd say 30% is more likely. To get there in the simple (and really, grossluy oversimplified) model I described all you need to do is hold PC Client fixed and double overall R with the servers and "other." My point is that in this transition, unless Intel has carefully understood their transition (which I assume is the case) we could be surprised. However, I strongly resent the analysts projecting 10% drops in R by exaggerating Intel's exposure and neglecting the compensating terms in the equation. Talking it down to $20 may be possible in a world of lemmings, but it is CORRUPT. I travel worldwide a lot and nothing confounds me more than dragging around a Dell Inspiron laptop that's way too heavy, very slow to wake up, short battery life (requiring the charger and a pack of international plugs, though most hotels loan these, at a price, but not always), that had a "bouncing" keyboard until I found an app online to fix it that I guess Muchael Dell missed, and that is actually too small, even with a large laptop screen, to effectively wotk at. I find I have to carry a mouse and external keyboard if I plan to get anything srious done. So a tablet would suit me just fine, but it needs to run ppt, office, and other apps I need. I work at home on my desktop, which is another Dell abomination. In bashing MSFT (which wholly deserves such) you are leaving out Dell which has shipped a lot of junk over the years.

This issue was brought to my attention by a friend who worked on the ATOM design team. Basically, whenever the CPU issues a cycle for I/O, memory, etc, the cycle has to be claimed downstream on the bus. For instance, if you issue an I/O read, it goes out on the Front Side Bus. Because it's an I/O instruction, the north bridge passes it on because there is no I/O in the north bridge (except AGP which is a special case.) The cycle then gets sent to the south bridge. This is called a subtractive decode because the north bridge didn't claim the cycle and "subtractively," the assumption is that something downstream on the bus will claim the I/O cycle. On the south bridge, the I/O cycle can get claimed in one of several ways: 1. If there is a PCI-PCI bridge that has an I/O aperture containing the address of the I/O cycle from the CPU, the PCI bridge will claim the cycle and forward it to the next PCI bus. 2. A PCI device on the bus can claim the cycle. 3. The I/O cycle can time out and be forwarded to another bus downstream. The forwarding bus must then wait for any and all downstream buses to claim or reject the cycle. The gist of this is that for every I/O cycle that is issued, several bridges may have to arbitrate that one cycle. Now, bear in mind that I/O cycles are way, way, way, way slower than CPU cycles so in the time it takes one I/O cycle to be processed, hundreds of thousands of CPU clocks might go by and the CPU is stuck waiting for the I/O to complete. Nothing else gets done and a lot of power is wasted. It's a horrid, highly inefficient architecture.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1373381355326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 10:49:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373381362743-99</Id><Title>I hope you are watching the action in Alcoa</Title><Msg>The Street touts their earnings calling it positive while the stock is down almost 2% today.

But the times are changing, with the expansion of region’s talent pool, Chip powerhouse now expects Asian engineers to help design processors that will be used in smartphones, tablets and PC’s. intel logo Intel’s Malaysian Facility Currently, Asia accounts for 80 percent of the packaging and testing of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) products. In 1972, the chipmaker opened its first facility outside the U.S. in the northern island of Penang, Malaysia. The facility is now one of Intel’s biggest technology development centers. Intel’s Malaysia Design Centre has played an important part in the development of the fourth-generation processor known as Haswell, which was launched in June. Apart from this, the center is also supporting the development of current and future generation Clover Trail, Bay Trail and Broadwell platforms. Apart from Malaysia, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has also opened centers in India, Taiwan, China and Vietnam with investments of more than $10 billion. These centers employ more than 20,000 people, which is one-fifth of the company’s total headcount. Intel’s Future Plans In a recent interview given to The Wall Street Journal, Robin Martin, vice president of Intel’s technology manufacturing group, and Christopher Kelly, head of Intel’s Malaysia Design Center, discussed the company’s plans in Asia. As per Mr. Martin, Asia is a huge market and is growing consistently. The logistics and infrastructure in the region is also improving, so “it makes sense for us to grow the seeds that we’ve sown here.” Presently, the Malaysian facility is responsible for chips used in smartphones, tablets, and SOCs (system on chips), but as the numbers grow, the company plans to rope in Vietnam because of the cost structure there.

And INTC will say there is not a correlation between the stock price and these compensation plans--BS! What was supposed to increase the stock price has in fact actually had the opposite affect. Until the Powers actually have their own real financial "skin the the game" all your posts on products, compressions, future direction, etc. are at best simply pablum.

You can read a whole Intel SSD block into memory in that time. That timing seems to be way high. Agner Fog's Instruction Table for Atom (Saltwell) shows that an IN or OUT instruction takes 8 uops and an additional 64 from uop ROM. None of these 100,000 stalls visible on the Anandtech benchmark power graphs of the running benchmarks. If a CPU issues a IO instruction, the CPU execution will continue until there is a register scoreboard stall. That could happen but is under some control by the original software designer and the compiler used. Only a pretty inexperienced programmer would insert serializing conditions into his code. If he happened to do that AND his SW was a success, the Intel performance groups would let him know and it would be fixed. I wouldn't worry about it.

It demonstrates the fact that CPU speed is orders of magnitude different from I/O speeds, esp when talking to a peripheral" I just gave some actual numbers that showed that your "fact" was inaccurate. You described an IN or OUT instruction as issued by the CPU and then stirred in a description of a system level IO as it relates to the higher level system operations (disk read/write). IN or OUT instructions are probably 10x or 20x slower. On an in-order implementation CPU (Saltwell), these would be punishing. On an out-of-order implementation CPU (Silvermont), these are likely hidden and operate in parallel to other instructions. "Do you really think most software engineers know what a serializing I/O transaction is?" Many SW engineers are not aware of performance issue related to serializing instructions. The reason is that very few of them deal with code that executes those instructions. The IO instructions are isolated in kernels and drivers. SW engineers who write kernels and drivers know about them (at least the employed ones do).</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373390352745</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:19:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373390594010-132</Id><Topic><Title>INTC back in upward trend- Nuff screwed royally!!!!</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1373388827608</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:53:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wish.

The new buzz word is "Cannibalization" which sounds pretty bloody and ugly but all it means that some "consumers and NOT the businesses" that do not need a PC or a Laptop, they will buy a Tablet instead. So what he forgets to add is that INTC was not in that market and now it would be eating ARM and QCOM's lunches with faster Chips capable of running Windows 8 and 8.1; so we will make more money however our "global" margin may come down a bit.... 2. OUR PC business is strong as with an improving economy, there will be more demand for "Business" PCs, Laptops and Mobile Phones so our Sales will be up.... 3. With almost everyone going on "Cloud" someone has to sell them Chips to enable the Servers as MSFT, ORCL, ASP, IBM, AMZN, CSCO, HP, DELL ALL rely on Intel more than anyone else to Power their Cloud Servers. SO once again a desperate sell side Analyst with 300 million Intel shares short is trying to save the day for his clients as they listened to him and his ilk and shorted the hell of INTC in the past six months just before the earnings; "while we are at the quiet period so we can not reply". SO screw this stupid S0B and Buy All You Can On This Dip.

But the times are changing, with the expansion of region’s talent pool, Chip powerhouse now expects Asian engineers to help design processors that will be used in smartphones, tablets and PC’s. Intel’s Future Plans In a recent interview given to The Wall Street Journal, Robin Martin, vice president of Intel’s technology manufacturing group, and Christopher Kelly, head of Intel’s Malaysia Design Center, discussed the company’s plans in Asia. As per Mr. Martin, Asia is a huge market and is growing consistently. The logistics and infrastructure in the region is also improving, so “it makes sense for us to grow the seeds that we’ve sown here.” Presently, the Malaysian facility is responsible for chips used in smartphones, tablets, and SOCs (system on chips), but as the numbers grow, the company plans to rope in Vietnam because of the cost structure there. Intel Corporation employs around 2,000 engineers in Malaysia, 3,000 engineers in India, 3000 engineers in China and 1000 in Taiwan. These are the regions where “our rapidly growing markets are” says Mr. Kelly. Each of the facilities is capable of performing tasks from “design to manufacturing test with a slight twist.” Bangalore team design work for servers while the team at Penang do chipsets and central processing units. Chinese unit is involved in the platform and software developments, reveals Mr. Kelly. According to Mr. Martin, the bulk of the hiring will be in Vietnam as the company is “starting to move more of our SOCs products there.” Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has around 1000 engineers in Vietnam and plans to increase it to 4000 once the process is fully ramped up.

Windows RT has been responsible for mass consumer confusion, and it lacks the backwards-compatibility with legacy Windows applications since it runs on ARM architecture. If Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s products can outperform ARM and match its power consumption, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) would effectively have the green light to eliminate Windows RT altogether. This would allow Microsoft to further streamline the Windows 8 user experience and could potentially translate into improved reception. Unfortunately, from ARM's perspective, the Windows on ARM opportunity may be gone before it's arrived. The bigger picture Not only will Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) be making a splash on the Windows side of things, it will also be working to grow its market share on the Android ecosystem. Although Android is known to be processor architecture agnostic, Intel remains disadvantaged against the ARM competition since existing Android apps aren't primarily optimized for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s x86 architecture. The hope is that Bay Trail's expected boost in performance will compensate for any performance hindrances this discrepancy may cause. Additionally, if Intel begins to gain meaningful Android market share, Android developers could begin to make the switch and start programming specifically for Intel's x86 architecture. Aside from how Intel performs on Android in the real world, you could always get excited about those $200 Bay Trail-powered Windows 8 tablets on the horizon.

Answer this question and you can go free: Q: If an SMI, an exception and a hardware interrupt occur simultaneously, which takes precedence and why? What if these events happen during an incoming bus master transfer. How is cache coherency maintained, especially if the bus master transfer is into the shadow RAM where the SMI handler exists? Remember, this area can house the legacy VGA frame buffer, unused shadow RAM, the SMI handler and ROM space.

It blew 64 bti and gave the lead to AMD. Then the recession happened and AMD nearly folded. And then the smartphone/tablet markets exploded for ARM. What high functioning companies like Intel needs are real competitors and goals to achieve. When they don't have these you get the aimlessness you got last decade. Now Intel is more poised, more focused, and more determined to success than its competitors. Anytime you want to discuss the packaging industry let me know. I spent ten years in it.

Over the next ten years I'd rather own Intel than any packaging company stock , that's for certain.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373422536689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 22:15:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373422661342-242</Id><Topic><Title>Xilinx tapes out 20nm - Xilinx is with TSMC</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1373421173361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 21:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"SAMPLES will be available in the FOURTH QUARTER for the chips that Xilinx estimates could boost system performance 50 to 100 percent over those with today's 28nm parts"....Would be very interested in their yields.</Msg><Username>clemsyn</Username><Timestamp>1373422661342</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 22:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373422679614-243</Id><Topic><Title>Most predicting Intel will have to guide down their 2nd half projections</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1373401889761</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 16:31:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It doesn't matter, it will only make next year's number that much easier to attain.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373422679614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 22:17:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373422983077-244</Id><Title>Who is right?</Title><Msg>In one corner we have Wallis, Ashraf, Ossobucco, and the other cheerleaders.

INTC is on my 100% 401K portfolio now (and more). This is the best opportunity to short-cut my retirement account for an early retirement that I have ever seen in my life.... I suggest all to look beyond the current quarter, to 5 or 6 years down the road.... Intel is un-stoppable, as far as I can tell....

I believe that this could be Nokia's shot at not only becoming relevant in the tablet market, but it could propel the firm to a market leader in this space. Why Windows RT Makes No Sense Windows RT - the OS, not the underlying runtime engine for the Metro UI - plain sucks. Contrary to popular belief, not everybody wants to replace a full Windows PC with a much more limited mobile OS. People like to print to their printers, use their traditional USB peripherals, run desktop applications, play their classic video games, and essentially have the best of both worlds. The unique advantage that Windows 8 has over any other platform is that in the "Metro" mode, it's a very competent tablet-oriented OS, but when real work needs to be done, a quick tap gets you into the full desktop" [A Nokia tablet running Bay Trail sounds good!]</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1373427883001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373428289026-256</Id><Topic><Title>Would some clueless clone please answer the question.
