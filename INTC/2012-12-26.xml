Amongst these are rumors that they are negotiating with Intel and that they are looking to invest directly in a fabrication plant in the New York area. To understand what these rumors could mean, it is important to understand the chip fabrication landscape. There are three leading electronic process development efforts going on the world today that can be categorized as leading edge. They are Intel, TSMC and the IBM Alliance. The IBM Alliance includes major chip developers IBM, Global Foundries, Samsung and a number of other smaller players. This means that Apple currently is designing chips for IBM Alliance technologies and it would be simplest for them to continue to do so. It just so happens that there is a joint Fab effort in upstate New York that is run by IBM Alliance companies IBM, Global Foundries and Freescale Semiconductor. It would be relatively easy for Apple to get involved in the effort there and have more control over their fabrication destiny. While becoming an active member of the IBM Alliance process technology and fabrication consortium is an obvious reason for Apple to be interested in upstate New York, it isn't the only possibility. They could also be interested in the area for the same reasons that the IBM Alliance has an effort there: favorable taxes and regulations from the state of New York and access to a sizeable technical talent pool in the New England region. So, it isn't absolutely impossible that they are exploring a partnership with TSMC similar to the one they have with Foxconn for assembling their hardware. The real question is why are they talking to Intel? The answer to this is that they likely are worried about making a big investment in process technology that will not be competitive in the next few years. Intel has the best fabrication technology period, end of story. Further, there is some risk that IBM and/or TSMC will not be able to continue the huge investments necessary to keep up with Intel's breakneck pace. This is another reason why TSMC is an unlikely choice. Not only would it be more work to ally with TSMC, they have the lowest performing process technology of the three. This leads me to believe that Apple is weighing the alternatives of becoming a partner in the IBM Alliance and purchasing their chips from Intel going forward. They are weighing the per unit cost of going with Intel against the risk of becoming invested in the very costly business of electronic IC fabrication. from fidgewinkle on Apha</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356535832648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 10:30:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356536148719-21</Id><Topic><Title>By the middle of 2013 Intel will have 2-3 empty 22/14nm fabs.</Title><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1356478637635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 18:37:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes indeed.

ARM foundries are still unable to produce enough 28nm capacity to satisfy demand. 2.) Opinions of 20nm planar technology have now reached a consensus level that the technology is noncompetitive with FinFET and therefore doesn't have the economics to be viable. 3.) The ARM foundries are therefore left with two equally ugly options. Stick with a doable move to 20nm planar leading to production of a inferior product that leaves Intel a huge opening into the mobile world. Or attempt the almost impossible two process level jump to 14/16nm FinFET that would take three years even if successful. 4.) The other option which appears to be the most reckless due to the extreme cost is to do both at the same time. This appears to be the approach that has been settled upon. There is almost no chance that this is going to end well for ARM. The stakes are immense and no ARM roadmap appears to have a good chance of success. Only two foundries remain players at this point in time due to the huge costs of building new fabrication plants: Samsung and TSMC. It appears that this will soon be just Samsung. With Samsung competing with its own customers, this leaves no viable ARM foundry choice for companies such as Apple. ARM has reached the fabrication tipping point and Intel's 2013 roapmap provides them little opportunity to avoid the abyss...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356537023674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 10:50:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356537189054-26</Id><Topic><Title>wallisweaver, gonna spend Christmas on Yahoo boards LOLOL</Title><Username>intciscrud</Username><Timestamp>1356463859366</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:30:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is good for 30!

The chip is 97 mm^2. With a new 32nm process at Samsung, still in a learning curve, the yield is probably 250 good parts per wafer. That wafer at Samsung has a cost of about $5000 including depreciation. That pretty close to a $20 part at cost. Samsung knows they have Apple by the soft parts, so they would have to be dumb as a box of rocks to sell that wafer for anything under $10,000...and probably $15,000. So the A6 part costs ~$20 and sells for $40-60. Don't believe the #$%$ from iSuppli about a $27 chip. They are very wrong. If intel made the same part with no changes on a fully depreciated, high yielding 32nm line, they would yield about 400 good parts on a wafer that cost $3000 (no depreciation). That's $7.50 cost. Intel selling the part for $25 would get 70% gross margins. Imagine for a minute that same part built on a 22nm line. We would be back to $5000 wafers (damn depreciation). The chip size would go to about 50mm^2 and the yield would be much higher just due to smaller die size. About 800 good parts per wafer would make the cost ~$6.25. Selling that part at the current Samsung cost of $20 would give Intel a 69% margin. This low margin mobile chip thing is just a crock. Even today a chip from TSMC with a $5 cost sells to the fabless guy for a 50% margin or $10. Maybe the fabless guy can get 40% margin or $16.66. The overall margin from TSMC to the end customer is 70%.</Msg><Username>amdroaddkill2010</Username><Timestamp>1356537307919</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 10:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356538736445-28</Id><Title>So when Apple Intel deal is announced, how much panic short covering will there be?</Title><Msg>I say Intel could push to 40 just 30 days after it becomes known as fact.

I am using one right now. It is called a Samsung ATIV Smart PC. It is a detachable PC, so it has a 11.6" tablet that you can detach from the keyboard dock. This type of PC along with new breed of "Convertible" PCs like the Lenovo Yoga or the Dell XPS 12 are just starting to hit the market with the introduction of Windows 8. The data and stock analysts are looking at sales of PC from last year when PCs had no touch capabilities. In 2013 and beyond, when newer and slicker PC convertibles and detachables come out, you will find that consumer (especially students and professionals on the go) will opt get one of these over a tablet due to their dual purpose of being both a PC and a tablet. On top of PC pickup, I think Intel will make great inroads into the smartphone and small Android tablet market. Asus will be coming out with 7" intel-based tablet and Motorola will come out with new smartphone for US market. On top of this, Intel can do foundry work on the side....Cisco and Apple are potential customers. The foundry work for these two alone will add around $7 billion to revenue. If Apple decides to use Intel in their iPad and/or iPhone, revenue will increase even more.</Msg><Username>jcdinh</Username><Timestamp>1356561654607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 17:40:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356561688738-80</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL deal is virtually assured</Title><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1356560181479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 17:16:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel has been averaging 10% y/y growth for the past 5 yrs despite the so called death of the PC. Pundits have it wrong, and the previous quarter slowdown had more to do with macro concerns and consumers holding off on buying until newer touchscreen convertible and tablet models became available. It looks like the slowdown wasn't all that bad for intel despite it all, having handily beat estimates in Q3, and they have yet to warn for Q4 which is coming to a close now, despite lowered estimates from analysts. If Intel is successful with mobile in 2013 and beyond expect the 10% growth to expand upward as they cannibalize tablets and takeover smart phones. At today's extremely low valuations Intel is likely headed toward big gains in the coming months, especially now with 6 billion in buy backs coming.

Most laptops have horrible displays which change colors as you push the screen forward and back. The Yoga is a "convertible" and can switch between a standard laptop, two "stand" modes, and tablet mode. It has a gorgeous, bright, IPS display. My main dislike is the aspect ratio, which is 16:9 instead of 16:10. Only Mac laptops have a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is unfortunate because they aren't available with touch screens and have issues running Windows in Bootcamp. For tablet use, the Yoga is large. It can be used on your lap as a tablet, but it's unwieldy to hold it up for long. The 16:9 aspect ratio means that it's awfully long and thin in portrait mode. It works best in the "stand" modes (especially for movie viewing) and laptop mode. The Yoga's boot time is ridiculous. It's the fastest device I own, booting in 10 seconds or less. From standby, wait time is 1-2 seconds. On the Yoga I spend more time using the traditional desktop mode than the metro interface, but that may change with time as more apps become available. Netflix in the metro interface is great. Desktop mode is quite usable with the touchscreen and trackpad; I often reach to the screen to move a window or scroll a web page. Touch is definitely a winner with Windows 8. With respect to my T60p, the Yoga is about twice as fast and has much more memory capacity. The T60p has a gorgeous 15", 4:3 IPS display but it's a bit dim in it's old age. Overall the Yoga is more responsive, much lighter, thinner, brighter, faster, better battery life (5-6 hours) - an improvement in most ways except screen size and aspect ratio. Unlike iPad and Android tablets, the Yoga isn't really designed to be "always on / always connected", at least I haven't tried that and I have it set to go into standby when the lid is closed. The Yoga and other PC convertibles are laptops first. I can't speak to the Windows 8 tablets that have keyboard docks, such as the interesting-looking Samsung Ativ series, as I haven't tried them. The 128gb SSD storage isn't large enough for me, however there is an open mSATA slot where you can add another SSD. You can add more memory up to 8GB. Also Lenovo has recently released a "patch" that increases the amount of free space on the SSD significantly. You don't even have to reboot :-) Although Windows 8 has received a lot of bad press, I believe that it will revitalize the PC industry to some extent, and provide many options for people like me that are looking for a device that is more powerful than a tablet while still being portable and touch-friendly. Soon many laptops will have touch screens, and the quality of the screens will improve because convertibles like the Yoga that function in tablet mode can't afford to shift colors when you move them around. Check out the Yoga, and it's little brother the Lenovo Twist, both of which are great laptops first, and tablets second. The "stand" modes are great too. Dell makes a 12.5 inch convertible with a rotating screen. There are also many laptops coming available that don't convert to a tablet mode but have gorgeous IPS touch screen displays, such as the 15.6" HP Spectre XT Touchscreen. I've ordered one of these as the Yoga's screen at 13.3" isn't quite large enough for me, so I may return the Yoga. Products like the Microsoft Surface are interesting, but it's too much a tablet and not enough a laptop for me. I have a Nexus 7 tablet and just don't use it that much. For me, a Windows laptop with tablety features like the Yoga makes the most sense, complemented by a smartphone.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356575633907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:33:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356576202338-91</Id><Title>Motorola RazrI review from a person that owns one, Intel inside (very exciting)</Title><Msg>I have had this device for just over a month now and I have to say I am very impressed with it. The "quirks" in the design, such as the slightly raised casework around the glass make perfect sense when you use it. However, the design trim around the camera does look pretty naff. But I don't spend that much time looking at the back of the phone. Overall I like the design and the fact its hardly any difference in size to the Nexus one I owned before, yet the screen size is 4.3" - excellent. The trend for ever larger phones is lost on me, this is big enough thank you. Good points:- It is very slick in operation. The phone has never crashed in the time I have owned it. Battery operation is 1 day comfortably with normal use, but intensive use, such as several hours on games or facebook will get you reaching for the charger within a day - but at least you do have to try. Nexus one would routinely torch the battery in 12-16 hours on normal use. SD card slot, major bonus! The screen is bright and, while not a "retina" display, it's clear and easy to read. Bad points:- You can't use BBC iPlayer because the BBC media player app does not install. SD card only accepts up to 32Gb. Camera is not the best in low light, colours lack saturation and accuracy. All apps store on the phone memory, there is no option to move to the SD card, but at least there's 5Gb of storage on board to use. I wonder how well this phone will be supported for android updates, something Motorola have been very slack with in the past. Overall I am very happy with my choice and even happier that it is not Apple or Samsung. To answer the question above the phone records and plays back at 1080, so video files of this size should be OK.</Msg><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356576202338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:43:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356576542864-92</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola RazrI review from a person that owns one, Intel inside (very exciting)</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1356576202338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:43:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I found a chart showing that T Mobile, Orange and others are giving this phone away for FREE with a contract.

On another mobile front, the x86 giant will show Haswell Ultrabooks at the Consumer Electronics Show and discuss a sub-10W variant. Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3." Intel compared a Windows 8 tablet using Clover Trail with a Microsoft Surface tablet running Windows RT on Tegra 3. The systems were hooked up to meters measuring consumption on the processors’ power rails on a variety of jobs. The Nvidia chip uses four main and one helper core. Brookwood said Windows RT does not use the helper core as extensively as Android. Intel did not show Clover Trail’s performance running Android. In the second half of 2013, Intel will roll out Bay Trail which is expected to use the first out-of-order Atom cores to bolster performance. It will also roll out Haswell, a new 22-nm PC processor geared for a variety of systems including ultrabooks. Intel “hasn’t given up on Ultrabooks by any means,” despite sluggish market uptake to date, said Brookwood. “They are convinced ultrabooks represent a journey,” Brookwood said. “They haven’t been able to quite deliver all the features and form factors they wanted to yet, but they think Haswell will give them the muscle they need” and better than all-day battery life, he added. Intel is expected to show at CES a reference design using a Haswell chip that consumes less than 10W and fits into an Ultrabook as thin as an Apple iPad.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356578191970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:16:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356579099350-98</Id><Title>Clover Trail dominates and Ultrabooks as thin as the ipad</Title><Msg>From the EETIMES Intel claims latest tablet SoC beats Nvidia Tegra 3 Rick Merritt 12/20/2012 6:25 PM EST SAN JOSE, Calif. – Intel claimed its latest tablet SoC outperforms the Nvidia Tegra 3 while consuming less power.

Intel’s Clover Trail, a dual-core Atom SoC for tablets, consumes as much as a half a watt less that Tegra 3 on some tasks, Intel told a group of analysts recently. In particular, the Imagination Technologies graphics block on Clover Trail eats less energy than the rival Nvidia block, the company said. “The tablet performance is as good with Clover Trail as with ARM SoCs if not better and now the surprising thing is they are using less power,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal of market watcher Insight64 (Saratoga, Calif.). “I’ve always been a little critical of that Atom core because I think they went a little too far in emphasizing power savings, but even so Clover Trial is beating Tegra 3." Intel compared a Windows 8 tablet using Clover Trail with a Microsoft Surface tablet running Windows RT on Tegra 3. The systems were hooked up to meters measuring consumption on the processors’ power rails on a variety of jobs. The Nvidia chip uses four main and one helper core. Brookwood said Windows RT does not use the helper core as extensively as Android. Intel did not show Clover Trail’s performance running Android.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356579099350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:31:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356579113905-99</Id><Topic><Title>Over 14,000 $22.50 call contracts traded today... speak well for upward motion...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1356576877025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:54:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harder to tell .... For each option transaction, there is a buyer and a seller. Someone today initiatied EITHER a "BUY " or a "SELL" trade of 14,000 contracts in order to generate these new contracts. The BUY/SELL order could be to OPEN new contracts or to CLOSE existing contracts. The 14,000 contracts is below the open interest so the trade could be to close as well as open. What does it mean if the order was a: BUY TO OPEN? An out of the money new buy would be bullish. Someone expects Intel to finish above the $22.50 strike. BUY TO CLOSE? Closing an existing position that they had earlier SOLD TO OPEN, would tend to be bullish since it looks like they think the Intel share price drop is over. SELL TO OPEN? Is BEARISH since it appears that they expect to sell contracts that will not be exercised and therefore Intel to end trading in Jan below $22.50. SELL TO CLOSE? Is BEARISH since someone who owned the call options is getting out because they expect the options never have more value. There was also 8,000 $21 contracts traded. It could be someone who sold the 8,000 $21 contracts at 40 cents and then bought 14,000 $22.50 at 7 cents for a credit. This would be a volatility trade where they would make a credit on the trade which would stay profitable if Intel finished below $22.50 or above say $24 (the profit on the long 14,000 was more than the short of the 8,000).</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1356579113905</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356579550376-100</Id><Title>Clover Trail dominates and Ultrabooks as thin as the Ipad</Title><Msg>From the eetimes Intel claims latest tablet SoC beats Nvidia Tegra 3 Rick Merritt 12/20/2012 6:25 PM EST SAN JOSE, Calif. – Intel claimed its latest tablet SoC outperforms the Nvidia Tegra 3 while consuming less power.

Intel “hasn’t given up on Ultrabooks by any means,” despite sluggish market uptake to date, said Brookwood. “They are convinced ultrabooks represent a journey,” Brookwood said. “They haven’t been able to quite deliver all the features and form factors they wanted to yet, but they think Haswell will give them the muscle they need” and better than all-day battery life, he added.

I am trying to value Intel ( which looks undervalued)- Valuation by parts. If we were to segregate fabs from intels- design/R&amp;D/mobile etc........how much do you think those fabs in total are worth? ( I know that this is probably hard to answer, but sombody who knows semi conductor industry pretty well should have a better idea than me - I am more from traditional manufacturing side) Thaank you in Advance!!!!</Msg><Username>vinebills</Username><Timestamp>1356580375764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:52:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356580906405-104</Id><Title>Clover Trail dominates and Ultrabooks as thin as the ipad</Title><Msg>From the eetimes Intel claims latest tablet SoC beats Nvidia Tegra 3 Rick Merritt December 20, 2012 SAN JOSE, Calif.

Separately, Intel demoed its Medfield chip running in Android smartphones, outperforming Qualcomm and Nvidia chips in some cases while having similar battery life. “The problem Intel faces is they have no hope of the U.S. market due to their lack of LTE support that forces them to focus just on Asia and Europe,” he said.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356581654501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 23:14:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356584107028-106</Id><Title>I sell the weekly $20 puts and have been cleaning up.</Title><Msg>7-8 cents a contaract....I wouldn't mind owning INTC for $20 with a 4.5% dividend.</Msg><Username>the_uniposter</Username><Timestamp>1356584107028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 23:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
