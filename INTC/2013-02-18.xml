TSMC made that change well before 28nm and it is good die not good wafer. The customer is responsible for design yield issues.????? TSMC logo1 63x48 Exclusive: TSMC raises prices on AMD and NvidiaTSMC is doing some thing that are sure to make AMD (NYSE:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) grumble, and grumble a lot. Moles tell SemiAccurate that they are raising prices on 28nm wafers. Since we exclusively reported that Apple had taped out CPUs at TSMC, there has been the looming question of capacity. Apple uses a lot of chips, and they are not exactly small chips either. TSMC has limited capacity on their cutting edge processes, and if you depend on that, things can be a little problematic at times. Ask AMD about the 5xxx shortages when 40nm had hiccups. Apple wants lots of chips, and because of this, they want lots of cutting edge wafers. If you have ever seen an Apple supplier contract, you know that they demand first priority on everything, and are pretty ruthless negotiating every detail. This is the long way of saying everyone else but Apple will lose out when there is a shortage. One more thing to add, moles, ehem sources, say that TSMC’s yields on 28nm are not all that great. While we don’t know if the contracts with Apple specify a minimum number of wafers or minimum good die, either way, the initial guesstimates are unlikely to match the parts coming out. This means Apple will want, nay need, more wafers. What Apple wants, Apple gets. When Apple gets, everyone else looses. That brings us back to AMD and Nvidia. They seem to want 28nm wafers as well, and in high volumes. They may not need quite as many as Big White, but they need a lot, and it is unlikely that TSMC has that many to offer. To lessen demand, TSMC came up with a cunning plan, raise prices to make the wafers less attractive. Either that or just rake in more cash. In the end, we hear that prices for 28nm products just went up by somewhere between 15-25%, lets call it low 20′s. If 28nm wafers cost about $5000, this is around a $1000+ bump. You can probably understand why this would make GPU makers very unhappy, especially if you look at the 28nm lineups we exclusively published a few weeks ago (Nvidia here, AMD here). The short story is that Nvidia is looking to capitalize on 28nm as a cost down measure for laptop chips, AMD less so. Given the margins on low end products, one has to wonder if this move just made initial profits on the new line just go *POOF*. Either way, you can bet both companies are not going to be happy. One has to wonder if this is why AMD is trying to move later</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1361168953727</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 01:29:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361169471257-3</Id><Topic><Title>Aggressive impulses of an evil empire</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361035106412</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 12:18:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At Motorola, he was commonly referred to as "Hector the sector wrecker".

Sales of Android tablets could be down nearly 50% this quarter verses the previous one, while Apple iPad sales will be up 5%, according to analysts working for DigiTimes. The holiday shopping season brought strong tablets sales. Q4 was especially good for the iPad's competitors, to the point where sales of Android and Windows tablets outnumbered Apple's sales -- 22.1 million vs. 21 million. But the analysts at DigiTimes say this quarter is going to be quite different. With the holidays behind us, they are predicting that combined sales of Android and Windows tablets are only going to reach 11.8 million, while iPad sales will grow slightly to 22 million. They credit this to strong demand for the new iPad mini. Obviously, Apple will remain the largest tablet maker in the first quarter, following by Samsung, Google, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Microsoft. The analysts say that total tablet sales in Q1 are going to be up 75.8% year-on-year.</Msg><Username>armsuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361201277233</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:27:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361202389079-12</Id><Topic><Title>Tablet sales: Good and Bad</Title><Username>armsuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361201277233</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:27:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When I look into these numbers there is obviously good and bad. The segment is growing at 71% year over year which of course is strong. Anything that grows at this rate year over year in this economy is doing great. The shining star of course is Apple. With iPad sales nearly the same this quarter as Christmas sales they are doing fantastic. But most of this is caused by the introduction of the new iPad mini. 7" tablets have been out in Android for a couple of years and now's the chance for Apple fans to get theirs. It's not Apple leading the pack as much as following the pack. But if you're an iPad fan you more or less sworn off competition and this is a benevolent gesture. As for everybody else, this is the concern. The steep sales decline shows that these sales are more seasonal. The type of thing you would find in a consumer electronic device, not so much for a computer. When you put all the tablets together with all the different OS including Android, Windows 8 and Blackberry and add them up and still have sales half of the iPad you can't convince me that this market is taking off. My question is when everybody who wants an iPad gets one, what next? Will they replace them when they die or break? Will they be compelled to upgrade to the newest iPad? My thinking is that something remarkably better needs to come along, not just a little better to keep this segment moving along. Without the iPad mini this quarter uptick would look much worse year over year and sooner or later this market is peak. I'm calling it now, looking at these numbers, unless something better comes along to drive the segment the tablet market is going to peak by 2014. There is nothing driving down costs and there is really nothing that is raising the bar as far as consumer can tell.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1361202389079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:46:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361203809311-13</Id><Title>Process naming: 22nm, 14nm, etc....</Title><Msg>In planar process technologies the 28nm or 20nm implies the minimum transistor gate length of 28nm or 20nm. Corresponding to that lithographic capability are two other critical dimensions: the “contacted gate pitch” and the “metal pitch” for the lowest, thinnest metal layers. (Higher metal layers will be thicker with less resistance which are more suitable for longer routes but will have a greater width+space design pitch.) FinFETS changed this of course since they are transistors in the 3rd dimension. Intel 22nm, TSMC 16nm, Samsung 14nm are named by marketing people not technologists. The new 14nm processes use 20nm process technology with FinFET transistors. That is why 14nm will launch and ramp much faster than previous nodes, the yield learning has already be done at 20nm. So yes you will see risk 14nm silicon in 2014 with production in 2015. What kind of added value do FinFETS have at 14nm compared to 20nm planar? This is based on ARM test chips so consider it preliminary: 2-3% higher cost 37% more performance 90% less power 14nm FinFET is going to be a good node, especially for the mobile guys. These numbers are Samsung 14nm, I have no idea what Intel 14nm will end up at.</Msg><Username>semiconductorguy</Username><Timestamp>1361203809311</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 11:10:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361204331890-14</Id><Title>Intel No.3 in Baseband Processors</Title><Msg>IMO, this shows huge upside potential for Intel. ==================== Thanks to buying Infineon's wireless division, Intel is now level-pegging with MediaTek as the second and third suppliers of baseband processors, according to Strategy Analytics.

The 3-D transistor is poised to go mainstream. After falling behind Intel, the world’s biggest foundries are all gearing up to produce these cutting edge switches. And to accelerate the process, some have opted to take an unusual step: marrying the new transistors with an older approach to building the wiring that ties them together on a chip.  The hope is that this hybrid strategy will help foundries make 3-D transistors, or FinFETs, available to most of the world’s semiconductor firms by 2014, a good year earlier than anticipated. That could help close the gap with Intel, which unveiled the first commercial 3-D transistor process in 2011 and likely aims to supply the technology, with few exceptions, only to itself. Intel plans to release the transistors in smartphone and tablet chips tailor-made to compete against the foundries’ customers.   Chipmakers are switching to FinFETs because each time they have shrunk their ordinary, planar transistors, manufacturers have seen a smaller performance gain. FinFETs—which effectively turn the transistor’s current- carrying channel on its side to create a fin—carry more current and leak less of it, making for circuits that perform better and use less power. GlobalFoundries, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), and United Microelectronics have all made it clear that they plan to pursue the technology. They aim to introduce FinFETs at the 14-nanometer-manufacturing-process node—a step, more or less, behind Intel’s 22-nm introduction.   To get there, both GlobalFoundries and TSMC have revealed they’ll take a half step. They will replace planar transistors with a denser array of FinFETs, but they won’t advance the manufacturing process used to build the wiring that connects the devices on the “back end” layers of the chip. As a result, although there will be more transistors in any given area, a good number of them won’t be connected and therefore can’t be used. The chips won’t be much smaller than the 20-nm generation, which is going into production now. That means the foundries won’t be able to create more of them on a single wafer to reduce costs. Nonetheless, GlobalFoundries expects the chips it will produce could be as much #$%$ percent faster or 40 percent less power hungry than the 20-nm generation.   For GlobalFoundries, the advantage of this halfway approach is that it will let the company keep more than 7000 design rules that were developed for the 20-nm planar chip, while changing just 60 or so that are needed to describe the fin, says Subramani Kengeri, vice president of advanced technology architecture at GlobalFoundries. “First- generation FinFET is a huge challenge. There’s no question about it,” says Kengeri. “Adding more risks to that by adding other complexi ties that were not necessarily fin- related was not prudent.” All told, the hybrid approach should allow the company to accelerate production by a year.  Illustration: Emily Cooper FINS ARE IN: Three-dimensional transistors, or FinFETs, control current between the source and drain more effectively by surrounding the transistor channel with the gate on three sides.  Click on the image for a larger view. TSMC, which calls its FinFET scheme a 16-nm process, says its chips are “similar” in size and density to other foundries’ 14-nm offerings. Later this year, both TSMC and GlobalFoundries hope to create small batches of test chips for customers and are targeting full production in 2014, which will put the companies’ releases more or less on the same schedule as that of Intel’s own 14-nm chips.  “I think this incremental strategy is probably a very sound, safe way of not changing too many things at the same time and developing something they can be sure can be production worthy,” says Chi-Ping Hsu, who heads up research and development for the Silicon Realization Group at Cadence, an electronic design automation firm based in San Jose, Calif.  FinFETs are “a huge challenge for the whole industry,” Hsu says. He estimates that his team at Cadence has already spent some 4000 man-years overhauling computer code for today’s generation of chips so that processor operation can be simu lated in a realistic time frame. FinFETs, which boast stronger electrical effects on their neighbors and have dimensions that can’t be adjusted, are an added challenge. Hsu reckons it will cost the foundries and their partners some US $6 billion to develop the manufacturing prowess and the computational tools needed to make 14-nm and 16-nm chips.  Whether the investment will pay off in the end is unclear, says Sam Tuan Wang, chief analyst for semiconductor foundries at Gartner. “People say if Intel can do it, I can do it. That’s not true,” he says.

Apple, Google, or Microsoft (and other interested parties) could each do it, either on their own or by sharing the price of a buyout, which clearly could go a long way toward securing their future. Intel's management has, unfortunately, left itself open to this prospect. The company is close to its 52-week low, cash rich, pays a high dividend that would no longer have to be paid in the event of a buyout, on the edge of major, new technological advances (CPUs &amp; mobile), on the verge of a major breakthrough in Internet TV, and to cap it all, the CEO is leaving in May. What a great time for a buyout, and how very depressing it is to contemplate this actually happening. But greed always is alive and well on Wall Street.</Msg><Username>feldman.stan</Username><Timestamp>1361222143721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 16:15:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361222215920-42</Id><Topic><Title>Intel No.3 in Baseband Processors</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1361204331890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 11:18:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All Intel basebands contain an ARM core...</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1361222215920</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 16:16:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361222371459-43</Id><Topic><Title>Wallisweaver is an Intel paid schill</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1361217893408</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 15:04:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm here to protect decent people from skum like him (you)."

With the Linux 3.8 merge over, the Intel Linux graphics developers are looking toward 3.9. From a weblog entry by one of them: "Let's first look at bit at the drm core changes: The headline item this time around is the reworked kernel modeset locking. Finally the kernel doesn't stall for a few frames while probing outputs in the background! ... For general robustness of our GEM implementation we've clarified the various gpu reset state transitions. This should prevent applications from crashing while a gpu reset is going on due to the kernel leaking that transitory state to userspace. Ville Syrjälä also started to fix up our handling of pageflips across gpu hangs so that compositors no longer get stuck after a reset. Unfortunately not all of his patches made it into 3.9. Somewhat related is Mika Kuoppala's work to fix bugs across the seqnqo wrap-around. And to make sure that those bugs won't pop up again he also added some testing infrastructure. " The thing I am most looking forward to is the gen4 relocation regression finally being fixed. No more GPU hangs when under heavy I/O load (the bane of my existence for a while now). The bug report is a good read if you think hunting for a tricky bug is fun.</Msg><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361246493433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 23:01:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361246891857-82</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel too big to be bought out?</Title><Username>feldman.stan</Username><Timestamp>1361222143721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 16:15:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM could buy intc, but why would they ?</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1361246891857</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 23:08:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361247815185-83</Id><Topic><Title>Lots of changes for Intel Graphics on Linux 3.9</Title><Username>lucysuxwang</Username><Timestamp>1361246493433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 23:01:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is Wang a new Peanuts character ?
