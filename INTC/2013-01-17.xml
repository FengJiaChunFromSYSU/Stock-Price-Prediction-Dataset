(NYSE:IBM) has led to commercialization of new chips that merge optics with electronics to speed fast transmission of “big data,” said a principal researcher Using techniques that integrated new nano-photonic technologies into conventional silicon chips, IBM Research has now successfully devised wave-length division multiplexors that can transmit a much as a Terabit, or a trillion bits of data. “We have developed the technology and it's ready for shipment,” said Solomon Assefa, the research staff member for silicon nano-photonics at IBM's Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Assefa declined to discuss future commercial development but noted that the chips, combined with fiber-optic networks, could use optics to multiply transmission of all kinds of data, including voice and video, hundreds of times faster than today. Later this week, Assefa, who holds a doctorate in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is scheduled to discuss his findings at the International Electron Devices Meeting sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in San Francisco. The IBM researcher said many other technology companies are exploring the same sector but with different approaches. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), the No. 1 chip company, has developed a multichip approach to optical communications that requires more room than IBM's integrated solution, he said. Intel researchers aren't presenting in his session. Another company, private Xtera Communications Corp. of Allen, Tex., has devised a comparable solution, Aseffa said. The venture-backed company has been selling products for wide-area optimization and 100 Gigabit equipment for networks. Assefa said IBM has received more than 50 patents for its proprietary technology and has spent most of the past two years transferring it to the manufacturing process. “We've developed the technology. It's ready and will have a huge impact,” the researcher said, declining to specify when IBM will start shipping multiplexing equipment with its added capabilities. With its internal IBM Microelectronics division, IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., is among the world's top semiconductor manufacturers, allocating the vast majority of its output for internal use. But it also sells chips for industrial and commercial products, such as the Wii system from Nintendo Co. (PINK:NTDOY).</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358431820128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 09:10:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358432339930-16</Id><Title>LOL..LOL...Intel pins hopes to low-end smartphones</Title><Msg>LOL Intel pins hopes to low-end smartphones With its new Atom platform launched at CES, the world's biggest chip maker is looking to finally crack the smartphone market at the low end.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358432339930</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 09:18:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358432978387-17</Id><Title>Do us all a favor and tell your teabagging friends that they are stupid AHOLES!</Title><Msg>Those idiots think their assault rifles would be needed for the next revolution.

However, a successful midrange/lowwer end smartphone position would put the high end smartphone product lines between the Intel strength (PC's) and the lower smartphone products. One thing that Intel has been very good at is increasing performance and now lower power too. If you think that Qualcomm/Nvidia/et. al will feel comfortable being the product lines above Intel, you do not understand what risk they are exposed to. We will find out at 4:10ET today.

So sell it covered. If it gets over there you can roll it at 3:45pm friday to feb 23s or sell far out of the money puts and cover or whatever which is a nice problem to have with the stock up to 23.65 say by then given it was in the 19s recently anyway. I see no chance for intel to close so high after such rally although of course its a 30+ stock value. They will tank volatility tomorrow and next week so whatever call can be sold today out of the money makes sense to me , that or sell all your long calls and wait to re-enter after the news on profit taking. The fact is it doesnt matter what they report. If its great it will rally and then sell eventually. If its bad to mediocre it will tank and then rally if future looks ok on rebound. If its really bad it will sell terribly though. I expect it will be probably better than expected ( 0.45$) and that they will say the future is better than the idiots thought it would be but they will remain cautious. As a result intel will indeed go to 25-30 and maybe even 30+ later this year but may gap up no more than 1+ and then sell down from here for a few days. Then on any selloff load the truck again. Intel has behaved real strong recently and is indeed overbought here so being careful is a good idea. The time to be loading was when i was screaming it was a multiyear entry point (with 30-40% upside) at 250 day -2sd levels at 19s and 20s and 21 for many weeks where i was buying jan 2014 calls strike 25 now over 0.85 when they were then at 0.4,0.5 etc and can easily eventually be 2-3$ anyway but are at some risk of tanking and volatility crashing here near term.</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1358444531718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:42:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358444534918-54</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL DIVIDEND WILL VANISH IN FEW YEARS: you can buy $12 Energy Trust in Canada for 10% dividend yield</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358443015925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:16:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PLAY THE RANGE BOTH WAYS $22.50 -$19.50</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358444534918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:42:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358444539899-55</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend should be raised to .96 or .97 by May</Title><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1358444385744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:39:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's historic Dividend chart just laughed at you.</Msg><Username>boknowsintel</Username><Timestamp>1358444539899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:42:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358445771401-56</Id><Title>SOXL up 25% in the last month</Title><Msg>SOXL is up huge leading into Intels report tonight, up over 25% in the last month</Msg><Username>gr99785</Username><Timestamp>1358445771401</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:02:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358445851197-57</Id><Title>Stacy Smith said margins would improve dramtically early in 2013</Title><Msg>According to this, margins should be poor again but guidance should be UP.

(INTC) has signed Cisco (CSCO) Systems Inc. as a customer for made-to-order networking chips, landing the biggest customer yet for its fledgling foundry business, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Under the arrangement, Intel will manufacture processors designed by Cisco, the largest maker of routers and switches, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal is private. Cisco is already a buyer of chips that are designed and manufactured by Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker. The new orders represent a vote of confidence in Intel’s effort to expand into the $30.7 billion market for making processors according to other companies’ specifications. If successful, Intel’s push would step up pressure on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330), the top producer of made-to-order chips. “Cisco has a long-standing relationship with Intel,” said Karen Tillman, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California-based Cisco. “The company is one of several strategic suppliers of silicon to Cisco. However, Cisco does not comment on the specifics of its relationship with suppliers.” Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Intel, declined to comment. The only companies that have announced plans to hire Intel to make products they design are Tabula Inc., Achronix Semiconductor Corp. and Netronome Systems Inc., three small designers of programmable logic and networking chips, Mulloy said. Intel’s management has faced questions from analysts about whether it would be better to make chips based on other companies’ designs, rather than keep trying to sell its own designs for new markets, such as smartphones, where it has largely failed to win orders. Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini has described his company’s interest in the foundry industry as being at the first stage in a “crawl, walk, run” progression, according to Mulloy.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1358449062213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:57:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358449222686-67</Id><Title>What are the conditions of the recent intel bonds issued to buy back shares?</Title><Msg>Does anyone know exactly the terms of that deal? Was it 5 bil to buy back shares during what time frame and also the one buying them lending them the money is getting exactly what terms and possibilities of various actions for the holder? I am looking to see what price impact these terms may have on trading ranges. 5 bil is about 200 mil shares give or take. Have any of them been sold already? Anyone knows? How about links that may have such info? From the news link back in December; "Intel will sell bonds to generate cash in order to buy back some of its own stock. Intel announced that it will offer unsecured notes to investors in order to generate cash in order to buy back its own shares. The firm has enlisted JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch to handle the bond sale. According to Intel the cash it generates will not only be used to buy back stock but also for 'general corporate purposes'. Intel has been running a stock buy-back program for a number of years and given that the firm's stock price has barely moved in over a decade, it is one way of pleasing investors. Given Intel's three year process node lifecycle, the firm has to spend tens of billions building fabs in order to keep its competitive advantage over other chip vendors. While the firm said the funds generated by the bond issue will be used for general corporate purposes, the bond sale should free up some cash for investment in research and development of manufacturing processes. Intel did not say how much the minimum investment for these bonds will be nor the interest or maturity. According to the firm, those factors will depend on the market and other conditions at the time of pricing " So any update on details here?</Msg><Username>maximum_probability</Username><Timestamp>1358449222686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:00:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358449312404-68</Id><Title>if i buy today will i get the divident?</Title><Msg>thanks in advance</Msg><Username>divident_man</Username><Timestamp>1358449312404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:01:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358449504210-69</Id><Topic><Title>Obama knew FICA was going up on Middle class but "forgot" to tell you?</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1358447739108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:35:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another stupid comment that has nothing to do with Intel</Msg><Username>geekonpatrol</Username><Timestamp>1358449504210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:05:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358449742675-70</Id><Topic><Title>if i buy today will i get the divident?</Title><Username>divident_man</Username><Timestamp>1358449312404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:01:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only if you hold it until the ex-dividend date.

Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the hardware giant has inked a deal with Cisco, which would be Intel's biggest customer yet for made-to-order chips. Basically, Cisco would design the chips for its networking products while Intel would be responsible for actually manufacturing them. Reports and rumors about the chip maker's interest in a foundry business have been around for awhile now. Back in December, Intel CEO Paul Otellini commented that the company would be open to being a foundry for a strategic partner -- at least one that isn't a competitor. Speaking during the Sanford Bernstein investor conference that month, Otellini didn't name any names, but he seemed to shy away from listing Samsung as a potential client while remaining mum about Apple. Yet in this case, it looks like Cisco would fit the bill. Neither Intel nor Cisco have commented publicly on the new report yet, and Bloomberg cited a pair of unnamed "people with knowledge of the matter" as its sources for the story. We could hear more about this potential development this afternoon as Intel will be reporting fourth quarter earnings after the bell, followed by a conference call at 2:00PM PT/5:00PM ET.

The new orders represent a vote of confidence in Intel’s effort to expand into the $30.7 billion market for making processors according to other companies’ specifications.

Despite these comments, IFTLE would be remiss if we didn't point out that rumors continue to swirl that Intel will use 3D stacked DDR4 memory in their Haswell-EX platform for enterprise computing [link ]. Since Haswell will feature microprocessors with 12-14 cores, it will benefit from lower memory power consumption, higher memory bandwidth, and the memory capacity that DDR3 simply cannot provide. DRAM makers will make high-capacity DDR4 chips using through-silicon-via (TSV) technology that will allow to increase capacity of memory chips at a very fast rate. For servers, special switches will be introduced to avoid one module/one channel limitation. Samsung won't "mess" with Intel's core business IMHO - it's like after WW2 when USofA and CCCP defined their segments of interest - though there was a cold war it never escalated in direct confrontation.

Seems like they're managing through this downturn pretty well. "It seems like PCs were slightly lower than we expected. It seems like they slightly under-shipped the market. They're up 7 percent in the more profitable server market. "First quarter seems like it's going to be slightly lower than what the Street was anticipating, but we think again that's weakness in PCs, and some in servers, in the first quarter. Looks like their guidance for the year is very strong with 60 percent gross margins -- that would be up from 58 percent in Q1. "It seems like they're positive and they think they're going to grow in the low single digits. That's because we think, in the second half of 2013, we expect to see growth in the PC market. "It's the best tool in Intel's toolbox: their manufacturing. "They're going to push forward and that separates them from their competitors and allows them to come out with lower-power, higher-performance processors in the future. "Some of these new PCs that are coming out are innovative and can actually start taking back some high-end or $700 tablets. We think that if you get a full PC that is convertible to look like a tablet with touch, we think that's a very compelling product. The results show that the "PC industry is still around and maybe it was slightly exaggerated that the death of the PC was here."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358459551614</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459555683-238</Id><Title>Intel posted results with 2 minutes left on the close market was still open W0W!</Title><Msg>what a blunder. that was. why you had spikes up over 23 before the close, the numbers were all over the map during those 2 minutes. on the screen I smell lawsuits</Msg><Username>joespada282</Username><Timestamp>1358459555683</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459557470-239</Id><Title>wait 5 years to make a few bucks...LOL..</Title><Msg>LOL...</Msg><Username>chump_change_2</Username><Timestamp>1358459557470</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459558886-240</Id><Title>INTC can go to 15 or lower..stay away</Title><Msg>lot of troubles at the top.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1358459558886</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358459563763-241</Id><Topic><Title>Fun Watching Shorts Soil Themselves</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358459199420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:46:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not mention when it was down to 19.23 a few months ago shorty???</Msg><Username>tothewest2002</Username><Timestamp>1358459563763</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459573024-242</Id><Title>Margins...drip drip..Growth..Drip Drip..Leadership...Drip Drip</Title><Msg>dead money</Msg><Username>trader.quick</Username><Timestamp>1358459573024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:52:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459631993-243</Id><Title>oops I bought feb 22 calls</Title><Msg>not looking good</Msg><Username>mshepherd197</Username><Timestamp>1358459631993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:53:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459640579-244</Id><Title>going down boyz/girlz/??????...hello $18.</Title><Msg>or lower...</Msg><Username>chump_change_2</Username><Timestamp>1358459640579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:54:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459645304-245</Id><Title>Great Buy Opportunity Tommorow</Title><Msg>I bet you it sinks to 21 and change by mid morning.

Here's an analysis by one by Midnight trader..:Intel (INTC): Stock touched an early after-hours high of 23.19, but it was quick to retreat into the red, maintaining declines between 22.50 and 21.80 through the late first-half and mid-session of night trade. It bottomed out at 21.36 deeper into the evening as it settled near 21.50. A pre-market open Friday may have potential in the 21.60 to 21.30 area. INTC has recorded 14 quarters over the last 35 in which it posted an earnings-driven after-hours decline. In five of those events it recorded a more aggressive downside move the following regular session. The lack of downside follow-through would have us cautious on the short side of INTC early on Friday. In fact, longs may want to watch for potential floors to form in the low-21s and perhaps take advantage of any possible bounce in the shares. On the short side, selling was most aggressive Thursday night at 22.50 to 22, levels to watch for a possible ceiling to form. More risk tolerant shorts may want to test the waters closer to 22 to 21.70, an area where the shares are likely to open below and where a potential early day top could hold. Price: 21.39, Change: -1.29, Percent Change: -5.7</Msg><Username>jenngreay</Username><Timestamp>1358464407753</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 18:13:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358464425344-375</Id><Topic><Title>Hang in here folks.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp's current-quarter revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street, while a sharp rise in planned 2013 capital spending unnerved investors who expect personal computer demand to dwindle. Shares of the world's leading chipmaker slid more than 5 percent after it projected 2013 capital spending at $13 billion - plus or minus $500 million - exceeding many analysts' estimates for about $10 billion. Intel said $2 billion of its increased spending would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. But some analysts worried that expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line if it has to idle plants. "People are starting to freak out about the capex," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "They are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what's going to drive it?" "The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don't have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down," Rasgon said. Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would suppress costs in the long run. "The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis," Otellini told analysts on a conference call. "Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have." Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business. But he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies - as long as that did not empower a rival. In the fourth quarter, Intel's revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion for the current quarter. STRUGGLING IN MOBILE Facing lower demand, Intel said in October it was running factories at less than half of their capacity. Intel is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft which has led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp. PC makers are struggling to stop a decline in sales as consumers hold off on buying new laptops in favor of spending on more nimble mobile gadgets. Microsoft Corp's long-awaited launch of Windows 8 in October brought touchscreen features to laptops but failed to spark a resurgence in sales that Intel and many PC manufacturers had hoped for. However, some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for operating efficiency. "The revenue isn't going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line," said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. "I think it's probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down." It foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 56 percent for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It estimated a 2013 gross margin of 60 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. Analysts on average had expected 59 percent. Net earnings in the December quarter were $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, year-ago period. Analysts had expected 45 cents, and said the surprisingly strong performance was partly due to a lower effective tax rate of 23 percent. This was below Intel's forecast of about 27 percent. Still, shares of Intel fell 5.6 percent in after hours trade to $21.43, after closing up 2.58 percent at $22.68 on Nasdaq. "This is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors," said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358466509490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 18:48:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358466543006-409</Id><Topic><Title>Most after hours trading is done by amateurs</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1358466143259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 18:42:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought it took a willing seller for a buyer to buy?

They reported GAAP revenue of $13.5 billion and a gross margin of 58% resulting in $3.2 billion in operating income and $2.5 billion in net income. This resulted in an EPS of $0.48, beating estimates of $0.46. In addition to that, Intel reported earnings for the year of 2012 with GAAP revenue being $53.3 billion and gross margin being 62.1% and operating income coming in at $14.6 billion resulting in $11 billion in net income for the year. This breaks down to $2.13 EPS for the year of 2012. Comparing these figures to 3Q 2012 and 2011 as a whole, we can see that Intel's revenue is down 1.2% or $700 million from 2011 compared to 2012. Gross margin also suffered annually, down 0.4%. Intel Operating income suffered which resulted in an operating income of $14.6 billion, down 16% from 2011 levels at $17.5 billion. Overall, net income was also down to $11 billion from $12.9 billion, representing a decrease of 15%. This affected EPS once dilution was taken into account reporting an EPS of $2.13 versus $2.39 in 2011, down 11%. Their quarterly figures were also down significantly more than their annual figures, even though this was already expected. Intel reported revenue of $13.5 billion, down from $13.9 billion in 2011, representing a change downward of 3%. Gross margin, in our eyes, is actually the most worrying figure for Intel as they saw a decrease of gross margin from 64.5% to 58% a change of 6.5%. This obviously affected operating income, which came in at $3.2 billion, versus $4.6 billion in 2011, a change of 31%. Net income was also down significantly to $2.5 billion for the quarter, compared to 4Q 2011, which was $3.4 billion, a difference of 27%. This all reflected upon an EPS of $0.48 versus an EPS of $0.64 for 4Q 2011, down 25% year over year. Everyone expected Intel's figures to be pretty bad for 2012, 4Q 2012 included. The majority of that had already been built into the price. The real thing hurting Intel's share price right now, is their outlook for 2013. Intel was up 2.58% or $0.57 to $22.68. After announcing their earnings a bit early (12:59 instead of the traditional 1:01 PST), their stock has been hammered and is currently down $1.15 or 5.07% at $21.53. Intel's outlook for 2013 as a whole is that they expect low single digit revenue growth (below 5%). This is in conjunction for their guidance for 1Q 2013, which they expect to hit $12.7 billion in revenue with a margin of error of $500 million. They also expect gross margin to remain at 58% plus or minus a couple percentage points. Compared to 1Q 2012, which came in at $12.9 billion and a gross margin of 64%. The continued decrease in revenue and gross margin year over year will likely be a popular topic during most conference calls regarding Intel. Since Intel is considered a bellwether of types, this is likely going to spark a trend of concern for the PC market and semiconductor industry as a whole. The slow down in the European economy is clearly hurting these large chip makers as they cannot rely on the slow recovery in the US to prop them up. We're hopeful that Intel is going to be able to execute their mobile strategies in 2013, otherwise we're not too sure they'll be able to stop this trend.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358469031038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:30:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358469038959-448</Id><Topic><Title>SAD TRUTH ABOUT INTC's "GUIDANCE"</Title><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1358461318315</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:21:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is just repeating what the Analysts are saying.

Intel could announce it yet and cannot put the revenue in its estimates but it did today give the increased Cap Ex spending. 1/04/2013 @ 11:23AM |5,820 views Intel Could Be Apple's Chip Fab With Little Extra Cap Ex There’s been a growing view in Silicon Valley – and on Wall Street – that Apple at some point will turn to Intel to act as a foundry for the processors used in iPhones and iPads. Apple has been relying on Samsung to produce its processors; but given the ongoing patent litigation between the two companies, as well as their growing rivalry in smartphones, Apple has reportedly been seeking alternatives. Among the most obvious choices: Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor. MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum took a look at the situation this morning and concluded that Intel could take on the new role as a foundry – Apple uses an ARM-based design for its proprietary processors, and not Intel-designed processors – without any significant additional capital investment. Berenbaum writes that he sees a foundry relationship between Intel and Apple as increasingly likely, “as it would be beneficial to both parties.” And he thinks the Street’s concerns about the additional capital commitment required from Intel are overblown.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey7</Username><Timestamp>1358470856401</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:00:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358471073731-457</Id><Topic><Title>All those who sold today</Title><Username>beachguy347</Username><Timestamp>1358470294754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:51:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dont hold your breathe sweetie..gggggggg</Msg><Username>dkeller1970</Username><Timestamp>1358471073731</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:04:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358471075950-458</Id><Title>Jenn I don't think he understands you</Title><Msg>But I Do , Hogs Get Slaughtered</Msg><Username>joe_gbrt</Username><Timestamp>1358471075950</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:04:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358471174172-459</Id><Title>intc--22.50 calls expire 1-18-13</Title><Msg>bought 10 calls for .45 for a total 475.00 other bought call for ..85 per call hope to get back even plus !!!</Msg><Username>clintelkins</Username><Timestamp>1358471174172</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:06:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358471236239-460</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Reports Dreary 4Q 2012 Earnings, Worries Industry</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358469031038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:30:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No Windows RT tablets from Samsung for US Written by David Stellmack Not a lot of interest from retailers or demand from consumers One of the premier tablet makers, Samsung, has now finally confirmed that its plans for Windows RT tablets for the American market have been scrapped. This decision by Samsung is said to be based on very little interest from its retail partners and not much demand by consumers. While Microsoft has only seen what can only be best described as modest success so far with its Windows RT based tablets, that level of success has made Samsung even more cautious about the investment in developing Windows RT models for the US. Most tablet makers, including Samsung, claim that price is such a big factor in tablets right now that it is hard to build a Windows RT tablet model that can be competitive against Apple and Android models. Despite its decision not to release a Windows RT model now, Samsung claims that it could revisit the decision in the future. We will have to see what happens long-term, but if Samsung can put the brakes on bringing out a Windows RT tablet, we have to think other manufacturers are going to also be cautious, unless the price point can come down, or for some reason demand for Windows RT models surges.

Data Center Group revenues were $2.8 billion, up 7% sequentially and 4% from the year-ago quarter. That's not enough to make up for declining PC sales and unloved mobile products, but there's hope for Cisco in the business of making silicon designed for servers that run in large-scale data centers. Cisco reportedly just signed up to be a big customer for Intel's new foundry business, where Intel will manufacture chips that its customers design, a big change from its past practice of only manufacturing its own chips. Cisco will become the largest customer, buying made-to-order networking chips, unnamed sources told Bloomberg reporters Ian King and Jordan Robertson. Cisco has long been a buyer of Intel chips, but this new contract would be for chips of Cisco's design, and would be a big win as Intel tries to expands into the $30.7 billion custom-silicon market.

Asked about the release of financial results slightly before the closing bell, Mr. Smith said Intel is looking into "where in the process" the release took place.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358473773655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:49:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358473810843-478</Id><Topic><Title>It Was A Good Report</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358473520988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:45:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Negative growth and negative outlook doesn't bode well for any company, no less a behemoth which ran up 10%+ into the earnings.

All the doom and gloom for PCs, yet Intel still generated $1 billion of net income, after paying taxes, per month. That's more than all of ARM's full year revenues. And with all the smart investments Intel has made and the interest it has generated for its future mobile chips, we will see who is the ultimate winner in 2 to 5 years time in the mobile market. Here's a clue. Intel was a very much late player in the server chip market in the past. Now they control of 90% of the market. Yet their x86 architecture controls nearly 100%.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358474991974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:09:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358475314613-485</Id><Topic><Title>Intel CFO Smith pleased with Windows 8 market.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358473773655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:49:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1 billion net profit is far from Horrible</Msg><Username>bokertonepictures</Username><Timestamp>1358475314613</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:15:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358475422483-486</Id><Title>Kick'em while their down</Title><Msg>Intel has treated vendors like disposable diapers for 20+ years and they are now getting the paybacks.

Permalink I hope everyone is ready (including bashers).... because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on your #$%$ The following are points I highlight when convincing friends and family to invest in ADXS. 1) Phase I had 15 people in it, all with stage 4b cervical cancer (VERY SICK PEOPLE). They all received 2 doses of the vaccine when it was known that 3 doses is the actual therapeutic dose. Why only 2? Because the company was scared. This had never been tested on humans before. Still.... with just 2 doses, 3 of these patients lived 3 years and 2 are still living 4 years out! The historical median survival is 6 months! This trial had a median survival of close to 1 year! Imagine the results when 3 doses are given AND given in combination with chemo!!! 2) Provenge extends life an average of 4 months, is difficult to administer, and will cost Medicare $93,000. Yet it was approved!! And for just 4 extra months of life!! Listeria based vaccines are easy to produce, easy to administer, potentially very efficacious, and will cost Medicare 15x (at least) less for reimbursement. 3) Drugs fail to be FDA approved because they are dangerous. We know 72 patients...sick patients... have received the vaccine and no serious side effects were experienced. 4) Provenge is a one trick pony. There are NINE Listeria constructs and who knows how many more cancers this can be applied to? The possibilities are literally infinite. Insert any antigen you desire. The vector (Listeria) will work the same way and elicit the same immune response. This could prove disasterous however if the technology DOESN'T work since one construct will give a glimpse into all the others. Please see point 1 for hints that it DOES work. 5) ADXS management is brilliant. They have a phase 2 going on in CIN (pre-cervical cancer) AND Stage 4b cervical cancer. If it works in both, chances are this vaccine will be approved for ALL stages of cervical cancer. Provenge is only approved for late stage/metastatic prostate cancer. 6) ADXS has collaborative agreements with NCI, CRUK, Dept of Homeland Security, Wister, etc. NCI and CRUK are running trials at their OWN EXPENSE. Organizations of this caliber do not associate with POS companies. 7) Veterinary applications. If this thing ONLY works in cattle to prevent hoof and mouth disease we are looking at a $10 stock. Forget humans. There are millions of cattle worldwide and they are a commodity. Let's not forget about canine osteosarcoma as well. 8) A lesson in pattern recognition. DNDN went as high as $54 and was the first immunotherapy approved. How high will the next approved immunotherapy go? No telling how high ADXS goes with 9 constructs and limitless constructs in the future. Imagine the kind of profit you can make by buying in NOW! And trust me... the cost effectiveness of Listeria based vaccines is a HUGE issue. Let's say ADXS vaccines extend life of prostate cancer patients 3 months and Provenge extends it 4 months. Guess which one will be reimbursed by Medicare. NOT Provenge. Why? Because 1 month of life is not worth an extra $90,000 to the government. 9) Great business model. ADXS has never had a problem raising money. There is minimal dilution. And guess what? They have enough to make it to the end of phase 2. Forget phase 3. After good phase 2 results they license out the technology and collect big time!! Why is this good? Because it means the share price will move FAST and you won't have to wait very long before you are a millionaire. 10) Advaxis has the only immunotherapy that downregulates T-regs. These T-reg cells help protect the tumor from immune attack. No other immune therapy dose this. And this is a big reason why Advaxis vaccines will work. Keep this post at the top for newbies and feel free to add.

I've owned intel for over 5 years and my patience had also ran out. Many people on this board are making a mistake of falling in love with a stock. While I don't deny that Intel is a great company, it's just not a good investement. After today's report and a yearly guidance, what is the catalyst for the stock to go up? Intel stock on WS is beyond the stage of "show me the goods" - it's at the stage until it delivers growth for a number of consecutive quarters - it'll not go anywhere. Announcement of smartphones in US will not move it until it (smartphone revenue) will significantly contribute to the bottom/top lines of the company - and this is, according to Intel, is not hapenning in 2013. When (if) revenue from smartphones starts adding up and WS sentiment starts shifting, I will reconsider and buy again, for now there are so many other better opportunities. I was a beliver in $30 this year, but had realized - it is a pipe dream. Stock with a low single digits growth in both top and bottom line is sitting right where it should be around PE 10. And specially stock that had been dead money for 12 years - it has zero credebility to expand PE just on a news announcement. If Intel happens to announce a major breakthrough/phone in US this year the stock will pop few dollars, but will be sold off again on next quaterly report until smartphone revenue shows in the earnings. I will be selling tomorrow if there is a smallest pop. I am afraid many investors will feel the same way and the stock will fall hard tomorrow.</Msg><Username>bubbagumphere</Username><Timestamp>1358481922303</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:05:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358482165347-525</Id><Topic><Title>Well we got over that..

(Nasdaq: INTC) is taking advantage of bond interest rates below its dividend yield as the world’s largest semiconductor maker borrows to buy back stock battered by its lagging share in the smartphone and tablet markets. The firm issued $6 billion of debentures in a four-part sale this week with an average coupon of 2.38 percent that will help fund its stock buyback program. That’s lower than Intel’s indicated dividend yield of 4.5 percent on equity that trades at a lower price relative to earnings than every profitable firm in the 30-member Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Intel is enriching shareholders with borrowed money for the second time in 15 months after selling $5 billion of debt in September 2011. While its shares have underperformed as the Santa Clara, California-based firm and Microsoft Corp. struggle to combat Apple Inc. in the $63.2 billion tablet market, bonds of the industry’s biggest generator of cash trade at tighter relative yields than the average for technology companies. “They’re essentially doing an arbitrage by borrowing at cheaper rates and retiring higher-cost equity,” Alan Shepard, an analyst at Madison Investment Advisors Inc., which holds Intel debt and oversees about $16 billion in Madison, Wisconsin, said in an e-mail. “Given that Intel has relatively low leverage, this shouldn’t affect its ratings.” ‘Arbitrage Play’ Intel’s stock has fallen to $19.82 as of mid-morning Thursday, down 15 percent this year including reinvested dividends while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 has gained 14 percent. It’s among 25 companies in the index with an estimated stock dividend yield that’s higher than its average bond coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. S&amp;P 500 firms have an average equity yield of 2.18 percent with a 5.13 percent coupon, the data show. “That’s the arbitrage play that capital markets are presenting now because rates are so low,” Dave Novosel, an analyst at bond research firm Gimme Credit LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “You’ve got very robust markets right now, with a lot of investor interest swallowing up paper, so it’s a good time to come to market.” The offering was Intel’s largest on record and exceeds the 2012 issuance of companies from International Business Machines Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. to Microsoft, Bloomberg data show. Those firms have borrowed a collective $8.75 billion this year as yields on investment-grade debt in the U.S. declined to record lows, reaching an unprecedented 2.73 percent on Nov. 8, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. “The cost of money is relatively cheap,” Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said in a telephone interview. “We thought it was a wise time to go to the market.” 4-Part Sale Intel sold equal $750 million portions of 4 percent bonds due in December 2032 and 4.25 percent, 30-year debt, as well as $1.5 billion of 2.7 percent 10-year notes and $3 billion of bonds due in 2017 that pay a 1.35 percent coupon, Bloomberg data show. The deal was the largest dollar-denominated sale since Abbott Laboratories raised $14.7 billion on Nov. 5. Bonds of Intel rose today, with the 2032 securities increasing 1.1 cents on the dollar to yield 3.9 percent with a 113 basis-point spread at 9:08 a.m. in New York, tighter than the extra yield of 130 basis points when it priced yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The 30-year debt that yielded 150 basis points more than Treasuries at issue rose 0.91 cent and yielded 142 more than benchmarks, Trace data show. Stock Decline Investors demand lower yields relative to government securities to own Intel bonds rather than those of technology firms such as Dell Inc. and Applied Materials Inc., Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. An average spread of 101 basis points on Intel debt compares with the industry’s 135. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Falling borrowing costs have coincided with a stock decline that’s wiped $24 billion from Intel’s market capitalization this year as growth in its main market, personal computers, has ground to a halt in a weakening economy. The PC market is on course for its first decline in more than 10 years, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli and other market forecasters. Smartphones, Tablets That slowdown is being compounded by consumers increasingly turning to smartphones and tablets to get online, putting off purchasing computers. Intel, which supplies more than 80 percent of the world’s PCs with their main component, has less than one percent of the market for phone processors. “They’re not creating growth,” William Larkin, a fixed- income money manager who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem, Massachusetts, said in a telephone interview. Revenue in the third quarter declined 5.5 percent from a year earlier to $13.5 billion, Bloomberg data show. Trailing 12- month net income dropped for the third straight period, to $11.9 billion, the lowest since 2010. Equity investors have responded by selling Intel stock, which traded at a price-to-earnings multiple of 8.3 on Nov. 21, the lowest level in 24 years, Bloomberg data show. A multiple of 8.57 yesterday compares with an industry average of 38. Texas Instruments trades at 16 times earnings. Free Cash “If you’re trying to time stock repurchases, I am sure Intel isn’t looking at the stock as being expensive right now,” Jason Paraschac, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said in a telephone interview. “They generate enough free cash flow that they can pay for their share repurchases from the organic cash flow they generate.” Intel generated $6.8 billion of funds that can be used to reward shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks, to reinvest in the company, or to pay down debt in the 12 months ended Sept. 29, more than the $6.3 billion that remained available for repurchases under the existing program and exceeding the funds generated by each of its competitors. The company has spent $90 billion on stock repurchases and dividend payments over the last decade, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said last month at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference. Intel increased its quarterly dividend to 22.5 cents a share in May, up from 21 cents, Bloomberg data show. ‘Significant Cushion’ The firm purchased about $1 billion of its stock in the third quarter, less than the $5 billion of cash generated from operations, Smith said on an Oct. 16 conference call to discuss earnings with analysts and investors. “They’ve done this before, so it’s not as if they’re embarking on a new strategy,” Gimme Credit’s Novosel said. The company’s leverage, or ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, may rise to 0.56 from 0.3 with the new borrowings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg data based on trailing 12-month Ebitda of $23.2 billion. That compares with an average gauge of 3.71 for semiconductor peers and 1.37 at IBM. “Intel is a high-quality company,” Jon Duensing, head of corporate credit at Smith Breeden Associates, said in a telephone interview from Boulder, Colorado. “They have a significant cushion with respect to cash-flow generation.” Credit Rating The new bonds didn’t hurt Intel’s credit rating. Moody’s Investors Service assigned an A1 ranking to the debt, equivalent to the A+ grade it received from S&amp;P and Fitch. Moody’s said Intel’s credit outlook is stable, reflecting its financial strength and the expectation that it will defend a strong market position. “It’s hard to argue you shouldn’t lever here,” Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco, who rates Intel’s stock a “sector perform” with a target price of $24, said in a telephone interview. “When interest rates are low, you borrow money.”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358482968798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:22:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358482993243-534</Id><Topic><Title>First comments from Intel CEO Paul Ottelini.</Title><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358474991974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:09:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hmmm, armh 27, intc 27 armh 41 intc 21 gosh I wish i owned more intc this last year. un f'n believable :(</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1358482993243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:23:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358483006394-535</Id><Title>I have been waiting to buy both INTC and AAPL.

I think it will likely go sub-20. If it does, it will have a VERY fat divi yield at that price, and will be a good risk/return.

It has an allegiance to none and no dog in this fight - it will take any and all with many potential customers to keep it's plants running at full or near capacity. Intel makes an overwhelming majority of it's money by manufacturing, selling and branding it's own silicon and only very little as a third party producer like TSMC (Cisco and a few other small players). Nonetheless, you are misinterpreting my post. It had little to do with capex per say and even less to do with expanding fab capacity or dye sizes but rather the Intel thinking that if it can make a slightly faster or slightly more efficient x86 cpu that suddenly the entire market will turn in it's favor and they will suddenly be relieving the same success of the Win-Tel glory days. That simply isn't going to be the case. Intel, will not monopolize the mobile market as it did with the PC market it will have to share that space with ARM like it or not. So, spending tons of money first shrinking the x86 just so it can be competitive with ARM and then thinking because they can make it slightly more efficient by pushing those limits (stuffing a few more transistors) will not yield them much more market share. Do you really think that even if Intel achieves the technical and power advantages that it thinks it can and stay in the lead that it will be able to grab the same market share and dominance it once had? All OEM's will just disregard ARM and switch (which is what I believe Intel needs in order for it to make this investment work)?</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1358483341197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:29:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358483472206-543</Id><Topic><Title>Let's guess how low INTC will go tomorrow!</Title><Username>scrapman50</Username><Timestamp>1358482702909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:18:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your scenario would cause about a quarter million call options to expire worthless.
