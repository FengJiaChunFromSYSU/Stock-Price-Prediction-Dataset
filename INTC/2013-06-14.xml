The Lenovo IdeaPad U330 looks like it will be an updated version of its 13-inch U310 ultrabook, while the IdeaPad U430 will be a completely new 14-inch ultrabook. The 13-inch U330 will support up to 8GB of RAM and feature a 500GB hard drive and 16GB SSD, HDMI, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a USB 2.0 port and an SD card reader. You’ll be able to customize the U330 with a choice of Intel Core i3 or Intel Core i5 processor as well as a screen resolution of 1366 x 768 and 1920 x 1080. As for the 14-inch U430, information regarding this particular ultrabook is scarce, but it will feature a Qualcomm Atheros wireless card with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and, as the name suggest, will feature a 14-inch touchscreen display. At this point, we’re not sure when Lenovo will announce these Haswell-powered ultrabooks in the U.S., but we’re hoping it’ll be sometime soon as the more Haswell we have in our life, the better.

If anything, Paul Otellini would set a low bar for Intel and BK for Q2 by dumping all the costs into Q1. Paul worked at Intel nearly 40 years and would give Intel and those who followed him all possible chances of success. If the market has deteriorated, Intel will just hit. If the market was predicted, Intel will exceed. If the market was good for Intel, Intel will warn "UP" or substantially exceed. Of course, this is just my opinion, like the "MISS" is for you.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371200472143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 05:01:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371204425936-7</Id><Topic><Title>We are just a few trading days away from a</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1371184261130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 00:31:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wooo!

The fiscal crisis fogged everything up and it takes a long time to recover. I "expect" Intel to trade between $25 and $35. $30 will be a price barrier with lots of shares available that will be needed to chew through.. There has been a steady accumulation of CALL options in JAN 2014 $25 to $35. 100 to 500 contracts per day appears to be accumulation. Not as much for the JAN 2015 options. I expect Intel to trade with the general markets with some positive currents that will make Intel look "overbought" to those purely looking at charts.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371208898778</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 07:21:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371209075398-11</Id><Topic><Title>Want to See the Haswell Effect?</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371185881318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 00:58:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6 months ago, the short interest was still increasing but had slowed down from the 1 million shares per day between the previous May and December.

Look for continued volatile trading as investors look for clarity on when and how the tapering will begin and its immediate effect on equities and the economy. The 50-day moving average has held support this week for all of the major indexes which is a positive going forward. This is where one would expect the first major battle of support to take place and as of yesterday the edge remains in the camp of the bulls. The market had worked off its overbought condition to start the day so there was room to run on the upside. With emerging markets continuing to trend lower, investors could migrate to our market for safety helping to support prices where they currently stand. However, a break below the 50-day moving average on a pick-up in volume would send investors for the exits. Friday's trade could be key as to whether or not the bulls still have some gas in the tank. If support, as found at the respective 50-day moving averages of the major indexes continues to hold, stocks should make an attempt to trade higher over the next few sessions.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1371210858455</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 07:54:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371211771934-15</Id><Topic><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1371210858455</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 07:54:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Overbought and oversold are meaningless terms.

The rapidly improving fundamentals easily support $35, the price it achieved several times before (the last time in 2010), but DRAM is now significantly stronger and having explosive earnings potential for its only 1.7 million outstanding shares (1.4 million share float). Here are two main reasons for these assertions, and they are very easy to corroborate by any serious value investor: 1……..Memory prices have almost doubled this year and were 70% higher in the quarter to be reported soon vs. the previous quarter. Traditionally, the memory business was it’s main business having been a pioneer and a respected company since 1967. DRAM prices continue to literally explode during the current quarter and are expected to continue to go up into 2015 due to manufacturing shortages and high demand. 2……..AMD and DRAM recently announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD and 5/12/2013 DRAM) that they have agreed on a memory manufacturing partnership. This partnership includes Dataram Corporation as an AMD memory-manufacturing partner to produce AMD's new Gamer Series memory.

When they get done pushing the Repub party more to the right, they will assure the Dems dominate in DC for the next 30 years. If sheet was brains, they would all be freaaaaking Einsteins. Funny thing is when they talk to we Libs in person, we all shake our heads agreeing with them because we do not want to fight with teaaabagging inbreds because it is like talking to a wall. The look of shock on their faces when Romney lost was so so funny. So here we are, they are all tuned into Fuxeeed up News where Fuxed says OB has committed high crimes. They are watching in hope they can impeach him. Kind of reminds me when Fuxed up News said Obamacare was impossible to pass into law and then it passed. Or like when Fuxed said the supreme court would rule the law unconstitutional and then the law was said to be OK by the courts. When they clowns talk to Jesus asking him to remove OB, they are told by the LORD to eat sheeeeet and die because last time I looked, OB is still there.

The shares are the most efficient way for Intel to pay top staff. WON"T EVER HAPPEN. The shares are awarded as incentive compensation in lieu of salary. Have you ever wondered why their is sort of a "ceiling" in base salary around $1m? Any corporate compensation that exceeds $1m must be paid with AFTER TAX company dollars. Salary of executive level employees would have to be competitive with other companies. COMPETITIVE SALARIES will have to be paid to attract and retain people. Without the RSU awards, Intel would convert after tax profits to employee compensation. The Intel profits would be subject to the Intel 24% tax rate. The salary would then go to the employee and be subject to the incremental tax rate of the employee. 35% ? RSU are a way of getting compensation to employees more efficiently.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371241465535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:24:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371241666650-73</Id><Topic><Title>The biggest problem with all the insiders dumping there FREE share is only the firms on Wall Street that make the trades</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371238549033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 15:35:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talk to your Congressman. Have him repeal the law. Does the Tax Code Influence CEO Compensation? "The legislation consequently has had relatively little real impact on overall compensation." Reacting to public and political scrutiny of high CEO compensation, Congress enacted legislation in 1993 to limit the corporate tax deductibility of executive pay. But a recent study by Nancy Rose and Catherine Wolfram indicates that this legislation had no significant effect on overall executive compensation levels. In Regulating Executive Pay: Using the Tax Code to Influence CEO Compensation (NBER Working Paper No. 7842), the authors use data on nearly 1400 publicly traded U.S. corporations and examine the effect of "Section 162(m)," which limits the corporate tax deduction for compensation paid to the CEO and the next four highest-paid executive officers to $1 million per person. This cap represented roughly the median level of total compensation for large firms' CEOs at the time the legislation was enacted. Two exceptions are noteworthy. First, the limit applies only to the five named executive officers of the firm as of the end of the fiscal year. This creates the possibility of using post-retirement or deferred compensation to mitigate the effect of the tax limits. Some corporations have in fact restructured executive compensation to take advantage of this.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371241666650</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:27:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371243048577-74</Id><Title>Wallisweaver absent as well as his aliases all absent today</Title><Msg>Funny how that works.

Keep up the good work... But I disagree with your assessment of "good enough." I'm an excel power user, do a lot of photo editing, and some video editing. My 4 year old ASUS G50 running Vista and windows 2010 stil does the job - not as fast as I'd like sometimes, but faster than our Atom powered netbook (WAY FASTER)...

My computer is good enough" and I'm not upgrading, and again, I'm what used to be called a "power user." Even if INTC's chips are used in every new system, the rate of high end system purchase is slowing because most people can exist with their current systems... There will be little to no inertial in the financial statements until December... Also, if you delve into the FY 2012 10k, you'll see that in the table that lists debt becoming current over the next five years in 2016 there is a large (4.5 Billion) debt due identified. It is not detailed in the notes. Until I know what this debt is, I have to function on the possibility that cash flow may become an issue, and that is why despite winning the battle of silicon and physics, the LEAPS are not trading at a high premium.

I'm just not yet convinced that yours is one of those. The arguments you presented are farcical. Here they are: 1.) The good enough argument. You project your personal needs onto the entire buying public. Not logical or statistically value. It's the opinion of one. That's not support for your argument. That's opinion. 2.) You state that the rate of high-end computer purchasing is slowing but you forgot to provide any verification that this is even true. And even if it is, your conclusion that this will drop profits cannot be deduced from it. More of just your unsupported opinion. The real picture of what is happening relates to processor sales and not PC sales. It involves much more than just high-end systems. You've totally ignored Intel's traction in mobility. You've totally ignored the fact that Intel tablet sales are doubling each quarter. If this is the argument you want respect for, I'm just going to have to say "no". 3.) I looked in the 2012 10-K as you suggested and didn't find any debt of 4.5 billion for 2016. The amount is listed at 1.5 billion. And Intel says this about the long-term debt: "Our long-term debt recognized at amortized cost comprises our senior notes and our convertible debentures." So there isn't any mystery at all about what makes up the debt. Furthermore the debt level at 3/31/2013 was virtually identical to that of the prior year. In short, there is no evidence whatsoever of a cash flow problem. You made it up. So, actually yours aren't honest arguments. You're either incompetent at analysis or just another shill.

Hints and rumors will propel hyper-active traders into triple-digit swings even as Bernanke tries to relay and assure the market what his intentions are. Mid-week Fed policy makers will meet again and what verbiage comes from that meeting will dictate the markets near term direction. The 50-day moving averages for the major indexes will remain in play as investors wait on Wednesday's session. Whether Thursday's rally was a one hit wonder, or a hint of things to come will likely be determined by Wednesday. Important support levels were able to hold as the week closed but as posted yesterday a break below the 50-day moving average with a pick-up in volume will send investors for the exit. I would stay liquid until the cloud of uncertainity was removed and the mkt has a direction to follow. Presently the path of least resistance is to the downside.
