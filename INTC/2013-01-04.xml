It talks about how Apple screwed the pooch by not having a superior node to move to. Just like that node wasn't enough, 28nm isn't going to be enough. Why? Because new functions are constantly being added and without improvements in fabrication the chips get too big to be practical. Apple got a serious lesson in this.

It seems there was a leak last year and a re-hashed one again yesterday that show Bay Trail being delayed a few months (to be introduced in early 2014 instead of end of 2013). Because Bay Trail will be manufactured on 22nm, it seems some people are assuming that Merrifield, also manufactured on 22nm, is being delayed until 2014. However, from my readings Merrifield has nothing to do with Bay Trail. I believe Merrifield is a redesign of the Medfield. I think Intel has decided to scrap the z2580 and will be pushing the Merrifield on smartphones and small tablets. So, IMO, the reports recently of Merrifield to be introduced at the Mobile World Congress this February is likely true.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357286709894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:05:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357286939181-8</Id><Topic><Title>Merrifield is NOT Bay Trail</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357286709894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:05:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's also very little information on Clover Trail+. We know Clover Trail+ will be coming in 2013, but the big question for me is - will it be manufactured on 22nm or 32nm? From a recent interview with Mark Bohr in December, 2012, he said: "You'll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation" Note the plural usage; this might suggest that the Clover Trail+ might be 22nm also. As you can see, Intel is attacking the smartphone and tablet markets using a multi-pronged approach. They will have Merrifield in smartphones and Clover Trail+ in the larger tablets and hybrid PCs. For the 7" tablet, they can either use the Merrifield OR the Clover Trail+.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357286939181</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:08:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357287524231-9</Id><Topic><Title>Merrifield is NOT Bay Trail</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357286709894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:05:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here are links to some articles I read regarding Merrifield: intomobileDOTcom/2012/05/14/intel-merrifield-system-chip-may-end-up-2013-superphones/ theregisterDOTcoDOTuk/2012/05/11/intel_smartphone_android/</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357287524231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:18:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357289678764-10</Id><Topic><Title>Merrifeld is a 22nm Atom SOC.

For MS to think they can push one form factor and that's it, is not likely to work. The PC makers are trying several form factors. The Surface must be assembled on a table-top for keyboard use. The convertible tablets are too heavy. (We might nickname them the Commodores.) The Samsung ATIV 500T and 700T detach from a keyboard and become light in weight but can be used like a laptop with keyboard. The Lenovo Think Pad 2 tablet and the HP Elite Pad 900 can add keyboards probably like the Surface. I would be interested in a Samsung 11.6" Series 9 convertible if they can make 2.5 pounds weight. But here's a new development: Some computer makers are selling Win 8 with a downgrade license to Win 7 and then the computer comes with Win 7 installed. To switch to Win 8 requires un-install of Win 7 and install of Win 8.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1357300062146</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 06:47:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357300106514-16</Id><Topic><Title>Merrifield is NOT Bay Trail</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357286709894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 03:05:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Baytrail slides were leaked yesterday and say Baytrail(22nm) will arrive in 2013 Baytrail is for tablets hothardwareDOTcom/News/Intels-2014-Bay-Trail-Platform-Leaked-But-With-Netbooks-Dead-Will-Anyone-Care/</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357300106514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 06:48:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357301785866-17</Id><Topic><Title>Played with MS Surface and Lenovo Yoga today at Best Buy</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357179578713</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 21:19:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also, to set the Surface against the Think Pad 2 tablet and against the Elite Pad 900 tablet would require three Surface.

That means it must take more market share from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Based on Apple’s share price, investors fear, among other things, Samsung’s success with Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android-based phones. According to Reuters: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is expected to widen its lead over Apple Inc in global smartphone sales this year with 35 percent growth, helped by a broad product lineup, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. This will take place as the overall market explodes: Global smartphone shipments will jump 27 percent to 875 million this year, slowing from last year’s torrid 41 percent pace as growth is easing in many key markets such as North America, China, the developed economies of Asia, and Western Europe. The Strategy Analytics does not offer much hope to the industry’s other players beyond Apple and Samsung. Douglas A.

Accounting for a substantial majority, Intel has been dominating the PC microprocessor market for the last two decades. Even in the tough macro environment, the company gained a record market share of 16.5% in 2011 and retained its top position in the semiconductor industry. In light of the challenging macro conditions, while the PC market growth rate has slowed, tablets and smartphones sales are witnessing tremendous growth which is expected to increase in the future. Determined to be the front-runner in the global technology revolution and focused to stay abreast of changing consumer preferences, Intel marked its entry in the lucrative smartphone and tablet markets in 2012. However, despite its increasing efforts, Intel has yet to make a significant mark in the mobile computing domain. Here we provide a quick snapshot of how Intel makes money, the important segments that contribute to its business, and the key trends that could impact its valuation. See our complete analysis for Intel What are the key markets and customers for Intel? What are the most important segments that contribute to its growth? Intel’s business can be broken down into the following key segments: 1. PCs – Intel manufactures and markets microprocessors and chipsets used in notebooks and desktops. Microprocessors are a PC’s central processing unit which drives its power and performance. A chipset is the PC’s ‘nervous system’, sending data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices such as keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. Intel sells its processors to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Toshiba and Sony, and individuals building custom PCs. Out of $51 billion in revenue that Intel earned in 2011, 70% was accounted for by the PC market. The $35 million in revenue from PCs can be further split into $18 billion, $10 billion and $7 billion from sale of notebook processors, desktop processors and PC chipsets, respectively. Intel earned 55% operating profit from the PC segment in 2011, which is constant across all the above sub-segments. With the increase in competition, we expect margins to decline slightly in the future. Intel currently accounts for over 80% and 70% of the notebook and desktop processor markets, respectively. However, we forecast a marginal decline in the company’s share in both markets in the future as a number of ARM-based players are expected to enter the PC microprocessor market in 2013. Additionally, the increasing demand for lower-priced PCs from emerging markets could work against Intel as its processors are priced at a considerable premium over competitors. 2. Servers – With over 90% market share, Intel also leads the market for server microprocessors. Servers manage large amounts of data, direct data traffic, perform complex transactions, and control central functions in local and wide area networks and on the Internet. With the rapid increase in online data processing, the server market is a fast growing division. Intel sells its processors directly to server manufacturers such as IBM, Dell, HP, etc. Intel earns close to 20% of its revenue from the server market and makes around 64% operating profit on the same, the highest among all its business segments. While we believe that Intel will remain the leader in server processors for years to come, we feel that its market share could decline marginally in the future as AMD’s server processors become more competitive with the SeaMicro acquisition. Additionally, the entry of ARM-based players in the server market will intensify competition for both Intel and AMD. 3. Atom Processors – Atom is the brand name of Intel’s ultra-low voltage microprocessors, which was introduced initially to power netbooks, nettops and other mobile internet devices (MIDs). The processors are now increasingly being considered for other devices such as smartphones and tablets. We estimate Intel to currently account for 7% of the total available market, which includes netbooks, smartphones, tablets, car infotainment systems, smart TVs, etc. Only 2.4% of Intel’s revenue in 2011 was derived from Atom processors and the company earned only 2% operating profit on the same. Smartphone and tablets are the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor industry. Intel has bagged a number of designs in 2012 and claims to have another 20 upcoming tablet designs in 2013, which can increase its market share. In addition to technology advancement, we feel a higher revenue stream for a similar cost base could improve margins in the future. 4. Embedded &amp; Others – Intel manufactures microprocessors and chipsets used in a variety of industries such as industrial and medical. The company also manufactures products for use in digital consumer devices such as digital TV, high-definition media players, cable modems and set-top boxes. In 2011, embedded markets accounted for 7.5% of Intel’s revenue and the company earned 2% operating profit on the same. Going forward, we expect both revenue and margins to increase at a steady rate for the rest of our forecast period. Factors that can revive Intel’s PC demand The slowing enterprise market, consumer softness in mature markets (US and Western Europe), slowing demand growth from emerging markets, operating system transitions and cannibalization by tablets are some of the main factors leading to the current slump in PC shipments. Research firm IDC predicts the global PC market to grow by a mere 0.9% in 2012. In the coming months, Intel plans to introduce more than 140 core-based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will be touch-enabled. Aiming to combine the productivity of a PC with the convenience of a tablet, Intel intends to launch a dozen convertible Ultrabook designs. At the same time, the company is also working to bring down the incremental cost of touch-enabled Ultrabooks. Many of the upcoming Ultrabook designs are slated to hit the mainstream $699 price point while some could even be below that number.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357311868285</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:04:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357312002735-34</Id><Topic><Title>A Review Of Why Intel Is Worth $33</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357311868285</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:04:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We feel the upcoming innovative designs and a lower price point could help steer Ultrabook demand for Intel in the future. Increasing share in the smartphone &amp; tablets market The smartphone and tablet space is dominated by established ARM-based players such as Qualcomm and Nvidia which together account for the majority of the mobile computing market and have a number of high profile design wins in their portfolio. (Read Our Article: How Big A Threat Can Intel Be To ARM?s Mobile Dominance?) However, we feel that Intel has been faring well so far in this domain and claims to have a strong road-map for the future. It recently launched its new processor code-named Clover Trail (Atom Z2670) for use in tablets that feature Windows 8 OS. Additionally, it plans to launch more than 20 Atom-based tablets from leading OEMs in the current quarter. Intel’s upcoming Atom Z2580 promises to offer a better performance, battery life and experience over its predecessors. We estimate an increase in Intel’s market share in this segment by the end our review period.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357312002735</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:06:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357312020044-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Making Apple's ARM Chips Will Leave Samsung Behind</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357188814214</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 23:53:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem with so many of your posts is that you not only count your chickens before they are hatched, you count them before the egg is layed.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1357312020044</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:07:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357312736598-36</Id><Topic><Title>RANGE BOUND: $22-$19 AND THAN BREAK DOWN TO MID TEENS 2013 ROAD MAP.......2013 BAD FOR INTEL</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357309151402</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:19:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT INTEL MANAGEMENT: $6B DEBT USED FOR BUY BACK SCAM ..." I cannot figure out what you are talking about. I know about the notes but it seems like a very good thing. You keep banging this drum but it seems like an opportunistic transaction where Intel borrows $6b to buy back stock and then effectively uses the dividend they would have paid on those retired shares to retire the debt. There is a $120mil per year positive accrual that will amount to 30 x $120m = $3.6b over the 30 year life of the paper IF the dividend is unchanged. "FLIP TRADES AND STAY STAY SHORT LONG TERM" You should invest and trade the way that you feel comfortable and I hope that you make wheel barrow's full of money. Staying short on a range bound high yield stock has its risks and looks to me to be a win only if Intel does break lower. If Intel stays range bound then you will profit only when Intel share price drops faster than the dividend or $1 per year. The news on Intel is not going to be all good nor all bad. There will be 400mil to 500mil PC class computing devices shipped per year and Intel will take a big chunk. I think that tablets are expanding the market and not a zero-sum product. "I WILL NEVER BE A SHAREHOLDER IN INTEL POOP PAPER ............" This is a decision you have made and that is fine. I doubt that your decision will change anything other than to disrupt discussion on the board as you repeatedly post the same message. I am pretty sure that you are capabile of discussion without the insults and taunts. It takes longer to articulate a response but worth the results. I think the next two weeks to be very interesting as Intel has the opportunitiy to talk to the press about plans, profits and the future.

I really hate it when people misstate facts repeatedly using multiple threads to try to convert a lie into "common knowledge". Along the compute continuum there are some product catagories and they have a Total Available Market (TAM) and Intel gets a share of it. Those markets are growing/shrinking/changing as technology impacts it. 1.7b phones sold in 2012. down 5% from 2011. it is approaching mature market status if not there. 42% were smartphones. 1.7b x CPU ASP price of say $20 = $34b if all were smartphones. Intel goal is to take a share of these sockets and integrate other silicon onto the chip to raise the ASP beyond $20. 50m tablets in 2012 (from my feeble memory) and Apple owns this segment Intel tablets and convertables should affect here. 380m PC (whatever IDC defines it as) sold in 2012. flat from 2011. ASP of below $100. You can probably figure out the ASP by Intel market share and Client PC revenue. ???? servers Increasing revenues with silicon pricing is like walking up sand dune. Prices decay almost as fast as new products. Intel top line growth is important. Analysts can ignore the obvious and make absurd cases for just about anything (think politics). Some of the bashers are likely those analysts or their representatives. There is nothing that Intel management can do about them other than to make the company successful. Intel has many good points but they also face a number of headwinds. I am long Intel. (4% dividend) I sell naked puts for premium decay and roll them out if I don't want the shares yet. (4% dividend is reflected in the put premium) I sell naked puts to buy shares cheap. I sell covered calls. (probably about 1/2 of the dividend gets reflected in the premium &amp; assigned stock capital gains set by the covered call strike point and usually $1 over the purchase price = 1/$20 or about 5%) 4% + 4% + 2% + 5% = 15% per year</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357315802372</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:10:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357316163823-50</Id><Topic><Title>Why is INTC getting crushed today??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357313456898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:30:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why don't you go off and buy another 20k shares you big blowhard of a baby.

Apple has been relying on Samsung to produce its processors; but given the ongoing patent litigation between the two companies, as well as their growing rivalry in smartphones, Apple has reportedly been seeking alternatives. Among the most obvious choices: Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor. MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum took a look at the situation this morning and concluded that Intel could take on the new role as a foundry – Apple uses an ARM-based design for its proprietary processors, and not Intel-designed processors – without any significant additional capital investment. Berenbaum writes that he sees a foundry relationship between Intel and Apple as increasingly likely, “as it would be beneficial to both parties.” And he thinks the Street’s concerns about the additional capital commitment required from Intel are overblown. “Investor pushback has been along the lines of potential cap ex requirements from an AAPL foundry arrangement.,” he writes. “Our calculations suggest that even half of AAPL’s A6 production would only require to 40,000-50,000 wafers per year, and absorb 1%-2% of INTC’s capacity. It is widely perceived that Taiwan Semiconductor is spending a large amount of cap ex in 2013 primarily to accommodate Apple – this seems only partly true, as our work suggests it has more to do with the requirement to maintain a significant installed base of lagging technology (a requirement that INTC does not have), and already tight capacity at the leading edge (in other words, TSM needs to add leading edge capacity not just for AAPL, but also for Qualcomm, Altera, Xilinix, Nvidia and others.)” Intel this morning is down 23 cents, or 1.1%, to $21.09.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1357317179468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:32:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357317456814-57</Id><Title>Hay jerry.blown I am not making any money you said everyone was buying and INTC were going to beat the lowered 55 cents how come INTC is going lower JERRY</Title><Msg>Hay jerry.blown I am not making any money you said everyone was buying and INTC were going to beat the lowered 55 cents how come INTC is going lower JERRY, Its not good to lose money Jerry</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357317456814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:37:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357317700665-58</Id><Title>Hay Jerry the stock is acting like INTC is going to miss the lowered 55 cents .

With 5 minutes of digging .... Romit Shah, Nomura Securities issued his pre-Intel negative-press-briefing-analysis about Intel and the likely bad earnings news. Romit always issues a negative statement the day before each Intel event, again right after the even with his "ho-hum" review and then 3 days later, downgrades Intel to a SELL and drops the target price to the current price minus $3. From Romit: "Speaking of CES, there have been a raft of sell-side research notes this morning about what to expect at the show. One in particular predicts some gloomy news. Romit Shah of Nomura Equity Research opines we might hear bad news from some chip makers about weak trends in their markets. “We have not found tangible evidence that indicates estimates for most of our universe have bottomed,” writes Shah. “In analog, we believe December bookings were weaker than expected due to continued disti inventory draw-downs at Texas Instruments (TXN), Xilinx (XLNX), Maxim Integraded Products (MXIM), and a couple discrete companies.” “Linear Technology (LLTC), however, may have fared better. In PCs, we believe Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) saw weaker processor and GPU shipments after Black Friday. And in wireless, high-end smartphone demand outside of Samsung appears slightly below seasonal for Avago Technology (AVGO), MXIM, and NVDA.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357317754506</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:42:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357317841739-61</Id><Topic><Title>Hey singh "dandy" lion</Title><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1357314279839</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:44:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IGNORE AnD LOOSE zombie $ucked brain clowns in USA ROME DID NOT BURN IN A DAY USA is hijacked by Home grown Financial AL QAEDA led by Bankster Terrorists Andrew Jackson quotes: Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the bread stuffs of the country.

But never mind--he is gonna go 14th amendment on the repubs and simple pay the national debt as President as the Constitution tells him to do. OH--You mean you never read the law of the land? Read it idiots. Obummer is gonna go constitutional of the GOP in the House. 14th amendment of the United States "'The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for the payments of pension and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion' -- this is the important thing -- 'shall not be questioned," Geithner read.

I think that everyone gets it. I am pretty sure you understand that this is not a bad move. Intel borrowed $6b at a blended rate of 2.5% which was 70 basis points above treasury yields. Intel retired $6b stock that is yielding about 4.5% which is 2% above the debt rate. Intel is making 2% on $6b debt which is $120mil per year that falls to the bottom line. I thnk there are additional financial benefits like lowering the tax rate since the debt service is a business expense and dividend payments are not. If Intel raises the dividend in the future, the dividends they would have paid on those shares increases the $120mil per year savings. The debt service is less than the dividend payment. How can that be bad? How does this "enrich insiders" ???</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357320121581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:22:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357320562791-70</Id><Topic><Title>do zombie fools get it yet?

The population of users supported by a company IT dept will have large number who will want to, or need to work with the touch screens. Others will very much appreciate the greatly increased battery life of the new systems. Those new systems will work best with Win8. The large company IT departments like to support a small group of systems so at least one will have the Ultrabook format and will need the Win8 OS. Everytime I touch my mouse would be a candidate for a touch screen operation or at least a touchpad type input device instead of the mouse. A convertible laptop or a tablet form factor with a bluetooth keyboard would work nicely too. I think the conversion will be driven by increased flexibility and security of the new systems but not as fast as the Win7 upgrade.

And ARMs fabrication has totally coasted to a stop while they try to figure out how to do the impossible two process node jump to FinFET in order to void their roadmap turning them into road kill. To Chump Street this means let's buy a bunch of Intel puts. Go figure. Well, when you see ARM with a 75 P/E ratio, you already know that these are not smart people. Looking forward to CES, the Mobile World Congress, the release of Intel LTE smartphones in the US, lots of new Intel tablets and a great year for Intel. Oh, yeah - and the sounds of Chump Street and the shills crying in their beer....</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357326332014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:05:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357326461833-87</Id><Title>Intel Pays Big Dividends Now, and Shares Could Soar in 2013</Title><Msg>By Jeff Reeves, Editor of InvestorPlace Editor’s note: This column is part of our “Best Stocks for 2013″ series; stay tuned for more entrants today and tomorrow. After two painful showings in this annual stock picking contest — a bottom-of-the-barrel call on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in 2011 and a woefully underperforming investment in Alcoa (NYSE:AA) for 2012 — I have decided to take a less speculative tack in 2013 by picking what I see as a stable and undervalued blue-chip instead of a long shot that I hope to be a highflier. That pick is semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Some of you may think that Intel is no less speculative — or foolish — than financial stocks were a few years ago or cyclical materials stocks were in 2012. And it’s true that the big-picture risks for Intel stock are clear — as they are for all PC-focused businesses, from other semiconductor plays like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) to desktop and laptop giants Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Simply put, in a post-PC age the growth just isn’t there for legacy operations. But I remain convinced that Intel isn’t going anywhere. It remains the largest semiconductor manufacturer on the planet, with 15.9% market share in 2011 that was bigger than Nos. 2 and 3 combined — for the record, that’s Samsung at 9.3% and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) at 4.5% — and boasts a very attractive yield north of about 4.4% right now. Yes, the big questions about mobile are serious ones. But Intel continues to research new chips, and its long history of making some of the most energy-efficient processors in the industry mean that it has a lot of potential to get mobile right. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to be considering Intel to make chips for its iPads, among other things, and there’s a lot of potential on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android-powered devices, too. I bet Intel will figure out mobile. And if no substantive headlines about a big supplier or gadget deal emerge to move the stock in 2013, there’s a pretty attractive underlying business anyway. Intel’s forward guidance has been disappointing, but at current estimates, the FY2013 earnings forecast is $2.03 a share. Divide its current pricing of around $20.50 by that EPS, and you get a forward P/E ratio of less than 10. And revenues continue to grow nicely, with Intel seeing year-over-year improvement in 11 out of its past 12 quarterly reports. Sure, that one miss came in the most recent quarter … but shares are back to mid-2010 valuations. That seems a bit too pessimistic. Barring the bear-market crash of late 2008 and early 2009, the longest Intel has traded below $20 was a brief stretch of August to November in 2010 … and since then, both the top line and bottom line have improved considerably. Top it off with $10.5 billion or so in cash and short-term investments and I think you have a compelling case for a stock that at worst has stabilized after a 15% drop in 2012 and at best could see big growth as it evolves into a mobile chip company in the next 12 months. For the record, I have skin in the game on this. At the end of October, I added the semiconductor giant to my personal portfolio at $21.50. And when it fell to $20.50 recently I doubled down — giving me a personal cost basis of about $21 a share with a yield north of 4%. I plan on hanging on to this company for a long time because of that attractive yield, and the hopes of big growth and continued increases in the payout.</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357326461833</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:07:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357326688713-88</Id><Title>Alexander - Dividend question</Title><Msg>What do you think Intel will grow its dividend over the next five years?

"For the second month in a row, strong growth in the Americas region pushed the three-month average of worldwide semiconductor sales to increase at above typical seasonal rates. The averaged sales reached $25.73 billion in November 2012, up 2.0 percent from October 2012 and up 2.0 percent from November 2011, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group." Chump Street has been betting on doom and gloom but it's a bad bet and their beat down of technology is now going to come back and bite them in the rear end. No surprise. The economy is improving. Get used to it and get ready for it. The other major factor continues to be fabrication. It's the reason Intel is clearly going to win the mobility war. All that foundational work is now going to start paying off. Intel and Samsung are going to be the last two standing due to the huge Capex demands of each new level of fabrication. And guess what? ARM is getting less and less out of each new node while Intel continues to get more. Someday maybe even Chump Street will understand the impact of FinFET. Intel has it. ARM doesn't and won't for four years. That's all you need to know. The economy and fabrication. If you want another good investment put some money in crying towels. Chump Street is going to need a ton of those.

I think that they are somewhere between 30% to 40% today, even with the anticipated Q4/2012 lowered targets. Yahoo Analysts Estimates page shows that the analysts expect Intel to grow 11.83% per year. If that happens, then a 7% growth in dividend increases seems to be in a reasonable range. That would incorporate the analysts 11.83% growth expectation and allow for a compression of margins if they were to contract and profits grow at less than the analysts forecast 11.83%. I think 7% growth is reasonable.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357327998970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:33:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357328181950-100</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like that guy who sold his INTC and purchased CSCO was the smartest guy on the INTC board</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357327336374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:22:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC is down and CSCO just keeps going higher</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357328181950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:36:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357328435933-101</Id><Topic><Title>Alexander - Dividend question</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1357326688713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:11:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks Alex.

Intel doesn't have to walk on water to merit a much higher price they simply have to avoid the bottom falling out. Chump Street priced in an $8 billion revenue miss last quarter that never happened. At all. This means unless Intel has an $8 billion revenue miss this quarter that the stock continues to be HUGELY undervalued. Given Chump Street's valuation, there had to be a revenue warning for this quarter. Otherwise their whole story is totally and completely wrong. Well, so far no warning. Implication: Chump Street was totally wrong last quarter and they continue to be totally wrong. Intel is stupidly, horrifically under-priced. And even if they gave a warning it would have to be an $8 billion miss warning to justify Chump Street's valuation. We all know that's not going to happen.

It is a U-series part that sits between 15W and 25W and has two cores. The Celeron 887 is a dual-core with two threads and 1.5GHz clock, 350MHz graphics that can clock all the way to 1000MHz, has 2MB of cache, DDR3 1333 support and 17W TDP. Intel plans two Ivy Bridge 22nm Celerons to take its place in the lower end market segment called U Dual Core VC1. The one that replaces 887 is called Celeron 1007U and has the same 1.5GHz core clock, two threads, the same graphics, memory and cash size speeds. The difference is of course that Ivy Bridge 22nm core should bring some performance boost over the 887 at the same speed and it will generate less heat at the same clock. The new processor that will lead this U Dual core VC1 market is called Celeron 1037U and this dual-core with two threads now works at 1.8GHz speed, keeping the thermal envelope at the desirable 17W level. It comes with Intel HD graphics with the same 350 / 1000MHz clocks and it comes with DDR3 1333 support, 2MB cache and 17W TDP. With the Celeron 1000 series and Ivy Bridge 22nm dual-cores, Intel makes this market segment even stronger in 2013.

The key part of the Shark Bay 2013 notebook platform is Haswell and Intel talks about a 15 percent CPU performance bump, along with a twofold increase in graphics performance with the GT3 graphics module. It doesn’t stop there, as Intel claims up to 12X real-time transcode on GT3 for QC3 and ~9-10x on GT3 1 Chip3 and GT2 (QC and 1 Chip). QC denotes quad-core processors for the high-end, 1 Chip denotes SKUs that need 17 or less watts and fit the Ultrabook thermal envelope.

Many using WInXP upgraded to Vista only to encounter slow performance and driver problems. My company skipped Vista. When Win7 was introduced, EVERYONE with Vista made the leap to Win7. Win7 has been very reliable and seems to be very robust, even in the enterprise installations. Win8 is a major upgrade and is really only needed for touch. I would not get Win8 if my system did not support touch. I will not get a touch system with Win7 either. IMO, the adoption is stalled by macro economic issues and qualifying the OS by companies is taking longer.

Majority of handheld devices out there make use of ARM processor. As we all know, Intel is the world leader in semiconductor processors for laptops and desktops, but the same hasn’t been the case in handheld device segment, mostly due to the power consumption and heat dissipation issues. Hand held devices are supposed to be small, and that means the processor should be designed in such a way that it gives optimal performance which consuming less power and as a result dissipate less heat. Intel does have the R&amp;D capable of developing such kind of processors and it is working hard towards attaining its aim of eventually conquering the smartphone sector someday. Intel is broadening its x86 architecture to reach the mobile world. The company is making all sorts of efforts to get popular in the smartphone industry, and they have launched 2 Intel powered devices till now. The first one was the Intel Atom Medfield based Intel AZ210 which was sold in various countries by the name of Xolo X900 and Orange San Diego. The device packed in a 1.6 GHz processor, and the second Intel smartphone was from Motorola, called as Motorola Razr I, and this device packed in a 2 GHz Intel Atom processor. 2 GHz is very impressive, in fact it was the first time that a phone had packed such a powerful single-core chip and also first Intel powered Motorola. Months have passed and after several months of R&amp;D, Intel is back with latest Atom chip designed for mobile operations. The thing about Intel Atom chips is that they have the performance advantage and all they have to tackle is the power consumption level, and that’s exactly what the company is working hard on. An Intel engineer visited AnandTech along with two widely available devices, a Dell XPS 10 tablet based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 with Krait (dual-core, 28nm), and a Nexus 10 running on Cortex A15-based Exynos 5 Dual chip (dual-core, 32nm). The engineer proved that Intel was indeed working day and night and has finally sorted out the power consumption issue. The two devices were compared against Intel’s own solution, the Atom Z2760, and the conclusion is in Intel’s favor. As we know, Intel’s Atom architecture is a 5 year old architecture. Despite its age, the Atom is significantly faster than Krait, but when it comes to power consumption, Atom’s figures are in par with Krait’s figures. Intel is going to refresh its Atom processors with 22nm core soon, after which things will start getting interesting. When the Atom Z2760 is compared with Cortex A15, Atom loses in the performance arena. Again, Cortex A15 is a very good performer, but very bad in power consumption, in fact it is not meant to deliver its full potential in smartphones due to its power hungry nature. ARM suggests manufacturers to use the big.little configuration, which uses A15 and A7 cores adjacently. Do you think Intel will be able to conquer smartphone field?</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357341790690</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 18:23:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357342062006-137</Id><Topic><Title>ARM A15 is a Power hog according to Anandtech.

The 7W (at 80c junction temp i.e good cooling solutions) Ivy Bridges will spit them both out after having chewed up the pieces. Lots of great graphs here which I may summarize later but the conclusions worth printing now anandtechDOTcom/print/6536 'Determining the TDP of Exynos 5 Dual Throughout all of our Cortex A15 testing we kept bumping into that 4W ceiling with both the CPU and GPU - but we rarely saw both blocks use that much power at the same time. Intel actually tipped me off to this test to find out what happens if we try and force both the CPU and GPU to run at max performance at the same time. The graph below is divided into five distinct sections, denoted by colored bars above the sections. On this chart I have individual lines for GPU power consumption (green), CPU power consumption (blue) and total platform power consumption, including display, measured at the battery (red). In the first section (yellow), we begin playing Modern Combat 3 - a GPU intensive first person shooter. GPU power consumption is just shy of 4W, while CPU power consumption remains below 1W. After about a minute of play we switch away from MC3 and you can see both CPU and GPU power consumption drop considerably. In the next section (orange), we fire up a multithreaded instance of CoreMark - a small CPU benchmark - and allow it to loop indefinitely. CPU power draw peaks at just over 4W, while GPU power consumption is understandably very low. Next, while CoreMark is still running on both cores, we switch back to Modern Combat 3 (pink section of the graph). GPU voltage ramps way up, power consumption is around 4W, but note what happens to CPU power consumption. The CPU cores step down to a much lower voltage/frequency for the background task (~800MHz from 1.7GHz). Total SoC TDP jumps above 4W but the power controller quickly responds by reducing CPU voltage/frequency in order to keep things under control at ~4W. To confirm that CoreMark is still running, we then switch back to the benchmark (blue segment) and you see CPU performance ramps up as GPU performance winds down. Finally we switch back to MC3, combined CPU + GPU power is around 8W for a short period of time before the CPU is throttled. Now this is a fairy contrived scenario, but it's necessary to understand the behavior of the Exynos 5250. The SoC is allowed to reach 8W, making that its max TDP by conventional definitions, but seems to strive for around 4W as its typical power under load. Why are these two numbers important? With Haswell, Intel has demonstrated interest (and ability) to deliver a part with an 8W TDP. In practice, Intel would need to deliver about half that to really fit into a device like the Nexus 10 but all of the sudden it seems a lot more feasible. Samsung hits 4W by throttling its CPU cores when both the CPU and GPU subsystems are being taxed, I wonder what an 8W Haswell would look like in a similar situation... Final Words Whereas I didn't really have anything new to conclude in the original article (Atom Z2760 is faster and more power efficient than Tegra 3), there's a lot to talk about here. We already know that Atom is faster than Krait, but from a power standpoint the two SoCs are extremely competitive. At the platform level Intel (at least in the Acer W510) generally leads in power efficiency. Note that this advantage could just as easily be due to display and other power advantages in the W510 itself and not necessarily indicative of an SoC advantage. Looking at the CPU cores themselves, Qualcomm takes the lead. It's unclear how things would change if we could include L2 cache power consumption for Qualcomm as we do for Intel (see page 2 for an explanation). I suspect that Qualcomm does maintain the power advantage here though, even with the L2 cache included. On the GPU side, Intel/Imagination win there although the roles reverse as Adreno 225 holds a performance advantage. For modern UI performance, the PowerVR SGX 545 is good enough but Adreno 225 is clearly the faster 3D GPU. Intel has underspecced its ultra mobile GPUs for a while, so a lot of the power advantage is due to the lower performing GPU. In 2D/modern UI tests however, the performance advantage isn't realized and thus the power advantage is still valid. Qualcomm is able to generally push to lower idle power levels, indicating that even Intel's 32nm SoC process is getting a little long in the tooth. TSMC's 28nm LP and Samsung's 32nm LP processes both help silicon built in those fabs drive down to insanely low idle power levels. That being said, it is still surprising to me that a 5-year-old Atom architecture paired with a low power version of a 3-year-old process technology can be this competitive. In the next 9 - 12 months we'll finally get an updated, out-of-order Atom core built on a brand new 22nm low power/SoC process from Intel. This is one area where we should see real improvement. Intel's chances to do well in this space are good if it can manage to execute well and get its parts into designs people care about. If the previous article was about busting the x86 power myth, one key takeaway here is that Intel's low power SoC designs are headed in the right direction. Atom's power curve looks a lot like Qualcomm's, and I suspect a lot like Apple's. There are performance/power tradeoffs that all three make, but they're all being designed the way they should. The Cortex A15 data is honestly the most intriguing. I'm not sure how the first A15 based smartphone SoCs will compare to Exynos 5 Dual in terms of power consumption, but at least based on the data here it looks like Cortex A15 is really in a league of its own when it comes to power consumption. Depending on the task that may not be an issue, but you still need a chassis that's capable of dissipating 1 - 4x the power of a present day smartphone SoC made by Qualcomm or Intel. Obviously for tablets the Cortex A15 can work just fine, but I am curious to see what will happen in a smartphone form factor. With lower voltage/clocks and a well architected turbo mode it may be possible to deliver reasonable battery life, but simply tossing the Exynos 5 Dual from the Nexus 10 into a smartphone isn't going to work well. It's very obvious to me why ARM proposed big.LITTLE with Cortex A15 and why Apple designed Swift. I'd always heard about Haswell as the solution to the ARM problem, particularly in reference to the Cortex A15. The data here, particularly on the previous page, helped me understand exactly what that meant. Under a CPU or GPU heavy workload, the Exynos 5 Dual will draw around 4W. Peak TDP however is closer to 8W. If you remember back to IDF, Intel specifically called out 8W as a potential design target for Haswell. In reality, I expect that we'll see Haswell parts even lower power than that. While it may still be a stretch to bring Haswell down to 4W, it's very clear to me that Intel sees this as a possiblity in the near term. Perhaps not at 22nm, but definitely at 14nm. We already know Core can hit below 8W at 22nm, if it can get down to around 4W then that opens up a whole new class of form factors to a traditionally high-end architecture. Ultimately I feel like that's how all of this is going to play out. Intel's Core architectures will likely service the 4W and above space, while Atom will take care of everything else below it. The really crazy part is that it's not too absurd to think about being able to get a Core based SoC into a large smartphone as early as 14nm, and definitely by 10nm (~2017) should the need arise. We've often talked about smartphones being used as mainstream computing devices in the future, but this is how we're going to get there. By the time Intel moves to 10nm ultramobile SoCs, you'll be able to get somewhere around Sandy/Ivy Bridge class performance in a phone. At the end of the day, I'd say that Intel's chances for long term success in the tablet space are pretty good - at least architecturally. Intel still needs a Nexus, iPad or other similarly important design win, but it should have the right technology to get there by 2014. It's up to Paul or his replacement to ensure that everything works on the business side. As far as smartphones go, the problem is a lot more complicated. Intel needs a good high-end baseband strategy which, as of late, the Infineon acquisition hasn't been able to produce. I've heard promising things in this regard but the baseband side of Intel remains embarassingly quiet. This is an area where Qualcomm is really the undisputed leader, Intel has a lot of work ahead of it here. As for the rest of the smartphone SoC, Intel is on the right track. Its existing architecture remains performance and power competitive with the best Qualcomm has to offer today. Both Intel and Qualcomm have architecture updates planned in the not too distant future (with Qualcomm out of the gate first), so this will be one interesting battle to watch. If ARM is the new AMD, then Krait is the new Athlon 64. The difference is, this time, Intel isn't shipping a Pentium 4'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357342062006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 18:27:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357343718105-138</Id><Topic><Title>RELIABLY REDDDDDDDDDDD!</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1357330811765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:20:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just started tracking INTC as a long candidate ...

Sure, INTC may never get a strong foothold in the phone space, but they probably can dominate the tablet space.</Msg><Username>furball_80110</Username><Timestamp>1357343718105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 18:55:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357343830540-139</Id><Title>arm and friends are in deep trouble</Title><Msg>- latest from anandtech shows 5-year old architecture Atom (Clover Trail) beating Snapdragon S4 handily in performance....AND the kicker here is in terms of power consumption, the Clover Trail is on par with Snapdragon S4! - The very latest Cortex A15 (Samsung Exynos 5) can fairly beat Clover Trail, but kicker here is it comsumes way more power to do so! This means Samsung will have to significantly lower the voltage/clock speeds in order to get it into a smartphone which will in turn hurt performance. Here's what's coming at arm and friends: Smartphones: - Leaked Antutu benchmarks for next dual-core Medfield shows it scores more than twice that of the Samsung S3 and Snapdragon S4 phones. And we are not even talking about Merrifield yet! We should see the new Medfield at World Mobile Congress in February. Tablets: - Clover Trail+ and sub-10W Ivy Bridge Y parts coming in 1st quarter. From results of anandtech, CT+ should match or beat the Samsung Exynos 5. We will see soon enough. The sub-10W Ivy Bridge Y will definitely beat out the Exynos 5 in performance and will allow for high end hybrid PCs that will be much more thinner and lighter than what we see today. - Haswell comes in mid 2013, which will further allow OEMs to build more sleeker ultrabooks and hybrid PCs. Battery life will be double what we find in ultrabooks today. Next year Intel will have Merrifield and Bay Trail and Broadwell....</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357343830540</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 18:57:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357344401746-140</Id><Topic><Title>RELIABLY REDDDDDDDDDDD!</Title><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1357330811765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:20:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"INTC may never get a strong foothold in the phone space" I think you are wrong...check out the latest Antutu benchmarks for the next Medfield...more than double the score of any arm-base phones and Merrifield is coming</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357344401746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:06:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357345010573-141</Id><Topic><Title>How big will INTC's miss be on the 17th?</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1357337617074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 17:13:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hard to believe a human being would waste as much time as nuff on a chat board,IDIOT.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1357345010573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:16:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357345311166-142</Id><Topic><Title>arm and friends are in deep trouble</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357343830540</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 18:57:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smartphones are quickly going to morph into Smarcomputers, any idiot can see this coming.

Investor pushback has been along the lines of potential capex requirements from an AAPL foundry arrangement.

ASML refered to 45k 20nm waferstarts per month @ TSMC. What becomes clear is that the ARM manufacturing eco system is with the back to the wall. They need to improve process technology desperately to remain competitive. So GF and TSMC will throw money and engineers at it because otherwise they will be out of business.

It's too bad that none of the big Wall Street firm analysts have access to this information. If only there were something like a public network where this type of information could be shared. An "internet" if you will. Then Wall Street could make informed conclusions. Oh, well - that'll never happen...] "I'd always heard about Haswell as the solution to the ARM problem, particularly in reference to the Cortex A15. The data here, particularly on the previous page, helped me understand exactly what that meant. Under a CPU or GPU heavy workload, the Exynos 5 Dual will draw around 4W. Peak TDP however is closer to 8W. If you remember back to IDF, Intel specifically called out 8W as a potential design target for Haswell. In reality, I expect that we'll see Haswell parts even lower power than that. While it may still be a stretch to bring Haswell down to 4W, it's very clear to me that Intel sees this as a possiblity in the near term. Perhaps not at 22nm, but definitely at 14nm. We already know Core can hit below 8W at 22nm, if it can get down to around 4W then that opens up a whole new class of form factors to a traditionally high-end architecture. Ultimately I feel like that's how all of this is going to play out. Intel's Core architectures will likely service the 4W and above space, while Atom will take care of everything else below it. The really crazy part is that it's not too absurd to think about being able to get a Core based SoC into a large smartphone as early as 14nm, and definitely by 10nm (~2017) should the need arise. We've often talked about smartphones being used as mainstream computing devices in the future, but this is how we're going to get there. By the time Intel moves to 10nm ultramobile SoCs, you'll be able to get somewhere around Sandy/Ivy Bridge class performance in a phone. At the end of the day, I'd say that Intel's chances for long term success in the tablet space are pretty good. Intel still needs a Nexus, iPad or other similarly important design win, but it should have the right technology to get there by 2014. Intel is on the right track. Its existing architecture remains performance and power competitive with the best Qualcomm has to offer today."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357353258948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:34:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357353987710-152</Id><Topic><Title>ARM A15 is a Power hog according to Anandtech.

Previous rumors have suggested the TSMC has begun preparing test runs to make Apple’s A6X mobile processors. However, MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum suggest that Intel is a more logical choice for the role since it’s greater chip-making capacity could allow it to act as an Apple chip foundry without the need for new capital investment. Rumors suggest that TSMC has been investing heavily to accommodate Apple’s anticipated orders. But Berenbaum says that TSMC’s chip-making capacity remains too restricted to meet Apple’s heavy demand.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357354195078</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:49:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357354525282-154</Id><Topic><Title>ARM A15 is a Power hog according to Anandtech.
