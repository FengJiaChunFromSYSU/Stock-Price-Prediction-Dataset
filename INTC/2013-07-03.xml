Putting them on the back of a monitor is a great idea. It looks like you don't have a system unit at all. I still haven't found any place that has them pre-configured with RAM, SSD card and the Bluetooth/WiFi card. If anyone knows where they are available, please post it up. Pricing starts around $300 and is about $600 with a complete configuration. Logic Supply First to Offer Core i5-based 'Rend Lake' Intel NUC Motherboard from Tom's Hardware Logic Supply is officially the first to sell the D53427RKE 'Rend Lake' Intel NUC motherboard, the first Intel NUC motherboard to feature a Core i5 CPU. Earlier we reported that the upcoming NUC motherboards would feature Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs. Now Logic Supply has tweeted that it is the first to retail the Rend Lake NUC motherboard. This is the first Intel NUC motherboard to feature an Intel Core i5 CPU. The Core i5-3427U CPU aboard is clocked at 1.8 GHz. This NUC board goes by the model number D53427RKE. If the upgrade to a Core i5 CPU wasn't interesting enough, external connectivity has also been revised. The board now has one front USB 3.0 port, two rear USB 2.0 ports, another two USB 2.0 ports through an internal header, an HDMI 1.4a port, two Mini-DisplayPort 1.1a ports, and lastly, Gigabit Ethernet. The board also supports up to 16 GB of DDR3 SODIMM memory. Other internal connections include a PCIe-Mini slot (half-length), as well as a full-length mSATA slot. The board is already in stock at Logic Supply's webshop for a price of $399. Oddly enough, we haven't seen any official announcements for enclosures for the D53427RKE board, and it won't be compatible with existing enclosures because of the different rear I/O layout. [Apparently there are third party enclosures for the NUC...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372824306626</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 00:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372824398127-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: The Next Unit Of Computing - NUC</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372777672677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:07:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That said, we did manage to get a hold of a couple images of what appears to be Logic Supply's upcoming ML300 fanless NUC enclosure. The rear connectivity appears to still have the old layout, though from the looks of it the rear metal part of the casing can be swapped out. The enclosure also appears to be a little bigger than the standard size, and the image shows some interesting ideas for use of the cargo space. It doesn't appear to be listed on Logic Supply's website yet, however, we imagine it won't be long until it does.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372824398127</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 00:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372825983865-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: The Next Unit Of Computing - NUC</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372777672677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:07:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I found one pre-configured: Directron NUC PC 3: Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing) BOXDC3217BY, Intel Core i3-3217U 1.80GHz, Intel QS77 chipset, Intel 525 Series 240GB mSATA 6Gb/s Internal SSD, and 16GB SODIMM DDR3 memory</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372825983865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 00:33:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372826941100-4</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC, GlobalFoundries, And Samsung Can't Save ARM And AMD From Intel's FinFETs</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372821631277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:20:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tsmc can't even "reverse-engineer" their way to FinFet.

He went on to say that at 22nm the ability to reverse engineer is now gone. The devices are so small that only a handful of transistors can be seen under the most powerful scanning microscopes....a handful out of billions, how do you do old fashioned trouble shooting? Even TSMC's decision to go gate last was based on Intel's decision to go gate last.

Here's his argument. He says that assuming a) Intel's data center business grow by 13% in 2013 and b) Intel's other non-PC client segments grow 3%. If those two items are met, then in order for Intel to meet it's single digit revenue growth, then Intel's PC Client sales can *only* decline by 4%. HE THINKS THAT A 4% DECLINE IN PC CLIENT SALE IS TOO AGRESSIVE!!! LOL! Furthermore, he thinks AMD will take market share from Intel! Seriously, this guy is friggen out of his mind! Reality check: 1) Amd has *nothing* to gain market share with 2) Windows 8 didn't have general availability until end of October 2012 and MS delayed drivers for CloverTrail so OEMs did not have time to bring touch-enabled products to market for the holiday shopping season. And of course, first half of this year have really been to clear out old Ivy Bridge inventory in preparation for Haswell. This year OEMs will be ready with Haswell and Silvermont for the back-to-school and big holiday shopping season. Check out just a few of the new Haswell designs so far: Asus Transformer Book Trio, Samsung ATIV Q, Dell XPS 11, MacBook Air. All with all-day battery life. The Trio and Q have better displays and has Dual boot functionalities. There are many more products on the way including refresh of MS Surface Pro, Lenovo Yoga, etc. And then we have Y-series Haswell products coming out too. We are talking about fanless tablets and 2for1s. As for Bay Trail; expect many Android and Windows 8 tablets that will have superior performance and battery life over arm counterparts. It's going to be a big second half for Intel, there is no doubt about it. In fact, I would not be surprise to see a PC Client *increase* by end of 2013.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372836307483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 03:25:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372849444815-8</Id><Topic><Title>ANALysts really have it wrong</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372731133141</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 22:12:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I rarely follow the analysts since from my experience 90% have an agenda hence they 'show' only one side of the picture and blow it out of proportion.

My first post on the NVDA yahoo board in early 2011 was in outrage to his $40 price target on a stock that had already inflated on hype and fluff to $26. I gave all the correct reasons why it would not get there and further more gave a very accurate price target of $14 in a subsequent post to a notorious poster, daysofshred000000, who repeated the same $40 boast. Mosesmann has already lost the right to be taken seriously as he has not got a real clue about the industry about which he pontificates.

The first benchmarks of Intel’s upcoming Bay Trail SoC have appeared online — and it’s good news for x86 fans, but terrible news for ARM: Bay Trail-T, clocked at just 1.1GHz, is around 30% faster than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.3GHz, the fastest ARM chip on the market. This data comes from an Antutu benchmark, which shows a device with the code name byt_t_ffrd10 — Bay Trail-T Form Factor Reference Device — racking up the magnificent score of 43,416. This is apparently at 1.1GHz, while running Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean (it is probably the Android reference tablet that Intel showed off at Computex last month). By comparison, the latest Galaxy S4 with LTE-Advanced support, with the Snapdragon 800 SoC, scores just shy of 30,000.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1372852272552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 07:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372853743568-11</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Bay Trail benchmark appears online, crushes fastest Snapdragon ARM SoC by 30%</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1372852272552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 07:51:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks Jaguar performance class at ARM power levels, a devastating awesome combination ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1372853743568</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 08:15:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372854691872-12</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Bay Trail benchmark appears online, crushes fastest Snapdragon ARM SoC by 30%</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1372852272552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 07:51:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>um, well, as I have said, and without which, I can affirm that, to my best of knowledge, certainly notwithstanding.</Msg><Username>thebluereddork</Username><Timestamp>1372854691872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 08:31:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372855481554-13</Id><Topic><Title>OMG!*** RAYMOND JAMES:**** INTEL WILL MISS HUGE *******</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1372813683108</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 21:08:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why do you swallow go back</Msg><Username>mct18pipes</Username><Timestamp>1372855481554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 08:44:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372855572599-14</Id><Title>The "quiet Period" should apply to both the analysts and the company.</Title><Msg>Iknow, I know, the SEC is too busy at their 4 hour 6 martini lunches to address this issue...too busy spending all that kick-back money from the high frequency traders and hedge funds, but how hard would it be to put a rule in place that is fair and balanced: If XYZ corp is in a quiet period, then no analyst can comment on it without peril of losing his/her license.

It's clear what is happening and what will happen. We will see the ARM world fail and fail badly to meet the fabrication schedule that the marketing department has laid out. Why are the ARM foundries making these predictions that they can't possibly meet? They simply don't have a choice. If they told the truth there would be literally a stampede to Intel by everyone who could get Intel to take them. By making outlandish promises they buy a little time to attempt the impossible. Will it help? No, it won't fix anything. It will merely delay the inevitable. As Arnold indicates, the ARM foundries have years and years of work just to get to a half-step to FinFET. The reality will come clear as dates start to be missed. Intel is ready to move up to a two process node advantage in six months. Anyone who wants this state-of-the-art technology has to be working with Intel now. So, there are quite a few of the big boys of mobility who are already late to the game. And they know they have to come to Intel or their competitors will. Wall Street continues in denial as if something might happen to turn this around. Nothing is going to turn this around. The situation was created by ten years of effort and billions and billions of dollars. ARM can not and will not get back into the game. Not everyone is oblivious to what is happening. The 14 dollar drop in the ARM stock price is evidence. That drop should have been accompanied by a huge move up in Intel's stock price. This latest dip in Intel's stock price will just make it that much sweeter when the trap closes on Wall Street. Intel longs will laugh last, long and best....</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372857667921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372857687818-24</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC, GlobalFoundries, And Samsung Can't Save ARM And AMD From Intel's FinFETs</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372821631277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:20:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the latest dip in the stock price" late 2000 to now? armh is making a fool out of you, intc 24, armh 24, now look. 1 is 37, 1 is</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1372857687818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372857811228-25</Id><Topic><Title>Hans Mosesmann destroyed INTC momentum today</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1372820947331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:09:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if intel had better earnings none of your excuses would matter. blame intel they missed the mobile revolution not the analysts. ww predicted $3 eps 2 years ago.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1372857811228</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372858269116-26</Id><Title>First Intel Bay Trail benchmark score appears online, squashes ARM scores like an insignificant bug</Title><Msg>Today we have the first ever benchmark score of Intel’s new Bay Trail Atom platform. Tested using the popular AnTuTu benchmarking tool, Bay Trail beats every single ARM performance records and leaves competition far away in the dust. Every once in a while, a new wonder chip emerges and posts benchmark scores that simply blow again the competition into oblivion. Today is such a day. We have with us the first ever benchmark score run on Intel’s new Bay Trail platform, and the score promises us of great things with the next-generation Atom processors. With a high score of over 43,000 points, Bay Trail scores roughly 30% more in AnTuTu than its closest ARM competitor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800. Assuming that the S800 SoC will be the fastest ARM chip for the next 6-8 months, we have with us the fastest SoC that runs on Google’s OS, Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean if the leaked screenshot is to be believed. The Atom processors are clocked at 1.1 GHz, a far cry from the 2.3 GHz core clock found in the Snapdragon 800 chip. We expect these scores to climb further north with optimization, final software, faster core clock speeds and the eventual release of quad-core Bay Trail Atom processor based products. Don’t expect to see these babies on phones however, as they are most likely to heat up far too much. My guess is that the chip will be downclocked to fit within the required thermal envelope. With the newest Atom based device being the Lenovo K900 (Clover Trail+), we really do hope that any major OEM (Sony, Samsung, ZTE, Huawei) picks up the fast and the furious Intel chip and integrate it into their future solutions. We’d love to see some more x86 Android action, now that power and performance issues have finally been sorted out.

The Atom likes antutu and ARM (and redbluemonk) likes Geekbench. ---- Interestingly enough, out of the (tested) Atom family it's only Clovertrail+ that really likes the antutu benchmark, and we still haven't had official numbers for Clovertrail+ (K900 etc) on the Antutu site. Antutu as a pure CPU benchmark is poor (as it contains none CPU based components in the score) and it's based on Java, not native code. The 1.1 GHz number is interesting, my first thought was that this device could be a core based product. Then again, Clovertrail has a base of 1.3, turboing to 2Ghz, so Antutu could be reporting it's base clock. If the score is legit and if this is a Silvermont core then the ARM crowd are going to struggle to match it.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1372861471879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:24:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372861635631-48</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Bay Trail benchmark appears online, crushes fastest Snapdragon ARM SoC by 30%</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372858960542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:42:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>theblueredmonk, I'm not sure why people give you #$%$...you seem to be pretty objective.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1372861635631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:27:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372861975109-49</Id><Topic><Title>First Intel Bay Trail benchmark score appears online, squashes ARM scores like an insignificant bug</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372858269116</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:31:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like the word is getting around. stock jumped out of low of day pretty quickly.

My comment was not a slam on the monk. I just don't like Geekbench and sometimes cannot control my fingers. IMO, there are substantial problems in comparing ARM vs x86 using Geekbench since the two chips do not even run the same Geekbench workloads. The results are typically run by users with results submitted automatically. I cannot see where Geekbench determines what else was running with the benchmarks, state of battery/power, turbo enabled/disabled, ... Same is true of Antutu. I would hope that theblueredmonk knows that I just disagree with the value of Geekbench and was taking a preemptive shot. I checked the Geekbench results to see if there were any Bay Trail ones that slipped in but could not find them.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1372863941939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:05:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372863946519-66</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry for crying like a baby here again today, guys</Title><Username>tiglet3l</Username><Timestamp>1372858317096</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh? that's a good one but ww is the old one here.

The largest chunk of the pie is the currently most beloved OS, Windows 7. . In second place with a chunk of the pie that isn't much smaller is a 12 year old OS. Together that's eight out of 10 systems that is using an OS that is at least four years old. I would like to see Microsoft switch over to a rental model. Each PC that runs Windows XP you can buy a 3 year license for $20. Each one that runs Windows 7 you can buy 3 years for $30. For $10 you can backup all your data on one computer onto Microsoft's servers and then Microsoft will reformat your drive. It will find the newest drivers for everything on your system and re-install everything with the latest software and drivers. The newer version of the OS will be built without patches. If your hard drive goes down in 90 days you can get all your data back for free. Otherwise there will be a yearly backup service fee if you want it to continue after 90 days. If they did this they could offer things like Windows XP+ where it would have newer features found in Window 7 (like backup and restore) and develop the OS in the direction that consumers would find of value. For many people XP is good enough for them, and they have no interest in gong to Windows 8. Why are they being forced to make this choice? If Microsoft owned Disneyland they would have built a larger park across town and after a while stopped fixing the broken down rides at Disneyland. Regardless if you ever wanted to go to the new park or not you would have no choice, you have to go to Disneyland 8.1 across town. Just look at the Windows 8 numbers, Intel is being held hostage due to Microsoft's stupidity. Consumers want new PC's they just don't want Windows 8. These numbers make that point very clear.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1372865676020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:34:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372866157435-74</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street says they support our VETS , but it sure doesn't look like it, Letting Congress furlough our DOD VETS the week after the 4</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372791664788</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 15:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Support our VETS move to cash and SEND WALL STREET and Congress a message that it is wrong not to take care of our VETS</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372866157435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:42:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372866781137-75</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street says they support our VETS , but it sure doesn't look like it, Letting Congress furlough our DOD VETS the week after the 4</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372791664788</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 15:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$</Msg><Username>phil.latio777</Username><Timestamp>1372866781137</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372866797678-76</Id><Topic><Title>OS percentages as of June 2013</Title><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372862936976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I still love my XP system. it works great and i'm not going to upgrade. my new system is Win 7, a great little OS.

While its exact launch date hasn’t been revealed, China’s Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center has approved the handset recently – which means it could go on sale pretty soon (at least in China). Following the latest trend, the ZTE Geek is a pretty large smartphone, as it sports a 5 inch display (with 1280 x 720 pixels). It also comes with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, HSDPA, Wi-Fi, GPS, 1MP front-facing camera, an 8MP rear camera, wireless charging capabilities, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal memory (expandable with MicroSD cards), and a 2,300 mAh battery. The Z2580 processor is a dual-core unit clocked at 2GHz. Meanwhile, ZTE has announced its second Atom Z2580-powered smartphone – the Grand X2 In, which should be released this quarter. We’ll let you know which of the two Intel-powered ZTE smartphones hits the market first.

But just like the Lenovo K900, the Clovertrail+ SOC in it delivers ARM beating performance. In the standard AntTuTu Benchmark that we ran on the show floor, the ZTE Geek scored an impressive 29401, better than the scores found in the public domain of the HTC One (Qualcomm 600) and Samsung Galaxy S IV (Exynos 5410). Naturally, one should reserve judgement and not entirely formulate opinion based on benchmarks done on the show floor (who knows what shenanigans could be happening behind the scenes). We would love to get our hands on one of these in our labs to do a proper analysis especially on the battery drain characteristics of the Clovertrail+ SoC, which actually matters more than raw performance to most people.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1372883814734</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 16:36:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372884324624-114</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Now 20 Cents Off the High of the Day</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372861405441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:23:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM up about 4 percent today......Explain to me how this isn't a content-free, waste of bandwith post.

Essentially the Ruku device acts as a full-on cable box for Time Warner Cable subscribers. [IMO, these developments are positive for Intel's TV service. Looks to me like the industry is moving towards a new structure in which there is now a distinction between the Internet service provider and the TV service provider. For example, you can subscribe to TWC TV service but have Comcast as your internet provide. I'm positive on these developments because Intel can offer their own TV bundles and also offer Comcast's or TWC's, so there's many opportunities for Intel to partner and current players instead of just competing. And if Intel's cable-box system has the killer user interface as rumored, Intel should be able to sell a bunch of these and the slowly add gaming and other functionalities to the cable box. They can also get OEMs to start building cable boxes based on Intel's chipsets and start an ecosystem for the living room.]</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1372895888613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 19:58:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372895929756-131</Id><Title>Apple just made a huge mistake by signing with TSMC</Title><Msg>The only people who will gain from this will be Apple's competition. What began as a rumor is now news: Apple plans to sever its last tie to Samsung and have its line of ARM processors manufactured by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., otherwise known as TSMC. It will be a while before TSMC actually gets anything from this deal, since Samsung will still be supplying chips to Apple for at least another year. It's a windfall for TSMC and a painful hit for Samsung, no doubt about it. Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong, estimates that Apple's component orders from Samsung were set to hit around $10 billion last year. Who would want to give that kind of money to their mortal enemy? Still, Tim, you couldn't make a worse decision. Well you could but I don't want to consider those options. Intel was a rumored suitor to make the Apple ARM chips and I think Tim Cook will regret not signing with them. Intel is an increasing rarity in semiconductors, a company that makes its own chips. Most are fabless, meaning they don't make their chip, they outsource to a firm like TSMC. As manufacturing processes have gotten smaller and smaller, it's been harder and harder to stay competitive and some firms have fallen by the wayside, leaving just a few. TSMC is the leader in this field and it has all the big players, which is already proving a problem. For starters, TSMC has a dubious history when it comes to on-time delivery and making the jump to a new fabrication process. There was a time when every Nvidia earnings call featured CEO Jen-Hsun Huang ranting and complaining about TSMC not being able to provide the company with all the product it needed. It got so bad, Nvidia publicly slammed TSMC at the International Trade Partner Conference, of all places.

And TSMC's inability to deliver has hamstrung Qualcomm, too. The fact that both companies remains with TSMC and haven't jumped to Globalfoundaries or Intel shows how intertwining these deals can be and how hard they are to extract your company. Apple has wanted out from the Samsung deal for a while and still won't be free until next year. Intel may be struggling in mobility with the Atom processors, but Intel does yields and manufacturing process migration better than anyone. While TSMC wrestles with 28nm and looking to 20nm, Intel is at 22nm now and moving to 14nm for next year. This is important; the smaller the fabrication design, the less power used. The stock pickers at Seeking Alpha know this. One columnist pointed out "it is quite possible that Intel might be 2 Moore generations ahead of TSMC and other companies by 2014," a reference to Moore's Law. Not just that, but TSMC already can't meet the capacity needs of Qualcomm and Nvidia. Now it's going to soak up Apple's demands? Apple has a habit of making huge, all-at-once buys. It's been known to nearly drain the market of DDR or Flash RAM with one buy in preparation for a launch. TSMC can't meet the modest demands of Nvidia and Qualcomm and now it's taking on Apple. Apple is going to rue this decision. Something will have to give. This might be the impetus for Nvidia to move to Globalfoundaries (I doubt it will ever be able to work with Intel after what Jen-Hsun has said about Intel over the years) and Qualcomm may also abandon ship. In any case, three giant players all demanding capacity from a company that can't satisfy two is a recipe for disaster, or at the very least severe product shortages (which for some people is a disaster).</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372895978301</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 19:59:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372896054727-133</Id><Topic><Title>Apple just made a huge mistake by signing with TSMC</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372895929756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 19:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee, did UBS do any due diligence before upgrading ARM?

The result would be steady capital spending, avoiding declines of the past." Bernstein Research’s tech team Wednesday offered the second installment of their treatise on the future of semiconductor production, “Dawn of Dusk for Semi Capital Equipment Manufacturers?” following the first installment on Monday. Authors Pierre Ferragu, Stacy Rasgon, Mark Li, and Mark Newman follow on their observation that delivering on Moore’s Law — the rule of thumb that transistor density doubles every two years — is going to be increasingly expensive, driving up capital investment expense for the industry. The authors posit that chip makers such as Intel (INTC) may succeed in balancing rising cost of wafers with the higher economies of reduced transistor size. The result would be steady capital spending, avoiding declines of the past. In a less desirable scenario, the authors write, the costs of production will outweigh progress on Moore’s Law, which could make spending untenable for the industry. In either case, the authors write that the stepped up investment will result in some particular winners in the semiconductor tools business:</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372896322079</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:05:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372896342381-135</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Bay Trail benchmark appears online, crushes fastest Snapdragon ARM SoC by 30%</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372858960542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:42:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you're right.</Msg><Username>angstromatic</Username><Timestamp>1372896342381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:05:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372896392585-136</Id><Title>Report: Global Tablet Panel Shipments to Increase 69% in 2013</Title><Msg>IHS believes the strong growth of tablet panel demand continued in the second quarter. The arrival of more turnkey tablet design solutions will drive up demand for 7" and 8" panels throughout the year. The 8" panels are becoming an increasingly large segment of the tablet market, with a display area more appealing to users than the 7" size. In all, the 8" panels accounted for 11% of panel shipments in April, with Samsung and Acer having recently launched new tablets in that size. With more introductions likely coming in the third quarter, IHS expects a substantial market share for the 8" by the end of this year. The market for larger-sized, 10" and bigger tablet panels may begin to enjoy a recovery in shipments with the launch of the new Intel Corp. Atom microprocessor, code-named Bay Trail. This new device could help reduce the cost of x86 microprocessor-based tablets and improve battery life. Bay Trail also could generate opportunities for hybrid-form tablets that include keyboards. 2013: Year of the Intel Tablet (Bay Trail rocks)</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372896392585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:06:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372896560246-137</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Bay Trail benchmark appears online, crushes fastest Snapdragon ARM SoC by 30%</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1372858960542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:42:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the stupidest argument one uses when their processor loses the performance battle.

Nobody can time the market with a stop watch - everybody who claims is a con artist like Aqualang ... daytrading sucks .. pick and hold with confidence Overall, we expect growth in the semicap industry to be stronger in the next decades than it was in previous ones, whatever the evolution scenario we consider. At the same time, all process steps won’t benefit equally, there will be winners and losers […] Winning segments are process steps at the origin of the increase in cost per wafer: Lithography, Process Control. In addition, we see Wafer-level packaging as a long term winner as well. Losing segments suffer from the decline in wafer additions we anticipate under the combined effect of increasing costs per wafer and the 450mm migration: Etch, Clean and Planarization, Deposition, RTP/Oxidation, Ion implantation, Manufacturing Automation […] In our coverage, ASML [Holding NV (ASML)] is a structural winner and remains a top pick. Outside of our coverage, KLA Tencor (KLAC), Hermes, NuFlare, Rudolph, and Nanometrics (NANO) appear as standing to benefit from the mourning of Moore’s Law. For most other players, mourning Moore’s Law equates to a secular headwind. At first sight, if mourning Moore’s Law is about more expensive wafer starts, it can’t be bad for capital equipment spending as a whole. It isn’t indeed. We described in our Silicon War research last year how competition for manufacturing leadership structurally increased capital expenses at leading foundries and IDMs. Combined with the concentration of the industry, the picture is fairly impressive. Cumulated capex of the top 3 manufacturers reached ~$33bn last year, vs. an average of $13bn from 2004 to 2009 […] In sum, we expect Lithography and Process Control to grow at a much faster rate than the overall semi cap market.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1372896610020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 20:10:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372897144140-139</Id><Title>INTC -- Samsung -- Boxee</Title><Msg>What do you get when you mix the largest gadget-porn maker, the largest and most advanced chip maker, and an Israeli cloud-based DVR company?

Even TSMC's decision to go gate last was based on Intel's decision to go gate last. I live in Taiwan. The Taiwanese love to copy. Saying, "Go ahead. Try. Good luck." is awesome. TSMC has based their timelines on past abilities to reverse-engineer INTC processes. Now that ability is gone. The investment needed 5 years ago wasn't made (thank you Russ Fischer for that info).

Around the 45nm node (when Intel introduced HKMG) TSMC was supposed to fab 45nm Atoms for Intel - but Intel pulled out. I don't think Intel is that late - back than Intel was well aware they would end up on collision course with TSMC..... Reversed engineering: interestingly SMIC (mainland China) did this to TSMC - they copied everything from TSMC to make chips for BRCM.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is why INTC does not patent everything they do. They don't want to give competitors a road map to follow. It would be nice to think that the 22nm process, and smaller, are too small to reverse engineer, but I can't underestimate the Taiwanese and Chinese ability to copy. Either way, it will take time to figure out.... time INTC will use to move to 14nm. TSMC will still only be at a functional 28nm when INTC is putting out 14nm. Also, INTC is the only company that can maintain the cost savings per die shrink. By Christmas, TSMC customers will be waiting for product. By this time next year, INTC will be the only chip that's stronger, faster, cheaper.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1372909799199</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 23:49:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
