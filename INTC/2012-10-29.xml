John Kasich on Sunday, June 3rd, 2012 in an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" said 1,800 DIRECT jobs. Did he change his number since June 3rd? Republican Governor John Kasich is far from a non-partisan source of information. The key word "direct" is the one that should be examined and I expect that Obama included the indirect jobs in the supply chain and Kasich not include them. I would expect that there may be a small number of direct jobs but 400 generated by the direct and indirect effects is far too low. From the Republican leaning Tampa Bay Times: However, the direct job figures don’t tell the whole story. The supply chain that feeds into a finished car is long and complicated. The BLS tracks the car parts industry, but it doesn’t track the other manufacturing jobs that supply auto parts makers. An analysis by the Center for Automotive Research, an independent group that gets some support from the auto industry, found that the number of jobs in metals, plastics and rubber that are tied to auto parts makers is about half again larger than the number of jobs in the auto parts sector itself. It is very difficult to know how this ripple effect plays out in Ohio itself. "The problem is we have these artificial boundaries called state borders," said Kim Hill, associate research director at the Center. "An assembly plant in Michigan can produce jobs at a Mom and Pop tool and die maker in Ohio and vice versa." Hill says often, the small firms themselves aren't aware of the connection. James Rubenstein, a professor at Miami University, has drilled into the complex connections among manufacturers in the car business. "A very high percentage of steel produced in Ohio goes to the auto industry," Rubenstein said. And he added, the pattern would carry through for all primary metals, machine shops and other fabricators. The larger the fraction of steel, for example, that went to cars, the larger the number of jobs attributable to the industry. Some of those downstream companies could be selling to car makers and car part suppliers in other states. The revival of the car industry was not limited to Ohio. It also took hold in places such as Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Increased activity there could produce jobs in Ohio. As a final complication, Strickland tied the auto industry to manufacturing in general. At some level, when people have jobs, they buy some big ticket items such as washing machines and refrigerators. Those purchases also would generate manufacturing jobs. The problem is, we could find no clear tally of all of these possible effects.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1351523119520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 11:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351526740935-13</Id><Topic><Title>Dell XPS Ultrabook review - This guys loves it and loves the future of the PC</Title><Username>intelonly_please</Username><Timestamp>1351480636273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:17:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung 13.3" Series 9: 3317U processor 0.50" thick 2.55 pounds weight NP900X3C-A01US NP900X3C-A03US I would be okay with a Samsung Series 9 tablet or convertible.

Desperate companies bond. HP ditches ARM for Intel in Project Moonshot Intel's Atom chips will now be at the heart of the first commercial product to appear from HP's Project Moonshot, in place of the originally-planned ARM processors. Intel has managed to convince server giant HP to eschew ARM-based chips in favour of its own Atom processors as part of the low-power Project Moonshot effort. Originally announced back in November 2011, Project Moonshot is HP's attempt to create low-power high-density server systems packing as many as 2800 server blades into a single rack. The company partnered with ARM, AMD, Calxeda, Canonical and Red Hat on the project - a list of companies in which Intel, you may note, does not appear. The original plan was to create servers based around Calxeda's EnergyCore dual-core chips, which feature a class-leading thermal design profile (TDP) of just 1.5 watts. Using these low-power chips, HP claimed it could create servers drawing 89 per cent less energy and taking up just six per cent of the space of a traditional server installation. That equates to massive improvements in efficiency for high-volume datacentres and a dramatic saving in power and heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) costs for everyone else. It also marked ARM's first major foray into the world of the server since the company departed the desktop market following the industry's switch away from ARM-based systems like the RiscPC and towards IBM-compatible x86 devices. For ARM, HP's decision to use its instruction set in Project Moonshot was a major validation and a win which could be used to great effect in convincing other high-density server makers to investigate ARM-based solutions. That's a situation which Intel, clearly, has found untenable - and it has convinced HP that Atom is the way to go. According to HP's latest announcement, the initial production servers to come out of Project Moonshot - codenamed Gemini - will be based around Intel Centerton Atom chips, rather than Calxeda's EnergyCore products. Intel, naturally, is saying that HP's made the right choice. 'The unprecedented value of the Intel Atom processor codenamed Centerton — with features like 64-bit support, ECC and an established software x86 ecosystem — will offer customers the increased flexibility and drastically reduced total cost of ownership required to compete in the fast-growing hyperscale computing space,' Intel's Jason Waxman, general manager of cloud infrastructure at the chip giant, claimed of HP's move. HP's decision to support Intel despite the latter company's refusal to become an official partner in Project Moonshot is no real surprise: back in November HP announced that the second-generation Moonshot servers, codenamed Redstone, would include an Atom option - but it was always planning on using ARM chips for its first-generation Gemini product. HP isn't giving up on ARM in the datacentre altogether, though: the company has confirmed that, while Gemini will launch later in the year using Atom chips, processors from other, unnamed vendors will be produced for use with the blade infrastructure. The company did not, however, provide a timescale for their release.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351563688050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:21:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351564064650-35</Id><Topic><Title>AMD adds ARM64 to its server line</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351553544627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:32:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"features like 64-bit support, ECC" yup, ARM64 coming at you...:)</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351564064650</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351564873135-36</Id><Topic><Title>120,000 Jobs created in Ohio.......only 400 of those related to Auto</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351521870640</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The whole country is beginning to emerge from the BUSH FINANCIAL PANIC. It is not a recession. When ROMNEY loses Ohio he can thank Republican Governor Kasich. It was Kasich who pushed though the anti-union legislation. The Democratic organization that was put in place to defeat the Kasich Krap was kept in place though the election. Thank you Kasich. More government workers? This is the first "recession" ever where the number of government employees has been reduced. Republican Presidents, pad the number of government workers. Karl Rove school of politics: If you repeat a lie often enough, conservative, religious extremists will believe it. It has nothing to do with Kasich.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351564873135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351565095704-37</Id><Topic><Title>AMD hopes to add ARM64 to server line by 2014 (yes, 2014)</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1351563101993</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:11:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol...</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1351565095704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:44:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351567767875-38</Id><Topic><Title>W8 Reviews - What They Don't Say</Title><Username>publicservice100</Username><Timestamp>1351376841744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The yahoo message board has become pretty useless except for your posts...You have me nearly peeing in my pants!
