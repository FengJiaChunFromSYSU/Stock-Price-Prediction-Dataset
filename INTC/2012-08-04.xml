He is GAY!http://pssht.com/biography/rush_limbaugh.html In effect, Limbaugh spent nearly a decade stoned off his bleeding backside, and ultimately built up his tolerance to levels requiring dozens of pills per day in order to, as Limbaugh once confided in his maid, "get my buzz on." A textbook example of the damning effects of drug abuse, Limbaugh's addiction precipitated a swift drop in weight, deafness in both ears, and a marked decline in mental faculties. He also became increasingly paranoid - requiring his provider to meet him at night behind restaurants, next to dumpsters, where he'd hand over cigar boxes stuffed with "cabbage" (cash) in exchange for some "little baby blues" (pills). Limbaugh's desperation peaked in 2003, when he groped his provider in an attempt to check her for a wire tap. By late 2003 the whole world knew of Limbaugh's drug addiction, though by virtue of their lack of character the majority of his fan base remained loyal listeners. Limbaugh's show remained popular, despite the rapid rise of Liberal Talk Show host Al Franken and the dogged attempts by the Bush administration to shut down long time talk show staple Howard Stern. In May 2004 Rush's third wife, Marta, grew tired of never having sex with her allegedly closeted homosexual of a husband, and so asked for a divorce. Limbaugh complied after his desperate wife agreed to never reveal the true nature of Rush's sexual perversion.</Msg><Username>amdroadkilldec2009</Username><Timestamp>1344056827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 01:07:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344063530000-4</Id><Title>I N T E L</Title><Msg>The best company in the world!</Msg><Username>texanjk99</Username><Timestamp>1344063530000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 02:58:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344063618000-5</Id><Title>I::::::::::N::::::::::T::::::::::E::::::::::L</Title><Msg>This is fun!</Msg><Username>texanjk99</Username><Timestamp>1344063618000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 03:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344063677000-6</Id><Topic><Title>____I____N____T____E____L____!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>salomonbernstein</Username><Timestamp>1343977518000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 03:05:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is the highlight of the chip industry.</Msg><Username>texanjk99</Username><Timestamp>1344063677000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 03:01:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344075755000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts on Fire</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344003503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:18:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll take 40 by the end of the year.

You did get something. You were able to observe, up close, dividend arbitraging and I think that you have a good idea what happened and why. I am still observing and trying to figure out how it works. Just before the close, the premium on the call option is zero and the premium on the put is equal to 100% of the dividend. The option market maker has to protect himself from a discontinuity in pricing that happens at the close. That is one reason why I sell put options (for the premium time decay) rather than sell call options. I roll out the options when the premium gets low, unless I sold the put options to buy shares.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1344094716000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 11:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344094914000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation (INTC)</Title><Username>angleasda518189</Username><Timestamp>1344090421000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:27:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Okay cool.

The software wasn’t ready. Instead of fulfilling customers’ orders, Knight’s computers went on an out-of-control spree of rapid-fire buying and selling. As trading volumes swelled, the Wall Street guys jumped in. (Sophisticated traders, relying on their own rapid-fire computers, often love volatility because it leads to trading anomalies they can take advantage of.) Many retail customers, having no idea what was going on, wound up losing money. I know: shocker. The mishap also cost Knight so much money that its future is in jeopardy. Even putting aside the havoc wreaked on customers, you’d think that self-preservation would have been enough for Knight to want to ensure that its software worked. But apparently not. Wall Street is now as blindly reliant on computers, on algorithms, on high-frequency trading, as it was once blindly reliant on the risk models that allowed “toxic bonds” to be rated Triple A. Wall Street has created its own Frankenstein. The machines are now in charge. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/opinion/nocera-frankenstein-takes-over-the-market.html?_r=1</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344112268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344112337000-34</Id><Topic><Title>Frankenstein Takes Over the Market</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344112268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wall Street never tires of figuring out ways to shaft the small investor.

Most rapid-fire trading has nothing to do with the core idea that drew people to the market in the first place — that if you picked good companies, and did your homework, you could make money. High-frequency trading is about buying and selling in seconds — for a trader relying on an algorithm, the “long term” is an hour. Maybe. [Wall Street has apparently abandoned that idea of picking good companies and doing homework to make money. They seem to think it's more profitable to manipulate the market. Despite continuously getting whacked, Wall Street's largest firms still engage in trying to suppress Intel's stock price...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344112725000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344121236000-38</Id><Title>Hey could Romney win Florida?</Title><Msg>Yes but it does not matter. Romney been a bloodsucker his entire career, that why he has 100 Million tucked away in his IRA. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Harry trying to bring out the truth. Romney is flailing to suppress Obama wins easily. Rightwing KKk teabagging trashball losers will cry. Rush will yell that he told you not to nominate Romney. Yeah Rush and I told you not to take all those pills and to be a closet homo but you still did it.</Msg><Username>amdroadkilldec2009</Username><Timestamp>1344121236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:00:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344121377000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Hey could Romney win Florida?</Title><Username>amdroadkilldec2009</Username><Timestamp>1344121236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:00:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The GOP have only themselves to blame. Obama was ripe for the picking until they nominated Mitt Romney, the worst Presidential candidate in modern history. Republicans didn't have the brains or the balls to nominate an intelligent moderate to battle Obama - they picked Romney, a shameless fraud with huge political and business baggage, and no political skills or personal charm. Obama will win easily, and hopefully this will cause the GOP to move back to the sane center again.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1344121377000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344122399000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Frankenstein Takes Over the Market</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1344112268000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read recently that 70 percent of all trading on Wall Street is by "high frequency" traders, and that the average length of time a stock is held is 11 seconds!
