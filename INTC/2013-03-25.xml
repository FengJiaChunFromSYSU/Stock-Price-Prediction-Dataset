This could turn into a BIG story if they cannot fix the problem soon ---- Rehashed rumor. Just like the existing S3, there are two versions. One with a QCOM app processor and one with a Samsung processor as they are dependent on the baseband. Some markets get one type (US will get the QCOM version), while others get Samsung's App processor (the Octa), while some markets (such as the UK) get both. Millions of the 'Octa' processors have already been made ready for launch. As for the fabless model not knowing about manufacturing processes, I suggest you do a google for ARM physical IP and see what you find.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1364218371749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 09:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364218728811-17</Id><Topic><Title>chump - ZTE and Acer will have a 4G LTE phone in US market later this year!!!</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364218041866</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 09:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who's gonna buy enough ACER phones to make ANY sort of dent in the market, buffoon !</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1364218728811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 09:38:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364218844048-18</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Galaxy S4 overheats on Exynos 5 CPU</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364163618843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 18:20:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>70% of first 10 million Samsung Galaxy S4 units will come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor by Ankit Banerjee on Mar 25, 2013 "Now, an ET News report says that the Qualcomm version of the smartphone could head to more markets than initially expected, with 70% of the first batch of 10 million Samsung Galaxy S4 units will arrive with the Snapdragon 600 processor on-board.

LONDON – Intel Corp. is making progress with its development of LTE modems but does not expect to have an integrated LTE modem and application processor until 2014, according to CEO Paul Otellini. When asked specifically about integration of LTE modem circuitry with a mobile application processor such as the Atom during an analysts' conference call held to discuss Intel's fourth quarter 2012 financial results, Otellini said: "In terms of integrated solutions, you'll see higher levels of integration from us next year." During the call, Otellini said Intel was shipping a data-only mode LTE modem IC to customers and that a data-and-voice multimode modem would ship during the course of 2013. He added that he expects the first mobile phones with Intel supplied LTE capability to have launched early in 2014 at about the time of the Mobile World Congress.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364218880587</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 09:41:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364219119170-20</Id><Topic><Title>Intel says no LTE until 2014</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1364176907845</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 22:01:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alexander, thank you for shutting this bacbacker up.

I value civility and honesty. I confess that trying to understand what the LTE issue is about from marketing descriptions is very challenging. I tend to agree with what ideal_invst is saying about data mode shipping now, a separate multi-mode modem chip shortly and then LTE integrated on the same chip with Atom in early 2014. That is how I read the announcements. Paul Otellini is saying that the single chip is the target (early 2014). However, Intel has announce it is shipping the XM7160 multimode chip LTE and customer products this year. It means that saying "no multimode LTE" is wrong. It also means that QCOM has a better solution if you want to buy their Snapdragon chip with LTE integrated.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364220114106</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364220469887-24</Id><Title>Thank you Alexander</Title><Msg>....for shutting Backbacker up with one littel sentence.

Ltd. to develop reference design flows using PowerVR Series 6 GPUs for manufacturing processes including the forthcoming 16-nm FinFET process. GPU cores are coming to dominate the area, power and performance of SoCs and therefore process design flows and libraries need to be tuned and optimized for them. The use of high bandwidth memory channels and 3#$%$ assembly will be part of the collaboration and should allow the two companies to demonstrate high performance, small physical footprint and low power, said Imagination Technologies Group plc (Kings Langley, England). "Just as memory drove silicon processes in the 80s and 90s, and CPUs drove processes further in the late 90s and 00s, high performance mobile GPUs for graphics and compute applications are one of the major drivers for our most advanced process technologies," said Cliff Hou, vice president of R&amp;D at TSMC (Hsinchu, Taiwan), in a statement issued by Imagination. Hossein Yassaie, CEO of Imagination, said: "Through advanced projects initiated under this partnership, Imagination and TSMC are working together to showcase how SoCs will transform the future of mobile and embedded products." As well as developing the widely licensed PowerVR series of graphics processors, Imagination also offers the PowerVR VPU video decoder and encoder, the Ensigma radio processor unit (RPU) which covers connectivity applications and the recently acquired line of MIPS processor cores</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364225368036</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:29:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364225692294-44</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>markmiller108</Username><Timestamp>1364225692294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364226120259-45</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>linkosarah</Username><Timestamp>1362149300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:48:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

A very small number of technically astute forum posters, but not journalists, challenged the prevailing thought arguing Intel's case for mobile success largely on a detailed understanding of technology and the financial implications of Intel's mutli-year roadmap. Today, at the end of Q1 2013 the picture is looking very different. Intel's Core architecture is preparing to deliver the single largest improvement in power efficiency and graphics performance in Intel's history. Intel's 32nm Clovertrail+ is winning key performance benchmarkets and getting numerous design wins for smartphones and tablets and Clovertrail's successor Baytrail with even better performance will be in mobile products by the holidays. On the software front Intel's Windows-Android dual-boot, multi-boot capability will further distinguish Intel-based mobile devices from those based on ARM. Today, we see articles like, "It's Not A Matter Of If, But When Intel Dominates Mobile". Perhaps that title is a bit strong as journalists like shock value, but the important point is that tide of sentiment among even the less-technical general media crowd has woken up to the new reality and the arsenal of products Intel is about to unleash in the marketplace as well as the impact those products will have on consumer behavior. Q2 begins a new era.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364226451414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364226647056-47</Id><Title>If I were Intel and Apple...</Title><Msg>I'd be working together to spin off Intel's fab operations into a jointly-owned separate company. Apple would pay Intel, say, $40B, or whatever the right price is, for half of the value of the spin-off, which Intel would return to shareholders in a special dividend. Intel would become essentially a fabless semi-company that still dominates server and PC architecture. Apple would get access to a two-generation ahead fab process for ARM-based chips (which ain't happening while Andy Bryant is around), the most efficient fabs in the world for high-volume designs, and resolve a dependency on Samsung and/or TSMC, which as we all know from the Qualcomm and Nvidia experiences is a risky proposition. Samsung would probably go along, since it would take the new fab operation years to ramp to meet Apple, and that would give Samsung time to down-ramp, which would be better for Samsung than Apple just dumping them for TSMC. I can't think of a better use for Apple's cash either. My guess is that what's left of Intel would go to a PE more like 12-14, maybe higher, after the initial frenzy passes.</Msg><Username>firstofmany</Username><Timestamp>1364226647056</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364226662320-48</Id><Title>a marching ARMH y.</Title><Msg>Evercore Partners tech analyst Patrick Wang today offers up clients some notes from his trip through Silicon Valley last week, ranging across a number of semiconductor names.

Even a 20% market share by 2016 would be significant - especially given the overall market growth in China and India.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1364237020505</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:43:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364237191588-68</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe our President...</Title><Username>prabbit51</Username><Timestamp>1364231605984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:13:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe we should give 100% of all the money we work for to the government, I mean they obviously know what's better for us that we do right???</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1364237191588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:46:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364237200778-69</Id><Topic><Title>Media Attitudes Are Changing</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364226451414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:47:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>India and China are cutthroat competitive because they are both price sensitive markets.

Intel's is producing now and will have volume production by the end of the year. Meanwhile ARM's hasn't broken ground and will be only a half-step when it arrives, years from now, if ever. And ARM's 20nm is a couple of years from volume production. It means ARM is stuck at 28nm forever and Intel will enjoy a two process node advantage. These are the dynamics that you should pay attention to and not the stock performance over the last 52-weeks. If this is too much for you then you should invest in something with a shorter cycle time. Those that hang in will be extremely pleased with the results. Intel will have many customers to choose from and Apple might not be the best. The Altera deal demonstrated that the control is now passing to Intel. They have the technology, the manufacturing and the capacity and ARM doesn't.

(INTC) is making progress in talks with Time Warner Inc. (TWX), NBC Universal and Viacom Inc. (VIAB) to obtain TV shows and films for a first-of-its kind online multichannel pay-TV service, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is negotiating financial terms with the companies, according to the people, who sought anonymity because the talks are private. The media companies have signed off on the broad outlines of the proposed service, said the people, with some aspects still to be settled. Other network owners aren’t as far along, they said. Networks such as Time Warner’s CNN, NBC’s USA Network and Viacom’s MTV would give Intel critical mass to offer consumers an alternative to established TV services. Using its own set-top box, Intel plans to offer an online service this year, Erik Huggers, vice president of Intel’s digital home group, said last month. That would represent a new challenge to incumbent operators like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and DirecTV. Intel is betting it can create a more flexible service, one that gives consumers more choices over the channels they receive, along with an easier-to-use electronic programming guide, Huggers said. The chipmaker is about to begin financial negotiations with News Corp. (NWSA), owner of the Fox film and TV businesses, two people said. Discussions with Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and CBS Corp. (CBS) are at a more preliminary stage, according to the people.

At the Intel Solutions Summit (ISS) 2013 last week in Los Angeles, the company promised that new Ultrabooks based on the upcoming fourth-generation Core processors, code-named Haswell, will arrive by the holiday season and come with a starting price of $599. Kirk Skaugen, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC Client Group, told an audience of top Intel partners that new Ultrabooks will not only feature lower price points but also more compelling features. Skaugen said early Ultrabooks were "just a retrofit of what was already in the market," but promised new Haswell-based models will require touch-screen support and offer faster solid-state drives, higher-resolution displays, voice recognition and facial recognition technology, and "all-day" battery life. "We designed this chip from the ground up for the Ultrabook," Skaugen said. "You'll truly be able to leave your [Ultrabook] battery pack at home." And while Ultrabooks are getting new features and better performance, the prices are still coming down. Intel originally positioned the ultraslim notebooks as premium mobile computing devices similar to Apple's MacBook Air with an average price point of around a $1,000. In addition, Intel last year unleashed its biggest branding campaign in more than a decade to promote Ultrabooks following the unveiling of several models from Hewlett-Packard , Lenovo, Dell and Samsung at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show.</Msg><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1364262647898</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 21:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364264147266-102</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe our President...</Title><Username>prabbit51</Username><Timestamp>1364231605984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:13:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really doubt that you are any where near an income bracket that has to pay any federal taxes.

While Intel’s Haswell pricing remains unclear, ultra thin notebooks built around Haswell could bring some buzz back to the PC ecosystem in 2H13.” Arya also believed that the Intel’s 22nm quad core Bay Trial chip could enable a wider presence in the Windows 8 and Android tablets in the latter part of 2013, and expected the company’s pricing to be aggressive ($25-$40). The analysts also believed that the Haswell-based ultrabooks would reduce market confusion on Windows 8. Arya recommended a buy rating for the stock of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a price target of $28 per share.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364264382414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 22:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364264876278-105</Id><Topic><Title>If Intel just raises Divvy 7% a year over next 5 years</Title><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1364243091799</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 16:24:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC could be flat to down divvy next 5 years.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1364264876278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 22:27:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364264913139-106</Id><Topic><Title>Google Prepping Intel Corporation (INTC) Haswell-based Chromebooks ...</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1364241043899</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 15:50:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope they core out AAPL.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1364264913139</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 22:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364264999622-107</Id><Topic><Title>Media Attitudes Are Changing</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364226451414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:47:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you drive a car by looking out the rear view mirror?
