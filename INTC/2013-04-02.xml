Global sales from February 2013 were 3.8 percent lower than the January 2013 total of $24.17 billion, reflecting seasonal trends, but year-to-date sales through February 2013 were 2 percent higher than at the same point last year. All monthly sales numbers represent a three-month moving average. “Despite persistent economic uncertainty, the global semiconductor industry is off to a promising start in 2013 – led by strength in memory sales – and is ahead of last year’s pace,” said Brian Toohey, president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association. “To help spur stronger growth, Congress and the Administration should invest in basic research to boost American innovation, reform the high-skilled immigration system to welcome the top scientific minds from around the world, and modify the tax system so businesses can expand, invest and hire new workers.” Regionally, year-over-year sales increased in Asia Pacific (6.7 percent) and the Americas (1.6 percent), but decreased in Europe (-1.5 percent) and Japan (-15.7 percent). Sales increased in Europe (1.4 percent) compared to the previous month, but decreased in Asia Pacific (-3.6 percent), Japan (-5 percent) and the Americas (-6.2 percent).</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364880447785</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 01:27:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364880987478-8</Id><Topic><Title>Keep buying INTC for that 4% dividend</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1364843385322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:09:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like it might do 16</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1364880987478</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 01:36:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364881987282-9</Id><Topic><Title>Keep buying INTC for that 4% dividend</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1364843385322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:09:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are like one of those little dogs the runs out from under the porch and bites people on the ankle.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364881987282</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 01:53:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364882367527-10</Id><Topic><Title>JMP fabricated story</Title><Username>aladeisright</Username><Timestamp>1364864509807</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 21:01:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It said Haswell was delayed.

A little retreat would probably do more good than harm for the long term. The poor internals we had yesterday suggested that stocks could be in for a retreat. The Russell 2000 broke below its trading range started in mid-March. Although the S&amp;P 500 reached a record closing high last Thursday, the KBW bank index as well as the Philly semiconductor index have been in a short tem down trend or going sideways, over in the last two weeks. The two sector indexes also saw some of their technical indicators making lower lows than those during the late February pullback. When indicators start to make lower lows, it suggests that the short term weakness could turn into a longer term correction.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1364901105239</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 07:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364901572987-16</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth Intel Research Report !!</Title><Username>avila.james</Username><Timestamp>1363877870548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:57:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report!</Msg><Username>patriciaalphin</Username><Timestamp>1364901572987</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 07:19:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364902022699-17</Id><Topic><Title>Help Settle A Stock Bet - WHO WON?</Title><Username>jorlev1164</Username><Timestamp>1364754304249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:25:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please answer.</Msg><Username>jorlev1164</Username><Timestamp>1364902022699</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 07:27:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364902628158-18</Id><Topic><Title>JMP fabricated story</Title><Username>aladeisright</Username><Timestamp>1364864509807</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 21:01:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can look at the history of the fails to deliver (naked shorts) and it will probably show a spike.

Benchmark scores of Lenovo K900 with Intel Clover Trail+ have surfaced thanks to hi-tech.mail and it seems Intel has really pulled this one off. Lenovo has shown with the K900 that the company means serious business when it comes to smartphones. Packing a 2GHz Intel Atom Z2580 processor, the K900 additionally comes with a 5.5 inch full HD display. It also features 2GB RAM, a 13 megapixel Sony Exmor BSI sensor and a 2 megapixel shooter at the front. The phone comes in a surprising 6.9mm thick aluminium body which is full 1 mm thinner than the Xperia Z. The phone also houses a massive 3,500 mAh battery. Now, for the benchmarks. You’ll be surprised to know that the little Intel heart inside the phone manages to outperform even the latest Snapdragon 600 processor from Qualcomm. That’s right folks, the K900 is faster than Galaxy S4 (the Snapdragon 600 version) and HTC One. Thanks to the Hyper Threading technology, the has phone four cores beating at 2GHz. The phone managed a score of 25,827 on AnTuTu benchmark, which is a tad more than the Snapdragon version of Galaxy S4. While the phone might not get released in most of the markets, we know now what the Clover Trail+ is capable of. If the chip delivers a solid battery performance as well, we expect multiple handset manufacturers to jump ship to Intel’s processors. techivianDOTcom/398-benchmark-scores-of-lenovo-k900-with-intel-clover-trail-surface-outclass-galaxy-s4/</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1364909481246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:31:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364909871503-31</Id><Title>Cortex-A7 taped out in 16nm FinFet at TSMC</Title><Msg>Your current smartphone just took another spin backwards on the obsolescence cycle thanks to a new landmark from ARM and TSMC: the first Cortex-A57 has reached the "tape out" stage, meaning it's ready for mass production. The new chip will use TSMC's 16nm FinFET technology (though the transistors will be 20nm for the A57) and will bring up to three times the CPU power of current chips for the same battery life -- or a maximum of five times the battery life at the same speed. The companies said they ramped the chip from design to tape out in a mere six months, though there's no timetable for its arrival in specific devices. When it does start hitting next gen phones and slates though, expect the performance charts to get singed.

The sources believe the PC industry will have a chance to see a shipment ratio of 45:55 or even 40:60 for the first and second halves of 2013, respectively, returning the year to the traditional season pattern. Pegatron Technology CEO Jason Cheng also previously noted that the company will have a chance to see shipment growth of 32.55% in the second half, up from the first. The sources expect their shipments to start rising in May and will stay strong for the rest of the third quarter.</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1364918798045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364918996704-76</Id><Topic><Title>INTC lower revenue, lower earnings , lower margins, NOT LOOKING GOOD Down Down Down</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1364909412646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:30:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There will be a lot of interest in Haswell. I am no good at predictions. Much too optimistic. First intros are not fixed to the calendar and are staged. The first SKU for Sandy Bridge was in Feb 2010 and Ivy Bridge in May 2012. Seems like a June 2013 for first Haswell SKUs is about what they have been doing the last couple of intros. I think it will really affect PC demand when Haswell is released. The increased battery life and touch requirement will create a reason to upgrade and many new options. Intel throttles demand with pricing to keep the market from converting immediately. Thus the complaints about Haswell pricing. Ivy Bridge to Haswell is more difficult since the socket is different and their is some new changes in the VTR circuits. It makes the motherboard manufacturer product build more complex. With Ivy Bridge using the Sandy socket, the builders could just install the CPU they wanted at the last second.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364918996704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364919109631-77</Id><Topic><Title>Cortex-A7 taped out in 16nm FinFet at TSMC</Title><Username>tuoithin</Username><Timestamp>1364909871503</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:37:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"yeah, where's that 20nm chip...?

Neither AMD nor Intel are part of the memory cube consortium - they probably try to move it faster Also Intels Enterprise SSD fit right in - maybe they can bundle it. During the final keynote of IDF, Intel's Justin Rattner demonstrated a new stacked DRAM technology called the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). The need is clear: if CPU performance is to continue to scale, there can't be any bottlenecks preventing that scaling from happening. Memory bandwidth has always been a bottleneck we've been worried about as an industry. Ten years ago the worry was that parallel DRAM interfaces wouldn't be able to cut it. Thankfully through tons of innovation we're able to put down 128-bit wide DRAM paths on mainstream motherboards and use some very high speed memories attached to it. What many thought couldn't be done became commonplace and affordable. The question is where do we go from there? DRAM frequencies won't scale forever and continually widening buses isn't exactly feasible. Intel and Micron came up with an idea. Take a DRAM stack and mate it with a logic process (think CPU process, not DRAM fabs) layer for buffering and routing and you can deliver a very high bandwidth, low power DRAM. The buffer layer is actually key here because it helps solve the problem of routing pins to multiple DRAM die. By using a more advanced logic process it's likely that the problem of routing all of that data is made easier. It's this stacked DRAM + logic that's called the Hybrid Memory Cube. The prototype these two companies developed is good for data rates of up to 1 terabit per second of bandwidth. Intel claims that the technology can deliver bandwidth at 7x the power efficiency of the most efficient DDR3 available today. The big concern here is obviously manufacturing and by extension, cost.

The TI chips will be offered as part of Project Moonshot, which is HP's effort to build and deliver low-power servers with either Intel or ARM processors. The first servers are projected to ship commercially in the second quarter, and are currently available only to select customers for testing in HP's labs. HP will use a package of TI chips -- also called a system-on-chip (SOC) -- that includes ARM's quad-core Cortex-A15 processor, the server maker said in a blog entry. The Cortex-A15 processor design is ARM's latest, and was shown in a prototype tablet and smartphone at last week's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. TI's Keystone II chip package will also include cores for network processing and I/O, much like a unified server chip package offered by Calxeda, which uses an ARM processor. HP also is offering the Calxeda chip called EnergyCore as part of Project Moonshot. "Coupling TI's new KeyStone II architecture with HP Moonshot enables large-scale, concurrent real-time processing of cloud and traditional telecommunications workloads by one integrated system optimized for high performance, power-efficient processing," wrote Tim Wesselman, senior director of ecosystem strategy at HP's HyperScale Business Unit, in the blog entry. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are buying thousands of servers to handle Internet transactions, and there is a growing interest in low-power ARM processors for such servers. Some believe ARM processors may be a more power-efficient way to handle large volumes of search and social media requests. Companies like Dell are also experimenting with ARM-based servers, and Advanced Micro Devices has said it will offer them in the future. Servers today are mostly based on x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon or AMD's Opteron, which are considered faster than ARM processors for tasks like databases, but are more power-hungry. As an alternative to Xeon, HP is also building a server based on Intel's low-power Atom chip code-named Centerton as part of Project Moonshot. The announcement also marks the unexpected entry of Texas Instruments in the growing ARM server market. After losing out to rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, TI late last year said it was moving away from the development of low-power chips for smartphones and tablets, and would concentrate on the embedded and microcontroller markets. However, TI's mobile chips are still being used in a few devices like Amazon's latest Kindle Fire tablets. ARM processors today are largely 32-bit, and the company has announced 64-bit processors which will become available in servers starting next year. The 64-bit ARMv8 architecture is being adopted for server chip makers like AppliedMicro, Nvidia, Calxeda, Samsung and AMD.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364938381517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 17:33:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364938647286-155</Id><Title>Lenovo to design own chips</Title><Msg>....

ET QCOM: Competitors Won’t Easily Take LTE Share, Says Raymond James By Tiernan Ray As I mentioned this morning, Raymond James‘s Tavis McCourt today raised his rating on shares of wireless chip maker Qualcomm tod without adjusting estimates, arguing that competition in baseband processors from Intel and Broadcom will slow the company’s growth next year and the year after, “but that Qualcomm will maintain a meaningful advantage on high end smartphones as it moves to 20 nanometer),” referring to the next leg down in chip feature sizes. The spur to competition, as McCourt observes, is the race the move from plain-old 3G and 4G networks to “long-term evolution,” or LTE, which is now in all high-end smartphone releases. McCourt doesn’t think taking material share from Qualcomm will be easy: Qualcomm outspends most of its competitors in mobile R&amp;D by a factor of 5:1 to 10:1 and most are not close to profitability still. To believe Qualcomm loses meaningful revenue share is to believe that Qualcomm is overseeing a misallocation of R&amp;D dollars on an historic scale. In fact, Qualcomm’s R&amp;D expense of ~$5 billion this year is likely greater than all its competitors’ revenues combined in WCDMA/LTE baseband/app processors. As McCourt observes, “QCOM has a 28nm Cat 4 LTE modem on 28nm this year, integrated with a world class App processor/GPU, power management, various connectivity modules, etc… In 2014, we expect QCOM to be at a 20 nm node, and continue to have substantial SoC advantages over its LTE competition.”</Msg><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364945959530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 19:39:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364946319804-166</Id><Title>What a bunch of morons...

Everyone else is reporting the same. The A15s run at a lower frequency than A7s" "The A15 was really designed more as a tablet CPU since tablets have huge batteries and can dissipate the heat A15's put out over a larger surface area, but they can be shoehorned into phones if you keep the clock frequency low." "When first announced, I distinctly remember the A15s running at 1.8Ghz and the A7s running at 1.2Ghz.

Xeon E7 v2 will arrive in Q4 2013, while Xeon E5-2600 v2 will launch a quarter earlier. Xeon E5-2400 v2 on the other hand will follow in Q4 2014. Xeon E7 v2 and "Brickland" platform will be released in Q4 2013. These CPUs will incorporate up to 15 cores and up to 37.5 MB of L3 cache. The CPUs will have Hyper-threading technology enabled, as a result they will be able to execute up to 30 threads at once. The CPUs will also support VT-x, VT-d and VT-c virtualization, Turbo Boost 2.0, Trusted Execution technology, along with Intel Secure Key and OS Guard features. The processors will be coupled with C602J chipset, and will utilize up to four C102/C104 scalable memory buffers per socket. Each scalable memory buffer will support up to 3 DDR3-1600 DIMMS, as such the maximum number of DIMMS per processor is going to be 24. Other communications interfaces on Xeon E7 v2 chips will include 3 QPI links, and up to 32 lanes of PCI Express 3.0.</Msg><Username>warreneast_61</Username><Timestamp>1364953404765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 21:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364955238060-182</Id><Title>TSMC won't have 16nm in full production until 2016 - if everything goes according to plan</Title><Msg>Here are the facts: 1) If you go back and researched old articles, TSMC and Samsung claimed to have 20nm tape out way back in 2011.

Regarding 16nm in 2015 he said "I think it will be very, very small" 3) So, for sure 16nm is *planned* for 2016, but we are talking about transitioning into finFET (3-D), so the timeline can easily slipped. 4) Another thing is designing on finFET is totally different than designing on planar. arm customers have no experience or tools in place to make this transition.

So they must release some pep talk. When Intel came out with Trigate people likeNenni did not like the shape of the fins yadayada - did TSMC show one cross section of their fins and how it compares to Intel? Nope - If it would look good it would be all over the internet TSMC lost ALTR for a reason - the ARM people like 61 don't see it. They are extremely naive. Beside technical difficulties NVDA painted a very bleak picture about wafer price going up ("exponentially") shrinking down from 28nm to 20/14 and it was NVDA that asked for 450 mm wafers (when Intel dares to spend on 450mm "analysts" go ballistic). Some ARM customers that use 28nm might not even be interested in 20 because of cost and diminishing return. The "happy days" of 65nm/40nm manufacturing are over - but it still has not sunk in. The JPM anal mentioned Intel's already difficult roadmap - what does that bonehead of analyst think about the difficulties that TSMC, Samsung and Glofo are facing. The stupidity of WS analyst seems to be unmatched How can the "market" be so dumb not seeing this?</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364956721424</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364956871444-186</Id><Topic><Title>TSMC won't have 16nm in full production until 2016 - if everything goes according to plan</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364955238060</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:13:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey zombie junkie SAMSUNG producing massive NAND flash volume on 20nm SoC..is next</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364956871444</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364959133660-187</Id><Topic><Title>OH NO down INTC goes.

Intel buyers took longer to chew through these blocks. MY THEORY .... which I think is a price action PRESSURE but only an influence. The final hour FADE has turned into a regular "final 10 minute cover". The Intel buy back machine has to stop at 3:50pm ET, 10 minutes before close. I always expect Intel to collapse under the weight of the selling without buy backs. It "appears" that someone seems to know how to take advantage of the buy back machine and then exits at close. Why $21.50? There is a lot of "passive" buying support visible. The share price is playing rope-a-dope with the sellers, buying at a constant rate as they dump and then continuing to buy as they stop selling. A battle between sellers and buyers. IMO, there is (there he goes again) some dividend action underway. It looks like long straddles and strangles to play earnings volatility of 4/16 earnings. They are buying low premium CALL/PUT option pairs or the OMM is preparing for the dividend arbitrage. Lots of $21 PUTS and $22 CALLS (various months). The premium is the maximum at the strike. The maximum premium of the pair is in the CENTER of the two. When INTC drops below $21.50, the option market maker hedges calls. When INTC goes higher toward $22, he hedges the puts. Just my theory but one that explains INTC love with the half dollar pricing.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364961182299</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 23:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364961394887-191</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcom is the problem, not ARM</Title><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1364575475237</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 12:44:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do I have this right that SoC's for smart phones will absolutely have to include the LTE within a couple of years?
