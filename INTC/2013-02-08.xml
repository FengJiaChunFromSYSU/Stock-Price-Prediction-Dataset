But, if they can price a Celeron-based Chromebook in a notebook form factor with keyboard for $199, they should be able to price a Phablet for the same or less due to 2 reasons: 1. less BOM and manufacturing cost (minus-keyboard, clamshell, etc.) 2. lower-priced Medfield processor relative to Celeron (read somewhere that Celeron costs $45) 3. not sure about the variation in display resolutions, but we are talking about a 7" Phablet - so the display may be about the same as a 11" Chromebook Assuming Asus-Intel announce this $199 phablet: 1.

There is (was?) a problem with the x86 implementations. Intel developed the microprocessor lines from the start, when they were too slow and user productivity continued to expand as Intel made the CPU faster and faster. Intel recognized when they reached the point where the CPU was fast enough but the "killer" app was not to be found. They had reached that point several times before but increased memory size and software requirements had pushed that performance level out. Intel pushed in the direction of low power and portability but Apple took a huge leap that Intel could not bring itself to take. The x86 implementation will be dramatically changed with Haswell. Haswell was taped out twice. The second time was to drop the power envelop by 50%. The fruit of that design will be seen in 2013 and beyond. Power reduction circuitry, FMA floating point improvements and especially TSX transaction memory (for threaded code to manage locks). The battery life benchmarks will be the club used to beat the analysts over their heads.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1360334727787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 09:45:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360334975984-11</Id><Title>This board is DEAD! It reflects the current state of Intel as a stock. DEAD MONEY for NOW!</Title><Msg>Cheerleaders come on and then deranged Bashers follow. It is all an endless bore and I would rather watch grass grow then read the nonsense. If you happen to be stopping by to get some insight as to what is going on with Intel, good luck finding anything here. But I will give the short story. Intel had earning drop 4th quarter to 4th quarter from 3 billion net to 2.5 billion net. That is negative growth. The stock has been up to 28 or 29 and dropped back to 20 and now is just above that. In fact, the stock has been dead money in a range from 35 to 18 most of the time for 13 years now. There is NO growth in net income to back up any move up. Current worry? Intel is facing competition from Arm based chips made by qualcomm which go into phones and tablets. These new devices are eating away at sales of PCs and notebooks which in turn eats away at Intel because Intel sells its chips for those devices. There is even worry that Arm based chips could get into Notebooks. Also, Apple is NOT using Intel chips in Ipads or Iphones and likely will NOT! The current CEO, Paul Ottelini, has announced he is threw and will step down soon. Intel has not picked the new CEO yet. So NO ONE knows where Intel is going for sure. The shorts and non-Intel people see all of this and simply say NOOOOO to Intel. Given all of this, it seems like a logical play. Thirteen years of DEAD money and the CEO quit--hardly a Bullish environment is it. But here is the Bull say. Yes all the above is for the most part true. However past is NOT a good move to take on today's Intel. You see, Intel has Huge Fabs (factories) which are state of the art and years ahead of the other chip makers. They are able now to produce Trigate chips in massive and very productive volume. These Trigate chips are years and years ahead of competitors and not easily copied. They are massively produced in these super fabs while allowing Intel chips to move to the top end in both performance and in reducing battery power used. While it is true that Intel's chips are just starting to get into phones and tablets now, it is also inevitable that Intel will use the superior chips to come with the 14 nm and 10 nm trigate chips to dominate tablets and phone in a few years. The fact that the investment community is not buying in yet is simply a reaction to Intel's previous failures and not a reaction to the facts. Intel Net Income will double from here in two years. The stock will more likely be above 60 by then then not. Likely Intel will move Net income North of 6 billion a quarter by the end of 2016. By then, the stock will be over 100 and I will never ever post here because this board will be like the Apple board is now. One post every 5 seconds and no one reading. Just noise. Go ahead and make your bet but remember, there is very little as far as a down side to Intel that has not already been priced in. If Intel were to fail in many many areas, it would still have the best fabs in the world and would likely take contracts from phone makers and tablet makers to produce their arm chips. Intel would grow from here no matter what. However, should Intel be able to mass produce its X86 chips and put them into phones and tablets the upside for Intel is staggering. I am long. I do not blame anyone for not buying it because it is a 50-50 bet but there you are. Good luck.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey7</Username><Timestamp>1360334975984</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 09:49:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360335730422-12</Id><Topic><Title>This board is DEAD!

Within the broader S&amp;P 500, when components were ranked in terms of analyst favorites, INTC claims the #417 spot. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — when companies have a low rank among analysts, it isn’t necessarily the case that investors should conclude that the stock will perform poorly. It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1360336881105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 10:21:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360336902425-21</Id><Title>We bought when we read smithdon post yesterday</Title><Msg>Time to buy INTC going to 24.00 this year.</Msg><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1360336902425</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 10:21:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360337126301-22</Id><Topic><Title>This board is DEAD!

The smartphone is designed for emerging markets with low cost at higher priority than stellar performance, but it did surprisingly well. Perhaps a part of the explanation is that the Intel chip also uses its hyper threading technology, which has better multi-tasking ability. The smartphone is powered by a 1.2 GHz Intel Atom Lexington Z2420 processor along with Power VR SGX540 GPU. The Atom-powered Xolo X500 is right behind the Xolo X900, which is powered by the Medfield chipset in the Quadrant benchmark tests. However the X500 managed to beat its more expensive sibling at the AnTuTu benchmark. The smartphone aggregates 12859 points in the AnTuTu 3.0 benchmark, which is not bad at all Xolo X500 is on top of Vellamo 1.0 browser benchmark tests too and scores a hefty 1168 and 421 points in the HTML5 web browser tests and CPU subsystem performance respectively. The X500 also managed to max out the NenaMark 2 benchmark. At the onscreen GLBenchmark test it only managed 18fps, but it should still do pretty well with all but the heaviest games. cnetDOTcoDOTuk/mobiles/samsung-galaxy-s3-pounds-htc-one-x-into-benchmark-dust-50008054/ Samsung Galaxy S3 pounds HTC One X into benchmark dust By Luke Westaway on 25 May 2012, 12:36pm We've run the Samsung Galaxy S3 through a barrage of benchmark tests, with our results showing that Samsung's latest toy is a proper performance powerhouse that manages to beat the beefy HTC One X(tegra 3).

Get off the plane and go get in line for a taxi to Bangkok Sukhumvit 4 the Nana Hotel. Every taxi KNOWS. Get a room and go out and the party starts. YES---it is low life stuff but it is a start for the likes of you. After you are there for a time, get an apartment and you will have friends and you will never be horney or lonely. Friends--other men to hang out with. You will not spend anytime here anymore nor will you give a rats about the stock market other than to ride the trends. Of course--Eastern Europe is nice to but it is winter. You are lonely and the sperm is built up and wrecking your brain. You need to blow it out. Yes--you will still be a rightwing idiot but after a time, you will not care so much about political nonsense. All your posts--all-are angry.

[Yep, I think ARM has crested the hill and now would be a good time to initiate a put position with the idea of building it up as it becomes obvious that it has peaked and the momentum vultures move in. I think by June 30 the new world order in chips will be clear. FinFET is a disruptive technology. I'm surprised that anyone thought differently just because it's take a while to roll it out. That's just the nature of the industry. You don't build $10 billion fabs over night. FinFET is now here and 14nm FinFET will be here shortly. In spite of the public pronouncements, I think ARM executives are afraid. But what can they do? Absolutely nothing. Intel has put the big huge forces in play that it needs to win. Kudos to them for their vision and guts in doing so.

I had to go make a series of sales presentations and wanted to use one instead of one of the many laptops we have. The first meeting I had there were not one but two people. One sitting across the desk and one next to me. This was a bit hard. The person behind the desk had to come sit next to me. From the distance the screen was a bit small. The next meeting the person sat right across from me, it was actually much better. It was a Powerpoint presentation. I had to limit the number of words and make the font HUGE. Overall it barely worked. It was done on an Android Motorola Xoom tablet. Here's my problem, I don't want to wear glasses on my sales call. I need to wear them but I don't want to wear them. I have a feeling that a lot of other people over age 40 are in the same boat. I didn't want to fire up the laptop and wait for it to power up, or need to find a plug to plug it in. In that respect things were fine. I did have to squint a bit to find my PowerPoint presentation but when it was up and running it was fine. I had some graphs but the text was so small it was almost counter productive. I like the tablet concept for PowerPoint presentations. But on a business sales call there is no doubt it needs to be larger. The screen needs to be at least 15 inches. It's the American way to make things bigger and better. They did it with cars, house, TV sets. I am thinking that tablets are next. I have an old Dell Core Dou laptop and though it fires up quickly with SSD drive installed I may opt for a Windows 8 Ultrabook with touch screen. We borrowed one for a show and fell in love with it. All the tablets in today's era are just too small and I know better things are on the way. We may just need something to carry us over for the next few years. Today everybody has seen a tablet and nobody is impressed that someone uses one. It doesn't show you're hip or with it. It's a tad bit on the annoying side to use it I have a feeling. I would rather start the presentation off by flipping on a laptop and BSing for a few minutes while waiting for it to start up.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1360343007005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:03:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360343225705-44</Id><Topic><Title>Asus-Intel 7" Android Phablet to be announced at MWC - pricing - $199?</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1360328240513</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 07:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>======================== Quote from the article above: The Atom-powered Xolo X500 is right behind the Xolo X900, which is powered by the Medfield chipset in the Quadrant benchmark tests.

Among other things, thIs could be why Intel is investing massive R&amp;D/Capex for building huge capacity... =============== Asus To Launch £60 Intel Powered Android Tablet Asus have always made great tablets but they really rose to prominence when they partnered with Google to produce the Nexus 7. The amazing-value tablet has taken the market by storm and rumours have resurfaced that Asus are working on their own affordable tablet. Back in December we reported that Asus were working on an affordable 7 inch tablet without Google's influence. The new information suggests Asus are working on a new tablet, code-named ME371MG, which will be priced at just $100 (£60). Currently, the only other tablets coming close to that price-point are unbranded Chinese tablets which are notoriously unreliable. Therefore, you might not hold out much hope for Asus's tablet but if these rumours are correct it's looking like an amazing deal ! Asus's affordable tablet is rumoured to have a 7 inch LCD touch-screen running at a resolution of 1280*720 pixels. To put things in perspective that gives it an identical PPI to Google's Nexus 7 which retails at £159. One interesting thing about Asus's new tablet is that it'll come with an Intel Atom processor which is expected to run at clock-speed between 1 and 2 GHz. While, it'll have 1GB of RAM and will come in models with 8, 16 or 32GB of on-board memory with the £60 model presumably having the lowest capacity. Apparently, the tablet will come pre-loaded with Android Jelly Bean and will have both a rear-facing 3 mega-pixel camera and a front-facing 1.2 mega-pixel snapper for video calling. We presume it'll only support WiFi but this is yet to be confirmed. Overall, it's looking like a truly amazing deal but could it be too good to be true ?

Microsoft's Surface Pro looks to be the perfect device for an engineer and mobile tech writer like myself. I like my Microsoft Surface RT device, but after my recent two day trip this week to San Francisco I realized I do need access to a full Windows computer while on the road and am planning to swing by Best Buy tomorrow morning to pick up the Surface Pro. I wrote about how I liked Surface RT because it wasn't my work computer, but now realize at times I do need something portable that is just as capable as my work computer. I needed to get something knocked out during my trip this week and couldn't do it on the Surface RT, or an iPad, and told myself I cannot travel again and be limited in my ability to work. I read Ed's review and am convinced the Microsoft Surface Pro is perfect for the way I work and play.

My office issues laptops to senior people on a four year rotation and for the most part they are utilitarian Dell laptops. There is nothing fancy about them, but they get the job done and work just fine. To be honest, I use mine 75% of the time in the docking station at work. After a year or two the battery life drops to just a couple hours, but most of the time I have the ability to plug it into an outlet where I am working. I could carry this computer around when I travel, but it's bulky, runs Windows 7, and is not a "fun" computer. If I am traveling for events to write about for ZDNet or for pleaure, I don't want to haul my big work-issued laptop around and want something else. An Apple computer is not an option for my work as a professional engineer, but I do use one at home for writing and other tasks. I could pick up a MacBook Air for around the same price as a Surface Pro, but then I have to get Windows on it and for the portable computer I am looking for there is no need to have Mac OS on it. If I just needed a computer for writing, then I would pick up an inexpensive Chromebook, but I need more than that to run my ship stability software and other engineering applications. I already sold my Surface RT via Twitter and will be keeping my blue Touch Cover keyboard. My wife is using my old original MacBook Pro, 2006 vintage, so I plan to pass along my 2009 MBP to her as well and use the Surface Pro as my primary home computer with an external monitor. I mentioned that I want a fun computer and I think the Surface Pro will fill that role as I found the Surface RT to be an enjoyable experience with Windows 8, interactive touch screen, slick kickstand, functional keyboard cover, and ultra-portable design. There are a number of Windows 8 laptop and tablet options, but I haven't seen any that are as light, well designed, and compelling to me as the Surface Pro. I want a super portable computer that is well designed and does not limit me from doing what I need to do when the occasion arises and I believe the Microsoft Surface Pro is that computer.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360350931387</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:15:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360350981027-69</Id><Topic><Title>Goodbye Surface RT, hello Surface Pro: I won't miss getting work done again</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360350786964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:13:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the author: "I already sold my Surface RT via Twitter..."

They can afford to undercut in price because fabs that were used to produce CPUs for PCs would have had to be upgraded previously, but now can be 're-used' to create SoCs for phones and tablets. So in essence, phones and tablets will be manufactured at just labor and material cost only. Revenues from phones and tablets are like icing on the cake for Intel since these are brand new markets for Intel and can be manufactured at labor and material costs. This is why Intel is not worried about extra capacity issues..they plan to leverage their fab for producing SoCs. Next year they will be using 22nm (trigate) for the SoCs for phones and tablets, which will be state-of-the-art process compare to competitors.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1360380375637</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 22:26:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360380740013-98</Id><Title>Asus Fonepad could be 7" phone (tablet second)</Title><Msg>In Asia, people are more "thrifty" so they want to buy just one device rather than a phone and a tablet.

Phones are getting bigger and you saw the 'phablet' which is a phone tablet sort of form factor emerged which are 6 even 7-inch phones, and then of course the shift of tablets from 10 to 7-inches. And I think that's probably what we're going to see, is the market will bifurcate between sort of a 5-inch to 7-inch type of products and the 10-plus inch type of products.

"] Global Foundries laid out their roadmap for the next few years at Common Platform, and this time it went to the 10nm node. Lets take a look at it in greater detail, there are a few non-obvious points to talk about. In their morning Common Platform (CP) keynote, Global Foundries Mike Noonen, Executive VP, Global Sales, Marketing, Quality, and Design did something unusual, he admitted the company botched something. More interestingly, he did it publicly and directly when they said their 32nm HKMG process was not exactly what anyone wanted it to be when it was released. This basically says that they have fixed the internal processes that lead to the little ‘whoopsie’ with Llano and are confident that those dark days are behind them. We shall see, but we hope they are right, the foundry business needs more competition. The roadmap laid out in the keynote out had a few new additions since last year, mainly the 20LPM, 14XM, and 10XM processes. Of these, two are what they sound like, one is not. In case you are wondering, XM stands for Extreme Mobility, XM just sounds better to the ‘Mountain Dew’ generation than EM which is probably why it was chosen. The roadmap in coarse detail All of the 32nm, 28nm, and 20nm processes have been announced previously, although a few suffixes have been added. The 20nm process is about what you expected, the next step in planar transistors shrunk to 20nm. There are no FinFETs like Intel is using at 22nm, but GloFo and the CP partners are moving to gate last this time around. This entire process is pretty evolutionary. That changes quite a bit on the 14XM process, it is most definitely not evolutionary on the transistor front but the rest is. Because of the way the last one was announced, we didn’t bother to write it up at the time but it is worth looking at. Unlike what the name implies, 14XM is not really a full shrink of the 20LPM node to 14nm, it is only half way there. 14XM uses the middle and back end of line (MEOL and BEOL) from the 20nm node couples to the new 14nm FinFETs. Global Foundries says this effective reuse of the entirety of the non-transistor bits of 20LPM will pull in 14XM, lower cost presumably through the reuse of existing equipment, and lower customer design costs because most of the software for 20nm just carries over. While we have no doubt this is true, it seems like a bit of cheating to do it this way. Since we are not nearly versed enough in the minutia of these 20nm and 14nm processes to say what the exact technical trade-offs are, we will wait until more information comes out to say for sure. Depending on your views about what GloFo and the CP partners are doing, you could consider 14Xm to be a full shrink of 20LPM or a minor technical half-step. Whatever you classify 14XM to be, the 10XM process is really a full shrink. Starting with test runs in late 2015, 10XM will be a second generation FinFET process with a true 10nm MEOL and BEOL. All that 10XM carries over from 14XM is the number 1 and the letters XM. Overall, GloFo did a good job in their keynote. They essentially came clean on the early 32/28nm problems that were nagging their reputation and laid out a clear path forward. The pulling in of 14nm may leave some people nervous, but given how much of the process is carried over from 20nm, as long as 20nm is OK, 14′s pull in should not be a big worry. The only problem we have with the roadmap as it stands is that 14XM really seems like a cheat, and that image is unlikely to be shaken until the chips that use it come out. At that time, the results will speak for themselves, until then, whispers will rule.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360382532331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 23:02:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360382637792-102</Id><Title>Market moving towards 5"-7" Phones and 10"-14" PC HYBRIDs</Title><Msg>Tablets as a standalone form factor will be going away.

Over that same tenures the first correlation of our business is GDP growth. Then beyond that, it's the kinds of things that Paul has been talking about. You have Haswell coming into the marketplace, Windows 8 gaining traction, touch gaining traction. So you have these great devises that are coming in that re convertibles and kind of the best of the PC and the tablet experience.

And now based on having fixed everything they will jump directly to 14nm production. Really? Hmmmm. Thinking. Thinking. Well, shouldn't that fixing have resulted in volume production at 28nm? It hasn't. And don't they have to do 20nm planar before doing 14nm anything since they are copying most of it in order to think that 14nm might actually work? They haven't. So, if you are willing to accept not one but three leaps of faith, then you might conclude that GloFo will have the half-step to 14nm in the next couple of years.Based on their track record I'm not willing to accept any leaps of faith. I'm gonna be from Missouri on all three suppositions. Show me. In general we are being told that the ARM foundries are going to develop 20nm planar and the half-step to 14nm at the same time. Except the 14nm has to be based on successful completion of the 20nm node jump since it will use the middle and back end of line (MEOL and BEOL) from the 20nm node. So, um - exactly how do you develop these at the same time? Does this make sense to anyone because it really sounds like they are making this up as they go along. Given the amount of smoke the ARM foundries are blowing, I'm surprised the whole world doesn't look like Beijing. The ARM Bubble has begun its descent into the land of sharp objects. Even the 14nm half-step looks like a very sharp object.

XM makes sense as its an incremental step and it gets them in the temporal ballpark of Intel's accelerated 14nm LP rollout at the end of 2014. At the end of the day, what matters is how much power the transistors are drawing and what speed you can switch them at. If they can get half-way in bridging the performance gap between 20 nm planar and 14nm FinFET, that should be good enough to make them competitive. It's a half step in the right direction and a good parry to Intel's acceleration. If they can pull this off which seems likely, they'll be competitive. The big advantage of the foundries is they don't need the huge margins on processor ASPs that Intel needs to maintain status quo.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1360384315072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 23:31:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360384624049-107</Id><Title>Intel Up 19 Cents, ARM Down 48 Cents</Title><Msg>And so it begins...
