While its technology prowess is undeniable having led the semiconductor revolution for the last 40 odd years, its ability to influence the market of late has become very questionable. It's bread and butter PC market is slowing down and it's made a series of announcements for mobile and server targeted chips which have made no impact on the market or on market sentiment. Both mobile and servers are growth markets. Given this recent history of getting up on the grandstand, making big announcements and no-one taking interest, it's unlikely the stock price is going to move in the absence of events that are at least slightly game changing. It's your call as to which of the planned chip releases in server or mobile markets are really going to make an impact. If there's no market impact going forward, this stock is going to erode in value slowly IMHO.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1362297542195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 02:59:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362310155072-6</Id><Topic><Title>So what are the odds?</Title><Username>emfetch267</Username><Timestamp>1362297091956</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 02:51:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very high odds. buy the stock instead and get paid while you wait.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1362310155072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 06:29:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362313503033-7</Id><Topic><Title>Where is TSMC and its 20nm PR.

Firms that are candidates to be an Intel customer will want to compare Intel's deal to the rest. At minimum Intel will learn a great detail about the potential client's products yielding good competitive intelligence and at best they can cherry pick some good customers. Of course some of TSMC's customers will use Intel to hammer TSMC on price so Intel's foundry business brings new pressure that didn't exist before.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1362320643764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 09:24:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362322598928-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's (INTC) Foundry Gains are a Negative for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) - Analyst</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362280917161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 22:21:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You support foreign companies over American companies,real good.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1362322598928</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 09:56:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362323648633-10</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's (INTC) Foundry Gains are a Negative for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) - Analyst</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362280917161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 22:21:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Growth is in mobile targeted chips specially at the cutting edge.

It has only given out about a dozen in its 22 year history. The architecture licenses were for ARM's new 64bit v8 processors which are principally aimed at servers. ARM said the architecture licenses were intended for "use in multiple end markets including supercomputing, mobile and enterprise." EW asked ARM CEO Warren East who the licensees were but he wasn't going to say. Asked if they were for chip design companies or for people who own a lot of servers, he declined to be drawn. A recent event for ARM was being included in Facebook's Open Compute Project which specifies interchangeable x86 and ARM processors for its server farms. Is it a new thing for ARM to work with its customers' customers? "It's always been the case that we work with the thought leaders in a particular space," replies East, "we have had a direct relationship with Nokia since the 1990s. It's part of the intelligence gathering process. We try to work with the thought leaders." ARM's penetration into servers has been a long time coming. "Expect to see some server revenues in 2014. That has been the same for the last five years," says East, "five years ago I said we'd have our first server revenues in 2014." Asked if there was any significant metric he could point to which showed ARM did a superior job to x86 in the server space, East replies: "Some of the results from the HP Moonshot project compared ARM with existing solutions which ran on x86, and looked at the cost of ownership, and they were fairly stunning results which were better than the theory." ARM's pervasiveness rolls on. Sales of ARM processor into consumer products including digital TVs and STBs doubled in 2012 and sales of ARM-based microcontrollers went up 25%. Progress into laptops was not much helped by Microsoft's Surface which runs Windows on ARM, but East points out that Surface was only the beginning of　 Windows running on ARM - and it was a very restricted beginning with very few companies engaged in the process. Whether finfet or FD-SOI makes the running at 20nm is not a critical factor for ARM whose designs can be made on either process. "FD-SOI looks very good to us," says East, "the libraries are the same as for bulk. That's one of the good things about it. It’s a much easier process than making fins."</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1362351233578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:53:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362351348146-43</Id><Topic><Title>ITS A FACT ARMH BASED Soc DOMINATE PLANET EARTH IN TABLETS AND SMART PHONES AND INTEL IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND YET</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1362351137500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:52:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Qualcomm joins ARM-based server race Chip giant advertising for engineers to work on system-on-chip for low power server space, challenging Intel The ARM processor architecture is looking well beyond its mobile device heartland and eyeing a whole range of products from embedded gadgets to servers. Several chip providers are chasing the emerging market for low power blade servers for the cloud, an area where ARM thinks its licensees can displace the incumbent Intel. Qualcomm has joined Marvell, pioneering start-up Calxeda and others in planning a system-on-chip for servers and is advertising posts for specialists for this project. According to EETimes, Qualcomm's job advertisements, for at least three software engineers, reveal its server ambitions. They say the engineers will work on "architecture/design and system prototypes of Qualcomm's new ARMv8-based server SoC ASICs for the power optimized server market. The ads also say: "Primary responsibilities include specification, development, porting, integration and shake-out of server platform management software and firmware on prototypes utilizing Qualcomm's new SoC." The nascent ARM-based server movement is expected to get a major boost from the ARMv8 architecture, the first generation to support 64-bit instruction sets and so level with Intel's x86 in the high end segment. A rush of commercial products is expected in 2014 once v8 has been fully commercialized. However, some early movers like Calxeda and Marvell are already shipping 32-bit server SoCs, though these are mainly to steal a march on rivals and attract customer interest, rather than mass sales. Cloud giants like Microsoft are already testing prototype ARM-based platforms (Microsoft has carried out projects with Calxeda) and Dell, HP and Mitac have all worked on 32-bit prototype platforms. Among the other chip firms known to be working on ARM server SoCs are AMD, Applied Micro, Cavium, Nvidia and Samsung, and Huawei advertised for ARM server engineers last year too, though these may be for boxes rather than silicon. Texas Instruments has also announced server SoCs, but is targeting them mainly at specialized companion servers or embedded platforms rather than taking on Intel in the data center. The companies known to be preparing ARM server chips generally aim to start shipping 64-bit SoCs in 2014. Calxeda and Marvell are shipping 32-bit SoCs for servers today with limited traction, mainly in prototyping systems for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Taiwan's Mitac. A server move by Qualcomm would be another step away from the firm's previous strategy of sticking to mobile devices - just a few years ago, it said it wanted to concentrate on what it did well, but with its core smartphone sector facing price competition and eventual stagnation, it must seek new bases just as the ARM platform is - in tablets, 'post-PC' products, the internet of things, home networking, and in future servers and wireless infrastructure, especially small cells.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1362351348146</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:55:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362351589389-44</Id><Topic><Title>ITS A FACT ARMH BASED Soc DOMINATE PLANET EARTH IN TABLETS AND SMART PHONES AND INTEL IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND YET</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1362351137500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:52:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The acronym “SoC” generally refers to “System on a Chip”. But with SoCs entering the server space, it is also taking on a new meaning: “Server on a Chip”. An SoC is a large scale integration of processor cores, memory controllers, on-chip and off-chip memories, peripheral controllers, accelerators, and custom IP (intellectual property) for specific applications and uses. As Moore’s law continues, chip process geometries shrink, allowing more transistors to reside on the same area of silicon. Traditionally, server processors have used this new real estate to add more cores. But there are better alternatives than just adding more cores for certain applications. Increasing integration in an SoC brings a number of benefits including: Higher performance – significantly faster and wider internal busses compared to those found in a multi-chip or multi-board solution. Lower power – wider range of power optimization techniques can be employed in SoCs including power gating, changing bus speeds depending upon utilization, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling of processor cores and peripherals, multiple power domains, and a number of others. Additionally, having peripherals on chip avoids power hungry PHYs (analog drivers that need to drive signals between chips and boards). Higher density – fewer components to buy, consume power, and fail. Deeper integration of peripheral controllers and fabric interconnect technologies allow a number of advantages that cannot normally be achieved by having to go through standard bridges like PCIe. Let’s stop and consider the components we typically will find in a standard rack-optimized volume server: One or two processor chips, often with integrated memory controllers. One or two chips for processor chipsets providing a range of functions like Southbridge peripherals and PCIe. A PCIe connected Ethernet NIC, either chip or PCIe board. In today’s volume servers, this is typically one or two 1 Gb Ethernet interfaces. A PCIe connected SATA controller, either chip or PCIe board. Controller chip for an SD card and/or USB. An extra cost, optional BMC (baseboard management controller) providing out of band system management control. So, now with the availability of a purpose-built ARM® server SoC, how does this change? Everything in the laundry list above gets integrated onto a single, low power die. For example, let’s take a look at the Calxeda EnergyCore ECX-1000 series of SoCs. In each chip, we find: A quad-core Cortex A9 CPU, configured for server workloads. The largest L2 cache that you’ll find on an ARM server: 4 MB with ECC. A server class memory subsystem including a wide, high-performance 72-bit DDR3/3L memory controller, also including ECC. Integrated peripheral controllers that have direct DMA interfaces to the internal SoC busses without the PCIe overhead. Standard server peripheral controllers like multiple-lanes of SATA, multiple Ethernet controllers (both 1 Gb and 10 Gb), even an SD/eMMC controller for local boot or scratchpad storage, are all integrated on-chip. If your server needs to connect to devices that are not integrated, there are four dual-mode PCIe controllers, supporting both root-complex and target modes, in both x4 and x8 configurations. Instead of an optional (and expensive) BMC, management is built onto every chip, providing a sophisticated server management system that provides both in-band and out-of-band IPMI/DCMI system management interfaces along with dynamic power and fabric management. A deeply integrated, power and performance-optimized fabric interconnect, which we’ll talk about in a future blog entry. And all of this is designed with performance, power, and cost optimized servers in mind, delivering the industry leading performance/Watt and performance/Watt/$ servers.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1362351589389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:59:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362351698665-45</Id><Title>Asus Zenbook Prime first Impressions</Title><Msg>Impressive.

But someone (wbmw) on that thread argued that you can't just flip a switch and compete with Intel... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Easier said than done. It takes many years for a new CPU team to hone their skills to the point of delivering consistent excellence. Apple was fortunate that they found an excellent design team already intact. The only thing Samsung has shown is that they can put all of the best building blocks from ARM and other IP vendors together in an SOC - but then again, smaller Chinese companies have also proven they can do that. Before Samsung can turn their investments into leadership products, they would need years of hardware and software expertise to hone their skills, and optimize their manufacturing. I think by then, Intel will have already turned the ship. Maybe Samsung will be Intel's #1 competitor in the next decade, but I think for this decade they will be more of a friend than a competitor. Intel still needs them as a laptop and mobile device partner, as well as a vendor for display and memory." ---------------------------------------------- realistically, do you think can Samsung catch up to INTC within a decade?</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1362361365240</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 20:42:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362361768930-51</Id><Topic><Title>Fan of Mr. Eassa</Title><Username>feldman.stan</Username><Timestamp>1362328897447</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 11:41:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>galba_imperator, I don't really see it happening if the new management team stays the course and keeps aggressively pushing process technology + architecture. To do so, Intel will need to grow chip volumes/revenues significantly to cover the ever increasing costs of capex. Now, I certainly think Intel's expansion into new, adjacent markets will help, but the real reason I'm excited by the foundry deals is that they will essentially fund future capex/R&amp;D on the process side. Intel is ahead and extending its lead, but Intel investors need to keep a very, VERY close eye on what Samsung does.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1362361768930</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 20:49:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362362403241-52</Id><Topic><Title>Flumoxed' aliases</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1352671230820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:00:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Changes his mind more than a hot mess.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1362362403241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 21:00:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362362578556-53</Id><Title>Galba Imperator Aliases</Title><Msg>Flumoxed anything amdmonkey anything amdroadkill hothectors (flaming Liberal peter pumper) miltonusa, on and on and on.

[Realistically they don't have a decade. They have until June. In other words none of the ARM foundries is going to be catching up to Intel. Intel is in the process of widening its fabrication and manufacturing lead. All of the ARM foundries are 3 years and $30 billion too late to change what is going to happen now. It's called FinFET. Intel has it, ARM doesn't. End of story. I don't understand why this is so difficult for investors to get their heads around. Did they really think that FinFET wasn't going to change everything? It's taken a while to put in place but now it's arriving - each step forward now is a step that ARM can't match....]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362365318976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 21:48:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362365531305-56</Id><Topic><Title>Altera foundry question</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1362364442779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 21:34:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Altera is already invested in TSMC 20nm... the lead time Altera would need to be able to port their technology to INtel fabs... would be out about the same time for 14nm as 22nm...

This indicated that the market advance was getting narrower with gains limited in a few large cap stocks. Without the small and mid cap stocks getting their upside momentum back, it will be difficult for the S&amp;P 500 to break out to new highs. Expect the roller coaster ride to continue in the near term with stocks stuck in a narrow range. For the S&amp;P 500, watch for resistance near 1525 with support at 1500, followed by its 50-day moving average near 1485.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1362366040973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 22:00:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362366087752-60</Id><Title>Until Samsung Has FinFET, Samsung Doesn't Have Butkus</Title><Msg>If TSMC is to be believed (some doubt there), Samsung isn't even geared up on 28nm, much less 20nm, much less 14nm FinFET.

I just got a note from the rest of the guys in your paid shill pool. They say that you are embarrassing them....] [If FinFET is a small side-step, then pray tell us from the two periodicals you say you read what the large steps are in fabrication that the ARM world will take.] [And then tell us how those steps will enable ARM to overcome the following factors: 1.) Fewer ARM fabless start-ups, Even fewer rising stars, Dropping number of foundries, deals and investments. 2.) The number of designs that the ARM foundries can support at each node is dropping. At 65nm it was 65 to 80, at 28nm, it was 20 to 30, at 20nm, it will be 12-16 and at 14nm it will be 5 to 8. 3.) The time to ramp on each new ARM node is getting longer. 4.) The complexity of each node is increasing dramatically. 5.) The costs of each new node are getting higher while the benefits are getting smaller. 6.) Foundries are forced into a bad economics move to 20nm planar which is costly at minimal benefit. 7.) Foundries are forced into attempting a half-step to 14/16nm even though they haven't yet successfully assimilated 20nm upon which the move is based. 8.) Fabless companies have to accept a slow ramp-up of wafer volumes because of the IP qualification and parametric yield challenges. 9.) ARM Design teams will need to be manufacturing-aware and have in depth understanding of the process variables that have to be included as part of design disciplines.. 10.) Fabless companies cannot assume that their designs will give high yields based on their legacy interfaces that are in place with foundries.]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1362372498214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 23:48:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
