ARM don't so they aren't spending their transistor budget on legacy instructions to maintain binary compatibility with Intel. Currently, ARM's CPU's are much smaller than the equivalent x86 core and thus have a die size advantage. Clearly this will change going forward, especially as GPU's are becoming the largest item on a SoC . I am not too sure what features you think the ARM ISA is lacking? The CISC/RISC argument:) RISC actually won in terms of design, as all Intel's Core processors are really RISC with a CISC decoder sitting on top. Regardless, over the years the RISC/CISC ISA's have moved closer together so is a mute point.

With Windows 8, the line between tablet and laptop/desktop completely blurs since the OS fully supports both platforms. Secondly, as you can see, Intel is bringing down the power consumption of its elite core series chips down to tablet levels. What we are going to see is desktop and laptops being replaced by a slew of touch enabled form factors all combining the features of laptops with tablets with touch. From the consumer's perspective, they are buying devices that have all the power and functionality of a desktop/laptop with the added convenience of a tablet. Its a win-win for the consumer and Intel. Since we're starting from the laptop/desktop end, you can expect them to pay the same price that they were used to before. Since we're also supporting the tablet form factor with a hybrid design, the total size of the market grows to include the tablet market.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1356789149555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:52:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356790257979-14</Id><Title>HAYYYYY GETANID61...read yahoo news about ARM's worthless Datacenter Quest</Title><Msg>Challenges and uncertainty Between exploiting a massive number of low-power processors, sustaining performance, and programming every aspect of the initiative, it's safe to say the challenges are plentiful for ARM to transition into the server space by 2014. But the greatest challenge of them all is Intel. By the time ARM is ready for prime time, Intel's Atom chip will be fabricated on 14-nanometer transistors, essentially closing the power gap between itself and ARM's latest and greatest. At that time, ARM chips are expected to be fabricated on a larger, less power efficient 20-nanometer node. If low-power server clusters become the de facto standard for cloud-based data centers, Intel has a huge lead on ARM, as nearly everything in the data center has been developed in favor of Intel's architecture – which commands a 90% market share in the server market. When you also consider Intel's fabrication process will be a solid generation ahead of ARM's fabrication partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, there won't be much reason left to convince businesses to deploy ARM server farms. Despite the efforts being made, the practicality of implementing ARM-based architecture in the data center doesn't appear to be all that practical</Msg><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1356790257979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356790614655-15</Id><Topic><Title>cliff deal within reach per google news</Title><Username>aintezbeingreen</Username><Timestamp>1356751960537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 22:32:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope so but not holding my breath, too many politicians would rather finger point than fix this!</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1356790614655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356791603178-16</Id><Topic><Title>HAYYYYY GETANID61...read yahoo news about ARM's worthless Datacenter Quest</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1356790257979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>10 years ago they said that about phones and tablets and other devices....and yet the ARMHY kicked butt.</Msg><Username>luvinitallwu</Username><Timestamp>1356791603178</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:33:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356792818164-17</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1: Amazon Price and Release Date Details</Title><Username>tiderunner3</Username><Timestamp>1304772583000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-05-07 08:49:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the site</Msg><Username>jennifermac49</Username><Timestamp>1356792818164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:53:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356793358524-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hurry Time Is Ticking`</Title><Username>ashlanutb303</Username><Timestamp>1343314271000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:51:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clear videos</Msg><Username>jennifermac49</Username><Timestamp>1356793358524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 10:02:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356796846545-19</Id><Topic><Title>KHITCHDEE exposed/undressed - plays both sides on the Intel board</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1356789149555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:52:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, I have nothing to do with that user except for occasionally correcting it when the errors are too glaring although often there are so many I can't be bothered.

There were always wars be for Marx and America has been in more wars than has any nation on earth over the past 150 years. Did America need communism to have its bloodiest war, The Civil war? NO I disagree with your defense of the terrible use of war by American presidents. We did not need to attack Iraq. We did not need to spend More than 6 months in Afghanistan. We should have never sent troops into Vietnam. By the way, all three of these wars will end up the same--America leaves and the nation goes back to where it was before we ever went in. Oh yeah--two attacks against Iraq. Then we bombed Serbia. Korean war remember? Pretty much America has been in a constant state of war since 1860. Then we wonder why it is we have so much violence at home. The money we throw away on wars could have made America an economic super power 50 years ahead of other nations.

Rather than roll out nationwide, the launch will happen on a city-by-city basis so Intel has more flexibility in negotiating licensing with reluctant content providers, according to a video industry source. The Intel box may also eliminate a core frustration with DVRs… A source in the video distribution industry directly familiar with Intel’s plans and content dealings tells TechCrunch the semiconductor company is dead serious about getting its chips into the living room. After its effort to convince smart TV manufacturers to use its chips in the initial launch of Google TV failed a few years ago, it’s decided to go it alone. The source said that Intel was frustrated with “everyone doing a half-assed Google TV so it’s going to do it themselves and do it right.” The plan is to a create a set-top box and subscription TV service that would appeal to people who want streaming TV access but don’t want to entirely cut the cable cord and lose key content like sports. The service would pipe in both traditional channels and streaming content such as Redbox’s streaming service. Intel Chip ExampleThe Wall Street Journal reported Intel’s intent to create a pay-TV service in March, and Reuters followed up in June that Intel’s box may use facial recognition to power dynamic insertion of ads, improved targeting, and performance measurement. Both noted that the stumbling block to a planned launch by the end of 2012 was an unwillingness on the part of media content providers to unbundle channels or programs and license them to Intel. The city-by-city rollout addresses this issue, as content providers may be more willing to experiment with licensing in select markets first where they have looser deals with traditional cable providers. The plan also lets Intel work around holdouts in key markets rather than having to delay a launch entirely. Intel licensed Comcast’s Reference Design Kit in October to aid development of its TV services, so it might look to lean on that relationship and operate in Comcast markets. With the strategy in place, our source says the roll out will begin “soon” but couldn’t be more specific. Perhaps Intel will reveal more details at CES next week. One feature we heard about could be a real game changer for the digital video recorder experience. Supposedly Intel’s technology could allow people to recall and watch any programming aired in the last month on the channels they subscribe to. That means no worrying about scheduling what to record. You could pull up a new show from last night that friends raved about, a sports game you forgot about, or all the recent reruns of a favorite cartoon. We aren’t positive this is feasible but if it is, it could convince people to ditch their current set top box for one with Intel inside and out. ------------- from techcrunch</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356817584181</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 16:46:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356818977528-41</Id><Title>NO Earnings Warning This Quarter.......YIPPEEE!!!!</Title><Msg>There's one business day left in the quarter and Intel didn't warn, in fact compared to last quarter there are far fewer earnings warnings.

[Note the combination of "lackluster demand for 20nm planar" and "GIANT leap" to FinFET. The interesting thing here is that there is no solution to ARMs problem. If they go with planar 20nm, then they have a lousy product with an expensive cost at a very critical time. Critical time in everyone in the ARM camp considering whether to jump to Intel's superior technology and manufacturing.

The processor was lacking when compared to the competition, however, and a leaked roadmap image appeared soon after showing the processor’s successor: the dual-core Merrifield. Now a benchmark has surfaced of Intel’s “Redhookbay,” which shows it equipped with the new processor. Redhookbay is shown as running Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, with a 1280 x 720 resolution display and the multi-core Merrifield, which scored 31,612 on AnTuTu benchmark. The processor is between 1.6GHz and 2GHz. The reported GPU is a PowerVR SGX 544MP. Unlike the Medfield, Merrifield offers 4G LTE support. This coincides with a piece over at Digitimes claiming that Intel will announce a smartphone platform and Atom processors at the 2013 Mobile World Congress, which is taking place in Spain in February. The sources in the article state what we already know: that Intel’s Medfield tanked because it was under-powered compared to its competition. According to the unnamed source, Intel probably won’t release its own branded smartphones “because it does not have close relationships with mobile telecom carriers.” It is possible we’ll see Intel pair up with telecoms in India and China and other similar markets, however, to release enter-level handsets. Still, the company faces pretty stiff competition.</Msg><Username>jakk_wagon</Username><Timestamp>1356831548128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:39:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356832056191-61</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Redhookbay benchmarks surface, show dual-core Merrifield processor</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356831238568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:33:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow...scored 31,612 on AnTuTu benchmark......Samsung Galaxy S3 scored 11878 ...oh boy this is like a heavyweight vs lightweight..no contest!</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356832056191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:47:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356832163097-62</Id><Title>New Medfield scored 31,612 on AnTuTu benchmark vs. Samsung Galaxy S3 11878</Title><Msg>read it and weep arm-fannies!!!</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356832163097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:49:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356832176020-63</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Redhookbay benchmarks surface, show dual-core Merrifield processor</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1356831238568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:33:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is unlikely to be Merrifield.

But starting at 90nm, a number of physics-based problems started to overwhelm the effectiveness of this traditional transistor architecture. Some of these shrinkage-related problems have found a technology fix—like an effective technique to reduce gate oxide leakage by using high-k metal gate (HKMG) technology [invented by Intel]. Nevertheless, several intractable problems remain unresolved and make it difficult to effectively shrink planar transistors much below 25nm. Above from white paper by Synopsys [In other words, 20nm planar will be no slam-dunk for ARM and therefore there is no good way of projecting when volume production might be achieved.

But from the system designer’s perspective—using the SoC, not creating it—everything reduces to five key points: cost, density, speed, power, and 2.5D. System designers’ experiences will largely be determined by how chip designers manage the interplay of these five factors. Cost is paramount. NVIDIA’s Huang may well have been right: with its greatly increased costs, 20 nm may always be more expensive than 28 nm for the same number of transistors. For SoCs with significant amounts of non-scaling circuitry, such as RF or other analog transistors, monolithic passive components, or electrostatic discharge protection structures, the gap will be larger than for dense logic-only SoCs. Quite simply, for an SoC to migrate to 20 nm, there will have to be some benefit—integration, performance, energy efficiency, or IP access—not available at 28 nm. Otherwise there will be no way to justify the added cost."

Making the wrong technology decisions at 20nm can cost wafer manufacturers and fabless companies billions of dollars.The decision processes for the high-volume applications should be cost-driven, and it is important to use cost data that provides an accurate perspective on the real situation that is occurring at 28nm and what is expected to occur at 20nm.

By Sy Harding, Street Smart Report My top stock pick for 2013 is Intel Corp. (INTC -1.37%), the largest micro-chip maker in the world, designing, developing and manufacturing microprocessors for the global market. Intel is the dominant force in the computer processor arena, having long-held the lead in new technology and chip performance. The stock sold off sharply (declining 33% from its April high to a low in late November) in reaction to the company lowering guidance for the second half of 2012 on slowing global economies. We believe the sell-off was overdone. Smaller rival AMD very occasionally emerges as a potential threat only to see Intel leapfrog ahead again. And Intel was faulted for being slow to recognize the demand for smaller chips used in smartphones and tablets, an area currently dominated by ARM Holdings. But Intel is moving more aggressively into that area with its ‘Atom’ chips, and acquired Infineon’s wireless connectivity chip business in 2011 to support that undertaking. Intel has a strong balance sheet and cash flow that allows it to maintain an immense budget for R&amp;D and the capital expenditures necessary to sustain its industry-leading manufacturing technologies, and a history of introducing new processor architectures every two years. The company is in solid financial shape. At the current price the shares are selling at less than 10 times estimated 2013 earnings, and pay an annual dividend of 4.2%. In our view, the stock is very oversold, and the stock will rebound nicely in 2013. Our upside target is $27. We suggest a ‘mental’ protective stop at $17.20. from msn</Msg><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1356842830956</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 23:47:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356843325736-79</Id><Topic><Title>"NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang publicly questioned the economic viability of the whole 20 nm node..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356832646752</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:57:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Money can't buy you love...
