He used tax treatments only available to the super-rich. This is exactly my point. Romney gets tax deductions for his watermelon-eating horse that he flies to competitions. And deductions for off-shore fantasy fiction tax treatments. And who takes up the slack for the missing United States revenue. The middle class. And you geniuses on this board say "Yeah, that's how we get economic prosperity!" That's not how you get economic prosperity - that's how you shaft the working class. That's how you manipulate the tax code to transfer wealth into your pockets without working. Anyone who looks the other way for this type of "intelligent" theft is morally bankrupt. Because this is the only way you can pay a mere 13 percent in taxes when you are filthy rich. You want me to vote for a guy who hires tax attorneys to try to put their hands in my pockets every chance they get so he can buy watermelon for a horse. Ain't happening in this or any other lifetime. Times are tough. You deadbeats need to pay your taxes. You need to quit asking the middle class to pay your taxes. You need to quit asking for more refunds...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346653262066</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 02:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346658444398-4</Id><Topic><Title>The More We Learn</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346653262066</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 02:21:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As for 'class warfare', I'm all for it and it's about time.

The job of a component named FIVR (Fully integrated voltage regulator) is to integrate legacy power delivery onto the processor package and die. Current processors in the market are working via PLL voltage regulators and even thou we don’t understand this part enough to brag about it, we know that Fully integrated voltage regulator will enable designs with less components and save manufacturers a few cents / bucks. Intel clams that getting the FIVR on die / package will greatly simplify a platform power design and that it can consolidate 5 platform voltage regulators to just one. The Haswell will now come with input voltage regulator that takes to FIVR and this should offer a better arch flexibility and finer grain on die processor delivery control. We are not sure if this is good or bad news for overclockers as modifying voltage regulator that becomes a part of a CPU is definitely harder than modifying one that is soldered on the motherboard, but it all depends on Intel’s approach. We are sure that Intel won’t abandon the overclocker community that easily and that 2013 Haswell parts will be designed with overclockers in mind.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346682981003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:36:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346683534876-14</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts Have a Week (Or Less)</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346629742294</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 19:49:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are the "boneless bears" in trouble, Waldolt?

Invites are currently being sent out for the US launch of the device in two days’ time [5th September 2012] and in London in just over a fortnight. Though Motorola is keeping its cards close to its chest, it’s widely rumoured that both events will mark the unveiling of its Edge device – the first real fruits of its labour since it was acquired by Google. Significantly, the London invite also bears the Intel logo though it’s not clear whether it relates to the debut of a smartphone or tablet. But, if as anticipated, a new Intel-based Android smartphone is about to be unveiled then it will serve as a milestone in the mobile industry given the dominance of ARM to date. The partnership between Intel and Motorola, first announced at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, is one of the few that Intel has been able to acquire in the mobile sphere, reflecting the difficulties it has hitherto experienced in getting an x86-based processor to fit neatly inside a system-on-chip suitable for phones. But more recently Intel has been developing its brand-new “Medfield” mobile processors to overcome problems with size and power consumption. If the new Edge device is Medfield powered it could pave the way for new Intel alliances with Microsoft and its Windows 7 OS, not to mention struggling phone makers like Nokia who desperately need to find their own way in a world equally dominated by Google’s Android platform – all the more so now that Android could be in the patent gunsights of Apple. While the current Atom Z2460 “Medfield” is running a single core, Intel has a higher end dual core Z2580 (with LTE or 4G capability) that will be available in the first half of 2013, potentially posing an even bigger threat to ARM, particularly its Cortex A9 designs. Meanwhile reports elsewhere suggest The Edge is likely to be the first Motorola device to ship with Android Jelly Bean, at the same time featuring a touch-screen that fills almost the whole front of the device. In London today [3rd September 2012], ARM’s shares were trading at around the 558p mark compared to 647p at their height earlier this year. It follows a recommendation by Deutsche Bank for investors to sell ARM shares “due to increased competition.”</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1346683610258</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346683749294-16</Id><Title>Deutshe bank recommend to sell ARMH on competition</Title><Msg>And so it begins !</Msg><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1346683749294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346683902436-17</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola to announce Intel phone in next few days (article)</Title><Username>duhboysarebackintown</Username><Timestamp>1346683610258</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:46:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does this mean the boneless bears are in trouble, Wallduh?

The company said that it is to cut staffing costs ahead of an expected slowdown in chip sales in the second half of 2012. In an interview with the Financial Times chief executive Warren East said depressed smartphone sales could hit revenues, and the group is braced for a further slowdown in the second half of the year. East said that many of the chip companies are indicating that they are not expecting an uplift and mathematically that will hit us. As a result the group is cutting recruitment and hiring graduates to save pennies.East said he would have liked to do more this year but the uncertainty of the business climate has made ARM hold off. The company is tilting from hiring more experienced people towards hiring graduates, who tend to be a bit cheaper.

The job of a component named FIVR (Fully integrated voltage regulator) is to integrate legacy power delivery onto the processor package and die. Current processors in the market are working via PLL voltage regulators and even thou we don’t understand this part enough to brag about it, we know that Fully integrated voltage regulator will enable designs with less components and save manufacturers a few cents / bucks. Intel clams that getting the FIVR on die / package will greatly simplify a platform power design and that it can consolidate 5 platform voltage regulators to just one. The Haswell will now come with input voltage regulator that takes to FIVR and this should offer a better arch flexibility and finer grain on die processor delivery control. We are not sure if this is good or bad news for overclockers as modifying voltage regulator that becomes a part of a CPU is definitely harder than modifying one that is soldered on the motherboard, but it all depends on Intel’s approach. We are sure that Intel won’t abandon the overclocker community that easily and that 2013 Haswell parts will be designed with overclockers in mind.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346698612724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:56:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346698677367-41</Id><Topic><Title>GETANID61 lists his ignore list.............but</Title><Username>wall.spam</Username><Timestamp>1346698430912</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:53:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read the board by message lists, doesn't matter what poster started the thread. but just added yet another of your ids to my IGNORE !!!! wall.spam</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346698677367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:57:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346699029095-42</Id><Topic><Title>GETANID61 lists his ignore list.............but</Title><Username>wall.spam</Username><Timestamp>1346698430912</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:53:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cover up a lie with another lie, LOL!

And if I were going to create aliases do you think I'd use something like "bozoweaver"? You can also look at the various writing and content styles to easily determine these are not all the same person. Some of these and I are obviously on different sides of the political spectrum. It's difficult to present different writing styles. This is why it's so easy to spot Lucy's aliases. Just look for repetition of things like "tooooooo" and "reeeeeeeeeeddddd" and "nuff". There are of course some Lucy-bashing aliases. None of these are mine. I have Lucy on ignore and with rare exception don't feel the need to respond to the consistent stupidity and dysfunction. Some of the above appear to be Lucy-bashing aliases. At least one appears to be a Lucy alias. I can see why a Lucy-bashing alias would also be used to bash you. You deserve it. In fact a lot of days we can't tell the difference between you and Lucy. Here's the bottom line: We don't (except for the lucies) want you and your consistent Intel bashing, ARM-worshipping here.

Asustek is already set to halt its Eee PC product line and officially phase out from the IT industry after completely digesting any remaining inventory. As for Acer, so far, the company has not yet made any plans to open new netbook projects, indicating that the vendor may also plan to step out of the market. Although Atom series processors will still be adopted by handset and embedded products, the sources believe the two product lines are unlikely to be able to fill the gap created by the absent netbook products in short term due to weak shipments. Asustek CEO Jerry Shen recently confirmed that the company will stop production of Eee PC netbooks using Atom-based processors such as the N2600 due to impact from tablet PCs and notebooks, as well as a sharp drop in demand in emerging markets. Asustek plans to have its Transformer tablet PCs fill the 10-inch mobile device market, replacing its netbook product line. Micro-Star International (MSI), which is selling a small volume of Atom N2800-based products, also has no plans to continue shipping related products. Although netbook vendors were originally optimistic about demand from Southeast Asia, Latin America and Middle East regions, as tablet PCs are rising quickly and many government procurement orders have turned to tablet PC products instead, demand for 10-inch netbooks has dropped rapidly, accelerating the segment's exit from the IT market. In addition, Windows 8's licensing fees, and upgrades in panels to higher resolutions and touchscreen functions will all add to netbook costs forcing netbook vendors to give up the product line before entering the Windows 8 generation. Dropping netbook orders are also expected to affect shipments of netbook ODMs Pegatron Technology and Compal Electronics. The sources pointed out that Intel's Atom N2800 and N2600 processors for netbooks and Atom D2700, D2500 and D2550 processors for nettops are expected to see their shipments drop close to 50% in the fourth quarter, and Atom N series CPU will only be adopted by Intel and a few vendors in 2013, while the Atom D will gradually be phased out of the market.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346726338385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 22:38:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346726475009-65</Id><Topic><Title>Intel may need to adjust roadmap for PC-use Atom processors</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346726338385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 22:38:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as INTC hits $24.90 tomorrow - I will be happy.

The netbook form factor has been in decline for some time now. Dunno, maybe this author just heard about it, just like the fanboi apparently just heard about it and being the last to know thought he could get some Intel bashing mileage out of it. Not really. Ultrabooks and tablets are the direction Intel is firmly headed into. At 14m, Intel will take ownership of the tablet space. It's playing out the only way it can due to Intel's immense lead in fabrication which is getting longer as ARM has no solutions after 20nm. Intel doesn't sell netbooks, notebooks or PCs. Intel sells processors. If Wall Street and the fanboi weren't dumb as a box of rocks, they would know this and skipped posting this very old news...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1346729087282</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
