The latest numbers show 247 million people went holiday shopping over the weekend and spent more than $59 billion dollars. That's a 14 percent increase over last year. By noon Monday -- what's billed as Cyber Monday -- online sales alone were up 24 percent from a year ago. Strong Black Friday weekend kicks off season Black Friday creeps into Thanksgiving permanently? Social networks fail Cyber Monday test The web is fast becoming America's marketplace and creating thousands of jobs along the way. Amazon's biggest shipping center, in Phoenix, Ariz., is the size of 28 football fields. Last Cyber Monday, it's busiest day of the year, Amazon processed 200 hundred orders per second. Vice President of Communications Craig Berman says Amazon expects business this year will be even better. "We've hired and are continuing to hire 50,000 seasonal workers to meet customer demand," he said. That's in addition to Amazon's 20,000 full time workers, like packing manager Mark Pulley. "They need to come up with a new word for busy. We've probably been on hyper-drive," Pulley said.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1353995711354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 00:55:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353995837156-7</Id><Topic><Title>INTERESTING ARTICLE</Title><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1353987356955</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 22:35:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yup...

He did buy 63 small community newspapers from Media General for a very small 142m. He also allowed a 42 million line of credit which Media General is yet to use which he makes 2% on regardless if they use it or not. $900,000 a year whether they use it or not. But it was not a good deal for the reasons you sited. How do i know this? Because I worked for Media General when he bought them. I now work for World Media Enterprises a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. He'll get no synergy's from the logicality of the newspapers. Everything you mentioned has been tried. It was a good deal simply because they had to sell. Period. No genius moves here on Buffets part. Just money. It takes money to make money. The funny part is he didn't buy the Tampa Tribune. Media Generals largest newspaper. They sold it after his purchase for 9.5m and the land alone was worth 25m. He's a #$%$ A rich #$%$ World Media has already laid off over 100 people and it's not going to end there. The insurance they are offering is horrific.

There's another article about it today but I can't pull it up. Intel Indonesia to focus on growing ultrabook market The Jakarta Post, Jakarta | Business | Tue, September 04 2012, 5:39 AM Intel Indonesia, a local unit of the world’s largest chip manufacturer Intel Corp., will focus its resources on developing the ultrabook market in Indonesia, believing that’s where the future of computer innovation lies. Intel Indonesia’s director for strategic business development, Harry K. Nugraha, says that ultrabooks will soon become the most sought-after gadget in Indonesia as more people will turn to portable, lightweight notebook that is capable of various high-performance tasks. “In the future, you will see many innovations and improvements in ultrabooks because our core business will focus on the segment,” he said recently. Intel Indonesia, for example, has distributed ultrabooks equipped with Ivy Bridge processors, a microarchitecture concept inside the processor capable of high-performance tasks but producing only moderate heat. The Ivy Bridge is especially known for having better endurance compared to its predecessor, the Sandy Bridge. Ultrabook is a term first coined by Intel to define a highly portable computer that is sleek and lightweight but still possess high data processing capability. Its development is inspired by Macbook Air, a pioneer of razor-thin notebook that was first introduced by US technology giant Apple Inc. in 2008. Among ultrabook products distributed in Indonesia are Acer Aspire S3, Asus Zenbook, Dell XPS, HP Folio, Lenovo Ideapad U300, Samsung Series 5 and Toshiba Portege Z series. All of the products are more expensive than ordinary notebooks with identical specifications, but are less than 1.8 centimeters thick and weigh less than 1.4 kilograms. “Ultrabooks are not only about its thinness and weight,” Harry said, pointing to the fact that an ultrabook is also equipped with the most recent computer technology, high data processing ability, long battery life and up-to-date security systems. Among the companies to first venture into ultrabook market in Indonesia was PT Acer Indonesia, which introduced the Acer Aspire S3 in September last year. “The market responded positively to the introduction of the Acer Aspire S3, as evinced by soaring demand,” Acer Indonesia marketing director Daniel Rustandi said when asked to comment on the sales of his company’s ultrabooks. Daniel predicted that the demand for ultrabooks in the country would continue rise. “There is still huge potential in the market. Ultrabooks are becoming the lifestyle essential for customers who need a thin but productive notebook,” he added. The Taiwan-based company remains the ultrabook market leader in Indonesia, with at least 72 percent of sales in the country, according to the Gfk Group, a market research company.</Msg><Username>divorceanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354024417327</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 08:53:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354025027613-23</Id><Title>Reason guys like Wdblawgrow are broke and so crotchedy</Title><Msg>Daytraders NEVER last.

He wins by doing nothing. SO--they have to do a deal--Obummer will be offering a tax cut for all those making less than 250,000 dollars a year and the GOP house #$%$ are going to say no? I mean NO NO NO for a week maybe but they will have to fold. Then they will be attacked by the right in their own party base and idiots like Grover will go nuts. Obummer wins--Elections have consequences. Eat it rightwing trash balls --Hey Joe kernon--you are a fat pig.</Msg><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1354027717165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:48:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027892736-29</Id><Topic><Title>INTERESTING ARTICLE</Title><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1353987356955</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 22:35:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There's still no support for Android or Chrome OS or iOS or even Mac OS" I see... better let those poor buyers, that are making those platforms a HUGE success, in on it...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354027892736</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:51:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354028075411-30</Id><Title>Intel annouces special $2 dividend</Title><Msg>That is how the leaving ceo will get a golden parachute</Msg><Username>jfk1to</Username><Timestamp>1354028075411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:54:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354028364325-31</Id><Topic><Title>INTERESTING ARTICLE</Title><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1353987356955</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 22:35:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I see... better let those poor buyers, that are making those platforms a HUGE success, in on it..."

The news arrives by way of an update to Microsoft's support lifecycle page. For the Surface hardware, Microsoft will provide four years of mainstream support, including firmware updates. During this time, hardware repairs or replacements and parts will be made available. Services are free for products under warranty and available for a fee for products out of warranty. As for Windows RT, the new ARM-based version of Windows 8 on Microsoft's Surface tablet is covered by the typical 5-year operating system support lifecycle policy. That policy also applies to the handful of Windows RT-based PC's supplied by its OEM partners. "Microsoft will make software updates, including security updates, available for Windows RT. Additional information regarding the Windows RT lifecycle policy will be communicated as available," the company states. "Office Home and Student 2013 RT has the same lifecycle policy as Windows RT." According to this Microsoft FAQ, any Surface software installed, embedded or downloaded on the Surface device is subject to the software lifecycle support policy for that software – unlike other hardware devices such as the Xbox 360 console. "The hardware support lifecycle policy applies only to the Surface hardware (and as stated above not the Surface software). For Surface devices, that policy affects only the tablet device and hardware based accessories (and for example not to soft goods accessories such as cases), the FAQ adds. Thus, consumers who purchase a Surface RT tablet should expect software updates until April 2017 at the very least. Security and platform updates will also include Office Home and Student 2013 software which comes pre-installed on the Windows RT tablets and desktops. CNET points out that this support schedule is highly generous, as Apple has already killed OS updates for the original iPad which launched back in 2010. Currently, consumers have no idea when the just-launched Google Nexus 10 Android tablet will cease receiving updates, or with any other Android tablet from Google or 3rd-party partners for that matter.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354029917068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:25:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354030306228-37</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Supporting Windows RT Until at least 2017</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354029917068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:25:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It might take until 2017 to sell an RT based Surface Tablet. lol</Msg><Username>divorceanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354030306228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:31:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354031479685-38</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Supporting Windows RT Until at least 2017</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1354029917068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:25:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My read is that Windows RT is not getting the traction that Microsoft hoped for.

Background- born to parents of Jewish descent. Father, attorney and mother, homemaker. No brothers or sisters. Upon birth, too funny was discovered to be extremely androgynous. Hence the name Lucy/Lucifer after his father cursed the devil. 2. Education- has high school GED and actually excelled in wood/metal shop. Suspended for crawling under the bleachers to more closely examine the crotch areas of unsuspecting patrons at a basketball game. 3. Employment- has only held two jobs. One job was a newspaper boy at age 30 and the other (current) one is a parking lot attendant at the local supervalue grocery store in his home town. Despite his GED, people interacting with him often walk away muttering that he must have only a 4th grade education. Still lives with parents in their basement. 4. Investment experience- has in the past borrowed money from parents to buy 50 shares of Intel which he sold for a loss. Ultimately he would lose what was left of his Intel shares by investing in Cisco. Has dabbled in get rich quick stocks since then, bought from his meager earnings, only to lose each time. Because of his experience in the market, he vents his frustration on Yahoo message boards, hoping others will do as awful as he has. 5. Personal life- is a practicing queer and avid masturbater. Will often dress like a woman and type ridiculous statements, like "hi ho weaverino". Spends most of his spare time in the men's room at the local bus depot when the stock market is closed. Mother often comments that the knee areas on his pants often wear quickly when doing his laundry.</Msg><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1354068113280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 21:01:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354068318509-123</Id><Title>Short into strength</Title><Msg>I'm not expecting a lot of strength, but PC data points getting less bad (for now).
