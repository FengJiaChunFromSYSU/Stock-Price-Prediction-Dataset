Cray has been a staunch supporter of AMD, with its Opteron processors powering its previous generation XE6 clusters, however the firm opted to install Intel's Sandy Bridge Xeons in its next generation Cascade XC30 cluster. The firm told The INQUIRER the decision to go with Intel's Xeon chips was due to improved performance and flexibility. With Cray selling its interconnect business to Intel and supporting Xeon Phi accelerators the two firms have been getting closer to each other in the last few years. Barry Bolding, VP of Storage and Data Management and corporate marketing at Cray told The INQUIRER that the firm's use of Intel Xeon chips in its Cascade XC30 cluster doesn't mean that Cray has completely shut the door on AMD. Bolding said, "This is a big step for us from just providing AMD based solutions or AMD combined with Nvidia. This allows us to really move forward and do Intel based Xeon, Intel based Phi and Nvidia. We haven't announced an Opteron product up to this stage, but it is fully supported in the PCI [Express] Gen 3." Bolding made it clear that if there is a great product from AMD that Cray or one of its customers wishes to incorporate, Cray can do it. "There's nothing wrong with our partnership with AMD," added Bolding, and he said that there are "design features up to Interlagos that we love". Bolding said Intel had suffered "hiccups" with its Xeon processors in the past but that Intel's current generation Sandy Bridge and upcoming Ivy Bridge chips provide the mix of performance and connectivity that the firm was looking for when it designed the Cascade XC30 cluster. "We are getting more experience with Intel, and we believe the Xeon line is greatly improved over what it was in previous generations. They have had some hiccups along the way but we do believe Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge are world-class processors for high performance computing [HPC], performance," Bolding said. Bolding said Cray's decision to use Intel Xeon processors was down to flexibility. "We need to be able to to choose the best processor in any generation," said Bolding, indicating that Intel Xeon chips were the best fit with the firm's Aries interconnect. Bolding said Cray will still sell AMD's chips for its existing clusters, and noted that XE6 clusters can be upgraded using AMD 6300 series Opteron chips. However, given Cray's position in the HPC community, its decision to move away from AMD for the Cascade XC30 HPC cluster will be a painful blow for the chip designer.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352368409070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 04:53:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352370087661-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why Apple is switching to ARM?</Title><Username>geobor2012</Username><Timestamp>1352170112535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 21:48:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cause they can...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1352370087661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 05:21:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352374079899-5</Id><Topic><Title>Germans Can't Fathom US Aversion to Obama's Healthcare Reform</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1352345580360</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:33:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I sell health insurance.

The 2 ARM 64 bit processors will arrive in two years but Apple wouldn't be using them, it would be designing its own to the ARM ISA. That 64 bit ISA has been floating around for a good few years (before it was officially announced) so Apple could be at the same stage as AppliedMicro’s X-Gene - basically months away from working silicon.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1352386986296</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:03:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352387362739-24</Id><Topic><Title>Karl Rove's Super PAC ALONE spent $103 MILLION DOLLARS</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1352383286391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:01:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$187 million spent for pres ads in ohio alone, $6 billion total spent on national races just to keep status quo, sickening exit polls indicate voters think obama cares about middle class and people more than romney and that was reflected in origin of contributions: romney's money mostly came from fewer wealthy donors maxing, obama money much more from small donors and modest contributions I am so pessimistic tha campaign finance reform has a chance.

New Intel® Itanium® Processor 9500 Delivers Breakthrough Capabilities for Mission-Critical Computing Based on New Microarchitecture, Intel®Itanium® Processor, Doubles Performance and Boosts Resiliency NEWS HIGHLIGHTS • The Intel® Itanium® processor 9500 delivers unprecedented availability, error resiliency and performance increase over the previous generation. • With twice the number of cores on a new architecture, the Intel Itanium processor 9500 series will provide up to 2.4 times performance scaling1 and 33 percent faster I/O speed over the previous generation, with new capabilities such as the Intel® Instruction Replay Technology. • Future generations of Intel Itanium processors will adopt an innovative “Modular Development Model” that enables deeper commonality between Intel Itanium and the Intel Xeon processor E7 family, from shared silicon design elements to full-socket compatibility. This will provide a more sustainable path for Itanium development and greater design flexibility for Intel’s partners. Press Release: Intel Corporation – 13 minutes ago.. .. . SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- In an era of unprecedented growth in data usage, businesses require powerful computing solutions that can deliver scalable and resilient performance to run IT’s most mission-critical applications. The new Intel® Itanium® processor 9500 series is more than twice as powerful as the previous generation, making it ideal for today’s most demanding workloads, including business analytics, database, and large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications. Systems based on Intel’s Itanium processors run in more than three-quarters of the World’s Global 100 companies across industries such as aerospace, energy, life sciences and telecommunications. With the Intel Itanium processor 9500 series, these industries will benefit from a leap in performance and an increase in world-class reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) capabilities. “In a world where businesses are increasingly dependent on IT for their competitive advantage, more and more business applications are rightfully called ‘mission critical’; they must be always available, highly responsive and extremely reliable. It’s for precisely these computing workloads that we’ve developed the Intel Itanium 9500 processor,” said Diane Bryant, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Datacenter and Connected Systems Group. “Built on a new microarchitecture and providing breakthrough performance, the Intel Itanium 9500 processor family signals Intel’s ongoing commitment to deliver unparalleled reliability, availability and scalability to meet the critical application demands across all industries.” Enterprise Performance with World-Class Availability Containing 3.1 billion transistors, the Intel Itanium processor 9500 series is Intel’s most sophisticated general purpose processors to date. It supports up to twice as many cores (8 instead of 4) than the previous-generation processor, packs up to 54 MB of on-die memory, and enables up to 2 TB of low voltage DIMMs in a four-socket configuration. The speed of the processor increased 40 percent over the previous generation in lower power configurations. The new frequencies range from 1.73 GHz and a power level of 130 watts, to 2.53 GHz at a power level of 170 watts. Delivering the highest levels of Intel Itanium performance, the new processors enable highly scalable deployments with world-class availability for data-intensive applications where downtime is not an option. These include ERP, supply chain management and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Modular Development Model Provides More Flexibility In 2010, Intel introduced its common platform strategy that allows Intel Itanium and Intel Xeon processors to utilize common platform ingredients including chipsets, interconnects and memory. This strategy gives Intel the ability to cascade the strength of Intel Itanium RAS features to benefit the Intel Xeon processor E7 family, and allows Intel Itanium to further extract the efficiencies and value of higher volume economics. For the next-generation Intel Itanium product family, code-named “Kittson,” Intel will employ an innovative model for Intel Itanium and Intel Xeon development called “Modular Development Model.” The model will extend the common platform strategy by sharing silicon-level design elements and socket compatibility. The result for Intel is an even more sustainable path to bring future Itanium processors to market. In addition, OEMs will be able to develop one single motherboard platform for both architectures. Industry Support Intel Itanium processors continue to maintain strong industry support among systems makers such as Bull, Hitachi, HP, Inspur and NEC. Enterprise applications are widely available from multiple vendors, such as, Oracle, SAP, SAS, Sybase and Temenos, among other vendors that underscore the ISV community’s efforts to ensure the success of the Intel Itanium mission-critical ecosystem. “A mission-critical IT infrastructure with resiliency, scalability and high availability is critical to the success of enterprises,” said Ric Lewis, vice president and interim general manager, Business Critical Systems, HP. “The addition of the Intel® Itanium® processor 9500 series to our newly enhanced HP Integrity and HP-UX portfolio provides breakthrough performance, increased productivity and delivers on HP’s commitment to provide our customers with investment protection.” "NEC has been working with Intel more than 15 years to build enterprise servers based on Intel Itanium processors," said Kazuaki Iwamoto, vice president and senior general manager of IT hardware operations unit, NEC Corporation. "We are pleased to provide our customers with the new enterprise servers based on Intel Itanium processor 9500 series for their highly scalable and mission critical systems." Pricing and Availability The Intel Itanium processor 9500 series is available now and is priced from $1,350 to $4,650 in quantities of 1,000 units.

Case and point, on Hannity just prior to the election he first tried to pin Carter as the worst president ever (excuse me but I don't think anyone comes even close to Dubya for that honor),... .but anyway he shows the long lines at gas stations during the energy crisis in the '70s and tries to compare the long lines in NJ and NY in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy as evidence of failed Obama energy policy in line with the broad energy crisis in the '70s. Ok well in Hannity's case, he is a clinical #$%$ but most of these clowns are not as stupid as the people they hope to convince with their #$%$.

Whenever someone exhorts you to look down at another human being for whatever reason, you should immediately know that the guy who makes this appeal is up to no good. Whether he is asking for your loyalty, your vote, or a donation. The egocentric view that "you", "your" group/religion/race etc. somehow makes you better than others will lead only to continued frustration (...and this view will never be satiated or satisfied). And who pays the price....not the guy making the appeal since he gets what he wants...we pay for it individually with our continued frustration. And we have to fix it for our own sake! BTW, amdroadkill - I will submit you are guilty of the same...your "inclusiveness" is very limited...and your continued posts putting down "rightwing" people using extreme language confirm that you are guilty of the same...only difference is that you're on the other side.

First of all there was NO announcement - A couple days ago around 15:55 someone floated a rumor. The rumor was repeated and reiterated over and over again (like propaganda) and at some point the rumor becomes the "truth". Unless Apple is asleep on the wheel they ought know what (low power) products Intel has in the pipeline. TSMC supposedly the new Apple partner has to my knowledge not produced any silicon for Apple - - they still depend on Samsung for the next couple years. You can not just ditch the current foundry on the fly and switch over to a new one. This is not switching from Ford truck to Chevy truck GF and TSMC roadmap is completely different and that will impact the design stage. Apple would be crazy to put all eggs into TSMC. And if they decide to use a second foundry (like GF) it will be very expensive. Apple laptops start at $1299 and go up close to $3k -you can just put some $50 ARM SoC into these machines - if there are any customer that require "computing power" it's Apple customers.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1352405314610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:08:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352405331468-83</Id><Topic><Title>Intel continues to execute while ARM Server-wannabe Tech. gets ditched by HP</Title><Username>getanid16</Username><Timestamp>1352393190996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 11:46:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"test" and "could" are far far far from the ARM server revolution you ARM employees preach..........while on company time.

If you are talking about just performance, then you are right, Intel are in a different league.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1352405705049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:15:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352405807625-87</Id><Title>From Barrons</Title><Msg>"given very low expectations for Intel (INTC), particularly in light of a disintegrating competitor and continued data center builds, the stage may well be set for a significant upside surprise".</Msg><Username>g2n2_2002</Username><Timestamp>1352405807625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:16:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352406003779-88</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1352403731591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 14:42:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your preaching to the choir.

INTC power performance is now comparable to ARMH in similar applications. Their performance/speed of logic functions, eg flops (floating point per second operations or machine executions) is infinitely better. That's why we are seeing so many attacks on INTC. The watershed has been reached. No one can now touch INTC in this space, ever again.

They are, and will remain, highly cyclical, and massively underperform in market slowdowns, just as they already have. The markets have already broken below uptrend lines which were previous support or breakout levels, and lower lows and lower highs has been the recent trend. The break below 65.00 on the QQQ was a breakdown of former resistance that led to new highs once taken out. Now resistance. Pompous Wally with his be patient children, chump that he is, patiently waited for over 2 years for INTC to get back to and above 24.00 and greedy fool that he is, failed to long in gains way back when this was 29.20, or 27.70, ie the rebound high on the way back up from just under 25.00.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1352426001375</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 20:53:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352427278660-124</Id><Title>Glad I bought this thing just under 21 a year ago</Title><Msg>I'd be sick if I bought at 25 let alone 29.

I tried to extract the 36% from a couple other releases and could not find it. It seems like Q4 Revenue are expected flat. GAAP Q Revenues Q3 FY12 GPU $644.8 Professional Solutions 230.3 Consumer Products 191.1 TOTAL $1,066.2 REVENUE Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was a record at $1.20 billion, up 15.3 percent sequentially and up 12.9 percent year-over-year. Our outlook for revenue was $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. Our consumer GPU business – which includes desktop, notebook, memory, license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel, and the ramp-down of chipset (MCP) products as we exited the chipset business – had revenue of $739.6 million, up 10.7 percent sequentially and up 14.7 percent year-over-year. Demand for our desktop GTX (enthusiast and PC gaming) products remained strong in the third quarter as we continued the launch of our Kepler™ based GPUs. Inventory in the channel remained healthy. As anticipated, notebook GPU revenue was at a record level on the strength of our Ivy Bridge design wins. License revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel was flat at $66.0 million, unchanged from the previous and year-earlier quarters. MCP revenue declined to $3.3 million from $7.3 million the previous quarter and $22.4 million a year earlier. Revenue for our Professional Solutions Business – which includes workstation graphics and computing – was $220.6 million, up 12.4 percent sequentially and down 4.2 percent year-over-year. Our Quadro® business continued to be challenged in the current quarter by the macroeconomic environment, with weak economic conditions in Europe and softness in other geographies. Conversely, our Tesla business was up both sequentially and year-over-year. The increase was largely due to the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products to Oak Ridge National Labs in connection with the build of their new Titan supercomputer. Revenue for our Consumer Products Business – which includes Tegra®-based smartphone and tablet products, Icera® baseband processors and RF transceivers, embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles – was $243.9 million, up 35.7 percent sequentially and 27.6 percent year-over-year. The increase was largely attributable to record revenue for Tegra, as our Tegra 3 processors continued to ship in smartphone and tablet devices. FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows: • Revenue is expected to be between $1.025 billion and $1.175 billion. • GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be flat relative to the prior quarter, 52.9 percent and 53.1 percent, respectively. • GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $400 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $359 million. • GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively, plus or minus one percentage point. This estimate excludes any discrete tax events that may occur during the quarter, which, if realized, may increase or decrease our actual fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates. If the U.S. research tax credit is reinstated into tax law, we estimate our annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 to be approximately 16 percent. We estimate depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter to be approximately $58 million to $60 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 629 million.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1352435809689</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 23:36:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352436219321-131</Id><Topic><Title>From Barrons</Title><Username>g2n2_2002</Username><Timestamp>1352405807625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:16:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't usually rant that Intel should speak up but it sure seems like they are very quiet.
