Did anybody buy TI's OMAP A15 big.LITTLE design? It got excellent reviews - might be even better than Samsung. ARM is NOT a rubber stamp because it's becoming pretty obvious that a generic off the shelf design won't cut it. . Both TI and Renesas put in extra efforts and it seems it still won't cut it.

Both the small and mid-cap stocks lagged. In addition, financials as well as the transportation shares, which had led the rally in the past several months, have been underperforming throughout the week. When the leaders in a trending market start to lose momentum, it sends a warning that the trend could start to change soon. Technically, the MACDs of the major indexes continued to head lower, suggesting short term momentum remained bearish. With that said, the stock market has demonstrated its resiliency since last Thanksgiving.

It really isn't about having another cable like service, it is about providing consumers with more content choices at a lower cost. Most folks have unlimited bandwidth on their Internet service and streaming content with all the compression that goes on is not as bandwith intensive as you might think. The cable TV model is broken. Most folks don't want to pay $100 a month to buy just 3-4 channels that they commonly use. Personally, I stream a lot of content from the internet to my TV now. If Intel comes out with a service that allows me to stream channels that I watch all the time then I would totally ditch my cable and pay them for the service. Intel TV in the end is going to be about content.

Fixed-price unlimited access is no longer the U.S. policy. Just because someone streams a couple movies per week today doesn't mean their Internet service is unlimited. I know heavy Internet users that regularly receive warnings from their service provider along with additional charges for exceeding the provider's cap. Read the provider's Terms Of Use. Virtually every operator's contract will say they can charge extra for excessive use and current FCC regulation supports them doing so. And here's the rub. When cable operators and the FCC were deciding how much monthly usage is suitable for the average consumer, they envisioned web access, email and some occasional movie streaming. They weren't planning on substituting cable TV service with 24x7 live TV IP streaming so when the cable operators grow tired of Intel's live TV service getting a free ride on the cable operator's infrastructure all they have to do is raise the cost of the Internet service to customers of Intel's Web TV service.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364046276602</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 09:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364049332478-20</Id><Topic><Title>It becoming clear Paul O. was the problem</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1364004644862</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:10:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct sir.</Msg><Username>thebegining6</Username><Timestamp>1364049332478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 10:35:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364049484515-21</Id><Topic><Title>Windows Blue is aimed at Intel 'Haswell' ultrabooks</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364010418828</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:46:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only sips power but maintains a low bandwidth connection to systems/servers and keeps monitored programs (email, messages, ...) current so when you "turn it back on" you get "instant on" and your content appears like you never turned the system off.

He did not want to transfer "ownership" of the Intel fabs to Apple. From Jobs autobiography. The episode is one of many anecdotes in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Apple’s late CEO. He writes that Jobs pushed for the use of Intel chips when Apple was developing its tablet computer, betting on the same technology that powered his company’s Macintosh desktop and laptop computers. Intel at the time was developing its low-powered Atom chip, which Jobs favored, Isaacson writes. Intel CEO Paul Otellini was pushing hard to work with Apple on the tablet, and Jobs was inclined to trust him. But Tony Fadell–then a key leader of Apple’s design efforts, now at the startup Nest Labs–was adamant that the iPad needed the even lower power consumption of chips based on designs from ARM Holdings. He felt so strongly about the matter that, during one meeting, he placed his Apple badge on the table and threatened to resign over the matter, according to the biography. Jobs eventually relented. Indeed, Apple became such a zealot for ARM that it began designing its own chips based on the technology, using an engineering team acquired by buying the startup P.A. Semi. The biography also includes some sharp criticism by Jobs of Intel, at least beyond its high-performance microprocessors for PCs. Intel, Jobs said, had wanted to do a “big joint project” with Apple to do chips for future iPhones but was not selected. “There were two reasons we didn’t go with them,” Jobs said, according to the book. “One was that they are just really slow. They are like a steamship, not very flexible. We’re used to going pretty fast. Second is that we just didn’t want to teach them everything, which they could go and sell to our competitors.”</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364050431266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 10:53:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364053097347-23</Id><Topic><Title>It becoming clear Paul O. was the problem</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1364004644862</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:10:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More from Jobs autobio. Remember that Intel fabs had been running at capacity for 10 years and wafers had been on allocation. The Netbook volumes were increasing exponentially. .... Isaacson includes Otellini’s rebuttal to this account. The real issue, Intel’s CEO told him, is that Apple and Intel couldn’t agree on chip pricing. The companies also disagreed on who would control the design–another example, the author concludes, of Jobs’s compulsion to control every aspect of a product. Elsewhere in the biography, Isaacson recounts how Jobs and Otellini had gotten to know each other in the 1990s when Jobs was struggling to sustain his second company, NeXT, and “his arrogance had been temporarily tempered,” as Otellini put it. Later, at Apple, Jobs pushed for the pivotal move in 2005 to start using Intel chips for the Macintosh, after years using the PowerPC technology promoted by IBM and Motorola. Chip pricing in those days was also a key issue, with Jobs wanting better terms than other computer makers, the biography discloses. Jobs and Otellini would take walks together above the Stanford University campus, starting with broad pronouncements by Jobs about the evolution of computing. By the end of the walk, Jobs would be haggling over price, Isaacson writes.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364053097347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364053350372-24</Id><Topic><Title>LI yui_3_8_1_1_1363986981907_613</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363983438124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:17:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You hit this bug when you try to reply at the maximum Yahoo REPLY depth.

That’s a milestone for both companies, and a surprising sidelight could play into the story–worries about dependence on non-U.S. manufacturers. The Silicon Valley startup in 2010 turned to Intel, which opted to break from long-standing practice and use its sophisticated factories and manufacturing processes to serve customers beyond Intel’s own chip-design groups. Achronix became one of two publicly announced users of the new Intel foundry business, as such services are called. Intel believes it can make smaller and more sophisticated transistors than other foundries. Achronix, which makes a variety of programmable chips that use lots of transistors, says its bet on Intel has paid off as advertised. Asked if the idea of domestic manufacturing is resonating with hardware makers, Achronix Chairman John Lofton Holt “absolutely.” Blake added: “It comes up quite often with customers.

Intel's silicon-level Haswell technology will result in "the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel history," according to a recent statement from Intel CEO Paul Otellni. But Windows Blue -- an update to Windows 8 that is expected to deliver a variety of improvements beyond Haswell devices -- will contribute to the system's overall power efficiency too. Microsoft is building a "power model" that can adapt to a range of mobile computers with different "performance output," according to the source. Basically that means Blue on mainstream Intel chips will be able to act more like a smartphone or tablet OS. That technology will come from both Microsoft and Intel, according to the source. "You'll be able to buy an ultrabook that's as wickedly fast as you can imagine, faster than an Ivy Bridge PC. But with longer battery life," the source said. Ivy Bridge, Intel's current mainstream offering, will be superseded by Haswell. "It will sleep longer [and] when you open the lid, your mail's going to already be in sync. So, you'll get the best of all of those worlds. And that's work that's coming in [Windows] Blue," the source said. Editor's note: as indicated in the story, Windows Blue is expected to offer improvements to a wide variety of devices. Not only Haswell chip-based devices. Haswell will be a major beneficiary, though, because it is expected to ship in tens of millions of PCs.

After launching the ASUS FonePad in April, ASUS is said to be previewing the next generation of Nexus 7s in May (most likely at Google’s I/O conference), and launching a brand new phone in June. The rumors come from sources who tipped off Digitimes. The rumors don’t seem far from the truth, however, because we already know that Google plans on launching a successor to its current Nexus 7. First up is the new phone. ASUS’s new smartphone will have a 5 to 5.5-inch display, and will also have an Intel Atom Z2580 Clover Trail+ processor. Intel processors may start being a trend for ASUS, who is also using an Intel Atom 2420 processor in its ASUS FonePad. But unlike the 1.2GHz single-core processor on the FonePad, ASUS’s upcoming smartphone’s processor will be dual-core and will be clocked up to 2GHz. Next up is the next generation of Nexus 7s. The devices will obviously see enhancements, but unfortunately the sources did not state what kinds. The device will see a price point starting at $249 and will directly compete with the high-end 7-inch and 8-inch tablets heading to the market. Rumors have circulated that the device will have a Full HD display as well as a thinner bezel. Both of the devices are set to impress. Despite the Intel Atom Z2580 being only dual-core, benchmarks have shown it beating out the Snapdragon S4 Pro time and time again. The CPU supports up to 2GB of RAM, HSPA+, 16MP rear-facing cameras, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. It is said to also be great at optimizing battery life. The new Nexus 7, judging from its predecessor, shall be an outstanding device as well.

You honestly think supporting live TV is straying away from their main business? Think about it...Sooner or later, Intel will have to support live TV in the chips. Live tv affects their business! If they don't support it and nvidia does or arm chips does than that would be at a major disadvantage! They have to live TV. TV will be as pervasive as youtube is right now. You think live tv can be done thru software only...baloney! Intel needs to support live TV in their chips for the future of their business! In the future all PCs will support Live TV...do you not agree with that?

The set top boxes got him excited last month and he asked me if it was a good time to buy. I told him yes but don't expect to see 30 this year. Recently I wrote him back and said "Yes, this is the time to buy." There were a few things that caught my attention . The first was the rather weak showing of ARM at CES this year. There was nothing wrong with anything they were showing, but for the first time in the past few years there wasn't that one phone/tablet that stood out. and made us excited for what's to come this year. The second sign was the fact that the word "Intel" kept coming up more and more when the press talked about ARM. If Intel truly sucks out loud when it comes to mobile why bring up the name constantly? The third thing was the new Samsung Gallery S4. ARMH must love it, they get royalties on each core. The big little concept didn't work that well with the Nexus 7 as people complained that the battery would be dead in a day. I am skeptical about how well it works in the real world. And without say Warren East leaving his post at the ARMH propaganda machine speaks volumes as to what is really going on. The last piece is that anti Intel propaganda is on overdrive. Someone posted the other day in a Yahoo article that the cheaper CPU's will bring down profitability tor Intel. Is that the best they've got? The arguments are growing louder as they are getting weaker. All it will take is a few good pieces of news, and a couple of good quarters and Intel will bring it's P/E back up to 15 or higher. When Intel gets a new CEO it will be even better, especially if it's a guy who can defend Intel in the media. Now is a great time to buy.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364069982524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 16:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364071041272-36</Id><Topic><Title>Entering the era of the longs</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364069982524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 16:19:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"ARM.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Intel should be working much harder to get its new SoC's inside new SmartTVs and other consumer devices and working harder to offer services in conjunction WITH cable companies. Unfortunately this is not the plan Intel is implementing. Intel's Web TV intends to offer its dedicated box and Over-The-Top service directly to consumers. Occasional movie streaming is tolerated today by cable companies but 24x7 live TV streaming to multiple TV's in a household in a completely different animal and is likely to trigger a response by cable operators unfavorable to Intel's plan. Intel's plan is further complicated by the fact that cable companies enjoy enormous unfair advantage when it comes to selling a service that relies on cable infrastructure. As it pertains to Intel's Web TV, cable companies can raise the price of Internet service to Intel's Web TV customers for all extra data they use streaming live TV while the same cable company can offer consumers a service that functions just like Intel's and not charge extra for the data. You may say this is unfair and uncompetitive. It is not a level playing field but that is the regulation that exists today. The problem with Intel's plan is not that they want to get inside the living room or have their chips streaming live TV, the problem is that they control none of the critical resources necessary to deliver this service, the playing field is highly skewed to the cable operators and if the cable operators want to compete against Intel's service they have a built-in advantage they control. So the question is not about getting x86 inside consumer devices, its about the wisdom of THIS plan to get there.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364071920087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 16:52:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364072217689-38</Id><Topic><Title>“WinRT is teetering on the brink of extinction,” Moorhead says</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364061858901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 14:04:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows RT never has, nor will it ever, make any commercial sense, especially if I can purchase an X86 tablet with similar/better performance/watt for the same price.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1364072217689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 16:56:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364073831582-39</Id><Topic><Title>“WinRT is teetering on the brink of extinction,” Moorhead says</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364061858901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 14:04:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Microsoft wants to create an iPad class tablet, it would have to be ARM based. The problem is, they don't have a clue what it takes to compete with the iPad. If they did, they would have come out with it first. Apple invented the genre.
