Wong, who has an Outperform rating on Intel shares, and a $28 to $33 “valuation range,” thinks a formal announcement at the show will this week, perhaps tomorrow. He notes that while there’s been no official press release, “Intel has updated its ARK website with 37 ‘launched’ Haswell products (16 desktop products, 8 mobile products, and 13 Denlow 1-way server products).” Wong expects to see announcements of products in various categories using Haswell, and also some tablet computers running Google‘s (GOOG) Android OS on top of Intel’s “Clover Trail+” family of mobile processors. Note that Samsung Electronics (005930KS) this morning announced tablets with Intel chips.

The iconic American PC maker, which also faces an jittery future with founder Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners offering a buyout, gave this blog a preview of its XPS 11, the result of a five-month partnership with Intel INTC +3.89% to install a “full performance” processor for two-in-ones: small laptops that fold up into a tablet. The tool that measures less than 15 millimeters high and weighs about 2.5 pounds, both record lows, will sell worldwide from the fourth quarter of 2013, Dell computing products Vice President Kirk Schell says. Screen resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 would also be the sharpest of any two-in-one. Its two-in-one reflects Dell’s staunch focus on PCs as well as a push to diversify. “We believe we have the best two-in-one device, and that is a very cool category for people who want to do consumption but also do real work,” Schell said in an interview before the annual Computex Taipei, one of the world’s biggest tech shows.

Writes Mobley, The news Intel has finally landed a tier-one tablet design win could take a bite out of ARM’s share price, a stock that trades at 43.0x fwd-12-month non-GAAP EPS estimates (consensus). The Samsung announcement confirms earlier reports from Reuters last week and Android.OS a few weeks which both speculated on such a design win for Intel. Since those reports from began to surface over the past 11 days, ARM’s share price has declined approximately 12%.

However, the royalty rate per unit ARM fetches from tablet processors is 5.0x-6.0x that of the corporate average, meaning tablet- related (tablet processor only) royalty revenue represents approximately 10%-15% of ARM PD revenue, or 5%-10% of total revenue.

It had to keep raising the bar so that each time a two year cell phone contract expired people couldn't wait to get the latest ARM SoC based smartphone. That's it. When they first caught sight of Intel in their rear view mirror a couple of years ago (which they swore would never happen) they should have been all in making sure that the fabrication crises was minimized. Instead of fixing things they relied on fairy tales and press releases to make their company look like it was beating Intel at its own game. What we got instead was the law of diminishing returns. The more cores they threw into their processors the less it seemed to matter. Their technical innovations are no longer new, and consumers grew weary of record high phone contracts. iPhone is no longer the #1 selling phone in the world and if it wasn't for the iPad mini the iPad sales would be in decline. Even with over $100 billion somewhere in the world and a thousand full time SoC engineers Apple can't seem to master it's domain. It looked so promising just a year or two ago. In house boutique processors. Why pay the Intel tax? The Intel tax went to world class R&amp;D . Intel has been scorned for wanting 60% GTM. When the pennies are all counted for ARM who got more than their fare share in the fabless model? Perhaps if ARMH and TSMC had an extra $20 billion each out of Apple's war chest things would look a bit different today?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370322874788</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 01:14:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370323668259-10</Id><Title>margin call day broker see melt down!</Title><Msg>18.00</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1370323668259</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 01:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370324812061-11</Id><Topic><Title>Antitrust concerns</Title><Username>kip_castle</Username><Timestamp>1370290171252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 16:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't realize Intel was keeping FinFet a secret.</Msg><Username>resu0ouf</Username><Timestamp>1370324812061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 01:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370325422267-12</Id><Topic><Title>Antitrust concerns</Title><Username>kip_castle</Username><Timestamp>1370290171252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 16:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Since Intel is poised to dominate all processor markets with its superior products shouldn't they share their FinFet/3D technology with Qualcom, Taiwan Semiconductor and AMD?

Intel possibly shipped 1 million units. The tablet market is expected to grow 45% to 200 million units. Intel has now secured the world No.2 tablet maker, in their top tier product. Intel said to have secured at least another 20 tablet wins from other world manufacturers. Translation, feature for feature, Apple iPad without adopting intel inside will be left for dead. Intel could conceivably with of without Apple be the processor in say conservatively 15% of the tablets shipping later this year. That's a conservative 30 million units, or intel tablet growth rate of 3000%. PC market is expected to stay at least 335 million units, with some expectation of growth. Where is the growth going to come from? PC refresh, Tablet gain in market share, sustained Server growth, phone wins, and software group which really hasn't been considered fairly by analyst. Intel's first attack in the tablet space, is by far more lucrative and damaging to it's competitors. Samsung already acknowledge the key to their tablet growth and success is SECURING the key components in order to deliver the product in quantity and quality. Apple is only interested in maximising their profits, LOL, be it supplied by their fiercest competitor.

Intel showed off a fanless tablet, based on its new ultra-low-power 6W Haswell parts, showed off tablets and ultrabooks with the the new integrated Iris (HD 5000) graphics, and confirmed that, with Bay Trail, it’s marching into the Android tablet market. Intel’s keynote began by outlining the current state of the personal computing market. In short, after a brief period of miniaturization (smartphones, netbooks), we are now moving towards devices that getting bigger and giving you more for your money. Smartphones are getting larger, and tablets are regularly being slotted into keyboards to improve productivity. “The two-in-one era: we believe this is the new normal,” said Intel’s sales and marketing bigwig, Tom Kilroy. Intel, with its Merrifield SoC for smartphones, and Bay Trail and Haswell chips for tablets/two-in-one transformers, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this shift — if Intel is correct about such a shift, anyway. Just in case we weren’t all aware, Intel also highlighted the monumental shift in our content consumption habits, too. Every day on the internet, consumers spend three times longer watching videos on Hulu than at the cinema. He doesn’t cite Netflix, which is a shame as it completely dwarfs Hulu. In both cases, content is often streamed to smartphones and tablets, which stresses the importance of the mobile radios and hardware playback of high-res video to reduce power consumption.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370350207721</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:50:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370350243803-29</Id><Topic><Title>Intel unveils Merrifield smartphones, Bay Trail Android tablets, and fanless Haswell</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370350207721</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:50:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which leads us neatly onto the Merrifield (smartphone) and Bay Trail (tablet) SoCs. Powered by the new 22nm Silvermont CPU core — the first new Atom architecture in five years — both SoCs will offer “3x more peak performance, or 5x lower power.” We don’t have any real benchmarks to refer to yet, but it certainly sounds like Merrifield and Bay Trail will compare favorably against the latest ARM-based Snapdragon, Exynos, and Tegra SoCs. Paired with Bay Trail (and probably Merrifield, too), Intel also unveiled the XMM 7160, its first multi-mode 2G/3G/4G LTE-capable modem with global roaming capabilities. The slides also mention that Merrifield will pick up Sensor Hub, a technology suite that Intel first developed for ultrabooks, but which is apparently making the jump to its smartphone platform. Sensor Hub is essentially a clever way for the smartphone to continuously use its sensors (GPS, gyros, etc.) without consuming large amounts of power. As with Medfield, Intel will show off a Merrifield-based, designed-in-house smartphone at Mobile World Congress in February 2014 — hopefully with 4G LTE. We’re almost certain that there will be a Bay Trail-based Android reference design, too, which should ship before the end of the year — again, with 4G LTE. On stage, Intel demoed a Bay Trail prototype streaming 4K video over an LTE connection. With LTE and SoCs that can keep up with ARM, will Intel finally wade into the US market?

ARM executives also see a place for their SoCs in the data center—where Intel is the primary chip vendor—for its designs, particularly for low-power microservers.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1370350249321</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:50:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370350318308-31</Id><Topic><Title>Intel unveils Merrifield smartphones, Bay Trail Android tablets, and fanless Haswell</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370350207721</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:50:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moving back to Haswell, this morning Intel also unveiled its dual-core, mobile-oriented Haswell parts. As the complete list of SKUs had already leaked, there aren’t really any surprises in the lineup. For the most part, these chips are the same as their quad-core desktop brethren, just with half the cores. The most exciting chips are the Core i7-4650U, which is equipped with the new Intel Iris (HD 5000) GPU, and the Core i5-4200Y, which hits an SDP (see slide for explanation) of just 6W. There’s no price on the i5 part, but the i7 with fancy graphics will cost a rather dear $454. The Iris-enabled mobile parts should see a performance boost of around 25% over Ivy Bridge’s integrated GPU. Gaming with integrated graphics just became a reality, basically. It sounds like this fall will be full of two-in-one designs, featuring low-power Haswell chips in the tablet, and some kind of keyboard-and-battery docking station. Perhaps most excitingly, Intel showed off a fanless Haswell tablet, but unfortunately didn’t give us any details (it was probably the 6W Core i5 part). Between Bay Trail and Haswell, though, it’s clear that there will be some very powerful Intel-powered tablets and ultrabooks this year.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370350318308</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:51:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370350467502-32</Id><Topic><Title>X-Gene™.

Funny how the higher Dow shuts him up. Face it teabaggers, things are going better now and are indeed looking great for Intel. NO--the world is not coming to an end. America is not going broke. I do not care how much golf the Pres plays. He can play Golf everyday and laugh as his drones blow up our enemies. He can say he is a LIB and cry but then go Kill enemies like Osama bid dead. Mean time--do you realize that North America has plenty of oil now? The fracking has opened up Texas and North Dakota and they are pumping more oil each day. If you include the oil being pumped from Canada and Mexico, the USA will be completely independent from Middle east and African oil imports in just 3 more years. You say why should that matter? We buy oil from Canada and Mexico and that is still imports. Well years but Canada and Mexico buy our things and so when they get richer, it helps us too. But our oil production is going to likely combine with new fuel efficiency in cars to make America completely 100% oil efficient to our own oil by 2020. Obummer is President while this goes on. Intel will retake the crown of tech god as it shrinks to 14 nm and smaller. Those tech jobs and exports come from America for the most part. Two wars will be completely over soon as we withdraw from Afghanistan. The deficit will on a yearly basis will be gone in 5 years. Healthcare will be popular.

Right now, I don't take you seriously either. But me, like your friends, have to demonstrate that you are knowledgeable and are thoughtful enough to formulate your theory. A copy/paste of my last response to your copy/paste .... Hmmm. Lets see .. .. You talked to some friends about a LIBOR manipulation 2 years before it became public. They did not take you seriously. When your story became public, you gained credibility. Makes sense. I can understand why your friends responded to you the way they did. If you gave them as much information as you have disclosed here, your friends were acting quite responsibly. I want to understand what you are saying but your logic does not make sense to me. This reply of yours does not add any more information. How about a little information about your derivative story? You say "look at the tell tale signs" .... what signs? You say "stagnation in the major indices" .... by what metric are you using for conclusion? You say this happens "when large derivative players are shifting their positions" ... how do you measure that? How can you tell they are "moving their money" so I can look for a cause and effect relationship you suggest? Warren Buffet plays derivatives through his insurance businesses but those are either reinsured or hedged. The credit default swaps clearinghouse does not show any unusual activity. What specifically are you looking at that makes you so fearful. Where, for example, do you think that Buffett is unhedged?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370355783887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 10:23:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370355850809-81</Id><Title>where can i get short info? 238M Apr 15. 233m Apr 30 224m May 15.</Title><Msg>Are the May 31 numbers out yet?

This is one of my assumptions that lead me to say that Intel will generally move with the market but have a stronger RSI and at times appear OVERBOUGHT on the technical indicators. There is no way you can "hide" people buying (covering) 1mil shares per day. The historical levels of short interest 3 years ago was in the 50 to 70 mill share range. That might have been affected by INVERSE ETF positions but I estimate that there is an extra 150m shares short that normally should not be.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370357900833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 10:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370358011068-104</Id><Title>This price is unsustainable</Title><Msg>It will finish red today.

The price ramp is not sustainable. Intel as part of every market index is also part of every market index ETF. The ETFs account for about half of Intel volume. Intel will move with the market and have a slightly stronger RSI. Of the 48 brokers issuing opinions on Intel, 24 are HOLD, 6 are UNDER PERFORM and 1 is SELL. There is substantial probability that some of those 31 of 48 brokers will upgrade their view. GS Covello is a $16 target SELL and he will have to do something to escape his embarrassment.

The dotcom distortion, the 2009 EU settlement effect on earnings, ... all put a negative shadow on INTC. IMO, one of the goals of the Intel buy back program was not to LIFT THE PRICE but to SCULPT THE CHART to make it look better for the chart readers. Intel took a multiple hits during the 2000 decade. It started with the dotcom bubble. Then mid-decade with the financial collapse that whacked all their customers. Their fast CPU stretched out the replacement cycle. Now, the planets are lining up on the other side and IMO, buying pressure is accumulating. Form factor changes will generate a leap in productivity and cost savings.

Intel's TriGate SoC is now superior - all the doubters Intel is way behind in SoC are wrong - it also bodes well for Intel foundry bizz going after mixed signal (MSCC!) Intel’s Haswell puts more analog inside Rick Merritt 6/4/2013 2:00 AM EDT SAN JOSE, Calif. – An interview with a trio of senior Intel microprocessor designers provides a few details and raises more questions about the company’s latest move into analog design. Intel designed an on-chip voltage regulator and external inductors to support it for Haswell, its next-generation x86. What’s not clear is to what extent the work is driving the digital giant into more design of analog components and processes. Haswell has two power rails coming into its package compared to six for Ivy Bridge, its prior generation CPU. Inside the Haswell package, Intel splits up the two rails into as many as 12. The Haswell package includes 20 or more Intel-designed inductors, one for each phase of each power rail. The inductors, like the on-die voltage regulator, are Intel made parts, replacing what used third-party analog parts on the motherboard outside the package. “We save on board real estate, increase our headroom for turbo modes and get more fine grained control of power,” said Per Hammarlund, a chief SoC architect at Intel. The move shaves $2-$10 off the motherboard bill of materials, depending on what version of Haswell OEMs are using. The chip will come in versions targeting tablets, notebooks, desktops and servers.... for complete story see EE times</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1370361603723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 12:00:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370361671741-139</Id><Title>astounding number of invisible (ignored) posts today</Title><Msg>The price performance today is like opening up a wall of an old derelict house and seeing it "come alive" with a million ants.</Msg><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1370361671741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 12:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370362634012-140</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370237011973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't think so, but wait and see!</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370362634012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 12:17:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370363281305-141</Id><Topic><Title>ASUS MeMo Pad FHD10 WITH CLOVERTRAIL+</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1370248374121</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 04:32:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree great looking 10.1" tablet from Asus.

Do you think that the GPU might be contributing to the heat? The MSI gaming laptop comes in various configurations of GPU. They have NVDA too. The one with the "heat problem" likely had an NVDA GPU in it also. Neither of these appear to be a Haswell problem. Both are form factor changes from the manufacturers who have downsized their gaming machines into Ultrabook style form factors. Are you sure these are the ones with Haswell power problems? The Razer Blade is the thinnest, lightest gaming laptop we've ever seen. ltrThat’s right, the new Razer Blade laptop, announced at a special Thursday press event in San Francisco, is no longer the 17-inch behemoth we once knew and (mostly) loved. That old model has been renamed the Razer Blade Pro to make room for the new Razer Blade, a 14-inch gaming machine with 8GB of RAM, an upgradeable 128 GB SSD, a discrete Nvidia GTX 765M GPU and a “fourth-generation” (read: Haswell) Intel CPU packed into an aluminum body that’s barely two-thirds of an inch thick.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370371070148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 14:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370371524910-173</Id><Topic><Title>LOOK INTC is already going lower, WOW going to give all them gains back.

A copy/paste of my last response to your copy/paste .... Hmmm. Lets see .. .. You talked to some friends about a LIBOR manipulation 2 years before it became public. They did not take you seriously. When your story became public, you gained credibility. Makes sense. I can understand why your friends responded to you the way they did. If you gave them as much information as you have disclosed here, your friends were acting quite responsibly. I want to understand what you are saying but your logic does not make sense to me. This reply of yours does not add any more information. How about a little information about your derivative story? You say "look at the tell tale signs" .... what signs? You say "stagnation in the major indices" .... by what metric are you using for conclusion? You say this happens "when large derivative players are shifting their positions" ... how do you measure that? How can you tell they are "moving their money" so I can look for a cause and effect relationship you suggest? Warren Buffet plays derivatives through his insurance businesses but those are either reinsured or hedged. The credit default swaps clearinghouse does not show any unusual activity. What specifically are you looking at that makes you so fearful. Where, for example, do you think that Buffett is unhedged?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1370394057151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 21:00:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370394284452-209</Id><Topic><Title>time to take some profit folks.....</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1370393370509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 20:49:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"don't be greey" buddy don't be stupid.,INTC hasn't begun to go up yet &amp; IMO is so undervalued compared to the rest of it's peers it's absurd.............</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1370394284452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 21:04:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370395767780-210</Id><Topic><Title>This will seal the deal</Title><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1370391535217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 20:18:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, look at this, here's something else Intel is doing that not too long ago on this very board ARM fans said would never happen.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370395767780</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 21:29:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370396362247-211</Id><Title>Intel has finally made a large indentation into mobile market</Title><Msg>A new family of chips, their own foundry, microprocessor expertise, and a new determination has propelled Intel into a lead in all parts of the microprocessor world including low power and mobile.

It was really something that GetanID61 brought up quite some time ago. "All the world's money is going into ARM." Well, he was right, to some extent. The problem was, that in the big picture Apple kept too much of the profits. ARM and Intel is like the cold war all over again. Intel simply outspent ARM in R&amp;D and manufacturing excellence. ARM had nearly 100% market share, a monopoly of tablet and smartphones. The problem was that they had licenses beating on each other to take down the price on the SOC. They left too much money on the table. Yes ARMH gets a royalty on each ARM core sold, but it still didn't mean much. They were too small to put up a good battle against Intel's R&amp;D machine. The real alarm sounded when Intel showed a couple of years ago that for every 122 smartphones sold Intel sold a server and made more profit on the one server than ARM made on the 122 processors. The next clue was when TSMC went to charging by the wafer, not the good processors on 28nm. This means their cost structure couldn't absorb the cost of fixing yield issues. As you may recall in 2009 and then again 2010 they said they fixed yield issues on 40nm. And now they are going to breeze in to finfet at 16nm in a couple of years. If they didn't have the money with nearly 100% market share to pay to fix yield issues at 28nm what are they going to do when they get to 20nm and 16nm? Keep in mind Intel will not only be at 14nm, but will be at 450mm wafers. Even with a GTM in excess of 60% ARM really hasn't seen pricing pressure like Intel will inflict. I dare say that TSMC will never see the day that they can afford to make a 16nm SoC in sufficient yields. Because by that time all the world's money will be flowing to Intel.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1370397723457</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 22:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370399478581-214</Id><Topic><Title>Shills Continue to Look Unsuccessfully for an Issue, Any Issue</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370372640657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:04:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a very exciting post. I have to defer to others (like you and Ashraf and Russ and Cincinnatus and Cube Monkey and Fidgewinkel) when it comes to understanding the tech. There's a saying that goes "I don't want to own a company that has to have a prayer session before it can raise prices" and I'm hoping Intel's superior technology one day translates into pricing muscle and swagger. I was encouraged to see the prices of Haswell chips looking beefy. Moore's law doesn't come cheap. At the beginning of 2009, Intel had 84,000 employees and today there are 105,000. Fortunately, net income per employee has gone from $63,000 to $104,000 over that span. I'm hoping to see employees hit 200,000 and per employee net income also hit $200,000 in about five years. That would be $40 billion net income and I acknowledge there is no way to get there unless Intel has the world's nuts in a vice.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1370399478581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 22:31:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370401862263-215</Id><Topic><Title>46k in 2 months? net PROFIT</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1366433177700</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 00:46:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there the best</Msg><Username>tellerjimmy</Username><Timestamp>1370401862263</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 23:11:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370403566032-216</Id><Topic><Title>Shills Continue to Look Unsuccessfully for an Issue, Any Issue</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1370372640657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:04:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>intel_fanboy, Beautiful post.

Firstly the measured power of both Ivy Bridge and Haswell is under all conditions less than Sandy Bridge so there is no power wattage problem. Yet Computerbase measured 51c, 57c, 67c for Sandy, Ivy and Haswell respectively. computerbaseDOTde/artikel/prozessoren/2013/intel-haswell-prozessor-fuer-desktop-pcs-im-test/17/ Why is that ? Well, temperature goes up as wattage goes up and die area decreases. Sandy Bridge has a larger die area but it burns more watts so all three cores should still be in the same range so why are they not ? Well, with the intro of Ivy Bridge the fluxless solder which has a tremendous heat dissipation of 80W/mK was substituted as the thermal conduit to the IHS by a cheap standard TIM paste with a thermal dissipation 1/20 of the solder i.e. 20 times less efficient ! A website removed this standard paste and replaced it with the best market alternatives and found temperatures drops of around 20% ! Frankly this is an unnecessary own goal by Intel and the two idiots who thought of it and ok'd it should both be fired as it undoes the efforts of the architecture team to keep wattage under control. In fact if they are going to go this cheap false economy route, remove the IHS altogether and just leave the die naked as in the old 1990s dies and let the OEMs do all the cooling rather than handicap them before they start. At least then some could do their own better solutions. This was a cost cut too far !! hexusDOTnet/tech/news/cpu/39369-intel-cuts-corners-ivy-bridge-thermal-interface-material-tim/</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370404710134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 23:58:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
