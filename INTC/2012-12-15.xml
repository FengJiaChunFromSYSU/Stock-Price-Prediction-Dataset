The NRA, they say, has already received a hefty cash infusion from the Koch donor network this year, enabling the 4 million-member pro-gun behemoth to expand voter registration and get-out-the vote drives. I just don't understand WHY semi automatic / assault rifles can be sold to anybody - don't get it though the margins/profits are probably astronomical. (I own a Marlin 30/30 which once in a while I use to get rid of rattle snakes). I don't believe Jefferson et al had semiautomatic guns in mind when drafting/creating the constitution.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1355549588427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 00:33:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355549843369-2</Id><Topic><Title>20 dead kids: Thank you GOP!</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1355520131118</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 16:22:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Flumoxed just congratulated Flumoxed as he forgot to change ID's.

Desktop and laptop chipsets account for another 13.5%. Since laptops account for 34% of Intel, 2/3 of the chipset is driven by laptops. Total of 20% desktop and 39% for laptops. They have been a shrinking part of Intel for some years. Right behind laptop CPU is server CPU. Servers have gone from 0% to 23% in a decade. The Intel s1200 will provide some protection to the bottom end servers and an areas of growth for a time. They have added an ATOM section and that will be increasing rapidly and accelerate. Intel has shown demos of integrated voltage regulators, LTE, WiFi and other nice functions. The Intel strength is in integrating this into on package to lower the manufacturing and operating cost. CES this year will be fun. What has hurt the stock has been a relentless campaign to label Intel as a desktop PC company. A group of analysts (notably ... James Covello and Romit Shah) have conducted a rating and target price war on Intel.

I used to just laugh to myself at the stupidity of our efforts to stop terrorists by concentrating on aircraft. Any idiots with assault rifles could kill 500 to 1000 people in 5 to 10 minutes at any crowded place in our nation. there is NO way of stopping it other than trying to find out their plans ahead of time. This young mass murder American man simply drove up to a school, kicked in the door, and walked into a class room and started shooting. The only reason he did not kill another 100 or more is what? I guess he might have had a moment of sanity and realized what he had done and then he shot himself. But he could have killed a lot more. Now imagine a group of men entering any school. You see? AND--if the bad guys in other nations did not think about this already, they surely will now. I would like to think, that even terrorists in other nations would find it very low to target children but who knows. Where was Home Land Security here? AND--the media tells the nuts all over our own nation how do do the same now. Looks like Mom pulled him out of school in or just after his Freshmen year. There were problems for sure. Mom is to blame for this wreck. Imagine keeping a nut in your house and he kills you and then children. The young man needed serious help and she just isolated him and let him go down down down. The family failed, the health community failed and the community failed to take care of him and they all paid for the failure. Unfortunately little nice kids and brave teachers paid with their lives for the failure of our system--Health.</Msg><Username>amdroadkilldec2009</Username><Timestamp>1355620537488</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:15:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355621994739-35</Id><Title>In Lighter news..... the new Domino's Pan Pizza is a masterpiece</Title><Msg>Blows Pizza Hut away!</Msg><Username>ikeclanton_outlaw</Username><Timestamp>1355621994739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:39:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355622146456-36</Id><Topic><Title>Now can we all see how futile Home Land Security is?</Title><Username>amdroadkilldec2009</Username><Timestamp>1355620537488</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:15:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you're placing an unfair burden of guilt on people,nobody is to blame really you can only prepare &amp; do so much,nobody can predict the actions of any mentally unbalanced person let alone a so called sane one, as long as we live in a free society.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1355622146456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:42:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355623074966-37</Id><Title>So off the fiscal cliff we go.

There is also rumor (semiaccurate) of a Haswell Ultra ULV lineup.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355628230869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 22:23:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355629790099-41</Id><Title>Bob Mansfield of Apple</Title><Msg>Bob Mansfield now heads the new Technologies group; basically the brains behind all new Apple products. Interesting history with Bob. He started at Apple in 1999 when Apple acquired Raycer Graphics. In 2005, he formally took over the Mac hardware division, right around the time of Apple's transition to Intel. He was instrumental in bringing the Macbook Air into the market. From 2006 to 2009, Apple tripled the number of Mac units sold thanks to this transition to Intel. In 2010, Mansfield took control of the iPhone and iPad hardware as well. In June of this year it was announced that Mansfield would be retiring. But in August, it was announced that Bob would remain with Apple, as head of Technologies group, working on "future projects" (wikipedia). It's been reported in the press that his promotion to head the Technologies group meant that Apple was transitioning from Intel to ARM processors. But it seems to me that Bob has quite a successful history with Intel. What could the "future projects" be? and why was it so important for Tim Cook to convince Bob to come out of retirement?</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355629790099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 22:49:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355632401020-42</Id><Title>I like this post</Title><Msg>investorshubDOTadvfnDOMcom/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=82510980</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355632401020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 23:33:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355632463022-43</Id><Topic><Title>I like this post</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355632401020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 23:33:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oops..should be the following replace DOT with . investorshubDOTadvfnDOTcom/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=82510980</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1355632463022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 23:34:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
