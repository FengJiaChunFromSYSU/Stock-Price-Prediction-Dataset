In this latest one he confuses royalty and licence revenues and thinks ARM 64 bit is just an ISA extension. He also skips over important changes in the IP world, such as the (sad) demise of MIPS, ARM's main competitor in the CPU IP space. The end of MIPS happened with the rise of the ARM's share price over the last few months (which is a better argument than his East speaks view). MIPS also gives us an idea of what ARM's IP assets are worth (it's patents) and more importantly it's sped up the adoption of the new ARM 64 ISA with architecture licences from key MIPS customers, Broadcom and Cavium. He also skips over other important aspects of ARM's business such as the physical IP business (Artisan) and what this means for the future. I may share his ARM 'overvalued' view, but the reality is that the bulk of his arguments are flawed.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1360835337966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 04:48:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360846875176-2</Id><Topic><Title>61% Downside Ahead For ARM Holdings As Lofty Expectations Meet Harsh Reality</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360810975782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:02:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the same Ashraf that has an astronomical target price of 23 this year on Intel so he can get out of his trade.

Bloomberg doesn't say when Intel hired them nor how long the contract has been in place. They do not say where Intel is in the search process. Hiring a search firm is part of the due diligence of the BOD. The retirement of Paul Otellini was a surprise and maybe the BOD just wants to be sure that they get the right person.

They don't want it to succeed." I would disagree with you. In fact, I expect that ARM, Apple and the low power leap that we have seen in the last couple of years has given Intel the new vision that they searched for during the Barrett years. Barrett continued the bigger is better, higher price is better, .... development (Itanium). Intel blew the Apple design win because the Apple account team at Intel did not meet the customer needs. Intel has put in place the leading edge fab capacity and protective IP to integrate the whole CPU, cache, memory subsystems into a single chip (possibly an MCM). The VTR, radios, memory and all the other subsystems will be integrated into a primary product. They will then build custom variations for large customers which will probably be fused versions of the main design. Anyone who thinks that Intel will approach business today like they did yesterday will surprised and please/disappointed (depending on their investments). Bay Trail is the future business model, not a blip.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1360849935451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:52:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360850858942-8</Id><Topic><Title>61% Downside Ahead For ARM Holdings As Lofty Expectations Meet Harsh Reality</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360810975782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:02:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is it more than that ?

Although he didn't reveal what Intel's brand will look like or what its set-top box will be called, he gave us a lot of info about Intel's new service. Some people, like fellow contributor Dana Blankenhorn, are already disappointed and believe that Intel's foray into the world of television will most likely be a failure. I take a more optimistic view and I believe that this has the potential to be such big a success for Intel as the iPhone was for Apple. The Service The new service will be essentially a cloud based TV that plans to replace your cable or satellite subscription. However you'll still have to buy channel bundles. Mr. Huggers ruled out an "à la carte" TV which means that you won't be able to cherry pick the channels you like the most. However, he said there will be a more flexible bundle system which means that customers may be able to customize their channel bundles either by adding channels they want to some "mandatory" selections or they may be able to pick whatever they like as long as they pick a minimum number of channels. The service will provide customers with live TV, an on-line archive of every program that was aired and a variety of on-demand content. The Device Mr. Huggers stated that because there is no device or platform able to offer the experience Intel wants to offer, the company decided to create an electronic device that will change the way we use TVs and make it as intuitive as the iPad's user interface. One feature that this TV box will have, is a camera whose job is to monitor TV users and adjust the proposed content along with their preferences. It will enable a "user account" experience to our household TV. When dad sits down to watch, the TV box will propose football games, comedy shows or whatever he usually watches. However, when the kids sit to watch TV it will propose the latest Disney cartoons or other shows for children. On the revenue side, this feature will allow for highly personalized advertising and content-targeting benefiting both content creators and advertisers. Various Details Mr. Huggers also revealed various other details. The service is intended to expand over time and be available across all platforms and devices. He also said that the will use a video codec that will be at least 50% better than H.264, helping consumers to stay well below the data caps wireless carriers have put in place. He also said that the box will be upgraded continually, unlike the set-top boxes that exist today. Execution The most critical element for this web TV to work is execution. Intel has assembled a high-quality team with marketing people from Apple, supply chain experts from Jabra, home media specialists from Microsoft's Xbox division and so on. One of the most promising things Mr. Huggers said is that they work with everyone. If Intel manages to deal and co-operate with the majority of content providers, then it would have an extremely big lead over the next guy who may try to compete. Keep in mind however that mistakes will happen at the beginning. However, if they are small and manageable they won't pose a problem to Intel's market share growth. After all, even Apple's first iPhone needed major improvements when it was first launched. Financial Impact As Mr. Huggers said, this won't be a value play but a quality one. That means that the device won't be cheap. Now let's assume that the TV box will cost $150 and that the subscription fee will be around $150 per month or $1,800 per year. (click to enlarge) Assuming that Intel will manage to seduce just 10% of the households with cable or satellite TV, it will end up with 9.5 million subscribers. That's $17.1 billion of new recurring revenue plus a one-time revenue of $1.4 billion from box sales. For intel that would be a 32% increase in revenue and 20% increase in net income, assuming a 15% net profit margin. Now picture a 30% market share scenario and you'll immediately understand just how big this venture's potential are for Intel. This is something to just keep in mind about Intel. I wouldn't suggest acting on it until we have more detailed information or the actual product is launched.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360861692776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:08:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360861767693-37</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Is About To Change Our TVs Just Like Apple Changed Our Smartphones</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360861692776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:08:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Some people, like fellow contributor Dana Blankenhorn, are already disappointed and believe that Intel's foray into the world of television will most likely be a failure.

I would bet against this thing but, as I say, most all of us missed out on the Apple story when it went into new things. I however do like that Intel is attempting to get directly into retail with sales of its products. I heard that Intel will use another company name when selling this TV BOX system, but it will be fully Intel owned with another name. A separate branch of Intel. Looks like everyone is going to go against Apple using the Apple playbook. Seems to me that Intel will have a distinct advantage in price of the boxes and of the quality. I see that Comcast is working with Intel so there you go. Perhaps things will surprise us yet.

Will this be effective solution? That remains to be seen. Clearly, Intel put that camera in the box to monitor family members watching TV and sell off that data to advertisers and anyone else willing to pay for the data. The money Intel would making selling your personal viewing behavior is built in to their business model for this product. If one disables the camera, does the monthly cost to the user increase to make up for the lost revenue? Everyone must realize that one can be uniquely identified by a photograph and matching one's viewing habits to a specific individual, home address, etc. is even more valuable information to sell. Does Intel really think its a good idea to sell the viewing habits or images of a ten year old child watching TV to any third party willing to pay? Even with a disable option, it is quite frankly apalling Intel would even consider this plan seriously enough to build the capability into the box and only provide the disable feature because of consumer disgust. If an Intel board member doesn't have the maturity to intervene on this project I am quite confident one or more members of Congress will.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360867483399</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:44:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360867638295-59</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone have a timeline when Intel reaches $100?</Title><Username>harrydick836</Username><Timestamp>1360862885390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:28:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yhoo seriously needs to get control of their boards,&amp; the only way to do so is to impliment a one alias/person perod so spam artists/ jerkoffs like nuff wouldn't stink up the boards i'm tired of having to ignore all the sewage just to get a decent financial discussion.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1360867638295</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:47:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360868426735-60</Id><Topic><Title>camera in my tv box</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1360860065041</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:41:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes congress will want intc to give them the info too. or at least access to it.

I believe that this was the thing that Steve Jobs had his eye on. Had he lived a couple more years I believe that Jobs was the vision to take on the cable companies and go for content directly from the networks. This would have bypassed cable and satellite. In my opinion, the main problem is that the cable companies own their boxes. Have you been around when they are installed? My FIOS box needed authorization from Verizon to be installed. If you ask them I'm sure they would say "we do this to ensure a quality experience" when in reality they simply don't want third part vendors selling boxes to us directly My question is how will this work? Will this be yet another box you can rent from your cable company? If so it will most likely be a cable box with an Ethernet port that would both stream cable and IP TV. A nice solution but you'll be spending $5 to $15 a month on a box that the cable company pays $72 for in bulk. The cable boxes are a cash cow for the cable companies. At your house you have the cable come into your home at one point, often near the electrical panel. From here separate cables run to each room in your house. If you were going to place one master DVR/tuner in your house it would have to go here. You would need a somewhat sophisticated little computer system most likely mounted on the inside of your house or garage to act as the brains of the system. For about $4-$6 a month you could rent a cable card and get all your TV channels. The box over your TV would have to tell the your computer near your distribution point to change channels. It would also need to have an eitherent cable plugged into it. Doing all this would mean that you could enjoy your cable plugged into a box over your TV like it is now and get the benefits of TV and IP TV without additional cables. Another solution that I working with now is to use an HD Homerun style box. It takes the TV signal and broadcasts it out over your Ethernet. The good news is you can watch TV on any computer including laptops with wifi. The bad news is that when we want to watch TV on a TV we first have to fire up the XBox, then call up a Windows Media PC to grab the TV signal and point it toward the XBox. It looks fine, I've enjoyed it using a small Atom based PC as the Media Center. The problem is that it takes a minute to fire up the Xbox, so if you want to simply turn on TV quickly, it's not happening. And the cable is out of the equation. Everything uses either Cat 5 cables or wifi. The HD over wifi actually works great as long as your near the router. Or Intel can just do everything over IP, This would mean they would cut out the cable companies. A bold move. They would need to fight for content against the cable companies. Very often for consumer the cable companies are part of the equation when it comes to bringing in internet into the home. My thinking is that Intel doesn't have the market presence to sell directly to the consumer. What makes most sense is that what they will offer are high end rental cable boxes you get from your cable company. The boxes will have Ethernet and wifi along with the direct cable line input. Every other solution will be too complicated for consumers. This may be the one thing that helps keep TV relevant. I think consumers are pulling the plug on cable more and more over time for IP TV.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1360868576609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:02:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360868617502-63</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Is Toast: Here's Why</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not Lucy.

Intel Media boss Erik Huggers, whose unit is in charge of the service, told me on the sidelines of the Dive into Media conference in Dana Point, California this week that the friends and family test began in recent weeks, and that it was one of the reasons for breaking his silence on the project now. Huggers said on stage at the conference Tuesday that his company is building a set-top box that will be fueled by a service that combines live TV, video on demand and a catch-up component similar to the BBC’s iPlayer. U.K. viewers can use the iPlayer to watch anything that aired on the BBC within the last week, and Huggers was in charge of launching the project for the broadcaster. “American audiences have not yet experienced a proper catch-up service,” he told me. Intel Media is preparing to launch the service in the U.S. before the end of the year through a mix of retail partnerships and direct sales to consumers. A lot of details are still under wraps, including the name of the service, the exact programming available, as well as its eventual price. However, Huggers said on Tuesday that his goal was neither complete unbundling nor undercutting cable. “We are not a value play,” he said, adding: “We are a quality play.” There was some backlash Tuesday about Intel’s announcement, namely that the device would come with a camera that would be able to identify viewers and service personalized ads. In talking to me, Huggers tried to put it in perspective by comparing it to other consumer electronics products, asking: “How many millions of homes have a Kinect device?” Of course, one could argue that people might be much less accepting of the Kinect if it was being used to identify individual users and relay that information to Microsoft. Intel Media is run as an independent unit within Intel, overseen by a separate board, and many folks within Intel didn’t even know what the unit was up to until this week. That separation also included a lot of outside hires, and even some cooperation with small, external companies, as we first reported in January. “We are not following the playbook of Intel,” acknowledged Huggers during our interview. “We are trying to do something that is rather left field for Intel.”</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1360869776417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:22:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360870523371-68</Id><Topic><Title>camera in my tv box</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1360860065041</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:41:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Overall, Intel is a super company with great people. However, on this specific product their seems to be an absence of maturity and good judgement and higher management needs to intervene. It would be unfortunate but the spying feature of their web TV product, arguably a nit product only tangential to company's core business could cast a negative light over the rest of the company and the brand. If this Web TV spying feature becomes infamous , and it easily could if this project continues as planned, it would be easy for consumers to believe future Intel Ultrabooks and tablets with built-in cameras would also be spying on its owners for another Intel revenue source. Personally, I don't think the Web TV spying feature is worth the potential negative fallout that it could cause to the rest of the company and its products.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360870523371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:35:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360870838417-69</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Is Toast: Here's Why</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm not Lucy."

There isn't any normal at these nodes. If you actually have any semiconductor work experience, then you didn't learn anything. The ramp curve is slowing for ARM. This is well documented. TSMC had a myriad of problems ramping 28nm. So don't speak of normal to me.

The big difference is the transistor which is FinFET. 14nm products will ship first half of 2015." [Come faster than what? A full-step to 14nm like Intel is currently doing? Faster is meaningless because there is no base line for the 20nm back-end or the 14nm component for any ARM foundry. They haven't done either. Yeah, it will be faster than if they attempted a full 14nm step but they might not be able to do that ever. The jury is still out. Because of all these unknowns, you have no idea when 14nm products will ship or when volume production will occur. If and when it does it will still be just a half-step and it will still be years from now...] "Intel is still struggling with 22nm SoC production. Hopefully lessons will be learned and Intel 14nm will not take as long." [We can be absolutely confident that Intel's curve is going to be hugely faster, better and sooner than that of the ARM foundries.

Apparently this group is run as a quasi-separate entity without Intel's normal management review as the author states, "many folks within Intel didn't even know what the unit was up to until this week". Well, Intel's management needs to get up to speed fast because this group's plan to spy on consumers could create a public relations disaster in a hurry. And Hugger's response to the spying topic compares what they are doing to the Kinect box. Well Kinect box is a completely different product. Some products need a camera to perform their basic function. Videoconferencing gear needs a camera. Kinect box needs a camera to see the game participant's motion, but Intel's Web TV doesn't need a camera at all to stream its programming - it only needs a camera if they intend to video you and your family members package them up with as much personal data as they can grab, and to sell to anyone willing to pay. For the sake of Intel Corporate, it's time for real management to intervene in this rogue project.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360872994352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:16:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360873992834-73</Id><Topic><Title>Intel TV service already being tested by hundreds of users</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1360869776417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:22:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IMO this is very far from being a rogue project, it has been in the making for years,&amp; as far as the camera is concerned,some people like the idea of video conferencing/child screening/show selection/etc. INTC IMO has to much on the ball to let a privacy issue that can be so easily be remedied be the stumbling block,give it a chance.I think if INTC can offer a quality experiance people will want it, time will tell.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1360873992834</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:33:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360875138754-74</Id><Topic><Title>Intel TV service already being tested by hundreds of users</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1360869776417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:22:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Family room video conferencing is fine. However the best location to place a camera for that purpose is on top of the TV. Settop boxes are almost always placed beneath the TV or even lower in a cabinet. Both locations are poor places for videoconferencing. For that matter, if Intel wants to support videoconferencing from its box they only need to include a USB port so one can plug in one of the many USB cameras on the market. The USB camera would also permit placing the camera in the ideal location. The project may have been in the works for a long time but the article above describes how separated the effort is from the rest of the company. Hugger reminds me of so many techies that fail to understand that just because something can be done technically, doesn't mean it should be.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1360875138754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:52:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360875267439-75</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Is Toast: Here's Why</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1360533617964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>[Whatever, butkus.

They certainly buy 20nm equipment - 20nm will have challenges with double patterning.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1360892077646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 20:34:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360892917490-92</Id><Topic><Title>Is TSMC's 28nm high performance process delayed?

TSMC has the LP,and HP processes working OK, but I am not sure of their yields. Copying Intel is tough to do. The 20nm equipment is probably for research. They don't have anyone to copy at 20nm.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1360893307257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 20:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360893459279-95</Id><Topic><Title>Did the GOP teabaggers shut-up yet? pathetic crybaby losers</Title><Username>amdmonkey72</Username><Timestamp>1360861045369</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:57:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't really care about Republitards or Demigods... but then the dollar comes crashing down there's going to be blow flowing in the streets and the welfare loving #$%$ will be crying bloody murder then...</Msg><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1360893459279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 20:57:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360893983204-96</Id><Topic><Title>Is TSMC's 28nm high performance process delayed?

The transistor pitch – essentially the distance between two transistors – in the 22nm tri-gate technology is 80nm, which is the smallest pitch that can be produced using single-pattern lithography, Bohr says. "The next generation, 14," he said, "we're going to have to convert to double patterning to get tighter pitches." Double patterning – as might be obvious – requires an extra step in the lithography process. An extra step – equally obvious – adds extra cost.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1360893983204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 21:06:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360894451585-97</Id><Title>Semiconductor guy - here's why Glofo and Samsung apply hybrid approach</Title><Msg>They can't get both (frontend and backend) done - so they hype the 14nm FinFet frontend: Cost is not the only challenge in moving down to 14nm, Bohr said. For one thing, there's the problem of creating the interconnects in a chip so dense with transistors. "Well, you've got skinnier wires," he said, "and can you get copper stuffed into that shallow trench with good reliability, good performance? We have that challenge." But the interconnect challenge is still on track, he insists. "We're doing it," he said. "I'm confident. I know that we can do this on 14."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1360894451585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 21:14:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360894991019-98</Id><Topic><Title>Wallis Weaver gets GUTTED</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1360875645005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:00:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>22-Feb-12 05:04 pm Two out of every three people receiving stock dividend payments are rich, many totally, incredibly rich and should be paying more taxes instead of us soaking the middle class.
