Fabrication will be the defining factor. Sure the ARM camp is going to develop new products. Gee, that's nice. But it doesn't change the fact that the new products are going to be developed with inferior ARM chips due to their fabrication limitations. There just isn't anything ARM can do about it. 1.) Until now ARM has been able to stay in the fabrication race. But 28nm was both slow to arrive and slow to ramp. Even now production is lackluster in terms of volume. But we hope that the fanbois really like it because all of the experts say that ARM is going to be at 28nm for a very, very, very long time. Did we hear anything different today? Nope. 2.) Intel on the other hand moves to a new process node every 2 years. Like clockwork. No other company on the planet can do this. And now we start to really see the results. Cue the lights because we are going to need them. It's ARMs time to fade to black. 3.) New ARM products will now begin to suffer the consequences of inferior fabrication coupled with both longer ramps and longer times between nodes. ARM is going to start to look like a runner in a long distance race with no water stops. They will move slower and slower and slower. 4.) No one knows if or when ARM will have volume 20nm production. But this is what we do know. It's going to ramp slower than 28nm. And 28nm was a pretty darn slow ramp. We know it's going to cost more for less improvements. Because it's planar. And you have to go to FinFET to get the good results. But ARM doesn't have FinFET. This is why many people are suggesting that ARM skip 20nm entirely. Because it's a dog. So the next move up is clearly a bump for Intel. They will move to the next FinFET node, they will move sooner and they will ramp it much quicker than ARM. Advantage, advantage and advantage. Can you feel the ARM fade to black yet? 5.) So, the really crazy thing here is that ARM is actually considering an attempt to jump directly to FinFET and 14/16nm. Kids, don't try this at home. You'll just end up in a body cast. Here, they can't ramp 28nm planar and yet they think they can move directly to 14/16nm FinFET in a year. Wow, that's some hubris. It totally reeks of desperation and that's exactly what it is. You may not believe what I have written here but ARM totally does. Or they wouldn't spend a split second considering this completely crazy scheme to jump two process nodes. It will be the end of them if they try it. Of course, they think it's the end of them if they don't. And they are most likely right. Putting their eggs in the 20nm planar basket is handing the mobility world to Intel on a plate with a napkin. So, boys and girls, what we found out today is that Intel is right on track with rolling out its fabrication. And with its new focus on power efficiency and architecture, Intel has a whole lot more than just fabrication.It is over-taking ARM faster than anyone thought possible. Now I don't know about you but I think that's pretty big news. Of course, there's going to be more big news. I just hope we don't have to wait for the Mobile World Congress to hear it...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357622989628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 00:29:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357623118246-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Merrifield To Be Announced At 2013 Mobile World Congress</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357446112906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:21:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My sources tell me integrated LTE only comes at 14nm.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1357623118246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 00:31:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357623191227-4</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Merrifield To Be Announced At 2013 Mobile World Congress</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357446112906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:21:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Intel does not have a 2 chip LTE solution, Medfield has integrated HSPA+ and Clovertrail+ (Z2580) coming very soon will have integrated LTE.

Intel didn't have a lot of new information to hand out to the press seated at its CES event on Monday afternoon—most of what it had to show off were things we heard about before, whether through official or unofficial channels. What the conference did was give us a comprehensive look at the company's products and initiatives for 2013. If you're familiar with Intel's initiatives of late, its new products are staying that course: emphasizing power consumption over all else and continuing to push its Atom processors into tablets and smartphones. Ultrabooks and convertible laptops also continue to factor prominently into the company's future plans, both with the next-generation Haswell chips and new Ivy Bridge processors that use even less power than the ones in currently shipping Ultrabooks. Atom in smartphones Enlarge / The Atom Z2420 is a new chip intended for emerging markets. Andrew Cunningham According to Intel, there are currently seven smartphones in the global market using its current Atom platform, codenamed Medfield. None of these phones, which are based around Intel's Atom Z2460 have really been aimed at the US market. But they've been relatively well-reviewed, and most importantly they appear to be competitive with ARM smartphones in both performance and battery life. An Intel-optimized version of Android and a compatibility layer for ARM-native apps in the Google Play store help to keep these phones familiar for users even though they're completely different from most Android handsets under the hood. Enlarge / It's not intended for high-end phones, but the Z2420 hits most of the right notes for consumers. Andrew Cunningham Enlarge / The new Atom also supports dual SIMs, an FM radio receiver, a microSD card slot, and Wireless Display functionality. Andrew Cunningham Intel spent the most time today on a processor not intended to replace the Z2460, but to augment it: the Atom Z2420 (codenamed Lexington) is a 1.2GHz smartphone SoC based on the same Saltwell architecture as its bigger brother, but it's aimed at "emerging markets." It's definitely no powerhouse—its Imagination Technology SGX540 GPU is the same used in the two-and-a-half-year-old iPhone 4—but it features 30FPS 1080p video playback and quick photo capture, (two features important for its target audience), as well as HSPA+ connectivity provided by a modem of Intel's design. Intel's next-generation Atom for smartphones, based on the company's 22nm manufacturing process, existed only as a nebulous "next generation" product on one of its slides; we know it will be based on the next-generation Silvermont CPU architecture, but not much else. Atom in tablets Enlarge / Clover Trail's successor will hit in "holiday 2013," bringing higher performance and Android support with it. Andrew Cunningham Intel's current-generation Clover Trail Atom platform is shipping in about ten Windows 8 tablets, according to the company, and like its smartphone chips the Atom chips have proven to be mostly competitive with ARM chips in terms of performance and power consumption. In a tablet, there's an additional benefit—Intel-based tablets can run full Windows 8 and all of the desktop and legacy apps that entails; the ARM-only Windows RT can run only apps from the Windows Store and the built-in first-party desktop apps. Enlarge / Intel's Atom roadmap for smartphones and tablets. Andrew Cunningham Clover Trail's follow-up is called Bay Trail, and it's a 22nm quad-core chip that promises twice the CPU performance of Clover Trail. Intel had three working Bay Trail-based tablets on the stage—they support Windows 8, of course, but unlike Clover Trail they will also support Android, using the same compatibility technology that makes Intel Android phones run. Bay Trail-based systems should be available by "holiday 2013." Ivy Bridge hits #$%$br /&gt; Enlarge / Lenovo's IdeaPad Yoga 11S will be one of the first to use a #$%$ Ivy Bridge CPU. Andrew Cunningham Intel has previously talked about new, low-power Ivy Bridge processors that would consume 10 watts of power instead of the 1#$%$s common in today's tablets and Ultrabooks. Today Intel announced that not only would these chips begin shipping to its partners today, but they would also use less power than anticipated: these Ivy Bridge chips have a TDP of just #$%$ PCs from both Lenovo and Acer using these #$%$ chips should be coming to market this spring and summer—Lenovo's system, the IdeaPad Yoga 11S, is actually a smaller version of the IdeaPad Yoga 13 we reviewed. The Yoga is one of the better Windows 8 convertibles we've seen so far, and an 11-inch form factor might make it a bit more plausible as a tablet than its big brother. The Intel processor will make the 11S much more useful than the Windows RT-based IdeaPad Yoga 11 that Lenovo is currently shipping, and at $799 its starting price is only $70 more than the ARM-based system. All's well that Haswell Enlarge / A look at North Cape, Intel's reference Ultrabook for Haswell. Andrew Cunningham Actual technical details about Haswell, as well as information about availability, were thin on the ground, but mentions of the architecture were threaded throughout the presentation. Among other things, Intel hailed the architecture as the "largest generation-to-generation battery life increase in the history of Intel" and the first CPU architecture designed "from the ground up" for Ultrabooks and tablets, rather than being retrofitted for those form factors after the fact. The company's first Haswell-based reference laptop, codenamed North Cape, is a convertible laptop with a detachable screen that tries to overcome the traditional shortcomings of convertible laptops (thickness and weight, mostly). The computer is just 17mm thick, but still manages to include batteries in both the base and the screen (as is the case with other detachable convertibles). Haswell will also bring some changes to the official (but not exactly stringent) requirements that OEM PCs must meet to earn the Ultrabook label. Most notably, Haswell Ultrabooks will be required to have touchscreens, and will also be required to support Intel's Wireless Display technology—these are both features common to the Windows 8 Ultrabooks we've been seeing for the last year or so, but this year Intel wants to make them official requirements. Intel also wants to drive touchscreens down into the $599 price point, down from the $800-and-above spot that many of these machines occupy presently. A potentially transformative year Enlarge Andrew Cunningham If Intel is to be believed, 2013 will be the year when their mobile strategy is finally realized: it will be easy to find and to buy x86-based laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and said devices will be competitive with ARM-based devices in speed, battery life, and price. It remains to be seen whether these innovations will actually be able to drive out ARM-based SoCs from tablets and smartphones, where Intel's competitors are pretty entrenched—big companies like Apple and Samsung seem content to use their own chips in their devices, rather than relying on an outside source. The biggest selling point for Windows tablets is full x86 compatibility, but no such advantage exists on Android tablets and phones. What Intel's proponents believe is that Intel's manufacturing advantages will ultimately make its chips' performance-per-watt so far superior to the competition that they'll essentially be forced to use Intel chips or lose their competitive edge. 2013 probably won't be the year that Intel's chips can reach that level, but the company's execution is definitely strong enough to make it plausible. .</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357627444654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 01:44:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357628104009-12</Id><Title>future Haswell detachable PC</Title><Msg>youtube v=FPT9E9zW5cE</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357628104009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 01:55:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357628116085-13</Id><Topic><Title>Intel at CES: More performance, less power, and x86 everywhere</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357627444654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 01:44:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel is saving up its big Merrifield launch with Lenovo for the more mobile specific MWC.

It's dual-core with latest graphics and LTE 4G support. Current Medfield is single core found in the Motorola Razr i is found to outperform and has longer lasting battery life than it's arm counterpart found in the Motorola Razr M (snapdragon S4). Imagine a dual core version. It will be interesting to see the benchmark comparison between Clover Trail+ vs. snapdragon 600/800. Intel mentioned at CES that it will release Bay Trail (22nm process) for tablet market for holiday season, so expect Merrifield (also 22nm) for smartphone market to also be available at that time as well. Tablet: ----------------- Currently Clover Trail. AnandTech recently compared the Acer Iconia W510 (Clover Trail) against arm tablets - ms surface rt (tegra 3), Dell XPS 10 (snapdragon S4), and Nexus 10 (samsung's A15 Exynos 5). AnandTech tests showed Clover Trail beating both tegra 3 and snapdragon s4 in terms of performance. Clover Trail beat tegra 3 in power consumption and was on par with the snapdragon s4. When compared with the samsung's A15, arm's latest and greatest, there was a big surprise. Even though the A15 outperform the Clover Trail (Intel's 5 year old architecture), the A15 was found be consume WAY more power. It's peak TDP was a whopping 8W! This was a big surprise since it proved that arm processors do not really have any power advantage over intel's. Future: This year we will see Clover Trail+, Ivy Bridge Celeron mobile parts, Ivy Bridge 7W parts, Haswell. Bay Trail for holiday season.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357657368825</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 10:02:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357657746395-36</Id><Topic><Title>Wally pumped CES to no end and...........nothing big happened</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357620578687</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 23:49:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As you can see here, clearly tooofunnny forgot to change his profile before posting this message...what a loser.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357657746395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 10:09:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357657861551-37</Id><Topic><Title>Expect at least TWO Intel Superphones with LTE 4G THIS YEAR</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357656253052</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:44:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ummm, are these OEM phones or INTC reference designs?

Intel: The Chess Game In Mobile Semiconductors Intel (INTC) is the world's largest semiconductor producer. 2011 total sales were $54 billion, with semiconductors making up $49.7 billion of that total. Since Intel's 2012 sales are expected to be flat with 2011, we can expect about $50 billion in semiconductors. So, we know that Intel had the capacity to make nearly $50 billion worth of semiconductors in 2011. That might seem like a "duhhh" comment, but read on. That $50 billion in revenue was made with capacity that existed at the end of 2010, which was three main fab complexes. In the fourth quarter, 2010 conference call (Jan 2011), CEO Paul Otellini made some comments. One was that the company would move to 22nm feature size for microprocessors. That move by itself would have allowed the existing revenue to be made in two of those three complexes. In the next paragraph, Mr. Otellini told everyone listening that the company would not only maintain the three fab complexes, but it would outfit another fab complex, for a total of four major complexes. Clearly, Mr. Otellini and Intel management had big plans for 22nm production. Since that time Intel has spent $25 billion+ on CapEx, suggesting that they have funded and built and equipped six fabs. Last quarter, the company took a charge for the expense of carrying unused capacity. This from a company that sensed and adjusted to the business decline of the Great Recession better than any company that I know of. Why $50 billion in ready-to-go capacity? The line of sight for the smart mobile devices market is one billion units in the very near future. With an Application Processor SoC at $25 and an LTE modem and transceiver set at $25, the total business opportunity is $50 billion, what a coincidence. To take a little side trip here; due to Intel's Tick-Tock strategy for moving the manufacturing technology down the road, a certain amount of extra capacity is required so that when they make the transitions to the next technology, they don't run short on capacity to handle that ongoing business. These transitions are a never-ending constant in the corporate life of Intel. That assurance of supply to customers is embedded in the very genes of the Intel business model. With regard to that assurance of supply to customers, I believe that Intel truly believes that they have the products to go from "zero to hero" in mobile a very short period of time. They will need every bit of this capacity to ensure timely delivery to nearly all mobile device customers. Of course, by the time that the already-started conversion to 14nm is complete those six fabs will have the dollar output of nine 22nm fabs. Since business is flat and assuming that Intel management are not a bunch of idiot children, these very expensive, state-of-the-art fabs will not go unused for very long. Here's the chess game part: For part of 2013, and maybe all of 2013, three of the existing six fabs will go empty, or each operating significantly below capacity. Why would Intel allow themselves to get into this underutilization position? One reason is that those three fabs represent nearly $50 billion worth of sales potential. That potential is at a node and soon two nodes ahead of the next best in class. If you are TSMC (TSM) seeing $50 billion worth of unused semiconductor capacity sitting at Intel is nothing if it isn't intimidating. Consider (from the standpoint of TSMC management): If Apple (AAPL) decides to move their "A" chip fab business to Intel from Samsung (SSNLF.PK), about one of those Intel fabs would no longer be empty. If the Apple 4G LTE and radio transceiver business came along with the application processor, it would consume the output of 1.5 of those idle Intel fabs. With that one move, TSMC can no longer justify the investment in additional fab capacity that would be obsolete as soon as it came on stream. Such a move in the Apple business would be a double whammy to TSMC because if Samsung lost the Apple business and TSMC didn't get it, Samsung immediately becomes a mega-competitor to TSMC in the standard foundry business. Consider further that Intel comes to market with a "Super SoC" that is so far ahead of anything that Qualcomm (QCOM) or NVidia (NVDA) has now or has planned that all non-Intel smartphone SoC chips would instantly be viewed as obsolete. There is some evidence that such a device is coming down the road sooner than expected from Intel. It is called Merrifield by Intel and is dual core, new architecture Atom based full function application processor SoC. Some leaked (rumored) search benchmarks put this chip at three times the performance of the best ARM (ARMH) based application processors. The Merrifield chip was supposed to be delayed until 2014, yet we have these leaked benchmarks. Another chess move by Intel? The Intel roadmaps indicate that a Clovertrail chip should be next to market. That chip is a dual core modified medfield with better graphics and some tweaks to the CPU section. Has Intel leapfrogged the Clovertrail and jammed the 22nm Merrifield based Redhook Bay into early production? Even if we don't see production of Merrifield until 2014, customers and competitors now know (or suspect) that this high performance core is just over the next hill. That simple fact will cause customers to delay new designs until this new super part is available. Those three unfilled Intel fabs have the effect of freezing any potential competition in place regarding capacity additions. Without significant capacity additions TSMC and other fabs will not be able to service the next stage of mobile device growth. QCOM and NVDA will have no path beyond 28nm. Intel is perfectly transparent. These unfilled fabs are physically there for anyone to see. The company publishes detailed roadmaps so that customers and competitors alike can make plans on how to respond. What happens to Qualcomm if Intel introduces a Superchip and gets the Apple fab business? With no access to 22nm, moving down to 14nm, Qualcomm has to re#$%$ their commitment to the mobile IC business. The Qualcomm mobile IC business is about 2/3 of their total sales, but only 28% of the operating earnings, while the royalty part of the business is about 1/3 of sales and 70% of operating earnings. If I were staring at that set of facts and looking at what the obvious intentions of Intel are, I would have a plan for winding down the mobile IC business. Qualcomm has recently bought Atheros Communications which is a play in the less congested networking business where, get your head around this, Intel might be a possibility as a foundry, much like the rumors circulating about Intel doing foundry work for Cisco System (CSCO). Qualcomm has also made an investment in the Japanese display maker Sharp. Perhaps Qualcomm will decide that the royalty business and a set of complementary joint ventures is a better use of their cash stash than competing with Intel. Qualcomm's history includes making cellular base stations and early cellphones, businesses they left for better opportunities elsewhere. That could happen again. What happens to Nvidia ? The discrete graphic chip business in rapidly being chewed up by the increasingly more functional GPU being integrated into the Intel CPU chips. Their mobile business goes the same way as with Qualcomm.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1357664599433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 12:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357665033208-56</Id><Topic><Title>ARM A15 is a Power hog according to Anandtech.

Apple asks TSMC to prove it can build iPad processor before Samsung is dumped TSMC is said to be on a three month trial to build Apple's iPad processor Karen Haslam TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co) has begun a trial production of the 4th generation iPad's A6X processor, according to Taiwan's Commercial Times. The news could spell trouble for availablity of Apple's 4th genearion iPad if TSMC is unable to meet demand. The company has three months to prove itself to Apple, and all being well, it will become the major supplier of chips for Apple's mobile devices, according to the report. Apple's arch-enemy Samsung currently manufactures Apple's iPad and iPhone processors at a factory in Austin, Texas. Following criticism that it manufacturers outside of the US, Apple has promised to return some manufacturing to the country. It is believed that Apple has pressurized TSMC to find a solution whereby it can manufacture Apple's chips in the US, and as a result the company is thought to have been looking for a new chip fab plant in the USA. When the A6 processor launched last year it was noted that Apple had designed the processor itself, using Samsung merely to build them. Previously Apple licensed the chips from ARM but the company is thought to have spent around $500m in designing its own custom chip. Neither Apple nor TSMC has confirmed the deal, according to AFP.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1357670089091</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:34:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357670252222-74</Id><Topic><Title>I bet INTC wishes for the good old days when they only had AMD to worry about.

Smartphones were pushed further into the emerging markets. Intel Atom is being pushed toward platforms that do more. Fourth-generation Intel Core (Haswell) is helping push ultrabook prices further down the price scales, while you can go further on a charge. And Intel is hinting at further features for its all-in-one and ultrabook wish lists and requirements. First off, the Intel Atom Z2420M (Lexington) processor is bringing the smartphone to developing markets like Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Like e-ink feature phones and hand-crank phone chargers, we're unlikely to see this technology in the states, but it shows Intel isn't leaving the rest of the world to Qualcomm and other mobile chip makers. While 32nm dual-core Intel Atom Z2760 (Clover Trail) is coming into its own with Windows 8 tablets from the top 10 PC makers, Intel is continuing to introduce new platforms with the next generation Atom (Bay Trail). Bay Trail will shrink the technology to 22nm and bring true quad-core to the Atom platform. Intel showed off several reference designs from manufacturers like Compal and Wishtron, heralding tablets that are capable of running both Android and Windows. Look for these tablets closer to the holidays in 2013. Intel Core processors for ultrabooks and all-in-one desktops were next. Third-generation and fourth-generation Intel Core processors are dropping to #$%$ power consumption on certain SKUs, leading to much better battery life. Kirk Skaugen, VP and general manager of the PC Client group touted 9-plus hour battery life. Fourth-generation Intel Core (Haswell) is expected to bring the price of entry level ultrabooks down to the $599 level, a far cry from the $899 introduction price for the first ultrabooks in 2011. Also shown were a 12.8mm (0.5 inch) thick 15-inch NEC ultrabook, with a three-year-old 15-inch laptop that was almost three times as thick. However, the most notable design was a reference model 18mm-thick detachable ultrabook that has 13 hours of battery life as a clamshell, but once detached, the screen turns into a full Windows 8 tablet that's only 10mm thick. A few hours are lost, but the tablet alone still turns in about 10 hours of battery life. All-in-ones like the Sony Tap 20 and Lenovo's new IdeaCentre Horizon 27-inch all-in-one were shown next, with the Intel folks highlighting a Hold'Em poker game where the table is the IdeaCentre Horizon and the "cards" can be held in your hand using Android smartphones. Intel is highlighting the large all-in-ones as shared PCs that can be used to play virtual board games like Monopoly, without having to worry about stepping barefoot on a stray green house piece. Xfinity and Comcast are going to leverage Intel technology with their new XG5 home gateway. Intel said that new Intel ultrabooks and all-in-one PCs and tablets will be able to view premium channels and content without having to use a decoder like a cable box or CableCard. Last but not least, the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK Beta was demonstrated, using an USB-connected 3D camera with voice, gesture, and facial recognition built in. This Kinect-style camera was shown in both a tech demo (grabbing and throwing a stream of gold coins flowing from a genie's fountain), as well as aspects of gameplay in Portal 2. Intel will be encouraging OEMs to build this technology into the next (or next next) generation of ultrabooks and all-in-one PCs. Taking the interface further, eye tracking was shown to play a game of Where's Waldo without using a mouse, trackpad, or even the user's arms.

At its big CES keynote presentation yesterday, Intel renewed its promise to double down in mobile, showing off new processors for smartphones. Those devices will likely only be available in emerging markets, but the idea is to provide devices that are just as powerful as those powered by Qualcomm and Texas Instruments at just a fraction of the price. Oh, and they probably won't be ready until 2014. We got a look at Intel's CES booth today, and despite the company's promise to increase its mobile presence, most of the booth was still Intel's bread and butter: Super-thin laptops called Ultrabooks (sort of like Apple's MacBook Air) and touchscreen PCs running Windows 8. The mobile portion of the Intel booth was relegated to a small kiosk in the corner. And most of the devices shown aren't actually available. According to the Intel reps, they're Android phones that are only sold in emerging markets. Others were just prototypes. That's pretty symbolic. Intel's biggest challenge today is convincing manufacturers to adopt its processors in smartphones and tablets, but it's going to be a tough sell since Intel is so late to the game. Despite the importance of mobile to its future business, it still doesn't feel like Intel is taking the space seriously. (By the way, Intel showed mobile processors at CES last year and as far as we know it resulted in only one phone from Motorola that was only sold overseas.)</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357679051918</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:04:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357679172093-118</Id><Topic><Title>"NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang publicly questioned the economic viability of the whole 20 nm node..."</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1356832646752</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:57:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QUALCOMM/SAMSUNG HAPPY WITH 28nm AND WHY?</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357679172093</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:06:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357679249221-119</Id><Topic><Title>Intel makes a fool of itself at CES.......and Wally knows it</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1357679051918</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:04:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WINTEL INTEL &amp; MICROSOFT both making fool of itself Monopoly broken and they now look like fools and don't know what to do???????????????</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357679249221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:07:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357679447508-120</Id><Title>WHY ALL TIER ONE OEM'S RUSHED TO ARM SoC's??????ALL YOU PUMPERS HERE can you explain?lol</Title><Msg>in love with Intel stock and bashing counter DD is not good for investing decisions ARMH and GOOGLE/APPLE busted INTEL MONOPLY and that is fact</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357679447508</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:10:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357679823076-121</Id><Title>Today the beginning of the end for Intel ?</Title><Msg>I find it to be a slap in the face that they basically pushed the same hype on us yesterday as they did one year ago.

Perenson 08.01.2013 kl 14:29 | PC World (US) The general population might best know Asus for its work on Google's Nexus 7 tablet, but hardcore tech enthusiasts know the Taiwanese company for all its inspired--some may zany--reinterpretations of common computer formfactors. Next in the list of Asus flights of fancy? An all-in-one desktop/tablet combo that doesn't make you choose between Team Windows and Team Android. Asus Transformer AiO At first blush, the Transformer All-in-One P1801 looks like a relatively ordinary all-in-one PC, except for one clear distinction: The 18.4-inch display is mounted in a docking shelf. When you turn it on, this all-in-one's unique approach becomes more evident. The unit runs both Windows 8 and Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, an unusual dual-operating system combination; you can switch between the two OSes by tapping a button along the right edge of the tablet. The switch is seamless, and makes hopping between Windows and Android viable. Previously, the largest Android tablet we've seen was Toshiba's Excite 13, at 13 inches. The Transformer All-in-One's split personality extends beyond its dual-OSes. It also has two processors, another unique find: The docking station contains an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, while the tablet itself also contains Nvidia's Tegra 3 processor.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357682073937</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:54:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357682109841-132</Id><Topic><Title>HTC sales plung 91 percent and one is to think that Intel will succeed????</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357680804170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:33:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Alexander was just making fun of one of singhlion2001's (your?) post..;)</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357682109841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:55:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357682588363-133</Id><Topic><Title>att4glte = singhlion2001 = coinmaker77</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357681069041</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:37:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think he could also be Lucy.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1357682588363</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 17:03:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357682976778-134</Id><Topic><Title>HTC sales plung 91 percent and one is to think that Intel will succeed????</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1357680804170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:33:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No. How different would that be than your "HTC collapse analogy to Intel".

I guess it possible to make that mistake. The innovation that occurred on the low end (smartphone and tablet) markets after Apple released its iPhone suprised everyone. RIM, NOK, HTC, AMD, INTC, Samsung, ......... Apple did a flawless Job to the point where Samsung had to directly copy the Apple product (per the courts). Those building retail products like HTC, NOK, RIM, .... were damaged more quickly depending on how much of their business came from those affected markets.

I'll spare the reader any further expository fluff and get right down to the two gems that Intel announced at the show: Next generation "Bay Trail" quad core, 22nm Atom will be in tablets scheduled to be on the shelves for "Holiday 2013" powering both Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 8 and Google (GOOG) Android tablets Intel has managed to get its third generation Core codenamed "Ivy Bridge" down from the 17W level to the 7W level for Ultrabooks and tablets during 1H 2013 so users don't need to wait for its 4th generation Core codenamed "Haswell" to get very low power consumption. Intel Has Stopped The Windows ARM Threat Intel's new chips effectively put an end to the notion of the ARM (ARMH) threat in the traditional Windows notebook/tablet space. The company is aggressively executing and will have very high performance, power-efficient solutions for every device that will run Windows 8. Not only does Intel's process technology advantage allow it to do a lot more than competitors on the performance and features front, it also gives it a power efficiency advantage. Further, compatibility with the suite of legacy Windows programs effectively puts a nail in the coffin of ARM in the Windows space.

Who cares WHERE they sell the Mobile chips? Will the Developing World’s Smartphones Have Intel Inside? Intel announces a “value” smartphone chip designed to power millions of low-cost mobile devices. By Tom Simonite on January 7, 2013 Why It Matters A more affordable smartphone chip could introduce millions of people to their first computer. Going mobile: Mike Bell, vice president for mobile and communications technology at Intel, announces the Lexington chip at CES 2013. Many predictions have been made about the impact smartphones could have on poor regions of the world—from improved health care to new modes of banking (see “Kenya’s Startup Boom”). Now the world’s largest chipmaker, Intel, is launching a smartphone processor aimed at enabling—and profiting from—an expansion of mobile technology in the developing world. “Smartphones have become a fundamentally enabling technology that everyone should be able to reach,” said Mike Bell, vice president for mobile and communications technology at Intel, announcing the new “Lexington” chip in a press session at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chip is designed to power Android phones that are cheap compared to those devices sold in rich countries such as the United States. Intel believes “value” smartphones could number 500 million by 2015. “Many [smartphones based on the new chip] will be sold into emerging geographies such as Latin America, Africa, China, South East Asia,” said Bell. “First-time buyers in these markets will be thrilled with the features and performance they get from these devices.” Low-cost smartphones have already begun selling in large numbers in Africa and elsewhere (see “Android Marches on East Africa”). However, those models have been built on processors significantly less advanced than those used in high-end smartphones. Intel believes its new processor will strike the right balance between price and performance. The company has already signed up Kenyan network Safaricom and Chinese manufacturer Acer to use the new chip. Intel has not yet announced a release date or pricing for the new chip. But Bell showed a “reference design” smartphone built to demonstrate the capabilities of the Lexington chip. The device had a screen three inches on the diagonal, an HSPA+ modem with a top speed of 21 megabits per second, and the ability to encode and decode full 1080p HD video. “We’ve added a couple of things that really make it appealing to the emerging market,” said Bell, pointing to support for dual SIM cards, so a person can switch networks to save costs or if his country is not fully served by any one network. Bell also highlighted the Micro SD card slot that would allow a user to add extra storage, a feature manufacturers concentrating on rich economies have begun to routinely leave out. If devices featuring the new chip catch on, they might help Intel gain a precious foothold in the broader market for smartphone and tablet processors, which it is all but shut out from (see “The Pressure’s On for Intel”). Most smartphones and tablets are built around processors based on designs licensed from U.K. company ARM, which has a long-established reputation for energy-efficient technology (see “Moore’s Law Is Becoming Irrelevant”). Intel’s chip and the reference design phone also support the company’s wireless display technology, known as Wi-Di, which makes it easy to stream content from a phone to a Wi-Fi-enabled television. This feature could also be important for Intel due to the fact that TVs are much more ubiquitous than smartphones in emerging markets and Wi-Fi has become a standard feature of even low-cost models. If someone’s first experience of computing is using an Intel-based smartphone to push content to his TV, the company may find it easier to sell him other products.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1357688870640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 18:47:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357688921834-142</Id><Title>where is the razr.i with LTE in the US?</Title><Msg>I am concerned INTC is moving too slowly... but really, I just want to buy one.</Msg><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1357688921834</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 18:48:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357689994426-143</Id><Topic><Title>ARM A15 is a Power hog according to Anandtech.

Example: Apple may have cannibalized some of it's own iPad margins by introducing the lower margin iPad Mini.. But Intel selling smartphone chips (at less margin) is not taking business away from any other Intel division. So how is adding lower margin sales a bad thing when they are in addition to all other sales?" [Makes sense; all the phones and tablets sold with Intel inside are like icing on the cake for Intel.

Intel has confirmed it has partnered with Comcast so the company's future chips will be able to stream live television without the need for additional hardware. Future hardware containing Intel's chipsets will be able to stream live and on-demand Xfinity cable programming without a set-top box. The service will be made possible due to what Intel describes as a "video gateway," a chip component based on an Intel Atom core -- complete with Puma Silicon -- that acts as gatekeeper to authenticate access with a broadcast provider. Demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show 2013, Intel showed how Xfinity streaming from an XG5 multi-screen video gateway could be transferred to an IP set-top box as well as directly to consumer gadgets. Intel says that the service will be compatible with Intel-based all-in-one PCs, tablets, smartphones and smart TV sets. The XG5 multi-screen video gateway has been designed by communications firm Arris, the recent purchaser of the Motorola Home set-top box business. It is able to connect any home screen to a network via MoCA, DECT and Wi-Fi, creating a multi-screen video gateway for your favorite program. Steve Reynolds, senior vice president of Customer Premise Equipment for Comcast commented: "Intel has been a great partner as we work to develop a platform that supports an in-home gateway and client architecture. Intel's powerful silicon platforms and their support for our RDK software initiative have enabled us to quickly develop a flexible platform for the delivery of our cable video services that will give customers the ability to view them on a wide range of consumer devices in the home." The new technology will be based on DLNA Premium Content Guidelines in order to eventually offer live television streaming on Intel-based devices in homes worldwide. There is currently no news on this working remotely, but the idea may be something Intel will eventually pitch to other broadcasters. from cnet</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1357697435198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 21:10:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357697671533-162</Id><Topic><Title>What happens when the mother of all phones come out with Intel inside?</Title><Username>ruipeirara</Username><Timestamp>1357696335493</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:52:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you wake up from a dream.

If Intel patents this, all SoC makers will have to license from Intel. The other thing that can come out of this is the All-in-one systems will become TV systems. Who needs an Apple TV then? And if TV can be watched from any connected device, watching TV becomes as ubiquitous as the internet.

Lenovo unveiled the K900 alongside Intel at a press party at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Tuesday. The smartphone features a number of unusual features, chief of which is the use of an Intel Atom processor. Lenovo is yet to release the processors exact speed, though Intel has claimed that the chip will make the K900 one of the fastest smartphones in the world. "Intel is pleased to provide the processor that will power Lenovo's latest flagship, K900. This innovative smartphone exemplifies the close cooperation between Lenovo and Intel," said general manager of mobile at Intel, Hermann Eul. "We believe that consumers will appreciate Lenovo's cutting-edge design and the overall responsiveness provided by Intel's next generation processor." Prior to the K900 in the UK only two other smartphones have been released running off Intel chipsets, the Motorola Razr I and Orange San Diego. Both devices ran using single core Intel processors, taking heed of the company's claim that there is currently no need for multi-core processors in a smartphone. Lenovo senior vice president Liu Jun went on to support Intel's claim, reiterating the company's argument that better software hardware optimisation removes the need for multi-core processing in mobile devices. "With the K900, our team has broken down the key functions of the smartphone and redesigned them from the ground up," said Jun. "Rather than focus on specifications that look good on a datasheet, we've zeroed in on what consumers want [...] The K900 is a game-changer that looks as good as it performs." The K900 will also feature a 13MP rear camera that Lenovo loaded with a Sony Exmor BSI sensor and F1.8 focal length lens for shooting in low light conditions. Lenovo claims the camera will be able to outperform all competing smartphone's cameras, including Nokia's Lumia 920. The handset is confirmed to house a 5.5in IPS 1080p HD screen that will display over 400 pixels-per-inch. The K900 will measure in at a skinny 6.9mm and weigh 162g, making it roughly 30g heavier than competing devices, like the Samsung Galaxy S3, which weighs a more modest 133g. The smartphone is confirmed to arrive in China in April this year, with Lenovo promising a wider rollout to "select territories" will follow. There is currently no information regarding the K900's price.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357702891511</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 22:41:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357702908766-177</Id><Topic><Title>Why hasnt Intel raised the dividend in a long time??</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1357702125419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 22:28:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Their history of div increases is almost unmatched in the tech world.

For those who missed the Intel keynote, Clover Trail+ is the much improved yet still secretive successor to the relatively quiet Medfield, though it is odd that Lenovo only says "the forthcoming Intel Atom processor platform for smartphones" instead of just "Clover Trail+" in the press release. ......</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357704193486</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:03:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357705429750-183</Id><Topic><Title>CES: Lenovo unleashes K900 Intel superphone</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1357702891511</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 22:41:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Anyhow, said Android device comes with many mouth-watering features: 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display, Gorilla Glass 2, 13-megapixel F1.8 camera with dual flash, and a front-facing imager with an 88-degree super wide viewing angle. 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage add to the package.

And they may not be as far away as they seem. Watch out, touch screens. You may be hot now, but one Intel executive predicts voice recognition will eventually make you obsolete. Mooly Eden, the Intel senior vice president who oversees the company's "perceptual computing" operations, told CNET today that voice recognition will do to touch what touch has done to physical keyboards -- making many things unnecessary. "Voice is the best means of communication between humans," Eden said. "We finally have enough compute power to do what we want from science fiction." Intel is working with partners on complete systems for such devices, including the hardware (run by an Intel processor, of course), software, cameras, and other features. It's still early days, Eden said, but voice, for example, could overtake touch in as little as three to five years.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357706482905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:41:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357706625294-186</Id><Topic><Title>Voice recognition will make touch obsolete, Intel exec says</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357706482905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:41:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good time to invest in NUAN.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1357706625294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:43:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357706638517-187</Id><Topic><Title>Response to blackoutbutkus</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357692538154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:48:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" I hope semi-equip-junkie can respond with clarifications, since your comments make no sense." I highly recommend to study how BRCM, Marvel and NVDA feel / think about 20nm economics. There are 3 CEO's that don't believe 20nm foundry process can provide ROI justifying to go to 20nm - even Jacobs is skittish about future nodes.. And last I checked TSMC buys tools to meet demand and technology requirements. They certainly do and I rspct TSMC...however there is always a faster gun... several years ago there was talk that TSMC would fab Atom chips for Intel - Intel decided to pull out because Intel decided to protect its (gate last) IP -otherwise Intel would have transfered its Gate Last IP to TSMC Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will collaborate on Atom chip production, the companies announced Monday. Intel chip technology For its part, Intel is eying big markets--such as smartphones--where it is currently not a player, but TSMC is. "Many of our customers already had an existing IP (Intellectual Property) infrastructure on TSMC that they would like to take advantage of as they ramp Atom-based products. That's essentially what the agreement is about," said Anand Chandrashekar, senior vice president at Intel, speaking Monday morning in a joint Intel-TSMC conference call. Atom is currently the most widely used processor in Netbooks.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357706638517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:43:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357707425051-188</Id><Title>ARM reality check</Title><Msg>I know a lot of suckers lik Hans are still employed...
