Intel has fixed this with Haswell by offering all day battery life and price points that will go as low as $599. Also, the big advantage Intel has is it can run full Windows 8 (not the useless RT version) which allows users to use their legacy applications and games. It makes the device the best BYOD since most companies run the Windows 8 platform. Don't forget that Haswell is compatible with Android too.

"Intel Corporation has joined TowerJazz Semiconductor in bidding to purchase the Micron Technology microchip plant in Kiryat Gat. A third option for Micron is shuttering the facility. A few days ago, Intel’s management informed Micron that it is interested in using the facility, according to sources privy to the negotiations on the plant’s purchase. Intel apparently wants to upgrade the plant and use it to produce 10-nanometer chips, its next generation of chips. Upgrading the existing plant would likely involve an investment amounting to billions of dollars. Under a 24-year leasing arrangement with Micron, Intel − the plant’s original owner − holds a veto over transferring it to any third party, which means Intel can prevent the factory’s transfer to Tower, a chip maker based in Migdal Ha’emek, or any other potential rival. The Micron plant specializes in manufacturing 45- and 65-nanometer memory chips.

The factory was built by Intel in 1999 to produce the then-new Pentium microprocessor and is one of Israel’s oldest microchip plants. In February 2010, Micron bought Numonyx, a company that had taken over the Kiryat Gat facility, and acquired the facility as part of the deal. One of the main questions under any scenario is what will happen to the 1,300 people currently working at the Micron plant. The company informed its work force last December of its intention to sell the plant or to shut it down by 2015. It appears that most of the workers will stay on in the event that either Tower or the management of Micron Israel buys the plant and continues to operate it. It’s less clear how many of the workers would be hired by Intel should the company take over and upgrade the facility. But a top-level source in the local high-tech sector said that Intel considers Micron’s labor force, with its specialized experience in producing microchips, to be the plant’s main asset. To further its attempt to sell the plant, Micron has sweetened the deal with a promise to supply the buyer with orders for several years.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898067659</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369898596531-17</Id><Title>Intel prepares to sell its own ‘market leading’ smartphones and tablets</Title><Msg>extremetechDOTcom/computing/156896-intel-prepares-to-sell-its-own-market-leading-smartphones-and-tablets Just two weeks after the departure of Paul Otellini, Intel’s new CEO is making some big changes to the company that will allow it to go toe-to-toe with mobile chip makers such as Qualcomm. The new CEO, Brian Krzanich, first appointed Mike Bell to head up the newly created New Devices division, and yesterday Intel acquired the division of ST-Ericsson that makes mobile GPS chips. The acquisition might sound small, but when you bear in mind that Intel is one of the least acquisitive companies in Silicon Valley and factor in the creation of a New Devices unit, it’s clear that Intel is gearing up to take the smartphone and tablet markets by storm. When ExtremeTech last spoke to Mike Bell, he was the co-chief of Intel’s mobile chip business, along with Hermann Eul. Back then, in 2012, his department had just shipped Medfield, which wasn’t all that exciting. What was exciting, however, was that Intel created a reference smartphone specifically for Medfield, so that carriers and OEMs could get to market with a Medfield-powered device very easily. When we asked him if this was the beginning of a trend, he said: “For every chipset, we’re going to do what we call an ‘iconic’ design, to really showcase what [the new SoC] can do. These designs will be available to anyone who wants to build a device based on our chipsets.” With the new Bay Trail and Merrifield SoCs arriving this winter, and Bell’s move to the New Devices unit, it’s almost guaranteed that Intel will release homegrown smartphones and tablets based on these new, fast, Silvermont-based chips.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898596531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:23:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369898711967-18</Id><Topic><Title>Intel prepares to sell its own ‘market leading’ smartphones and tablets</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898596531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel, for its part, is being quite mysterious about the New Devices division. “The group will be tasked with turning cool technology and business model innovations into products that shape and lead markets,” Intel’s PR department said in a statement. Intel also says that the new unit will focus on emerging technologies, including ultra-mobile products. Whether that means smartphones, or wearable computers like Google Glass, we can only guess. Bell, incidentally, was at Palm between 2007 and 2010, bringing the Pre and Pixi to market; and before that, he spent 16 years at Apple, working on the iMac, Apple TV, and iPhone. It’s fairly safe to assume that the New Devices unit, helmed by Mike Bell, will be releasing some sexy mobile devices in the upcoming months.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898711967</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369898747864-19</Id><Topic><Title>Intel prepares to sell its own ‘market leading’ smartphones and tablets</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898596531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And then there’s the acquisition of ST-Ericsson’s GPS mobile business. ST-Ericsson, a money-losing venture between STMicroelectronics and Ericsson, is in the process of being shut down — and it seems Intel couldn’t resist picking up the GPS business for a cool $90 million. With this acquisition, Intel gains the intellectual property, engineers, and technical expertise to produce GPS receiver chips that will most likely find their way into Intel’s new smartphone and tablet devices. This might seem like a small acquisition, but it’s important to remember that Intel is one of the least-acquisitive companies in Silicon Valley. Yes, Intel bought McAfee for a massive $7.7 billion in 2010 and a handful of other software companies since then, but on the hardware front Intel has been very quiet since acquiring Infineon (a wireless modem maker). Looking through Intel’s entire acquisition history, the company hasn’t acquired more than a handful of hardware businesses — so, while $90 million is one of the company’s smallest acquisitions to date, it’s probably quite significant. With Intel’s Haswell parts reaching TDPs as low as 7W, the ARM-beating Bay Trail and Merrifield, and perhaps a bevy of new devices in time for Christmas, this could be a very exciting year for Intel and consumers alike.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898747864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369900228610-20</Id><Title>Another article on the Micron plant</Title><Msg>globesDOTcoDOTil/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000848090 Have the employees of the Micron facility in Kiryat Gat become hostages in Intel's battle over the next fab it plans in Israel, on the eve of the decision about the fate of the Micron fab? This is the feeling that has been in the air in the past week for the 1,200 Micron employees, after Intel Israel approached Micron head office in the US with a request to receive back the Micron fab, which was leased to Micron several years ago. Intel refused to respond on the matter, while Micron Israel said, "We cannot comment on business negotiations. The negotiations on the sale of the fab in Israel is being conducted between prospective purchasers and Micron Technology Inc." Last December, Micron Technology Inc. decided to stop production in Israel, and to shut down the fab within two years if it was not sold. The fab was constructed in 1998, and was then known as Intel Fab 18. It produces components for memory chips using technology that is no longer at the forefront of semiconductor manufacture. Over recent months, attempts have been made to sell the fab for a price in the tens of millions of dollars. Among the entities that have made offers are Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Nasdaq: TSEM; TASE: TSEM),Maxim, and a group led by the management. The deadline for a decision on the fab's future is June. If no solution is found for continuing operation of the production lines, the employees, along with 600 others employed indirectly, will be liable to find themselves without jobs.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369900228610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:50:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369900264654-21</Id><Topic><Title>Another article on the Micron plant</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369900228610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:50:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As a condition for selling the fab, Micron is demanding that the buyer should continue operate it for the next eighteen months for Micron customers. The buyer will also be required to take on various costs connected to commitments to the employees (costs that Micron is trying to prevent though a sale). Against this background, Intel asked for the return of the fab, in exchange for continued operation of the machinery. After that, it is believed, Intel will be able use the land for construction of its next Israeli fab in 2014-2015, improving the chances that the fab will indeed be located in Israel. It Is not clear whether this scenario includes employment of some of the Micron workers, but certainly a substantial portion of them will become jobless in this event. If Intel does continue to operate the fab for the next year or two, 600-700 Micron workers will presumably continue to be employed there, but it is hard to guess what will happen afterwards. Intel's current fab in Kiryat Gat, Fab 28, employs 3,500 people. Last year, Intel Israel missed out on construction of the company's new fab producing silicon wafers using 14 nanometer technology to Ireland. Intel Israel president Mooly Eden has said in the past that "it would be very worthwhile for the company's next fab to be here." Intel's only comment on what is happening at its neighbor, the Micron fab, came at its annual press conference in February, when Intel Israel plant manager Maxine Fassberg said in response to a question on the matter, "Micron is an independent company. We are not part of its management, and so we respect its ability to deal with the situation, and when decisions are made, we'll respond. The question ought to be directed to Micron Israel's site director Yonathan Wand."</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369900264654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:51:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369903239618-22</Id><Topic><Title>IPHONE 6 to use INTEL Chips :</Title><Username>oceanbeachvictor</Username><Timestamp>1369754714062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:25:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd say $24.42/share</Msg><Username>aulus_vitellius_germanicus</Username><Timestamp>1369903239618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 04:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369913487890-23</Id><Topic><Title>Intel prepares to sell its own ‘market leading’ smartphones and tablets</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898596531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Would be good if they sold unlocked versions of their smartphones online the way Google sells its Nexus lineup.

There is some economic data due out in the next couple of days which could give the market a direction.

Stocks are still in a sweet spot between the Fed and the economy. On one hand, should the economy stay relatively weak, the Fed would stand pat on its QE program. On the other hand, should the economy surprise to the upside, stock prices would benefit assuming an orderly tapering by the Fed.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369914124851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369914546391-25</Id><Topic><Title>Intel prepares to sell its own ‘market leading’ smartphones and tablets</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1369898596531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the interesting post.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369914546391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369918749138-26</Id><Topic><Title>Just A Thought</Title><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1369914124851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:42:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You've posted this drivel day in day out since DOW 11,000.

Then I was lucky to stumble upon one of Wallis' messages talking about Intel's process manufacturing...planar, finFET. I did not understand any of it at the time, but after digging further into the subject, I now realize Intel's manufacturing lead is the REAL competitive advantage.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369920232228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369920380299-30</Id><Title>Why Haswell Isn't Priced In</Title><Msg>With Haswell announcement on Monday, it appears that there is an enormous flood of positive press on the way. While it seems that the buzz might have started to dissipate, a new factor has been injected to provide new life and excitement. The new factor is the news that the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (10.1) will use an Intel chipset. And it's the unknown nature of this news that will continue to drive the Haswell news cycle. There are supposedly two possibilities. One is that the Intel processor will be one of three offered on the Galaxy Tab. This would be bad for shorts and presents a serious risk. The other possibility is that the Intel processor will be the ONLY one offered on the Galaxy Tab. This would be devastating to shorts. There is speculation that Samsung will reveal the answers at Computex. The result of this is that there will continue to be speculation through this week and into Computex next week. So, a news cycle that was started to look saturated now has new energy. Of course, once Computex starts (and even now stories are breaking) there will be an exceptional number of new product announcements to also pump energy into the Haswell news cycle. Here's the calendar: June 3: Intel to release Haswell - In the final countdown stage. June 4: Computex Opening Keynote-Tom Kilroy, executive vice president and general manager, Intel's Sales and Marketing Group, will deliver a keynote on Intel's vision for continued innovation to reinvent people's computing experiences across a range of devices. June 4: Computex-Computing Reinvented Satellite Event and Media Q&amp;A-Kirk Skaugen, senior vice president and general manager of the PC Client Group, will host the computing reinvented satellite event where he'll demonstrate and provide details on the new experiences delivered by 4th generation Intel Core processor-based Ultrabooks, laptops, desktops and all-in-one devices.

She went extreme right and had to quit because a DEM would get elected over her in a republican district because she is so so nuts. Oh well--Do you really think you can hurt him with 4 dead when Bush got over 100 thousand dead in wars and the GOP backed them all? He laughs at you Mitch. Your entire goal that you stated was to make Obummer a one term Pres. You failed. You are an angry old dirrrtbag loser and your base that votes for you in Kentucky hates you too.

Since yesterday was a big down day in the market, the Haswell effect was probably larger than 19 pennies. Intel will likely trade a little stronger than the market tomorrow too since the Haswell introduction happens over the weekend before the Monday US markets open.

The deal extends Intel's position in the mobile chip business, an area that it is eager to penetrate. PREVIOUSLY: ST-Ericsson, a joint venture of STMicroelectronics and Ericsson, today announced the signature of a definitive agreement to sell the assets and intellectual property rights associated with its mobile connectivity Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) business to a semiconductor company. At the time of release, ST had not released the name of the purchasing company. The sale of these assets represents another step in the execution of Ericsson's and ST's announcement of March 18, 2013. In addition to the assets and IPR associated with this business, a team of 130 industry veterans located in Daventry (UK), Bangalore (India) and Singapore are anticipated to join the buyer at closing of the transaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and standard conditions and is expected to be completed in August 2013. ST-Ericsson estimates the proceeds from the sale, combined with the avoidance of employee restructuring charges and other related restructuring costs, will reduce the joint venture's cash needs by approximately $90 million. "Today's transaction validates the leading innovation developed by ST-Ericsson in mobile navigation systems and marks a further important step towards the execution of our shareholders' decision to exit from ST-Ericsson" commented Carlo Ferro, president and CEO of ST-Ericsson.

It has to be priced into the stock. What is projected is priced into the stock too. Some of the projections are positive and some are negative. The impact on the stock price is the average of those projections. When the projections become "known", then the wrong projections will be adjusted and priced into the stock. My opinion is still that, with the large, peaked short interest, share buyback and new products, Intel will track the market (like it should) but will have a slightly stronger performance which will lead to an RSI that will appear overbought. Whatever affects the market will provide a framework for Intel trading. Negative warnings will affect the market negatively and Intel.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1369931091528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:24:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369931232355-70</Id><Title>Wall Street must be crushed here</Title><Msg>Need to learn a lesson once again to quit manipulating markets up on nothing but greed.

Inclusion in Samsung’s budget range of tablets will be a significant design win for Intel as it attempts to bring down the power usage of its chips to be more mobile friendly. The Tab 3 is expected to be unveiled at Computex next week. Talking to The Korea Times a member of Samsung’s research staff said “This is a win-win deal for both sides. Intel, which is trying to cut its heavy reliance on PC business, offered better pricing for Samsung that is shifting its focus toward tablets following its huge success in smartphones.” The person went on to explain that Samsung is using chips from multiple sources in various product lines as it stabilises yields of its own Exynos processors. The Tab range is a big seller for Samsung and it expects to double sales of the range this year to approximately 33 million units. We all know Intel has been working hard to improve the energy efficiency of its chips and it claims the latest Haswell parts offer roughly 50 per cent more battery life alongside a greatly reduced idle power draw. These new Intel processors are said to be “reinventing mobility” and will be officially unveiled at Computex, where Samsung’s Tab 3 range will also be unveiled. An Intel source told The Korea Times that there are many more Intel employees in S. Korea now, compared to a year ago. Chipzilla apparently has over 50 Atom chip engineers beavering away in collaboration with Samsung Electronics, last year there were as few as six.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1369939257737</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 14:40:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369939284695-82</Id><Topic><Title>Sources confirm Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 range will have Intel inside</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1369923239430</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 10:13:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel Korea’s boss Lee Hee-sung said that the chipmaker isn’t just collaborating with Samsung in S.

The acquisition might sound small, but when you bear in mind that Intel is one of the least acquisitive companies in Silicon Valley and factor in the creation of a New Devices unit, it’s clear that Intel is gearing up to take the smartphone and tablet markets by storm.

I have full sympathy for Intel's competition. They simply can't acknowledge how far behind they are in regards to FinFET. All they can do is assuage their customers that they are on track and pray for a miracle. Fake it till you make it. I would imagine that some of the engineers at these foundries are putting in 20 hour days trying to catch up to Intel. In the comments section, Russ Fisher made an astounding assertion: "Maybe TSMC will prove me wrong, but I think they will NEVER ship anything of commercial value below the 28nm node. Not 2015 or 2016, I mean never. If Intel has cornered all the mobile business at 14nm in 2014, there will be no justification for TSMC to spend what it will take to get to 16nm finfet. There is still a lot of business at 28nm and above, but below that they have to slug it out with Intel. Does anyone know of a direct confrontation with Intel where Intel did NOT prevail?

Essentially, Microsoft doesn’t get that its central criticism of the iPad — that is, that it’s more of a toy that can’t be used for doing serious work — is precisely why consumers are drawn to it in the first place. Simply put, consumers have PCs at their offices if they want to do work. When they’re at home, they want to play around with their tablets instead; they like having toys. When you take this into consideration, says Ritchie, it’s clear that any attempt to bring core Windows functionality to tablets is doomed to failure. “For years mainstream customers have felt alienated by desktop operating systems,” Ritchie writes. “They’ve struggled with their archaic file systems and confusing windows management, their intermediated control schemes and their sheer complexity. And those frustrations are the last thing those mainstream customers want on mobile. They want to pick up a device that they can understand… They want their apps, they want their media, and they want it without all the inhuman bulls*** traditional computing platforms like Windows (and OS X for that matter) have been forcing on them for decades. They want iPads.” But all is not lost in the tablet space for Microsoft: Ritchie says that the company already has experience in creating a popular, intuitive operating system with its Xbox gaming console. If Microsoft were to make a tablet that took more cues from the Xbox and had gaming capabilities that put the iPad to shame, then it could have a winner on its hands</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1369943447489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 15:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369943454879-100</Id><Title>Whur's Nenni at?

Looks someone picked up on it 2/26/2010 from the "Inquirer" He (Shang-Yi Chiang, TSMC’s R&amp;D boss) then moved on to explaining what the company plans to do next with its 28nm roadmap. It will start with a 28nm Low Power (28LP) silicon oxynitride, followed a quarter later by the 28nm high performance (28HP) high-K metal gate process. Despite it being the first high-K metal-gate process, Chiang believes that TSMC will be able to migrate the technology as it moves forward with 22nm and 20nm nodes. 28nm should be introduced by Q3 2010, we garnered. Further along the roadmap comes the aforementioned 22nm node. Chiang expects to see a more mature second-generation high-K metal-gate process kick in. The first 22nm process will be a high-performance one (22HP), followed 2 quarters later by the low-power version (22LP). These should be in place by Q3 2012 and Q1 2013, respectively.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1369946151835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:35:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369947902542-112</Id><Topic><Title>Article: Taiwan Semiconductor Tries To Pull A FinFAST One</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369920232228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:23:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TSM dropped 1.75 % .. wow .</Msg><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1369947902542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369948182134-113</Id><Topic><Title>Article: Taiwan Semiconductor Tries To Pull A FinFAST One</Title><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1369920232228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:23:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not sure that TSMC has a lot of choice but to blow smoke. I am pretty sure they know they are in trouble but as long as they perpetuate the myth then they have a steady stream of customers. I can't fathom them making money on 20nm node let alone 16nm. Even if they manage to get the process out correctly they will not get the yield to satisfy their customers. The cruel fate for these companies will be that they bought into ARM to get a chip that was cheaper to make and more efficient to run and when they get to 20nm the chip will be more energy inefficient then Intels solution and more expensive to make.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1369948182134</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369950233100-114</Id><Title>H'mmm</Title><Msg>will Waldo even recognize the triple top pattern that shows up on a certain chip stock just like the one that showed up when he, a rare thing, correctly, called a triple top in ARMH at 44.00 on it's way to 40.00 where he, as usual, incorrectly failed to take the profit and put the money in the bank as it exploded to 50.00, and held 44 on the next downdraft? na, Wally will just keep pumping INTC as it languishes well below the high of last year, and even further below it's 2004 2nd bubble peak at 34.00</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1369950233100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:43:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369951368579-115</Id><Topic><Title>Mr Weaver and Mr Essa sniffing again.

Kick in the rear for Windows RT and Snapdragon, very cool !! ================== HTC Said to Cancel Large Windows RT Tablet on Weak Demand By Dina Bass - May 30, 2013 3:22 PM CT HTC Corp. (2498) has scrapped plans to introduce a full-sized tablet computer with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)’s Windows RT operating system on concern it will meet with lackluster demand, according to people familiar with the matter. HTC decided not to make the device because it cost too much and demand for RT machines has been weak, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The company still plans to release a 7-inch tablet running the software, a version of Windows 8 for chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)’s technology, later this year, the people said. HTC is coping with a sales slide, market share declines and management turnover, prompting the company to be more selective with the products it brings to market. Microsoft’s Windows RT sales have lagged since the product’s October introduction, with just 200,000 tablets running the operating system sold in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC. A tablet with a screen of about 12 inches was too pricey both in terms of components, and what HTC would have to charge customers, said the person. The company expects lower costs and higher demand for a smaller tablet to be delivered around September or October, the person said. HTC chose Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)’s Snapdragon processor for its tablets, the person said. Bloomberg reported that HTC was developing devices with Microsoft’s software in December.

Less Windows, more Android. Acer is about to give us a taste of this trend, as Android PCs begin to creep onto the market. The Acer all-in-one (AIO), due to be announced next week, will pack an Intel 3GHz Core i5 4430 "Haswell" processor and run Android. Expect this trend to pick up steam as PC vendors announce new systems based on Intel's upcoming Haswell and Bay Trail chips. Intel is already dropping not-so-subtle hints that Android laptops running on the Bay Trail chip are on the way and will be priced between $200 and $300. Acer's new AIO system will go for less than $400 at some resellers, though most listings put it about $425 and some are higher. And that's the appeal of Android. Systems sans Windows 8 can be priced lower and require less hardware. The Acer AIO will come with only 1GB of memory and storage configurations will be as small as 8GB.

Anyone bother to ask the negative analyst if their firm is actively in the market to buy back shares for their client, intel?</Msg><Username>gooddigger</Username><Timestamp>1369971647047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
