Very significant. Whole day intel traded in a narrow range with low volume and then picked a huge momentum at the end. Such narrow range accumulation followed by a huge run like this means a lot, specifically that there is heavy manipulation and accumulation in anticipation of the earnings release. I would assume another day or 2 of narrow range and post earnings huge run up, wont be surprised if INTC hits 30 by the end of this month</Msg><Username>trader_the</Username><Timestamp>1373948067932</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373948146915-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel is dead money</Title><Username>stjdavis7</Username><Timestamp>1373946692667</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>idiot idiot idiot</Msg><Username>orco_apocalypto</Username><Timestamp>1373948146915</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:15:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373950920205-4</Id><Title>If INTC flies wednesday ARMH and QCOM crashes</Title><Msg>if INTC crashes ARMH and QCOM also crashes</Msg><Username>jake_718</Username><Timestamp>1373950920205</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373951470332-5</Id><Topic><Title>Semi equipment junkie</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1373892066999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 08:41:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go have some Brautwurst and get over yourself, jerk. youtube.com/watch?v=1eLJEE5NJ5c</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1373951470332</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:11:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373953271850-6</Id><Topic><Title>Semi equipment junkie</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1373892066999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 08:41:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The great 88 the coolest heroes of the cold war The Film The film titled „The Great 88,“ tells the story of AFN-Berlin and the staff, in particular the DJs and the music (R &amp; B and Jazz) in context with the cold war situation of West Berlin. In this spirit, the DJs and the music as they were presented on AFN between 1976 and 1984 plays a central role in the film. Since then, the DJs have been raised to legends, which represent a state of mind and took the music scene in Berlin beyond the limits of imagination. As a foundation, the film conveys the unique situation of the city of Berlin, and of AFN in its historical relationship to the Western sector of the city, and also the duty that was assigned to AFN. At the same time, the role of all the Western allies is illustrated (keyword: guarantors of peace and freedom). West Berlin entered into extraordinary situation in the era of the Cold War. AFN also took on extraordinary status in the region as it was also being heard in East Germany and East Berlin. The special feeling and atmosphere that AFN brought to the East German youth forged a music scene and a desire for freedom that was existed in the AFN DJ personalities and the music itself. At the same time the West Berlin youth were living the same dream. Friday belonged to Jim McAuley. On Thursday it was AFN disco. The AFN broadcasts and the DJs were part of everyday life for teenagers in Berlin. But AFN also stood for great music and the highest standards of excellence. AFN was actually a channel of culture, par excellence. [Cool. I hadn't heard about AFN. The power of music and freedom....]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373953271850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373953483461-7</Id><Topic><Title>One trade + $4,500 On the day..</Title><Username>rogerwalker513</Username><Timestamp>1371785363137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 23:29:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUGF</Msg><Username>brettlange74</Username><Timestamp>1373953483461</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373953504247-8</Id><Topic><Title>Two very large dishonest derivative players!</Title><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1373553237747</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 10:33:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They do not know what is going on!!</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1373953504247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:45:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373954156874-9</Id><Topic><Title>Two very large dishonest derivative players!</Title><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1373553237747</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 10:33:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This seems to be a copy/paste of the last 5 identical threads you have started in the last several weeks. I would like some more detail to give this the weight you think it deserves. You say "look at the tell tale signs" .... what signs? You say "stagnation in the major indices" .... by what metric? You say this happens "when large derivative players are shifting their positions" ... how do you measure that? How can you tell they are "moving their money" so I can look for a cause and effect relationship you suggest? Warren Buffet plays derivatives through his insurance businesses but those are either reinsured or hedged. The credit default swaps clearinghouse does not show any unusual activity. What specifically are you looking at that makes you so fearful. Where, for example, do you think that Buffett has taken derivative positions? I would like to do some DD on what you are saying but it makes no sense.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373954156874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 01:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373954863913-10</Id><Title>Two very large dishonest deranged players</Title><Msg>geraldomcginty and CoinBoy</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1373954863913</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 02:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373959611723-11</Id><Title>INTC is going to miss the 54 cents they made last year by a lot, The only question is by 10 or 15 cents?</Title><Msg>INTC will still go lower if they beat the VERY lowered earnings forecast of only 39 cents, That would be almost a 30% drop in earnings, If INTC misses the very lowered 39 cents we will see INTC at $19 very fast</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373959611723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 03:26:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373959744793-12</Id><Topic><Title>The slow down here is in full force now, Starting to look like 2009 all over again, Furlough is causing layoffs in retail and restaurants</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373860779451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 23:59:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TIC TOC get ready for the stock market drop</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373959744793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 03:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373960721584-13</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is going to miss the 54 cents they made last year by a lot, The only question is by 10 or 15 cents?</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373959611723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 03:26:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TIC TOC are you ready for the drop</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373960721584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 03:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373965987190-14</Id><Topic><Title>Intel-powered ZTE Geek arrives in China on July 25th</Title><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373642538474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:22:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel-based phones gaining traction, expect major design wins with Merrifield for US market</Msg><Username>intc40endofyear</Username><Timestamp>1373965987190</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 05:13:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373965995652-15</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P UPGRADES OPINION ON SHARES OF INTEL TO BUY FROM HOLD</Title><Username>jctailman</Username><Timestamp>1372861108408</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:18:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>S&amp;P is the reliable source even though it is still very conservative.

Investors should not be carried away by the current rally and Mr. Bernanke's dovish talk from last week. Besides the fact that both the S&amp;P 500 are the DJIA are facing resistance at their respective May intraday highs, there are other technical conditions that warrant a pullback. Stocks are now overbought on both a short term and immediate term basis. In addition, the nearly 10% move by the Russell 2000 index since the June low has now put that small cap index at the top of its up channel since last November. Expect the smaller stocks to face some resistance also. Notable earnings due out on Tuesday include: JNJ, KO, CSX, GS, SCHW, MOS and YHOO.</Msg><Username>littlestewie88</Username><Timestamp>1373970439702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 06:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373978033454-41</Id><Topic><Title>Semi equipment junkie</Title><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1373892066999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 08:41:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You believe that everyone in your socioeconomic class is good and everyone outside of it is bad.

According to first half results, Amino recorded £2.6 million ($3.97 million) of operating profit on revenue of £20.1 million ($30.35 million). Operating profit before exceptional items was up 735 percent to £1.7 million ($2.56 million) and gross profit was up 30 percent to £9.3 million ($14.05 million), the company said in an earnings statement. Non-Executive Chairman Keith Todd, in a statement released by the company, credited Amino's ability to develop products for a changing IPTV marketplace that now includes OTT as an essential element and a series of "win back" campaigns aimed specifically at North American operators.

Some are better than others. Most try to point to the fact that declining PC sales have everything to do with the world switching over to phones and tablets and ditching the PC. They never mention BRIC, Windows 8, and other factors. Also far from being mentioned is that if it wasn't for the iPad Mini sales for tablets would have fallen also in the first quarter. I really get tired of seeing things spelled out simply that people have thrown away their PCs and have pulled out their iPhone and iPad and are perfectly happy. The much larger story involves many layers of the world economy, the problems with Windows 8 not really being an option that people want, and perhaps the fact that at $300 to $500 a tablet many people are holding off on purchases. Something else that may be of interest is that we are starting to get to a phase where the initial iPads are facing dead batteries and the repairs coast more than they are worth. Will someone who dropped up to $700 on a tablet be looking to do the same in the future when laptops can functionally last longer?</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373985454927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:37:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373986160148-61</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Opinion</Title><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373985454927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:37:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problems with Windows 8 not really being an option that people want.

My opinion is that individual consumers are spending more money on peripherals and probably delaying purchases of PC's to pay for them. I know very few people who don't have a desktop PC and those are usually students who have a laptop. I would say very few people can get along with just a tablet and a smartphone. Personally, I have a tablet and use that occasionally instead of my PC or laptop. I like it for quick web work but would not think of using it to replace either my laptop or my desktop. I would like to hear for some folks that think the PC is dead, have neither a laptop nor a desktop PC. I don't use my desktop as much as I used to but I still need it for heavy duty work, so I would not ditch it. I would be willing to say that folks that have the money to spend on an iPad also have a laptop somewhere and probably a desktop. I have a Galaxy Tab and quite honestly it is a luxury item for me. I like the convenience of it but I could very well get along with out it. What all this mean regarding INTC is this. The sales of desktop PC's will flatten but not disappear over time. The total number of devices that require a CPU is going up a lot. The share of that CPU growth that INTC is able to capture is vitally important to the long term growth story of INTC. Many bulls believe that INTC will capture a significant part of that market. The bears believe they will fail. It really is as simple as that.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1373987380195</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373987538850-72</Id><Title>Maybe INTC can use weather for them missing the .54 cents they made last year or maybe they should lower there forecast some more so they</Title><Msg>beat it.</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373987538850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:12:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373987940552-73</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe INTC can use weather for them missing the .54 cents they made last year or maybe they should lower there forecast some more so they</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373987538850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:12:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought you said they would beat anyway?

It's all about the screens. INTC's new TAM is 2+ billion screens... or as bjaythebear put it, "devices that require a CPU". There is no reason not to believe that INTC will get 85% of this total market, like it did with PCs. Not today. Not next quarter. Not this year. Start to look at projections for smart devices for 2015. Right now, INTC has about 15% of this total market. There is your growth story. Even if average selling price for all CPUs (from smart phone to servers) falls to $50, we are still looking at $100 billion in sales.</Msg><Username>jflaherty</Username><Timestamp>1373988012301</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:20:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373988101617-76</Id><Topic><Title>INTC is going to miss the 54 cents they made last year by a lot, The only question is by 10 or 15 cents?</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373959611723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 03:26:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TIC OTC your going to lose a lot!@ How old are you by the way?

Intel Israel spokesman Guy Grimland confirmed that the deal has closed in an email Tuesday, declining to specify the price Intel paid; Israeli news source Haaretz reported that the price was close to $50 million. Grimland also provided a statement, which read, "The acquisition of Omek Interactive will help increase Intel's capabilities in the delivery of more immersive perceptual computing experiences." Intel has been developing a set-top box that it expects to deliver in 2013, and company spokesman Jon Carvill said earlier this year that the device will include a built-in camera that can recognize users and maintain profiles of the programming each of them prefers. Adding gesture-recognition features to such a camera could allow viewers to control their TV sets by moving their hands or other gestures, similar to Microsoft's Kinect hardware that connects to the Xbox 360. The Kinect's technology was developed by another Israeli startup, PrimeSense, which The Calcalist reported Tuesday is an acquisition target for The Cupertino tech giant is also rumored to be developing a television offering that advances beyond the capabilities of Apple TV, a set-top dongle Apple has offered for years. Israel has been a prime target for Silicon Valley acquisitions of late, as companies use overseas profits to purchase foreign companies while avoiding repatriation taxes levied when the cash is brought back to the United States.

The PC that they had before there last PC was usually some sort of Pentium or AMD at under 1ghz. Then they switched over to a Pentium D around 2005.. It's dual core and running nearly 3ghz. The problem is that its most likely running XP as we've seen from the stats Wallis put up a few weeks ago. If the computer is still running, it's a horrible experience. By now they really needed to re-install an operating system. I believe that there are many homes that have these ancient XP machines that still run. albeit very slowly. But the point is that they still work. Like you they use the PC for heavy lifting but rely on their tablets and phones for the day to day net surfing. They would upgrade to a new PC if only a viable non-Windows 8 option existed. I do believe that within the next couple of years we'll start to see real, viable alternatives to the Microsoft OS hit the market for PC most likely based on Linux. Google seems to be the only company that can pull this off. They could invest a few billion dollars to finish off Linux once and for all. It would require a smooth and seamless transition from Windows to Linux which probably could be done in a variety of ways. The transition will be x86 in phone and tablet. The next step will be Android apps that run on the PC. There is a lot of money to be made from PC's and a lot of pent up consumer demand and even more consumer frustration with the status quo. Keep in mind that both Microsoft and Apple have phone to workstation solutions. Other than Chromebook Google has yet to really enter the PC market with a viable stand alone operating system. The PC isn't dead, it's just in bad need of a makeover.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1373995475487</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373995726062-133</Id><Topic><Title>INTC use the weather for your miss, That will work, BUY,BUY,BUY it was the weather</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373995151381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:19:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could not be because INTC missed the boat on phones, tablets and game systems , Its the weather, That's it missed the 54 cents because of weather, That will work if KO can use it INTC can</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373995726062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:28:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373995747458-134</Id><Topic><Title>The lucy's camp is in PANIC posting mode. lol</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1373994018789</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:00:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For sure, that senile old coot has a major screw loose...............</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1373995747458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:29:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373996132354-135</Id><Topic><Title>Options</Title><Username>stockjock44</Username><Timestamp>1373995201874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:20:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is hard to know if someone purchased or sold.

The hype concerning Windows 8 is overblown. I see this hand ringing every OS revision. In the corporate world, and BTW I work in the IT field, I see that businesses are buying mostly Windows 7 desktops but adoption of a new OS is slow on the business side normally because of legacy applications. RIght now our org is buying lots of PC's just with Windows 7. The selling of MSFT related to Windows 8 "slow adoption" was absurd and I new it. It was media led nonsense talk like this that enabled me to get MSFT at 26.5 and many happy returns. Bears will similarly perish shorting INTC because anti PC propaganda that is going out now.

Geekbench use the same switches (compile settings) across OS's and Archs when using the same compiler. Remember, this is a PC benchmark suite that has been used to compare x86 cores, not mobile phone chips so it's gone through years of rigor/challenge. Intel's compiler isn't free and I suspect there are licence issues when you use Intel's compiler for this kind of benchmarking. Besides as alexander shown on this board, GCC can beat ICC. The only 'true' benchmark suite is your own workload, every benchmark suite has issues. The best you can do is use several of them and reach your own conclusion.</Msg><Username>theblueredmonk</Username><Timestamp>1374004642265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:57:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374004950877-203</Id><Topic><Title>Its funny, all these benchmarking sites are GARBAGE.

I am merely pointing out that the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 isn't a design that's going to set the world on fire. I am very long the stock (and January 2015 LEAPs), and I firmly believe that Intel has everything in place to win in mobile from a process lead, to a world class chip design team, to what seems to be a very credible cellular modem team. However, it can't be ignored that the press is going to tear the Galaxy Tab 3 apart, and because Samsung equipped it with 1GB of RAM and an average camera (the Galaxy Tab line isn't high end), people will start to associate Intel with "low end". I believe that Bay Trail can't come fast enough, and I am hoping that the leaked benchmarks don't look great because it's running at a very low frequency, coupled with a broken FPU test (Sharpen/Blur), and that retail chips will do far, far better. I think they will, but given the snafu with AnTuTu and Clover Trail+, I have to err on the side of caution until these chips are tested by independent reviewers. Like I said, VERY long Intel, and long calls, with NO plans on selling.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1374015302594</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 18:55:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374015520939-236</Id><Topic><Title>NAND flash price has steadily rise!

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of builder sentiment climbed to 57 this month from a revised 51 in June, the Washington-based group reported today. The reading surpassed all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 49 economists. The gauge has climbed 13 points in the latest two months, the biggest back-to-back advance since January-February 1992. A pickup in builder optimism about the sales outlook shows an increase in mortgage rates in the last two months is having a limited effect on the housing market. Further gains in residential construction would help underpin the world’s largest economy after a slowdown in the first half of the year. “You’re seeing a significant pickup in demand for new residential dwellings,” said Brian Jones, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York. His forecast of 55 was the most accurate in the Bloomberg survey. “Mortgage rates are moving higher and pulling people in.

If they used 2GB of RAM it would have been A LOT better. I also can't understand why they used a 1280x720 screen on the device when they could have easily used 1920x1080 screen. It is more of Samsung's fault than Intel IMO.</Msg><Username>clemsyn</Username><Timestamp>1374029774540</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:56:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374030019619-261</Id><Title>Apple Intel Predictions from Russ Fischer</Title><Msg>The bottom line is that to move the "A" chip business to Intel, two things had to happen; Elpida had to be saved in order to supply mobile DRAM chips to Apple and Intel's Infineon division had to come up with a discrete 4G LTE solution in order to de-fang Qualcomm/Samsung. The first of those is done, but Infineon is nearly a year behind schedule on the 4G LTE solution. It now appears that Intel/Infineon has a certified LTE solution that Apple can use. So, now all of the potential blackmail roadblocks are out of the way of Apple's intense wish to end all supply business with Samsung. Now what do we get? An oft-repeated rumor from the notorious Taiwan rumor rag Digitimes, that Apple has signed a three year deal with TSMC (TSM) for 20nm, 16nm, and 10nm versions of future "A" chips. Does that make sense? TSMC, who would have all the reasons in the world to shout about even a 20nm (planar) test chip, has shown exactly nothing, while Intel is shipping 100s of millions of 22nm Trigate devices and in a matter of months will be shipping production chips based on 14nm, again Trigate. I really don't have anything against TSMC; as a matter of fact I admire the company for all they have done. The fact remains that TSMC is nearly two nodes behind Intel and in the case of Apple; a conscious decision to put all their beans in the TSMC basket is suicidal. On the other hand, if I were Apple and the largest and best foundry on the planet promised me 20, 16, and 10nm fab services, I would give them orders for a piece of anything they asked for. In the unlikely event that TSMC were to catch up with Intel, Apple would have two sources of leading edge foundry work, TSMC and Intel. My bet would be that Intel is all set to run the "A" chips as well as the LTE chips for Apple and has been ready for some time while the two roadblocks, mobile DRAM and 4G LTE chip supply are being resolved.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374030019619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374030087251-262</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Intel Predictions from Russ Fischer</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374030019619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continued: How could something like this be kept secret? I honestly don't know, but I remind the readers that the Apple move from Power PC to Intel X86 was kept absolutely secret for the six years that it took to re-write OSX for X86. If the TSMC rumors were true, the stock price should be up $10. It's not. Intel helped Micron pull Apple's bacon out of the fire by saving and buying Elpida. Micron's payoff for this move, which seemed like insanity at the time, is acquiring Elpida at 20 cents on the dollar, packed to the roof with Apple mobile DRAM orders. Where is Intel's payoff for its help in getting Apple off the Samsung hook? It will come in the form of application processors (either "A" chips or x86 chips) and LTE chips. Having Apple in the bag goes some way to explaining the huge apparent overcapacity at Intel. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1374030087251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 23:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374031344693-263</Id><Topic><Title>Intel-based Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is garbage</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1374010304273</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:31:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By any chance do you know whether they use regular PC DRAM or do they use mobile/low power DRAM?
