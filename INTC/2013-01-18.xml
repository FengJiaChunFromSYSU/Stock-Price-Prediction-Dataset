At six watts, Centerton is the industry's only low power microserver SoC that delivers critical enterprise features like 64-bit, ECC and virtualization. Last quarter, our customers also began shipping tablets based upon our Clover Trail SoC and Windows 8. These systems boost up to 10 hours of battery life, three weeks of connected standby and come in a range of sleek ultra light form factors, all while bringing the benefits of software compatibility with the millions of Windows applications written for Intel architecture. There are now 10 Clover Trail tablets shipping today with several more launching in the coming months. 2012 was a milestone year for Intel architecture and smartphones with our customers now shipping seven devices across 20 countries. These phones use our 32-nanometer Medfield SoC and our extremely comparative with the best ARM designs on performance and equal or better power and battery life. We saw the introduction of our 22-nanometer manufacturing process and along with it a revolutionary new tri-gate or 3D transistor technology. 22-nanometer products represented more than half of our volume in the fourth quarter as the rest of the industry works to ship its very first tri-gate designs. In July, we announced an important strategic relationship with ASML, which combined with our process technology expertise, will accelerate deployment of EUV and 450-millimeter technologies helping to ensure the future of Moore's Law and our growing manufacturing leadership. Looking ahead to 2013, I am excited about the strong pipeline of our products, we have coming to market. In the first half of this year, we will launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable breakthrough innovation in form factor, battery life and usability. It will deliver the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel's history and it is inspiring a new wave of ultra-sleek, convertible, touch-based designs across our customer base. Later this year, we will ship 22 nanometer versions of our Zion and Atom products for the data center, bringing the power, performance and efficiency benefits of 3D transistor technology to our entire data center product line. In 2013, we will also begin to deliver the industry's first 22 nanometer tablet and smartphone SoCs to OEMs. We are now shipping our single mode data LTE baseband to customers and over the course of the year will begin delivering multimode data and voice modems to customers, giving us a full complement of competitive technologies to grow our device business. Last, but not least, we will begin our transition to 14 nanometers as we begin the world's first 14 nanometer products towards the end of this year. We see the industry in a period of transition and hyper innovation. We are well-positioned to take advantage of these trends across the spectrum of computing from the lowest-power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers and everywhere in between. [Hmmm. wonder where all the bad news is that the tech press was screaming about? It all sounds pretty good to me. Intel is preparing to kick ARMs rear-end from A to Z in 2013, from the high-end to the low-end, from PCs to smartphones. It has the fabrication and manufacturing to do it. It has a huge lead in fabrication that is getting larger. It has closed the power efficiency gap and is prepared to move ahead of ARM. Intel is prepared to carve out big market share in tablets and smartphones. I wonder what conference call the tech press listened to???]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358485522074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:05:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358485606906-2</Id><Topic><Title>Enough is enough !</Title><Username>lpaoa</Username><Timestamp>1358479082405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 22:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope you and da rest dumping INTC are successful in forcing INTC under $20 again.

The shills weren't surprised but they wouldn't get their ten cents a post if they didn't act shocked. As if anyone cares what the shills posted. These are the people who gave back 3 bucks since November but still think they are smart. Whatever...] In 2012, revenue was $53.3 billion, gross margin was 62%, operating income was $14.6 billion, net income was $11 billion and earnings per share was two dollars and $0.13. For the year, the business continued to generate significant cash with almost $19 billion of cash from operations. We increased the dividend per share by 7%, resulting in over $4 billion in dividends paid and repurchased roughly $5 billion of stock. We continue to invest in our manufacturing leadership. We purchased $11 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading edge factories and made a $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML. Lastly, we took advantage of record low interest rates and borrowed $6 billion. Total cash investments ended the year at roughly $18 billion, up approximately $3 billion from a year ago. Revenue of $53.3 billion was down 1% from a year ago and below the expectations we had at the start of the year. Worldwide GDP growth was significantly less than we had thought entering the year. [OMG, revenue was down by one percent!!! One percent!!! No wonder the analysts went crazy. Revenue dropped by a massive one percent while Intel was preparing to kick ARMs rear-end. Holy smokes, yikes and TORA, TORA, TORA!!! Somebody get the ninny from Lion Broadcasting over here. When was the last time in the history of the stock market anyone has seen a one percent revenue drop???] [Okay, I'll stop now. But you get my drift.

Even in the midst of the slow-down, Intel was managing inventory levels and increasing its efforts towards deployment of 14nm which will be game over for ARM...] "Our investments in industry leading manufacturing process technology continued to pay off through leadership products and a highly responsive factory network. We invested over $10 billion in research and development in 2012, up almost $2 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by investments in Ultrabooks, the data center, phones and tablets. In addition, we made investments in core capabilities, like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was 34%. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.5 billion, in line with expectations. We believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in the fourth quarter as customers reduced inventory of older generation PCs. Gross margin at 58% was up one point from expectations and down five points from the third quarter. The drop from the third quarter was driven primarily by excess capacity charges as a result of the aggressive tactical actions we took to reduce inventory levels and to redirect space and equipment to 14 nanometer. Our inventories decreased almost $600 million from the third quarter as a result of these actions. Separately, we start production on our next-generation microarchitecture product code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale this quarter."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358487064166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 00:31:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358487688784-10</Id><Topic><Title>Otellini insisted Intel will prove superior to the ARM chips:</Title><Username>roor15</Username><Timestamp>1358473430049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:43:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel doesn't need to recoup its investment in CapEx.

Um, which conference call did they listen to?

The tech press is dumber than a box of rocks...] "Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank If I look back between the last two years and then heading into what you just guided to for 2013, it seems like your CapEx and your OpEx are outgrowing revenues. I guess, if I partner that together with where the stock is trading valuation wise, it really looks like investors are dubious as to when any returns are going to come from those investments. So, I guess the question after that is, when do you see the investments come or the return on these investments coming. How long do you think this investment stays last and what are some of the mile markers we should look for to see those returns being generated? Paul Otellini - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director Ross, there's two parts to the CapEx this year. I mean, two large parts to the CapEx this year, Ross. One is, you are starting to see in our first significant investments in bricks and mortar and some equipment for the 450-millimeter transition which happens later part of this decade. We have to make to those investments earlier. Now that we've solidified our relationship and contractual relationship with ASML, it gives us line of sight to that conversion and therefore we're now in a better position to predict the exact timing and deploy capital for that, so I would treat that as a more of an extraordinary event that's not related to the day-to-day business in terms of volume in 2014, 2015, 2016. The CapEx that we are projecting on a base level, $13 billion minus the $2 billion is $11 billion, which is about what we spent last year. And, as I look forward into the business in 2014 and 2015 as we finish up the 14-nanometer factories and begin deployment of the construction of and equipping of the 10-factories, we need those factories principally for our view of the computing market, and in that that would include tablets and certainly the data center. So as we look at it, it gets used. Remember the leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis, the highest performance and the lowest power. So regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the world's leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have." [BAM!!! Otellini puts the hammer down on this idiot. First of all you don't know anything about fabrication and 450mm. Second, you don't understand Intel's node economics as compared to ARM.

I will take that. Let me break out that capacity related CapEx in a couple of different ways. First if you look at it by process, it's very much driven by building for the peak of 14 nanometer and then it's the start of the investment and 10 nanometer. So just building on what Paul said, if you think about that, it's really building for units that we expect in 2014 and 2015 because that’s where you start to see the peak of 14 nanometer and the start of the ramp of the 10. In terms of the breakout between what's for facilities versus what's for equipment, as I had showed at the investor meeting back in May, we are seeing that the facility related spending is coming back and a higher proportion of that CapEx is for equipment."

Housing is finally showing big improvement and this is extremely important. We just had great employment news. Best figures in 4 years. How did you manage to miss that??? The new oil production is doing really well and we are expected to be energy independent not too far off in the future. This is really great economic news. We're supposed to get 12 million new jobs in the next four years from expanded oil production in the US. China has had great economic news lately and the thinking is that even Europe has turned the corner. The US economy is slowly but steadily improving. So, I am hearing a totally different story than you and most of it is coming from Bloomberg, CNBC and the mainstream financial press. The positive economic moves will definitely help Intel. In 2012 things were worse than predicted. In 2013 I think they will be better. 2013 will be a watershed year for Intel as they take over the power efficiency lead and make major inroads into smartphones and tablets. Intel's fabrication is going to be the deciding factor. Intel's fabrication is screaming long while ARMs is in full crisis mode. You simply can't win the technology race without great fabrication and manufacturing. Intel has it. ARM doesn't.

As my follow-up, we have recently started seeing an increased adoption of ARM's Cortex-A15 processor and I believe earlier today, DSMT spoke about their optimism, but the 20-nanometer process ramping next year at a faster pace than they had ramped 28-nanomer. So, my question is, do you see the competition catching up in terms of performance or in general how should we view the computing landscape? Thank you. Paul Otellini - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director No, I don't. Now that we've met the power battery life curves and we are still on 32-nanometers as we move to 22 in 2014, you will see us accelerate. We've looked at the 815, we've looked at the 815 specs and we know our own silicon in terms of Bay Trial and Cover Trail Plus, and we are very comfortable that we can maintain a performance lead there. Micro architecture is hard and it's something we've got 30 years of experience at, and these devices are simply becoming very small computers and that's what Intel is exceptional at. [Is ARM catching up in performance? Don't make me laugh says Ortellini. Intel is working on 10nm while ARM isn't going to have 20nm until 2014 and the economics and performance on 20nm planar will be lousy whenever it happens. 14nm is so far off for ARM it's not even worth speculating on.

Thanks for taking my question. It sounds to me like you are guiding traditional PCs down a ton this year and yet you seem to making a very big bet on revenue growth in to 2014 because it seems like this flood of CapEx doesn’t really start getting depreciated until then. So how much do you need to take, in terms of share within tablets or how much of that tablet market needs to be eaten up by your convertible PCs in order to fill that big bet in 2014 that you seem to be making and avoid the underutilization that may otherwise happen from the CapEx that you are spending? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President I take issue with the characterization of guiding PCs down a ton and then some big snap back. [Analyst makes the big mistake of trying what he does in print but in person.] Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein But you said revenues were up of 2% with data center up in the double digits and phones and tablets ramping, which implies that the core PC business is down. [Idiot analyst thinks he can slip by converting "core PC business is down" to "you are guiding traditional PCs down a ton". And he's even wrong on the first part and gets b-slapped for it...] Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President No, so I said for the company its low single-digits in terms of our expected revenue growth, data center up and back into the double digits. You still end up with client growth when you go through that and I think the point that Paul was making earlier was a really important one which was the lines between a traditional notebook, a convertible, a tablet have blurred to the point that it’s a market for computing and we are expecting some unit, now Q1 we think is seasonally down. That’s what we guided but when we get into the back half and you have a combination of new products in the market and an improving macroeconomic environment I think that’s a fairly reasonable assumption on the year. As we think, into the future, we think of it as just more or less normal growth, consistent with what we have historically seen, from a unit standpoint. It's just growth across a much wider range of devices than what we have historically supported. You want me to add anything to that? [I love that last remark: "You want me to add anything to that?"

I know you raised that recently any need you think to have to do that at some point during the course of the year? Stacy Smith - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Not need, but we would certainly look opportunistically like we have been and we certainly have capacity if we ever wanted to, but I think it's instructive to just look at where we are. If you take Q4, which we would say was a relatively tough quarter at the top line, macroeconomic weakness, the impact of tablets on our business, we generated $6 billion of cash flow from operations, we had $2.5 billion of CapEx, we paid a little over $1 billion in dividends. So, we are generating plenty of cash to invest in our business and to pay the dividend and protect the dividend. So, I am not worried about it from that standpoint, and as I model out 2013, I get to a similar model where I am generating more cash than I need for those two things. In terms of the cash balance that I'm comfortable with, I am comfortable with how much cash we have today. I could live with a little bit less also and we make those decisions tactically as we go forward.

First and foremost, it comes down to, if you consensus GDP estimates, the consensus today is that there is a pretty significant strengthening in the worldwide economy over the course of the back half of this year. Over that same ten years, the first correlation of our business is GDP growth. And then beyond that, it's the kinds of things that Paul has been talking about. You have Haswell coming into the marketplace, Windows 8 gaining traction, Touch gaining traction, so you have these great devices that are coming in that are convertibles and kind of the best of the PC and the tablet experience and then we become more and more represented across both, the Windows, tablet section of the market and Android over the course of 2013, and the combination of that puts us into a situation where we believe we have more than seasonal second half.

I loved seeing Paul and Stacy finally slap some of the totally worthless analysts down. They have been deserving it for years. And we got good information on what to expect. Continuing to be a bit slow in the first half but with some significant acceleration in the second half. Paul is expecting stronger world economic improvement in the second half. And Paul and Stacy definitely think that Intel is bringing the full load in 2013 and think ARM will buckle under that load. No doubt that Intel expects to lead in power efficiency as well as performance. No doubt Intel expects to bring a lot of state-of-the-art capacity on line and doesn't expect to share it with competitors, only with strategic partners. Now I wonder who those could be? So, best guess is that Intel was very conservative with the first quarter number and I would expect it to be an easy beat. No upside for shorts on the next call. I like that. In general, I expect the economy to improve and produce an environment better than Intel's conservative forecast. I think Intel will have a good year and if a couple of deals break their way, then they will have a fab-u-lous year.

It went very well. Yes there were a couple of analysts that were trying to throw rocks at Intel but they handled it perfectly. Key takeaways that I saw: 1. Inventory problems that hurt this quarter have largely been dealt with and should not be a problem going forward. 2.Profit margins are higher for this quarter and future quarters than anyone expected. 3. Capex will be higher than expected. Some folks will make hay out of this but Intel explained that most of it was normal. The extra is due to migration to larger wafer size. The larger wafer size should improve efficiency down the road and will reap margin benefit down the road. Intel already the most efficient fabs in the world and they are going to keep it that way. 4. Intel is moving aggressively into Mobile chips. This will benefit them as time goes on. Don't let the bears scare you. 2013 will be a transition year but a growth year with things picking up nicely toward the end of the year.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1358511501281</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 07:18:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358511670583-67</Id><Title>selling half of my position</Title><Msg>small profit is better than nothing.

I’ll make a few comments on last year’s achievements, on this year as a whole, and specifically on first quarter. And I will also comment on 28-nanometer technology and on 20-nanometer and the 16 FinFET, and then finally on CapEx, this year’s CapEx. Lora has already reported the financials of last year to you. Basically, last year was a year of achievements for us. Revenue grew 18% to reach $17.1 and EPS grew 24% to reach TWD 6.41 per share. 28-nanometer technology was a resounding success. The production in 2012 increased more than 30-fold, 30-fold over 2011. And we have enjoyed throughout the year, in spite of a lot of attempt to the competition, we enjoyed throughout the year close to 100% foundry market share in 28-nanometer technology. We have also, in the year 2012, further strengthened our R&amp;D. Our R&amp;D expenditure increased from TWD 33.8 billion in 2011 to TWD 40.4 billion in 2012. Our R&amp;D people increased from 3,400 at the end of 2011 to 3,900 at the end of 2012. Now, a few words on 2013 and the first quarter of 2013. For the full year 2013, we are forecasting a global GDP growth of 2.6%, which is a bit higher than last year’s global GDP growth for 2.4%, now we’re forecasting 2.6% for next year – I’m sorry, this year. We are forecasting a world FTE market growth of 3%, we are forecasting a fabless company growth of 9%. We are forecasting a foundry industry growth of 7%, and we are forecasting a TSMC revenue growth much higher than 7%. So those are our forecast for the full year 2013. For first quarter 2013, I have some comments on supply chain inventory to make. Three months ago, in the last investors conference in October, we expected the supply chain inventory to decline from seven days above seasonal in fourth quarter to one day below seasonal in the first quarter. That was our expectation 12 months ago that the supply chain inventory will decline from seven days above seasonal in fourth quarter to one day below seasonal in the first quarter, all together an eight days decline. Now, because many mobile product manufacturers have accelerated their new product launch this year, and so late in the year they have now pulled ahead to earlier in the year. And therefore, they need IC supplies, IC inventories earlier. So, in – supply chain inventory now is forecast to decline only slightly from fourth quarter to first quarter. And so seven days above normal to one day below normal, we are now forecasting that the inventory will decline from six days above seasonal – well you know, in sort of seven days. Three months ago we thought the inventory was going to be seven days above seasonal. Now, we have better information and we think it’s six days above seasonal in the fourth quarter. So, the big change is that we are forecasting it to decline to only four days above seasonal in the first quarter, which is only a two-day equivalent, two-day decline, instead of the eight-day decline that we had forecast three months ago. Orders resulted in a higher first quarter than we thought three months ago. So now we expect the first quarter revenue to decline while in three months ago, we expected to decline. The first quarter revenue we expected to decline from the fourth quarter. We now expect the first quarter revenue to be essentially flat in U.S. dollars from the fourth quarter. Essentially flat from the fourth quarter in U.S. dollars. A few more words on 28-nanometer technology. After accomplishing a 30-fold increase in production, 28-nanometer capacity and output continued to ramp up aggressively this year. Production of 28-nanometer wafers in 2013 will triple that of 2012, adding the newcomers may ask we have customers. The old customers, I think, know us well enough not to ask that, if we have customers. High-k metal gate will surpass oxynitride. That’s in the 28-nanometer. We have, as you know, actually four types. Three of those are high-k metal gate, and the earliest type that we introduced was the oxynitride, and indeed last year, the majority of the production was the oxynitride. But the more advanced version high-k metal gate will surpass oxynitride in the third quarter this year. And in the fourth quarter, it will even surpass oxynitride even more. Gross margin percentage of 28-nanometer in 1Q ‘13, which is this quarter, will be slightly higher than corporate average, and is expected to remain so in 2013. This linear dragging the corporate average down more than pulling it up. Now, a few words on 20-nanometer and 16 FinFET. Both technologies are in progress in R&amp;D. Both represent state of the art, leading-edge technology not just in foundry but in the whole SC industry. And enough discussions have taken place with enough customers with large requirements to lead us to believe that in both its first and second year of production, in both the first and second year production of 20 SoC and that first year will be next year, 2014. The second year will be a year after that, 2015. In both those years of 20 SoC production, the volume of 20 SoC will be larger than 28-nanometer in its first and second year of production, which were last year and this year. That’s a long sentence, but let me repeat it. In slides it didn’t work. We think that our volume of 20 SoC next year, 2014, will be greater than the volume of 28-nanometer last year and we think the volume of 20 SoC in 2015 will be greater than the volume of 28-nanometer this year. Our CapEx plan is, therefore, in accordance that belief ....</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358511908937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 07:25:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358511922765-69</Id><Title>Heading back to the teens</Title><Msg>Sell before market opens or watch the slaughter at 9.30</Msg><Username>beachguy347</Username><Timestamp>1358511922765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 07:25:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358512127997-70</Id><Topic><Title>Hilarious: Stacy Smith Slaps Down the Idiot from Sanford Bernstein</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358493154921</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:12:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I caught that whole conversation too.

However, I think it's prudent to let the dust settle before taking new positions. We've seen this pattern many times with CSCO when they habitually missed earnings projections. Each time it happened, the stock would tank followed by a feeble rally followed 3 months later by another earnings miss. This created a pattern of lower lows and lower highs which eventually brought the stock down by about 40% over more than a year. I used each earnings miss to add and was soon regretting my decision. Even Cramer started bad-mouthing CSCO, calling it Crisco - as in fried. It took enormous patience and stubborn fortitude to resist my instinct to cut my losses. Finally, after more than 2 years of pain, I'm now ahead. INTC has some work to do in reinventing the company and creating new products that fit into new areas that they've ignored until now. It'll take several quarters for this to happen, but I'm confident that it will... eventually. Meanwhile, the company has a strong financial condition and pays a generous dividend. The main thing to remember is this: CRAMER IS THE KISS OF DEATH! (Those will probably be the last words I say before I die.)</Msg><Username>skinz4q</Username><Timestamp>1358516870271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 08:47:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358516920584-106</Id><Topic><Title>How much would Intel have needed to beat estimates for stock to hold?</Title><Username>A Yahoo!

Intel is doing what they need to do to maintain dominant position in their traditional markets as well as establish strategic competitive position in its targeted mobile markets. If that means Intel needs to disappoint some analysts and sacrifice some margin in the process - so be it. What do analysts know about taking risks? Analysts are not entrepreneurs, they're not business leaders and they certainly don't run Fortune 50 companies. They have no experience competing in the big leagues and they no nothing about putting strategic objectives over the spreadsheet. To Intel I say, "do what you gotta do" to be a leader in your targeted markets.

I hope we have a much better CEO to follow him.</Msg><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1358521915238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:11:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358522015961-193</Id><Topic><Title>Intel and pet rock analogy</Title><Username>grgbrz</Username><Timestamp>1358521610492</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:06:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When bumped even a pet rock moves, doesn't mean it has life.

They contract with a 3rd party to buy shares. Intel gives that person a instructions or a plan on how to buy. They are restricted to buying at the BID or the LAST TRANSACTION PRICE. They are limited to the maximum number of shares that they can purchase. I think they are limited to 20% of the average of the last 5 days (or some similar algorithm) AND they cannot purchase in the last 10 minutes since Intel trading volume is high. Yesterday's high volume will allow Intel to purchase a few more shares.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358522031159</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:13:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358522037428-195</Id><Topic><Title>I bought Intel at 20 a year and a half ago.....</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358517059236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 08:50:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"what if you bought apple at $700 when the whole world was screaming - "apple headed to $1000"?"

It is as if INTC will never sell another CPU or any other product to anyone. Of course that is not the case. While Value Line has lowered its ranking of INTC, it still has a 3 to 5 year target price in the $30 to $40 range. Is there any reason NOT to buy more INTC at these prices? W.

Had I been brilliant and sold at the very top, I would have sold inside of a year and paid max capital gains. I would have bought back again at 25 or so and been sitting on a big loss AND having to write a big check to the IRS for Cap gains taxes. Instead, I'm making a very healthy Dividend, no longer am facing max gains and the longer I hold the more I get paid and my average cost goes lower and lower. I'm happy.

No. You are calling things as you see them. What you "see" may be accurate or it may not. Everyone has a lense that distorts what they see. That lense may be an unconscious filter or it may be a conscious one used to distort (positively or negatively). "So dont trust bumps like buy backs." In most cases, share buy backs are a bad idea. Companies convert cash to high multiple shares. The Intel case is in the one case that is different. The analogy that I like to use is: The market has given Intel a $6b loan and is charging them -1.5% interest. Intel borrowed money at 2.5% and is buying back shares at 4.0% dividend. Intel is paying off the loan with the 1.5% interest spread. Trust this particular buy back. It reduces share count by 300mil shares.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358522785275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:26:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358522806167-212</Id><Title>How does this pancake?</Title><Msg>I am amazed that a stock that making a big readjustment under such heavy volume just sits like a pancake at -1.35 for millions and millions of shares trading.</Msg><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358522806167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:26:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358522837180-213</Id><Topic><Title>How many shares did Intell buy today 50,000,000,000</Title><Username>kravcleve</Username><Timestamp>1358521737008</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:08:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the 21.5 trade.

In his tenure he crushed the AMD threat created in the Craig Barrett era with Conroe, Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge. Agreed, he had many missteps in mobile. His biggest mistake was putting Sean Maloney in charge of the company's mobile effort which resulted in a decade of wasted effort and money. Otellini did ultimately rectify that problem but the mistake cost Intel dearly and put it behind schedule. Now it's costing Intel more to compensate for the lost time. Fortunately they are profitable enough to afford mistakes but this was one they didn't need.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358523931876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:45:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358523940367-233</Id><Topic><Title>I'm in with 20k shares at $21.20</Title><Username>american_interest_first</Username><Timestamp>1358523015475</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:30:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and to think you could have spent that money on drugs</Msg><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358523940367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:45:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358523985247-234</Id><Topic><Title>How does this pancake?</Title><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358522806167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:26:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The pancake is going a little flat</Msg><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358523985247</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:46:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358524061224-235</Id><Topic><Title>hello new low..$19 comin..</Title><Username>tracer_0_0_1</Username><Timestamp>1358520369516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:46:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll be a buyer at 19.</Msg><Username>a_cramer_contrarian</Username><Timestamp>1358524061224</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:47:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358524156220-236</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's CEO Discusses Q4 2012 Results - Earnings Call Transcript</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358511350573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 07:15:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read the earnings call transcript, especially the Q&amp;A. The problematic thing is that Intel's costs are increasing more than revenues and earnings will be lower for 2013. They are specifically spending an additional $4B with ASML (above and beyond the $11B per year they are already spending on capital expenses), this will be spread over both 2013 &amp; 2014. This should drive profits in 2015 &amp; 2016 and maybe beyond... but for now the weight of higher expenses and lower profits will hang over the stock. I have been bullish, but I cannot justify holding the stock in 2013, maybe I will buy back in Jan 2014.</Msg><Username>trader_brad</Username><Timestamp>1358524156220</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:49:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358524201009-237</Id><Topic><Title>where's the big plunge?</Title><Username>wpjs</Username><Timestamp>1358522365213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:19:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's an "orderly exit", which usually happens over several days or a couple of weeks.</Msg><Username>a_cramer_contrarian</Username><Timestamp>1358524201009</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:50:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358524418106-238</Id><Title>If you want to complain to the FCC about CNBCs illegal bashing...</Title><Msg>Send an email.

I hope you make lots (cause then I will be along for the ride) I am long shares. short puts closted out my 150 $22.50 calls contracts (cost average 9 cents) at 100 for 16 cents, 40 for 23 cents and the last 10 yesterday at 43 cents when Intel was trading at $22.15. I could have time this much better but I had my puts and shares and so I booked some profits. I have found that If I consistently book the 50% or 100% profit on the calls, I can keep some of the $$$. If I wait for the home run, I book losses.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1358525862334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:17:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358525932552-263</Id><Topic><Title>How does this pancake?</Title><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358522806167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:26:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The -1.35 pancake continues</Msg><Username>curleyhoward2000</Username><Timestamp>1358525932552</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:18:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358525953499-264</Id><Topic><Title>Analysts keep Buy Rating</Title><Username>mshenocker</Username><Timestamp>1358524790663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:59:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the downgrades come after they sell most of their positions....Buy after the downgrades if you believe Intel is a good deal.</Msg><Username>aladiesright</Username><Timestamp>1358525953499</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:19:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358525956757-265</Id><Title>INTEL BACK TO 419 ROAD MAP AND THAN NEW LOW INN 2013 NEXT</Title><Msg>Win-tel monoply busted android and arm commodity chips rule..free from intel monoply tweak arm chips as you wish is the name of game on planet earth</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1358525956757</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:19:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358525990617-266</Id><Topic><Title>I bought Intel at 20 a year and a half ago.....</Title><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1358517059236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 08:50:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Negative, sometimes we're good or just lucky.

First of all that first statement you quoted just highlights how out of touch this guy is with the industry and further strengthens my initial post: "Tablets, smartphones and forthcoming wearable computers will become full blown computers" - Mr Otellini - this is the the industry calling - Tablets and smartphones already are FULL BLOWN COMPUTERS. They do all the same things and more...He as well as it seems from the color you added seem to thing what constitutes a computer is Win-Tel and that is that, in my opinion, is the type of thinking, hubris and myopic vision that put them in this situation in the first place. Sure we will see chips in everything and those everythings will get more and more powerful but they don't need to run Windows or run legacy x86 code to provide value to the consumer. Do you really think that running a legacy windows app (lets face it those the only apps where Windows leads aside from office) or some of those productivity apps on a mobile or other small device makes any sense? The mechanical and software form factors just don't translate! That is why windows CE stunk and only found it' way into industrial apps and mostly because of MS large dev community. Something MS has fractured in the last few years (which is hurting Intel) but I digress and won't go into my litany of how MS screwed the pooch (taking Intel and others with it). Now I can go on and on about all kinds of performance number as they relate to x86 and ARM but that only adds to my frustration about this market -adding more transistors, getting a few instructions per cycle etc is NOT the be all end. There are other value add pipelines that you can add for the this brave new world whether that being something optimized for graphics (like a gpu) or for video, or for gaming or automotive, music etc. The brawn over brains approach of simply crunching a few more bits won't set you apart. All you'll be doing is getting into an arms race with ARM's league of nations. If you think that ARM and all of it's licensee's are just going to concede to big bad Intel and go away think again and think IBM. Intel should put R&amp;D into mobile but be creative and think about the entire consumer pipeline and how you can leverage your cloud services and data center services, you desktop services, your communication services and your mobile services to provide unique and non reproducible experiences and solutions to your customers.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1358527213624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:40:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358527219675-282</Id><Topic><Title>Analysts keep Buy Rating</Title><Username>mshenocker</Username><Timestamp>1358524790663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:59:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It warrants the big drop because the estimates were lowered so much already.

Intel Reports Record Year and Record Fourth Quarter Full-Year Results • Revenue $43.6 billion, up $8.5 billion, 24 percent year-over-year • Gross margin of 66 percent, up 10 percentage points year-over-year • Operating income $15.9 billion, up $10.2 billion, 179 percent year-over-year • Net income $11.7 billion, up $7.3 billion, 167 percent year-over-year • EPS $2.05, up $1.28, 166 percent year-over-year Here we are 2 years later and some analysts are trumpetting "the death of the PC" tune and this cannot be good for Intel. So what happenned in 2012? Intel reported $53.3 Billion in revenues and $2.13 in EPS. EPS could have been much much higher if it were not for the costs that Intel decided to incur to extend its leadership in fabrication of chips (currently about 5 years), to steal huge market share in the coming years in smartphones and tablets is hybrids themselves don't do it alone. And for 2013, Intel is being very conservative and confident in actually giving a revenue guidance during an earnings call which is higher than 2012. That does not sound like the demand for PC is in trouble when most of what Intel will sell will be somewhat related to the PC. As for smartphones, Intel offerred its investors this fact, that many of their partners are waiting in line for the next great Intel solution for phones. Obviously, LTE being on top of their list. The promise of Intel based phone chips must be so promising for them to be willing to wait. And if anything, Intel will deliver in time. So "the death of the PC"? I don't think so.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1358527386897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 11:43:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358527555383-287</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to reach $24 in the after hours session</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1358455262358</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:41:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GREAT CALL, Jerry!

Same old same old in PCs, only Apple MACs seem to be still growing. And look what the fools are doing in mobile and data center - they're trying to replicate the PC strategy of hollowing out the device manufacturers and forcing all of the products to be mostly the same, just like in PCs. Where's the differentiation in Xeon-based servers? Not much. So the ARM-based guys are focusing on interesting system architecture, and people like Facebook are interested. So Intel's cloud CPU business is at risk, though probably not for a year or two. Still no leading mobile strategy, a weak tablet strategy - pathetic. Sorry, but fab process won't fix it all. The only bright spot looks like supercomputing. This is a conservative, incremental company increasing led by marketing people, faced with dramatic market changes, and they're lulled into confusion because their profits haven't evaporated yet. And rather than drive change the clueless CEO jumps ship after big speeches only months earlier that he had the best job in the world.

The reasons are simple. 1.) There wasn't any bad Intel news in the earnings report. There was the same ole mantra about sluggishness in PC sales of course but we knew that. And it's been baked in for six months now. For two quarters in a row, Wall Street has projected huge misses and they just didn't happen. 2.) There was the red herring about excessive Capex, which is, of course, not excessive. Otellini explained it but the analysts simply aren't smart enough to understand. No surprise there. Intel is building for the future with 450mm which they will use to crush ARMs economics but it's highly unlikely there will be anything left to crush by the time it arrives. Intel will have 10 and 7nm production by then. 3.) The economic news continues to be good and that's good for Intel. The US and Chinese economies are moving on up. Bump for Intel. 4.) Intel is still two bucks off the November low. The Q1 guidance is very conservative and Intel will beat it along with shorts, shills and analysts without breaking a sweat. 5.) We have the Cisco news and Mobile World Congress to provide a lift. By Q2, things will be looking better. Another beat for Intel as guidance will continue to be conservative for the first half of the year. 6.) By Q3 the world economy is going to be exceeding expectations and Haswell will be kicking in. By then, the Intel fabrication story will be getting traction as Intel's technology looks better and better as ARMs fabrication efforts fade to black. ARM has until July 1 to produce 20nm in volume. It will never happen. After that ARMs fabrication demise will start to crush their competitiveness. The ARM fabrication roadmap ends at 20nm planar. 7.) The major story out of the earnings call was that not a single analyst talked about fabrication. They are simply too ignorant. As is just about everyone on Wall Street. And it's all about the fabrication. Paul and Stacy talked about 22, 14 and 10nm production. Intel is currently working on 10nm. That's totally amazing but apparently not something the analysts have considered. At all. Oh, well. They will, they will. 8.) In Q4, Intel's 14nm production will show up and it's game over. ARM has nothing to compete with it. Nothing. Q1: Conservative guidance, easy beat. Cisco and MWC 2013 bumps. Q2: More conservative guidance, economies beat expectations, PC sales move up, another easy beat Q3: Haswell arrives, ARMs fabrication fade to black, Intel builds momentum Q4: Intel 14nm arrives, game over, Intel stock price doubles from 1/18/2013. So, there you have it. I hope shorts enjoy this little downturn. It's your last hurrah.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358530265034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:31:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358530333831-323</Id><Title>End of September, 2011</Title><Msg>This stock is known for dropping after run ups (22.98 to 20.40).... but look what happens right after.

How did Wall Street let this get out???] ["Otellini also promised 22nm Xeon and Atom products, targeting the micro-server market, later in the year, while stating that Intel would also be looking to begin production of its first 14nm products towards the end of the year - a bold claim when the company's competitors are still largely stuck on a 28nm process node."] Intel has been one of the companies hit by the slowing PC market, but you'd struggle to tell from its latest quarterly earnings report: the company has made $0.48 per share, higher than the $0.45 per share predicted for Q4 2012. Despite being hit by the slowing consumer interest in buying new PCs, which has seen shipments of desktops and laptops shrink 6.4 per cent year-on-year, Intel's latest earnings call reported impressive net income of $11 billion - based on $13.5 billion revenue - for the quarter to make up a total of $53.3 billion for the 2012 financial year. Even after everything was deducted, Intel came out of one of the toughest quarters yet with a profit of $2.5 billion for the quarter - and that's despite spending $1 billion to buy back 47 million shares of previously-public stock. 'The fourth quarter played out largely as expected as we continued to execute through a challenging environment,' claimed Paul Otellini, current Intel president and chief executive. 'We made tremendous progress across the business in 2012 as we entered the market for smartphones and tablets, worked with our partners to reinvent the PC, and drove continued innovation and growth in the data centre. As we enter 2013, our strong product pipeline has us well positioned to bring a new wave of Intel innovations across the spectrum of computing.' That isn't to say that Intel was unaffected by the overall market conditions, of course: the company's PC Client Group - responsible for desktop and laptop products - saw its revenue drop 1.5 per cent from Q3 and an impressive six per cent from the same quarter in 2011. The data centre group, meanwhile helped soften the blow with a seven per cent quarter-on-quarter growth and four per cent year-on-year. Coupled with a one per cent increase in gross margin and a tax rate of 23 per cent compared to an expected 27 per cent, that growth helped keep Intel well in the black. Otellini had some interesting claims to make as he revealed the figures to analysts and press during the company's conference call. 'It's no longer necessary to choose between a PC and a tablet,' he claimed. 'Convertibles and detachable, combined with Windows 8 and Touch, provide a two for one, no compromise computing experience. Ultrabooks have also served to accelerate the trend towards thinner and lighter notebooks. For example, the volume of systems less than one-inch thick grew 18-fold last year in the U.S., and we expect to see the same trend continue around the world.' Otellini was also hopeful for the company's smartphone and tablet products, boasting that there are now seven devices available across 20 countries using Intel's 32nm Medfield Atom system-on-chip processor - a start, but dwarfed by the number of devices using some variant on Cambridge-based rival ARM's IP. Otellini also discussed 22nm manufacturing, tri-gate technology and his company's partnership with ASML on extreme ultra-violet lithography (EUV) and 450mm wafer production. 'Looking ahead to 2013, I am excited about the strong pipeline of our products we have coming to market,' Otellini concluded. 'In the first half of this year we will launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable breakthrough innovations in form factor, battery life and usability. It will deliver the single largest generation-to-generation battery life improvement in Intel's history, and it is inspiring a new wave of ultra-sleek, convertible touch-based designs across our customer base.' Otellini also promised 22nm Xeon and Atom products, targeting the micro-server market, later in the year, while stating that Intel would also be looking to begin production of its first 14nm products towards the end of the year - a bold claim when the company's competitors are still largely stuck on a 28nm process node.

Cisco reportedly just signed up to be a big customer for Intel's new foundry business, where Intel will manufacture chips that its customers design, a big change from its past practice of only manufacturing its own chips. Cisco will become the largest customer, buying made-to-order networking chips, unnamed sources told Bloomberg reporters Ian King and Jordan Robertson. Cisco has long been a buyer of Intel chips, but this new contract would be for chips of Cisco's design, and would be a big win as Intel tries to expands into the $30.7 billion custom-silicon market. Intel announced its custom foundry plans about a year ago.

Intel has a gross margin of about 62 percent verses TSMC at 39 percent. Intel margins are clearly superior. Just one of the reasons the foundry fabless model is broken. Intel's R&amp;D is one of the reasons why it's operating margin is lower. It is also the reason it's technology and fabrication are highly superior to ARMs. It's most of the reason why ARM is having a fabrication crisis while Intel's fabrication moves seamlessly from node to node every eight quarters....]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358536007673</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:06:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358536028286-420</Id><Topic><Title>After I sold all my shares yesterday I posted to all sell before the market closed</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1358533182468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:19:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wrong board ragstock. you didnt post hear yesterday. you were annoying the people on the aapl board.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1358536028286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:07:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358536037204-421</Id><Title>Widows and Orphans Stock</Title><Msg>Intel is now a Widows and Orphans stock.

The company said it also committed to buy another 5 percent of ASML's shares for about $1 billion in the relatively near future. Intel also committed to provide more than $1 billion to ASML's R&amp;D programs for EUV and 450-mm. The chip giant said the investment would accelerate the deployment of these technologies by as much as two years. As part of the deal, Intel also committed to advanced purchase orders for 450-mm and EUV development and production tools from ASML, the company said Intel wants to deploy EUV lithography at the 10-nm node in the second half of 2015. But the company has also said it would be prepared to extend optical immersion lithography to that node in the event that EUV is not ready. Many chip industry observers believe the technology will not be commercially viable by that time. Because Intel designs chips about two years ahead of production, the company must make a decision relatively soon on the type of lithography it plans to use at the 10-nm node.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1358536829067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:20:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358536938326-439</Id><Topic><Title>Excitement's Over</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358536548060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:15:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep pumping Waldo, it appears to be the only thing you're good at, cause you sure suck at realizing profits.

Day-Traders Lose Big, Still Live in Denial: 77% of American Traders are “Losers” While 82% of Day-Traders in Taiwan-China Are Bigger “Losers” by Paul B Farrell, JD, PhD Behavioral finance researchers have studied the performance of stock market traders in both America and Asia. Interestingly, they discovered that traders in both countries under-perform the world’s broad markets by significant amounts. One study analyzed 66,400 accounts at a major Wall Street firm over a seven-year period. Another studied all the active traders on the Taiwan, China exchange. In spite of the cultural differences, the results were virtually the same. Why? Due to the high transaction costs, taxes and bad decisions, the bottom line is simple: “The more you trade the less you earn.” In fact, about 80% of all day traders lose money. In researching the Americans, the study found that the active investors who turned over their portfolios 258% annually made less than 12% on their money. Passive investors who bought and held, with only 2% portfolio turnover, had average returns of roughly 18%, which is about fifty percent higher than the returns of the active investors. Still, investors believe they can “beat The Street,” simple because the Wall Street “Hype Machine” has programmed them to believe that myth. It was billed as a “debate,” on a nationally syndicated show. Me, a buy’n’holder to the core, versus John Mauldin, author of the Bull’s Eye Investor and Millennium Wave Investments, a newsletter publisher and investment adviser. John’s a guy who’s not only pro-trading, he hates a buy’n’hold strategy with a passion. So why’s he against buy’n’hold? Well, a good part of the reason is he believes the market’s going nowhere for the rest of this decade, maybe longer. Volatile, risky, unpredictable. But, he ‘s convinced that by using active and aggressive strategies, you can beat the market. Mauldin is so thoroughly convinced that if you don’t give up on a long-term buy’n’hold strategy and actively engage in alternative strategies (such as hedge funds, gold stocks and trading in value stocks), you’ll lose a lot of money and retire a pauper. So, who won the debate? Buy’n’hold or the hyper-active Bull’s Eye Investor? Nobody! In fact, nobody ever wins this debate. Nobody. Ever! Different DNA? Then you better play a “different game” Why? Probably because over ninety percent of American investors are born with a buy’n’hold gene. They are born as passive investors who instinctively tend toward well-diversified portfolios of low-cost index funds. They don’t have the time, or money or the interest in active portfolio management, nor do they trust in the market or in professional market experts. Meanwhile, the DNA of other ten percent or less—those macho “Bull’s Eye Investors”—contains a rare over-confidence gene that pumps an “I’m-convinced-I-will-beat-the-market” drug directly into their veins and brains. Of course the odds are against them beating the averages, but that gene also contains a blocker that suppresses contrary negative information—even when they’re on a losing streak. The brain chemistry and psychological profiles of these two types of investors are world’s apart. If you listened to a debate between passive Main Street investors and Bull’s Eye Investors you’d think you were talking to two aliens, one from Mars, the other from Venus. Warning, 82% of all day traders are losers! But deny it! Moreover, never the twain shall meet. Each type of investor is as dogmatic as the other. DNA-based ideologies control each one, not rationality. Why? Their minds are made up in advance. Their opinions and beliefs were already cast in stone long ago. To each, facts about the other are totally irrelevant. Indeed, that was a given from the start, as I found out once again in our so-called debate. Here’s why: Just before this little debate we discovered some interesting new data from a BusinessWeek article. The bottom line is simple—most traders are losers. Earlier, Forbes reported on a study that the “North American Securities Administrators found that 77% of day traders lost money.” Now comes more evidence, BusinessWeek was reporting that 82% of all day traders lose money. That data comes from a recent study by a couple professors at the University of Taipei working in conjunction with University of California behavioral finance professors Terry Odean and Brad Barber. And yes, that is the same Odean and Barber who researched 66,400 Wall Street investors a decade ago and concluded, “The more you trade the less you earn.” In fact, their earlier study proved that the returns of passive buy’n’hold investors (with just two percent turnover) were a whopping 50 percent higher than the returns of the most active traders (averaging 258 percent annual turnover). Why? Very simple, transaction costs, commissions and taxes were killing returns. In the new study four behavioral finance professors had access to all the records of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) for the 1995-1999 period. Not just 66,400 randomly selected accounts in Wall Street’s huge database of millions of clients, but all 100 percent of the traders on TSE, including their identities, a total of 925,000 investors. Assuming the DNA of a Taiwanese trader is essentially the same as the DNA of a trader at Goldman, Morgan or Merrill, the new Odean-Barber study results actually confirm what we already know, that market timing and day-trading are a loser’s game. Dumb and dumber—and yet, they can’t stop losing All this research also shows that the most active traders—a small group equaling about one percent of all traders—actually accounted for over half of all the exchange’s volume. However, while those guys did make money in their trading—after transaction costs were deducted they were net losers. The study actually went much deeper: Listen to this new bit of information about the strange self-sabotaging obsession traders have to lose money: The study separated the traders into six groups depending on their past successes. The researchers wanted to see if past winners repeated. The answer was yes, but at a very high cost: – The average winning trader did in fact repeat as a winner, netting $251 a day after transaction costs. But overall, things were so bad that 82% of all the traders lost money, for an average loss of $45 a day. – That’s right: Out of 925,000 traders in the study, about 750,000 of them were losers. And assuming 250 trading days a year, each trader lost roughly $11,250 a year for a total loss of about $8.4 billion annually. – On the other hand, the 175,000 repeat winners each made an estimated $62,750 a year after transaction costs, for a total annual gain by the winners of roughly $11 billion. So even the small number of the top-performing traders made only $62,750 a year for all their risk-taking. Big deal? It gets even worse. Remember, those study covered the manic trading days of the late nineties. Those were the heady go-go days of the great bull market when even 30 percent returns on funds were considered so-so. Those were the days when over a couple hundred funds generated returns in excess of 100 percent in 1999, many over 300 percent—the days when few lost money. Chimp makes chump of best day-traders Let me remind you of one very unique “competitor” in the trading world at the time: Raven the chimpanzee! Raven created a winning portfolio by throwing darts to pick stocks—regularly beating even hot portfolio managers returning 300% annually on the Monkeydex portfolio. So the joke’s on all of America’s hot-shot traders. And just in case you think this is just a cute joke, for several years The Wall Street Journal ran a regular contest pitting dart-throwing versus picks based on a comment made by Princeton Professor Burton Malkiel in his classic, A Random Walk Down Wall Street: “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by the experts.” In short, the new study is a huge embarrassment for the online discount trading firms, for example, who hype the payoffs from trading. Unfortunately, their trader-clients are not only big losers, the 82 percent who are repeat losers are so blind and dumb that they stay in this loser’s game, in denial, and just kept on losing. That’s the trader’s DNA at work! Dumb, dumber … now the dumbest Worse yet, the “winners” were the dumbest of all. The so-called winning traders were not only making less than Raven the monkey, they were making less than a buy’n’hold investor would have made from a portfolio with a thousands just sitting passively in tech funds and stocks in the 1995-1999 period. So once again our hat’s off to Odean and Barber, their two studies confirm the truth about trading, that … trading is a loser’s game. The only people who really make money trading on a regular basis are the service professionals, especially the commission brokers. These pros make their commissions no matter how much investors and traders lose. Even in bear markets their ads paint a deceptive picture aimed at the wannabe trader’s super-confident but addictive and self-sabotaging genes—ads designed to convince naïve wannabe traders that the pros have some special secret that’ll beat the market—secrets they’re willing to share for a fee, naturally. The truth is: They can’t … they never do … and they never will beat the market … no matter how long they try … trading’s a loser‘s game. But as I found out one more time in this “debate,” as I do in every “debate” with an expert who may be making a living selling trading secrets … I may as well have been trying to convince Raven the chimpanzee that eventually he too would lose, and lose big. In that respect however, chimpanzees are superior to human traders. The trader’s DNA control their brains, they have no choice but to keep chasing the impossible dream that they can beat the market. The truth is, they’re addicted to losing. The pros know this, so they can take advantage of the wannabe traders never-ending delusional “winner’s fantasy.” And the game goes on ad infinitum, with the pros having a big laugh as they rake off big fees and commissions and get rich off the 82 percent of all traders who are repeat losers.</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1358537942011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:39:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358538015611-451</Id><Topic><Title>vix pretty low</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358535495810</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:58:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot of people have lost money betting on the VIX in the past month.

This may provide swing traders with an opportunity for a short position, as such a crossover often suggests lower prices in the near term.Intel Corporation designs, manufactures, and sells computer components and related products. The Company's major products include microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors and microcontrollers, flash memory products, graphics products, network and communications products, systems management software, conferencing products, and digital imaging products. Potential upside of 7.2% exists for Intel, based on a current level of $21.25 and analysts' average consensus price target of $22.78. The stock should hit resistance at its 200-day moving average (MA) of $24.23, as well as support at its 50-day MA of $20.65. In the past 52 weeks, shares of Intel have traded between a low of $19.16 and a high of $29.27 and are now at $21.25, which is 11% above that low price. Over the past week, the 200-day moving average (MA) has gone down 0.5% while the 50-day MA has remained constant. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1358538923288</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:55:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358538924817-460</Id><Topic><Title>screaming buy right now</Title><Username>erosym1</Username><Timestamp>1358538563091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:49:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dawn of the dead</Msg><Username>kublican</Username><Timestamp>1358538924817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:55:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358539062480-461</Id><Topic><Title>buy and hold market now</Title><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1358537451503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:30:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The truth is: They can’t … they never do … and they never will beat the market … no matter how long they try … trading’s a loser‘s game.

According to a Bloomberg report, the world's largest chip maker will soon be making made-to-order processors for networking giant Cisco (NSDQ:CSCO). The report, which cites two anonymous sources with knowledge of the agreement, states Intel will soon begin manufacturing processors for Cisco networking products. Cisco already uses Intel chips in many of its products, but the new agreement will see Intel's foundry business manufacture custom processors designed by Cisco itself. Last year, Intel opened up its processor manufacturing operations to third parties, effectively shifting the company to a made-to-order chip-making business.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358539067683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:57:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358539123123-463</Id><Title>110 Million Shares With an Hour To Go</Title><Msg>Wow...

The strategy of using x86 architecture for everything *requires* better fab process to even get in the game. Cloud systems use scale-out architecture, and that means that the processing power of each server is less important than in most enterprise systems. The way the servers communicate and manage memory will be more important than how fast the CPUs are. And don't tell me about all of Intel's network investments. They bought weak sisters behind the competition. This is one sick old dog that used to win races, so everyone thinks it can win another race.

Hand helds and tablets and very thin clients and need computing power to make them effective. Intel is the leader in making the microprocessor in these server and will not go away. If they were smart they would raise the price on these componets and reap a higher margin. Also, PC's will always be needed in business, schools, hospitals and government. Handhelds are great and have taken market share from PC's but the core use is still needed. The reason for the decline in growth is the PC industry staturated its marketing strategy, newer is better and faster, which is not true anymore.

This has been the challenge for Intel for the last 2 to 3 years, which it has overcome with Medfield/Clover Trail+. But for this market transition, Intel's management has demonstrated continuously that it has a seasoned team that is capable of estimating future volumes and planning production around it. I find it very absurd that analyst firms think that these decisions may be whimsical on Intel's part and are concerned about Intel's capital spending levels. On the contrary, I think the huge capital spending outlay for 2013 is an indication that there are huge design and customer wins (both for own x86 production and foundry) in the pipeline. CEO, Paul Otellini is the previous conference call Q3-2012 had indicated that some of the customer wins have not been announced due to the difficulty in transitioning from foundries to Intel - some of which may be for smartphone manufacturers transitioning from ARM to x86. On its part, Intel should shed some of its conservativeness and provide more information to the investing community on its customer and design wins.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1358542289305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:51:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358542289611-516</Id><Title>Hardworking Wallisweaver closing out another 80 hour work week</Title><Msg>Oh wait......</Msg><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1358542289611</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:51:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358542480128-517</Id><Topic><Title>EU States to Send IMF $267 Billion in New Crisis Fight</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1323411054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-12-09 01:10:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suppose if I ever get married all of this will have to stop. ------------------- You should have plenty of women pursuing you what with all the $$$ you made trading Intel, Buttplug.</Msg><Username>lucifer_nuff</Username><Timestamp>1358542480128</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:54:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358542579268-518</Id><Topic><Title>Do analysts really think that Intel's capital spending is without solid basis?</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1358542289305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:51:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately, I seriously suspect market manipulation by MMs and institutions.

It's like the wingnut that just told me. It's about making money. Or manipulating people out of money. Or defrauding people out of money. Or scaring people out of money. Or tricking people out of money. He very clearly indicated that ethics had no place in investing. That's your drooling mob momentum crowd at work. You just get things started and wait for them to show up. It happens because the people with the money make the rules. What happened to the uptick rule? Why doesn't naked shorting get policed? Why was high-speed trading ever allowed? You trace all of this unethical behavior and it leads right to Wall Street's largest firms. They could care less how they transfer your money to their pockets. So, let's not pretend that this isn't happening.

Unfortunately, the stock price is a reflection of everyone dealing in that stock, including them. When the sheep read the news and think it is bad, and the smart folks with the big money read the news and regardless of their own analysis to the contrary, *still* sell or short, because they know the sheep will do that, you have a self-fulfilling tide. What you are really trying to do, if you want to get rich, is predict what the big money thinks the sheep will do. Does big money think the sheep will see the good in Intel's report, or even READ the report, for that matter? No. Hence, your move yesterday should have been sell because you know the big money follows the sheep which in the case of Intel basically sell on every earnings report unless its blowout earnings or some other earth-shattering announcement that even the sheep can understand.

These are all very good reasons to continue their plan and investments.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1358547943670</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:25:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358548169629-571</Id><Title>2013 will become the year of INTC's THUNDERBOLT</Title><Msg>2013 will become the year of INTC's THUNDERBOLT.

There is this BIG noise/stink about Intel increasing capex and nobody really knows what's going on. $2 billion are allocated to 450 mm which means it's NOT used to add capacity. Intels capex that actually results in (added) capacity is flat - but the media is repeating the same chit over and over again. Three months ago.... In response to end-demand softness, Intel as expected is reducing its 2012 capex "pretty significantly" to $11.0B-$11.6B, a full billion dollars below its trajectory a month ago. CFO Stacy Smith reiterated the reasoning: reign in utilization to clear out inventory until demand recovers, and keep reusing existing equipment in its 14nm node efforts. "We are taking down utilization in the factories down to sub 50% again to take inventory out and free up the opportunity to move both space and equipment and redirect that to 14nm," noted Smith. He specifically declined to issue a forecast for 2013 capex, saying it will depend on unit growth and visibility into 2014 -- but "right now we want to fight through a Q4 where we don't have a lot of visibility before we lock in on a 2013 number."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1358553621894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:00:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358553918495-601</Id><Topic><Title>Not a peep from TSMC about 20nm.

Given that Intel /quotes/zigman/20392/quotes/nls/intc INTC -6.31% is expected to report Thursday that fourth-quarter sales were slightly down year over year, a significant production cut is the only way the company can bring down its bloated chip inventory. In the 12 months ended in September, Intel’s inventory rose by 34% to a record $5.3 billion. During that same time, sales fell by 5% at $13.5 billion. As a result, inventory rose from 28% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011 to 39% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012. (See chart below.) Intel’s inventory Percentage of sales Q3 2011: $4 billion 28% Q4 2011: $4.1 billion 30% Q1 2012: $4.5 billion 35% Q2 2012: $4.9 billion 36% Q3 2012: $5.3 billion 39% Even if the company reduced chip output to the target its executives set in October, Intel’s inventory will have ended 2012 significantly higher than it was a year earlier — both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue. That’s a major concern for a company whose biggest customers (like Intel itself) are posting sales that are either flat or falling slightly.</Msg><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1358566195074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 22:29:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358566452634-629</Id><Title>CES 2013: ARM’s state of the nation</Title><Msg>"ARM’s Director Segment Marketing, Client Computing, Jeff Chu started our interview with a bold statement; ARM, he said, is really at the heart of CES this year with most major announcements happening in and around the event involving the British company in a way or another."

Imprint litho firm claims 450-mm first Peter Clarke 1/18/2013 10:36 AM EST LONDON – Imprint lithography firm Molecular Imprints Inc. said Thursday (Jan. 17) that one of its machines is being used by an unnamed semiconductor company to support the development of chip production on 450-mm diameter wafers. The company claimed that the availability of the machine would shorten the semiconductor industry's transition to 450-mm wafers by at least two years. Molecular Imprints (Austin, Texas) said its Imprio 450 machine was accepted by the unnamed semiconductor company at the end of 2012. The unit is being used as part of a multi-year wafer services development contract, according to the company. Last week, at the Industry Strategy Symposium organized by fab tool vendor trade group SEMI, Robert Bruck, a corporate vice president at Intel Corp., showed one of the first fully-patterned 450-mm diameter wafers. The J-FIL imprint lithography technology has demonstrated 24-nm patterning with line edge roughness of less than 2-nm to 3 sigma and critical dimension uniformity to 1.2-nm 3 sigma. It offers the prospect of 10-nm patterning with single-step process. "In an era where multi-year and multi-billion dollar optical lithography development programs are becoming the norm we were able to design, build and deliver an advanced nanoimprint platform in just one year from receiving the customer's purchase order," said Mark Melliar-Smith, CEO of Molecular Imprints, in a statement. He added that the capabilities of the Imprio 450 were well aligned to the needs of semiconductor memory manufacturing but that the company is alos making progress towards placing J-FIL technology into high volume production of advanced CMOS devices.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1358569591494</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 23:26:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
