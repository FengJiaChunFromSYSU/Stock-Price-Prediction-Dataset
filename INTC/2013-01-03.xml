In fact, GF's 14nm process may have smaller features than Intel's 14nm process because, says Mojy Chian senior vp at Globalfoundries, because "Intel's terminology doesn't typically correlate with the terminology used by the foundry industry. For instance Intel's 22nm in terms of the back-end metallisation is similar to the foundry industry's 28nm. The design rules and pitch for Intel's 22nm are very similar to those for foundries' 28nm processes." Jean-Marc Chery, CTO of STMicroelectronics points out that the drawn gate length on Intel's ˜22nm" process is actually 26nm. Furthermore Intel's triangular fins, which degrade the advantages of finfet processing could underperform GF's rectangular fins which optimise the finfet advantage. At the front of the GF 14nm finfet node will be mobile SOCs says Chian. GF has been working with ARM since 2009 to optimise its processes for ARM-based SOCs. At TSMC the first tape-out on its 16nm finfet process is expected at the end of next year. That test chip will be based on ARM's 64-bit V8 processor. Using an ARM processor to validate its 16-nm finfet process should give TSMC's ARM-based SOC customers great confidence. Asked about the effects of finfets on ARM-based SOCs, East replies: "There'ss no rocket science in what you get out of it. The question is does it deliver the benefits at an acceptable cost? You don't get something for nothing. How much does it cost to manufacture? How good is the yield? And that, of course, affects cost." And so on goes Intel beating its head against the wall to get into the low-margin mobile business. Recently Intel said it expected its Q4 gross margin to drop 6% from Q3's 63% to 57%. Shock, horror said the analysts But if Intel succeeds in the mobile business, its gross margin will drop a lot more than that. It's a funny old world.</Msg><Username>repklikint</Username><Timestamp>1357191319997</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 00:35:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357192131901-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Making Apple's ARM Chips Will Leave Samsung Behind</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357188814214</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 23:53:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clearly, I'm not as influenced by the hype generated by Intel's well-oiled old marketing machine.

It is the result of ten year's of hard work on top of quite a bit of vision which no one else in the industry had. Which is the reason that Intel has such a huge lead in fabrication. The huge lead in fabrication has allowed Intel to put in place the foundation to move past ARM in power efficiency and to thereby eat up huge portions of the mobility market. It's only your ignorance that causes you to think that three years is a long time in the chip business. It's about one process node. Doesn't matter if you call it hype or totally ignore it. It's the dominant factor in what happens from here on out. There's nothing you can do about it and there's nothing ARM can do about it. Once Intel brought out FinFET three to four years ahead of anyone else, it was game over. We know what is going to happen now. We're just watching it play out. Well, I'm watching and admiring. You are watching and denying. Doesn't matter, Intel is going to own mobility.

Down 50%</Title><Msg>Ratings Drop Sharply For Hannity At Fox The two most popular commentators on Fox News, by far, are Bill O'Reilly (who gets about 4.1 million viewers) and Sean Hannity (who gets slightly less than 4 million viewers). Fox already had O'Reilly locked into a long-term contract, and last April they moved to do the same for Hannity. Although the salary numbers were not released, it is known that Hannity has been signed through the 2016 campaign season at least. This had the Fox News executives feeling pretty smug -- at least until the election debacle that was totally misjudged by Fox commentators. For months before the election, Hannity preached to his viewers that Willard Mitt Romney was a lock to win the election, and he brought on a whole cadre of right-wingers to back up his perception. Even when polls began to show that Romney was falling short of expectations, especially in the critical swing states, Hannity keep up his misguided prediction (saying the polls were skewed and Romney was really ahead). It is because of this total misreading of the American electorate by Hannity and his Fox News cohorts, that right-wingers (who depend exclusively on Fox for their "news") were so shocked at the real thumping the Republicans received on election night. Now Fox News might be regretting the long contract they gave Hannity, because it looks like a large part of his audience has abandoned him (perhaps angry because he was so badly wrong about the election). Hannity's December numbers have dropped from nearly 4 million viewers to around 1.95 million viewers. That's a drop in his rating of nearly 50%. And that's not all of the bad news. In the 25 to 54 age demographic (the group most coveted by advertisers), the drop was even more -- falling more than 50%. In addition, for the first time at least two of the MSNBC commentators have received ratings higher than Hannity's. Those commentators are Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell. A few months ago, most people would not have thought that was possible. O'Reilly fared a little better than Hannity did. His viewership only dropped by about 30%. The December ratings show he lost about 1.1 million viewers. It's starting to look like even right-wingers don't appreciate being lied to and told that things are going their way when the opposite is true.</Msg><Username>hector_cornholed_amders</Username><Timestamp>1357223143877</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 09:25:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357223615175-19</Id><Topic><Title>Lucy Has 85 New Daddies</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357197764813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 02:22:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lucy's obviously your Daddie since you can't not only ignore him, you start threads about him on a message board at midnight.

'How well do you think journalists (Anandtech in particular) cover your latest architecture? It seems to go over a majority of the tech-news writers' heads... When journalists attempt to pry into your CPUs to determine some undisclosed facts that you never released, how often do they hit the nail on the head? Is withholding this information from them just a cat and mouse game? Where do you read your tech news? Are you worried at all about reverse engineering efforts by competitors (ie is this common in your field)? Are protection mechanisms designed at the manufacturing/materials level or logical/layout level? Was Global Foundary's split from AMD a wise move? Purchase of ATI wise? Pentium 4 era was obviously a cluster-f. Interesting enough, AMD has started to wander down this path in their latest processors -- hoping to get to higher frequencies with longer pipelines. There has to be SOME technical justification for AMD to 'repeat' the past's mistakes. What technical detail is elusively close yet fails to be reached time and again? How many transistors/gates are hand-laid vs computer synthesized on a modern processor? Old Pentium Pro era videos shown at colleges indicated a heavy reliance on manual design for large sections, although I assume this isn't the case anymore. Would an undergraduate EE have any possibility of an interview? Or is a Master essentially required? ANSWERS I will thank them all for you. The space race is what got me interested in engineering so I know where you're coming from. Here are your answers (some long because you asked some great questions): Anandtech and Real World Tech (sometimes The Tech Report) are the best sites with the most accurate information. Especially with Real World Tech, we are sometimes surprised at the accuracy of many of the inferences. Anandtech's latest Haswell preview is also excellent; missing some key puzzle pieces to complete the picture and answer some open questions or correct some details but otherwise great. They get close (see above). There are a couple of things to note here: sometimes the architectural information is not enough, the circuit implementation is incredibly important and that is not often discussed. I guess it's lower on the totem pole. Sometimes we do keep some information from the press that end up in patents, conference papers, etc... But eventually we disclose everything, I think is because we try to outdo ourselves every generation as well as being proud and wanting to share our accomplishment. Ask Apple for a disclosure of Swift. I like Real World Tech the most and find that Anandtech and The Tech Report do good jobs too. I also read Semiaccurate for its humor value and to level set. No and there are little protection mechanisms once it's in customer's hands. By the time they're able to reverse engineering, we're on to the next thing. And even then their implementations tend to not be as good (see AMD power gate efficiency and leakage). Here I referred only to hardware/circuits because security features are a different matter. They didn't have a choice if they wanted to stay in business. They do not have enough silicon revenue to sustain it. In retrospect the ATI purchase was necessary, the sad part is they did overpay by a large margin. Also execution missteps in coming out with their "APUs" allowed us to come very close. In my mind, Netburst, much as it's maligned, brought some very good things internally for Intel design teams. First, unbelievable circuit expertise (the FP logic was running at 8GHz in Prescott stock!). Next, the trace cache which you can see reimplemented in Sandy and Ivy Bridge. Also, SMT. Building a validation team that could validate the beast pre- and post-silicon. The power-perf thinking i.e. frequency through power savings. Finally, the development of tools and project management required to do that kind of extreme design. All of these learning continue to this day and it's a very large contributor to why in client and server CPUs Intel can sustain the roadmap we have. I can't say. But the most important, performance and power sensitive parts are still hand-drawn. Otherwise you can't get past around 1.8GHz on Intel 22nm without losing too much perf from overhead. Yes, we have tons of UG interns and most of our hires have BS. MS is always helpful, but do it for your own personal growth and interest, not to get a job. If you're interested PM me.' 'AMD had to sell their fabs, otherwise they wouldn't be in business today. There are advantages to having fabs. You'll see many things, especially with Broadwell, that you cannot do without owning a fab.' ' What are the PC's inside intel that you guys use on a day to day basis like? Are they using hardware that has not been released to the public? Are there working prototypes of future processors that aren't even supposed to come out for a couple more years (such as broadwell)? As a person who just bought an Ivy-bridged based system, is there anything you can tell me to convince myself to save up for a haswell or broadwell system? ANSWERS Yes and no. For day-to-day, our laptops have regular Ivy Bridge processors. Most of the heavy lifting though happens in our datacenters. There we do have cherry picked, specially-fused parts to run our high compute workloads. The most interesting scenario I can recount is we used our Haswell A0 silicon to tape out the subsequent steppings, thus "validating" it. Yes. Many in the labs, used in publications. For products, we have things in the labs well in advance because it takes time to get them up to snuff. What do you usually do with your system? If you like to overclock, Haswell is worth it (can't tell you why but read the Haswell Anandtech preview very carefully for buried treasure). On-die graphics is improving quite a bit as well. If you're into energy efficiency or even more graphics, Broadwell. I think the tech community will be very pleasantly surprised with Broadwell. But I'm biased, so we'll just going to have to prove it the hard way.' 'Q:I've been told that Intel CPU's are still completely hand laid out. Is this true? Do you see Intel transitioning blocks to Place &amp; Route for CPUs in the near future? Does intel use a custom toolset or vendor supplied like synposis, cadence, etc...? A: All of the analog circuitry, arrays, and performance-sensitive parts are definitely hand-drawn (schematics) and hand laid out. We're one of the few places that actually still do this (apparently Apple does too). You can tell which parts were laid out by hand if you look at die photos. As for tools, we definitely use many custom tools. For some things we do use Synopsys and Cadence tools when it doesn't make sense to develop internally. But, I think more interesting, is we develop on Linux systems and use all sorts of Open Source software.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357224873579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 09:54:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357226028786-21</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Plans iPhones In More Sizes, More Colors, Analyst Says</Title><Username>bacbacker3</Username><Timestamp>1357182232321</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 22:03:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have an iphone5 , it could not be any faster that I can see.

Stock is ridiculously undervalued. x86 is reducing its power greater than ARM is raising its performance and wave after wave of Tick-Tock of both Core and Atom over the coming years will roll back East's cocky ARMy back into the cheap slots. Thus the current P/E is unwarranted and too pessimistic. The stock might take a year to start recovering though as the OEMs complete changing their inventory to the new form factor mixes and the new low power Ivy Bridges and Atoms and Haswells get up to full volume and Windows 8 gets accepted. Just a matter of time though, everybody's roadmap is out there to see for years to come and Intel's is the strongest by some measure.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357232281122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 11:58:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357232793142-26</Id><Topic><Title>Will INTC do a double in 2013?</Title><Username>keeperoftheq</Username><Timestamp>1357163616175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 16:53:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD may even get some profit one of these years.</Msg><Username>andresfandom</Username><Timestamp>1357232793142</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 12:06:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357232869515-27</Id><Topic><Title>(((MANY EXAMPLES WHERE AMD HIT LOWS AND RALLIED UP 224% - 509%)))</Title><Username>keeperoftheq</Username><Timestamp>1356148387458</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:53:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUMPruptcy won't make any difference!!!

Qualcomm's single threaded performance advantage is obvious in interacting with the ATIV Tab, particularly for any work on the desktop (modern UI remains fairly smooth across all platforms). Application performance and web browsing performance are at worst equal to NVIDIA's Tegra 3, but at best are tangibly better. Intel continues to have the overall performance advantage (not to mention backwards compatibility), but at times Qualcomm remains surprisingly competitive in many of our tests. Ultimately even Atom isn't quick enough to fulfill the dream of having a tablet that can really replace a modern notebook, and that's where the Windows RT/8 cookie crumbles for now. I suspect that once we get to the next generation of SoCs we'll see a better story from all of the vendors (22nm Atom, Cortex A15 based Wayne, Krait 200/300 from Qualcomm). The ATIV Tab itself feels fairly well executed. Its performance is snappy (for Windows RT) and unlike my W510 experience, I didn't encounter much instability during my use of the Tab. Battery life is better than any other Windows RT or 8 tablet we've tested thus far. The Samsung/Qualcomm combination excels in video playback battery life in particular, giving us the first 10-inch tablet capable of lasting as long as a modern iPad in our video playback test. Web browsing battery life is also quite competitive, equaling the Clover Trail based Samsung ATIV Smart PC.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1357239754980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:02:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357239778369-51</Id><Topic><Title>INTC halted for a moment there.</Title><Username>dimebag_eddie</Username><Timestamp>1357239160616</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:52:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yesssssssss!!!!

The numbers behind these functions have changed somewhat in the last few years to Intel disadvantage. Therefore, its no longer a question of if but when the foundries will catch up and start leading this aspect. Intel is an overgrown company with no teeth." [Foundry Capex is definitely not determined by the demand for ARM chips. Demand is going up while the number of foundries capable of raising the money to do state-of-the-art fabrication has constantly declined. Only Intel, Samsung and TSMC can afford the massive costs of new fabrication facilities and TSMC is in danger of dropping off the list. You do know why they call all the ARM shops "fabless", right? This "fabless" dynamic is why many say that the ARM foundry model is totally broken. The ARM shops don't pony up for Capex. So, it's silly to say that this factor works in ARMs favor and will allow them to catch up in fabrication. It's the biggest reason why they will never catch up...]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357245020564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 15:30:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357245272309-76</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings whisper number is higher than consensus estimate</Title><Username>jerry.blown</Username><Timestamp>1357241088313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:24:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>diarrhea is too cruel. you should allow regular movements too!!! i preferr the 1812 oveture da, da, da, da, da,..... da, DA, .... , PLUNK when you drop it into a toilet, what sound does a coinmaker?????

The Chinese economy is on the road to recovery: "Following a year tainted by heightened economic uncertainty, the world's second largest economy is setting itself up for a positive 2013, say analysts, pointing to China's latest economic data and stellar equity market performance." 2.) The world economy is on the road to recovery: ""This is great news for global growth," AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said." 3.) The US economy continues to improve: "There is good reason to think that 2013 will finally be the year that the U.S. economic recovery really feels like a recovery: The biggest forces that have been holding the economy back finally seem to be subsiding." 4.) The economic situation in Europe continues to improve: "A year ago, many people seriously doubted whether the euro would still exist by now. On the threshold of 2013, the debate is about how long it will take for the Eurozone economy to recover and what must be changed to avoid future crisis." 5.) Intel will get a big boost from economic recovery and from its robust 2013 roadmap as its fabrication accelerates just as ARMs coasts to a stop. 6.) Intel will get a major boost from both CES in January and the Mobile World Congress in February. Look for LTE in the US and lots of tablet news as Intel gets out of the gate quickly in 2013. 7.) 2013 looks to be the year of big moves as deals and innovation promise to bust Intel out from under the control of the Wall Street manipulators. 8.) Intel is preparing to take the lead in the power efficiency race in 2013 while continuing its significant lead in performance. 9.) 2013 will be a watershed year for Intel in terms of traction for its mobility strategic plan. 10.) 2013 will be the year that FinFET and 14nm production finally get the kudos they deserve.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1357246459407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 15:54:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357246669272-80</Id><Topic><Title>BUY,BUY,BUY jerry.blown has a insider that said there going to beat the lowered 55 cents.

We will find out soon. If you haven't read about the leaked Merrifield benchmarks here it is: Intel Merrifield SoC benchmark scores online Posted by: Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 12/31/2012 02:04 PM | 25 comment(s) ] Interesting, some benchmark score of Intel's Redhookbay, which is equipped with a dual-core Merrifield SoC (for smartphones), hit the web. In the graphics performance NenaMark2 benchmark the chip reaches a score of 58.30 fps (but that might be limited due to a 60 FPS cap). In the more general AnTuTu benchmark it scores 31612 points (!) and that is nearly three times as much as the Exynos 4412 based Samsung Galaxy S III and the Tegra 3 based HTC One X. Redhookbay is shown as running Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, with a 1280 x 720 resolution display and the multi-core Merrifield, which scored 31,612 on AnTuTu benchmark. The processor is between 1.6GHz and 2GHz. The reported GPU is a PowerVR SGX 544MP. Unlike the Medfield, Merrifield offers 4G LTE support. So far, performance tests of the demo handsets have been impressive, but power consumption is also a critical factor and Intel has yet to disclose full details of Medfield's performance in this critical area.

Once upon a time, it had a stranglehold supplying chips to computing devices, but that's loosening now that consumers increasingly connect via smartphones and tablets with no Intel inside. Will Intel see another symbolic loss in valuation in 2013? Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) isn't far behind now At the rate that the two are going, it's very conceivable that Taiwan Semiconductor's valuation could top Intel's by year's end, as the former is the dominant chip manufacturer. If you look at each company's recent growth figures for both top and bottom lines, it's obvious why each player's market cap trajectories are heading up or down.</Msg><Username>tsmtobeatintc</Username><Timestamp>1357256817776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 18:46:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357256924455-91</Id><Topic><Title>running the chart for INTC and ARMH I notice ARMH has beaten INTC for the 1, 2, 5, year and max parameters</Title><Username>armhbeatsintc</Username><Timestamp>1357243085103</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:58:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so true, will only get worse</Msg><Username>tsmtobeatintc</Username><Timestamp>1357256924455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 18:48:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357256991739-92</Id><Topic><Title>(((MANY EXAMPLES WHERE AMD HIT LOWS AND RALLIED UP 224% - 509%)))</Title><Username>keeperoftheq</Username><Timestamp>1356148387458</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:53:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I sold INTC and NVDA.

Researchers have improved the power of light sources 20-fold over the past three years. But they must make similar heroic improvements in the next two years before EUV is ready for production, said Kurt Ronse, IMEC's director advanced lithography program, reporting on the conclusions of an EUV symposium in Brussels. The group also called for development of 500-1,000W EUV light sources by 2016.

When ASML roped in Intel (INTC), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) earlier this year by selling a 23% stake in the company, we did wonder how this cash would be used. Since Cymer has been collaborating closely with ASML over the past year, the deal make sense. The EUV Roadmap ASML provided some details in its press release. The company currently has 6 EUV systems (NXE: 3100) in beta, with satisfactory resolution performance at 22nm. However, the successor system, NXE: 3300B, which is intended for 14nm production currently requires closer integration with light sources to drive targeted levels of efficiency. Joint laboratory testing of the NXE: 3300B by Cymer and ASML shows ability to process 18 wafers per hour. The companies intend to take this to 69 wafers per hour for 2014 chip production. For this purpose, ASML intends to have 11 NXE: 3300B systems installed at customers for testing in 2013, with production-ready shipments at targeted efficiencies starting in 2014. The company has received four commitments so far and expects another four to eight in the next six months. Now do you folks get it now? here is more facts: GlobalFoundries has added a 10nm finFET process to its roadmap and expanded its technology platform offerings. The foundry vendor plans to go from 20nm planar in 2013, to 14nm finFET in 2014, to 10nm finFET in 2015, and 7nm finFET in 2017. At the SOI Consortium’s event at IEDM, Jeff Watt, a fellow at Altera, presented an evaluation and benchmark of planar fully depleted SOI technology. A simulation showed that 20nm FD-SOI provided a 5X reduction in power over 28nm bulk, Watt said. However, Altera has not made a commitment to SOI for FPGAs and is currently evaluating the technology, he said. “We are looking at all options,” he said. For 20nm, Altera plans to use a bulk technology at TSMC. At 14nm, the FPGA house will likely go with bulk finFETs at TSMC. However, Altera is also exploring SOI.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357263141734</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357264527053-118</Id><Topic><Title>Think Fabrication Doesn't Matter?

The challenge is that thay have to deliver design rules which are less restrictive and they have to deliver a shrink that is very aggressive." As such the decision to go to EUV for 14-nm concerns the foundry environment more than the microprocessor environment, Meurice said.</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1357264527053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:55:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357264528584-119</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's 2013-2014 Bay Trail Platform Leaked</Title><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1357262616657</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:23:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also at same site, ASUS is going to use gesture control in laptops and desktops.

If your chip's performance is good enough at a lower res node, simple cost benefit analysis clearly indicates that going to the next process node and adding the cost of fabricating finfets etc etc is simply not worth it for most chip applications. For Intel which is the leading light for high performance consumer computing it makes sense to make the huge investments necessary for further extending Moore's law for PCs, but for the average smartphone vendor, paying more for higher performance chips has become a case of diminishing returns. In other words while it maybe worthwhile to invest in more complex fabrication in the PC space specially now when it is expected Intel and Microsoft will completely change the landscape by integrating tablets into the fold, not in the smartphone space. The only reason all these foundries are investing in fab upgrades is because they think Intel might have an advantage with fabrication in the smartphone chip space. Over time they will realize that this is not the case. They're just playing it safe. The csenario that will probably play out for the foundries is that their most popular process node remains at 28nm even though higher res nodes are available.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1357272846213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 23:14:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357274344172-136</Id><Topic><Title>Think Fabrication Doesn't Matter?
