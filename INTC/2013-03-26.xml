But seriously, what's to stop Intel from designing arm chips? Intel is the chip king, they can do what ever they want. If Intel starts designing and manufacturing arm chips, it doesn't mean they stop designing and making x86, they can do both! Paul O. is right, the best asset Intel has is their manufacturing process. With it, they can do anything. This is why you buy and hold Intel here.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1364273237707</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 00:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364273281989-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Said Nearing Media Company Deals for Pay-TV Service</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364259945904</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 21:05:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel Corp.

You know you may be onto something. Think about it, wouldn't you announce a retirement for the end of the year perhaps in August or September? Why so quick to leave? What if this so called leakage issue at 28nm is more than a rumor? What if it's minor enough on a single core but running multi core it's more devastating than expected? This can be a summertime scandal that haunts them until they get finfet up and running, which can be years. Suddenly right after Warren East leaves there is a lot of talk about ARM64. Could it be that by summer talking about 20nm ARM anything will be met with skepticism? Here's where the rubber meets the road folks. If you believe ARM can produce at sub 30nm without leakage issues without finfet then ARMH is a good buy. If not then follow Warren East's lead and get out while you still can.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1364294079624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 06:34:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364294793155-12</Id><Topic><Title>If Intel just raises Divvy 7% a year over next 5 years</Title><Username>khitchdumb</Username><Timestamp>1364243091799</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 16:24:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please tell me what law of physics is violated should INTC reduce its dividend?

The term "Unlimited Service" is only seen in advertising with tons of disclaimers and fine print which basically says the service is capped. After the FCC gave broadband service providers the OK to abandon true unlimited service cable companies experimented with several fixed-price tiers and landed at about 300 Gigabytes (GB) per month as the accepted monthly allocation for consumers. This cap not been much of a problem for Netflix and other movie streamers because streaming a single movie might reach about 2GB, depending on the display resolution chosen. Streaming one movie per week would use less than 10GB per month and the consumer would still have 290GB remaining for regular Internet use. Even two movies a week wouldn't have much impact. But how is this different with live TV streaming? Suppose a single TV household has a TV on for six hours a day. Even with the high efficiency codec (h.265) Intel will most likely to use in its box, that single TV could use 121GB per month or nearly half the entire monthly cap. If the household has a second TV that could be 242GB per month leaving very little data left for Internet use. As high resolution 4K resolution TV's are introduced to the marketplace this year the bandwidth requirements for streaming to each TV could easily double or triple. Owners of Intel's Web TV could easily find themselves exceeding their monthly cap and facing higher prices for Internet bandwidth to do exactly the same things they were already doing with their PC's and TV's. Anyone that believes in the perpetual free lunch might like this business model, but those that exist in the real world have a right to be skeptical.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364307080072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:11:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364307248875-34</Id><Title>They Said It Couldn't Be Done</Title><Msg>1.)

You can assess the probability. The Intel BOD is targeting a payout ratio of 40%. The payout ratio is the % of income paid in dividends.Boards are very reluctant to drop dividend rates. The ARE interested in increasing the dividend every year so they can say "the dividend has been raiased each of the last X yearas". I expect the Intel BOD will raise the dividend in Nov unless they are seriously concerned about future. The dividend payout lowering would not be considered until it threatened to exceed cash flow (much higher than income). Intel is paying 40% payout ratio in Q4/2012 which is up from 36% payout ratio in Q3/2012. Intel income would have to drop by another 60% of its Q4/2012 rate for the payout ratio to hit 100%. The Q4/2012 cash flow was $6b. With 5b shares, the $6b Q4 cash flow allows Intel to take a very large hit and not threaten the current dividend.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364308721917</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364308795822-46</Id><Topic><Title>I can't REPLY to anything this AM ......

They do it only when they have cash flow problems. It is difficult to conceive a scenario that Intel would have a cash crunch problem since they are very cash rich. The divy is also very well supported. As to whether it stays flat or not, that is dependent on future earnings growth. INTC has been reducing its share count by 10 percent per year so even if revenues are flat, EPS should grow by 10% which would support a higher divy. No, INTC is the type of company you want to seek out if you are interested in dividends. MSFT, is another. They both have good dividends, and have a history of raising payouts. They also have dominate market positions in their respective categories and very good balance sheets.

Intel probably wanted to partner with the cable companies and took the idea to them and actually the early articles on the topic reported that Intel's Web TV was going to be launched with cable companies. But the cable companies had no desire unbundle or to cannibalize their revenue and sent Intel packing. So now Intel is attempting to bypass the cable companies altogether with an Over-The-Top service like Netflix, Vudu and others. Problem is though there is a huge difference in the amount of data needed for occasional movie streaming and 24x7 live TV to multiple TV's. And simply assuming "someone else" has done these calculations doesn't change the reality of the bandwidth problem. Moreover it doesn't change the fact that the cable companies can launch their own identical live TV streaming service and not charge the consumer any overage fees for their own service while charging Intel's customers extra fees for the very same thing. You may say, this would be really stupid and Intel wouldn't do this. But they did nearly the very same thing five years ago when they wanted to enter the wireless business. They created WiMAX technology to deliver wireless broadband but instead of working with Verizon, AT&amp;T and the world's leading carriers, they invested in a wireless startup called Clearwire to push their WiMAX service. In response the leading carriers simply developed their own version of WiMAX called LTE and promptly crushed Intel's WiMAX along with the Clearwire upstart. Altogether Intel probably spent $6-8 billion on that fiasco. The second flaw in the Web TV business model is the camera. Intel needs the extra revenue from the spying and selling-off customer's data to encourage content creators to unbundle. Intel miscalculated the widespread concern and controversy surrounding their desire to spy on its customers watching TV, and without that extra revenue there's no incentive for content owners to unbundle.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364313537451</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 11:58:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364313701417-59</Id><Title>A Quick Look At Intel's Financial Position</Title><Msg>Anybody read or care to comment on this seeking Alpha article,the author claims that INTC's dividend is very sustainable but basicly the share buy back has been a waste of time.

While it does in a strict sense, the concept that is missed is that because of Intels superior credit rating, the borrowing is essentially free. If you reduce the share count you reduce the amount of dividends you are paying out also, so I don't know what INTC borrows money at but if it is less then the 4 and change percent that it pays in dividends per year, then it is cost free money. I am pretty sure INTC can borrow money at less then 4 percent. Strategically, it makes a lot more since to borrow the money in easy credit times and preserve the cash for other purposes.

At the time, it looked like the company had lots of hurdles in the way, namely in how it was going to set up deals with broadcasters to provide content for the service. Now, it looks like Intel has cleared many of those hurdles, and has broadcasters ready to commit. "According to Bloomberg News, Intel is close to agreements with Time Warner, NBC Universal, and Viacom for the service. Details are forthcoming, but seeing as these three companies are the parents for channels such as CNN, USA, MTV, and VH1, Intel has some big names already at the table – good news for them. "The companies have already agreed to broad terms of the deal, but not the specifics. Many details still need to be worked out, according to sources close to both sides. In addition to the three major players above, Intel is also said to be close to financial negotiations with News Corp., and in a slightly earlier stage with both Disney and CBS." My comment: I can't help but think that this new partnership has something to do with Intel CEO Paul Otellini announcing his retirement. These negotiations between TW, NBCUniv, Viacom and Intel could only be taking place because they sense a new Intel which is prepared to be the best partner imaginable. INTC is p/e 10 stock with growing revenues, a great moat, a dividend over 4%. Truthfully, I'm flabbergasted that Intel can get these guys onboard with their plan for unbundled channels. The multichannel bundlers like comcast must be sh_tting bricks. As for Netflix, whenever SVOD is validated, the reigning champion is also validated as to its future prospects. The bashers/bears keep missing this. They think whenever someone else throws their hat into the ring, Netflix stock should go down. But we have seen just the opposite happen time and time again --- as more companies want a piece of the pie, the pie king goes up in value.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1364317257888</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 13:00:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364317468335-67</Id><Topic><Title>ARM Technicals</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364307508580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:18:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not going to go out and call it weak today but it is pretty near some important resistance levels.

There will substantial taxes on repatriated profits. Borrowing defers the taxes on those funds but allows Intel to take advantage of having the cash. The 2011 $5b and 2012 $6b were both issued at rates below the dividend yield. Intel margined the company below 3% average to buy shares that yielded 4+%. Intel arbitraged low debt financing costs to retire shares as you pointed out. Intel debt did grow at an alarming rate of 538% since 2010, from $2.1b to $13.4b with $11b of that retiring shares. The spread on this $11b dividend and borrowing rates will pay off the loans. 8-) Intel debt is going to grow another $2.6b in 2013 for a rate of 662% over 4 years of which $11b is still the borrowing to buy shares. The $11b debt is less of a load than the dividend on the shares. Anyone who thinks that the UK or the US DOJ would allow Intel to buy ARM is operating outside of reality. Corning? Dell? Those are his "better use" ideas?</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1364318918739</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 13:28:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364319087988-71</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Web TV Bandwidth Challenge</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364307080072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>watch a blue ray Disc from Netflix and then stream the exact same movie using Netflix.

Engineering samples of the first chip in the series, the ABAX2P1, will be available in Q3, Tabula said. EDA support, packet processing reference designs and related soft IP blocks are already available to allow 100G design work to start. The ABAX2P1 – which ten-year old Tabula (Santa Clara, Calif.) calls a PLD rather than an FPGA – is a 12-fold "Spacetime" device which means that it can support 12 different configurations in its SRAM look-up tables and cycle through them as a way of supporting up to 12 times more logic than a conventional FPGA architecture would on the same fabric. It also includes additional RAM, logic and interconnect capabilities alongside hard IP blocks to customize the device for packet processing applications, Tabula said. The chip supports 2-GHz clock frequency throughput through every component of the chip and provides 23.3-Mbytes of 12-port or 24-port on-chip memory providing for up to 13.8-Tbytes per second of throughput. The FPGA fabric includes 570,000 LUTs and 70,000 logic carry blocks, although it is not clear whether these figures are before or after the 12-fold time-slicing. There are multiple DDR3 memory controllers and 100G Ethernet media access controllers (MACs) and the chip includes multiple instances of 10G/40G/100G forward error correction blocks. The overall combination will support processing of four 100G streams on a single chip, a search engine capable of supporting 100G packet traffic, and a 12 times 10G into 100G bridge. To design with the ABAX2P1 Tabula provides the Stylus compiler software which maps standard RTL to the ABAX device taking into account the time-sliced nature of the FPGA fabric. It includes sequential timing, router aware placement, and automatic co-optimization</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1364320907478</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:01:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364321208941-77</Id><Topic><Title>A Quick Look At Intel's Financial Position</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364313701417</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:01:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, I read the article.

Skaugen said the starting price for Haswell based Ultrabooks will be $599. In addition to the lower price tag, Haswell Ultrabooks should also offer a range of new features, including high resolution touchcreens, voice and facial recognition and all-day battery life. Of course, we don’t expect all these features to end up in entry level $599 SKUs, but it’s a good start. Skaugen pointed out that Haswell was designed from the ground up to best suit the Ultrabook.

Most of the earnings are coming from the iPhone. It is about 75 percent of the earnings. The smart phone market is getting close being commoditized. iPhone margins are pretty steep and appear to be vulnerable. Apple appears attractive on a valuation bases but but if you shrink the margins about 25-30 percent on the iPhone then you don't get such attractive numbers. That is assuming that they are able to maintain market share in an increasingly competitive landscape. I had a sell recommendation on Apple a couple of hundred points higher but have since gone neutral on it. I think earning will be under pressure for awhile so I don't see a lot of upside. Apple needs a great new product to drive earnings higher and I just don't see what that product is going to be. Intel on the other hand has new revenue drivers in Mobile chip sales, contract foundry service and Intel TV. So, I certainly see more upside in INTC.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1364327305357</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:48:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364327478548-97</Id><Topic><Title>Turd Farmers are happy today..

That's a big restriction. Why does Huggers believe those caps will go up or disappear entirely? The FCC is happy with the caps cable companies have today and no one is championing changing them. Neither Netflix nor Vudu has any issues with the status quo. Further, the FCC moved to support caps as part of the broadband reform it made during Obama's first term. It is not going to reverse this policy, especially with Obama's re-election. Caps are only a problem for Intel's live TV business model and it will become more of a problem when current HDTV's are replaced with Ultra HDTV's. Of course caps don't even apply to streaming services the cable companies deliver themselves so don't expect them to be asking to go back to fixed-price unlimited.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364330111827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364331175241-107</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Web TV Bandwidth Challenge</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364307080072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess I am not seeing the bandwith issue as being a problem.

Virtually all wireless carriers have caps and nearly every wireline broadband provider has them too. Most importantly the country's largest cable companies have them. Check their terms of use. The FCC solidly endorses the use of caps to encourage capital formation for further deployment of broadband infrastructure. The argument about additional traffic for the cloud makes my point. Cable companies already provide plenty of data for consumer's Internet and cloud use - assuming no one is streaming to several TV's to bypass the cable operator's HDTV service. When the home owner gets the bill for exceeding their monthly data allocation whose fault will it be? It won't be the cable company. It will be the streaming service used to bypass the same HD channels one can get via the cable company. And exceeding the allocation isn't an argument to do away with caps or increase them, it's the argument for the consumer to drop the Intel service and buy the video programming directly from the cable company. Intel's Media Group may not even have time to wait for cable companies to fight the caps. The typical timetable for an Intel experiment to produce serious traction is about 24 months.

What, you mean the broadband companies are actually gouging us with these data caps? They’re not about network congestion like they tell us? Well, yes, of course the companies are doing their darndest to get as much money out of you as they can. They are, after all, capitalist and supposedly profit maximising enterprises. There isn’t even in theory supposed to be a link between their cost of providing a service and the price they can charge you for it. That’s set by the price they wish to provide it at and the price you’re willing to pay: that old supply and demand thing. Internet users have been complaining about data caps — and the costly penalties for going over said caps — for years, while both wireless and fixed broadband providers claimed these caps were an absolute necessity to curb runaway use. But a new report attempts to debunk many of the ISP industry’s claims. At the heart of the NAF’s argument is that the costs associated with delivering data to consumers has dropped while the number of consumers subscribing to broadband services has increased. The way to deal with a producer trying to gouge the consumer is to increase the competition to supply that the producer faces. Get enough suppliers into the market and costs will indeed decline.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364342514051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364342615684-115</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Web TV Bandwidth Challenge</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364307080072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My provider Comcast had a cap of around 350 GB a month but they apparently dropped it because of complaints.

Of course, for years, independent researchers showed that this was bogus, and there was no data crunch coming. If you actually caught a technologist from a broadband provider, rather than a business person or lobbyist, they'd quietly admit that there was no congestion problem, and that basic upgrades and network maintenance could easily deal with the growth in usage. But, of course, that took away the broadband providers' chief reason for crying about how they "need" data caps. The reality, of course, is that data caps are all about increasing revenue for broadband providers -- in a market that is already quite profitable. But if they can hide behind the claims that they need to do this to deal with congestion, they can justify it to regulators and (they hope) the public. Of course, enough people have been calling this explanation out as completely bogus that it appears that even the broadband companies' own lobbyists may finally be dropping this line of reasoning. Former FCC boss Michael Powell, who is now the cable industry's chief lobbyist (president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association -- NCTA), has finally admitted caps aren't about congestion: Michael Powell told a Minority Media and Telecommunications Association audience that cable's interest in usage-based pricing was not principally about network congestion, but instead about pricing fairness...Asked by MMTC president David Honig to weigh in on data caps, Powell said that while a lot of people had tried to label the cable industry's interest in the issue as about congestion management. "That's wrong," he said. "Our principal purpose is how to fairly monetize a high fixed cost." Of course, as Broadband Reports notes, Powell is jumping from one myth (congestion) to another (fairness) that is just as ridiculous.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364343148220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364343411263-124</Id><Topic><Title>intel beat apple to the TV biz</Title><Username>alex_big_gun88</Username><Timestamp>1364326703110</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:38:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I haven't really figured out what Apple TV is or if it even exists.

That stops the spying for sure but it doesn't solve the business model aspect of what the camera is there for. You may believe the camera is there to "improve the user experience", deliver tailored ads, or recognize your face so your movie favorites will be displayed. That's the sales fluff, but that's not what it's there for. The camera is there to sell personal data to generate incremental revenue above that the user pays for service fees. That extra revenue is critical because content owners have zero motivation to unbundle their content and unless Intel can shower content producers with extra revenue from selling your personal data that video content will never get unbundled. If there is no unbundling and no cost savings to consumers there's pretty much no reason for Intel Web TV to exist. Intel hasn't yet announced pricing and they never said the fees to all users will be the same, or those that disable the camera will pay the same monthly fee for service as those that don't.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364348185581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 21:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364350340197-136</Id><Topic><Title>Intel planning $599 Haswell Ultrabooks</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364326079904</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:27:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what sent Intel issues higher today.</Msg><Username>walrusweaver</Username><Timestamp>1364350340197</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364351691808-137</Id><Topic><Title>Media Attitudes Are Changing</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364226451414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:47:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the smart money already knows ARM's day are numbered.

We don't get unlimited electricity, unlimited water, unlimited gas or unlimited anything else for a fixed price. Why would you expect telecom be exempt from the laws of economics? The reason is that there is a direct relationship between the consumption of services or goods and cost. The notion of fairness that Michael Powell referred to is correct because an environment of unlimited use encourages highly distorted usage models that are inefficient and completely separated from underlying costs. Inevitably there will be some number of users that will exploit the fixed-price arrangement to their benefit, while pushing the cost of the shared infrastructure to others. There are countless examples in the wireless and wireline world. This is the fairness issue Michael Powell referred to. Usage pricing brings fairness in cost recovery and it encourages efficiency in usage. Now for congestion every telecom manager will tell you that the period of peak demand drives cost. Consider Internet usage only about five years ago, before YouTube, before Netflix. There was email, web, a little streaming music and very low resolution video. Today, demand for data has grown exponentially and broadband providers often say streaming video now represents about 40% of the entire traffic on their network and the predictions offered by CISCO show data traffic increasing by orders of magnitude every couple years. If there isn't constant re-investment in the telecom provider's infrastructure there will be serious congestion and outages. So yes, congestion and fairness are always concerns for telecom operators, regulators and the public and usage-based pricing is here to stay for consumers.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364352402793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:46:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364355555896-139</Id><Title>It Seems Like Intel Has Gathered a Lot Of New Buyers Recently.</Title><Msg>Even the sentiment among some analysts has changed with a few analysts raising PT slightly.
