So, it will try to take advantage of anything it can, trumped up or not. However, they are being much less successful these days with silliness that used to get them a lot of traction. I attribute this to the strength of the Intel pipeline and the significant gains in tablet market share. But the Microsemi news is much bigger than the Lehman news. And nothing will happen with the lawsuit for 2 or 3 years. It will likely be dismissed or settled for what is not material for Intel. My guess is that it's a ploy to get Intel to offer up something to make it go away quickly. Intel can easily afford a long lawsuit. Can Lehman? I wouldn't worry about it one way or the other until Intel counsel weighs in on whether they believe the suit has merit. There are a lot more topics deserving of our attention...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367467330945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 00:02:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367467767301-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Smartphones Already Released</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367458030291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 21:27:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I already read it.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 28 Lehman Matter In November 2009, representatives of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. advised Intel informally that the Lehman bankruptcy estate was considering a claim against Intel arising from a 2008 forward-share purchase contract. The transaction at issue was between Intel and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (together with its affiliate Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., "Lehman"), which entered into a $1.0 billion forward-purchase agreement to purchase shares of Intel common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, Intel provided a $1.0 billion pre-payment to Lehman, in exchange for which Lehman was required to purchase $1.0 billion in shares of Intel common stock, calculated at a volume weighted average price from August 26, 2008 to September 26, 2008. Intel received an equivalent $1.0 billion of cash collateral from Lehman. Lehman was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of Intel common stock to Intel on September 29, 2008. Lehman failed to deliver any shares of Intel common stock, and Intel foreclosed on the $1.0 billion collateral. No specific information has been provided by Lehman regarding the nature or scope of the potential claims, other than the assertion that Lehman contends that it suffered damages in a range between $130 million and $380 million. In February 2010, Lehman served a subpoena on Intel in connection with this transaction, but Lehman has not initiated any action against Intel to date. We believe that Intel acted appropriately under its agreement with Lehman, in light of Lehman's bankruptcy filing, and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367467828458</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 00:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367467996873-4</Id><Title>Acer Going Forward With Intel Powered Atom Bay Trail 10-inch Tablet Named WT5</Title><Msg>There isn’t just one rumor referring to what Acer has in store in terms of new releases for this year. The manufacturer seems to have prepared a number of devices of different sizes for the budget and mid-end category. There is still no word about when any of these might be available. One rumor that seems most interesting in regards to Acer’s plans concerns the upcoming tablet in the 7-inch category that will arrive at the same price as the current model – the Iconia B1. However this new tablet will offer better specs and maybe an improvement in terms of design and overall feel. Another fact that has surfaced is the fact that Acer may be preparing to announce a high-end device codenamed WT5. This tablet is powered by the new generation Intel Atom – Bay Trail chipset that should be able to deliver very good performance. On top of that the 10-inch Full HD LCD IPS 1920 × 1080 pixels display should look stunning and there are also 2 GB of RAM for multitasking. Other specs include 64 GB of internal memory, 8 MP rear camera and 4G LTE connectivity.

It was still a big leap in purchasing a 40 percent stake in Falling Sky, one of 20 horses scheduled to run in the 139th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs (CHDN) in Louisville, Kentucky, in two days, Covello said. The 3-year-old went for $425,000 at the Ocala Breeders Sales Co. winter sale in January, by far the highest price of the session three years after the colt was purchased for $16,000 at Keeneland. “It’s a calculated risk,” Covello, 40, said in a telephone interview. “You have to be as analytical as possible in trying to marry the numbers.” Falling Sky will go off at 50-1 in the Derby, the first leg of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown. Since Covello and his partners bought the colt, he has won the Sam F. Davis on Feb. 2, come in third at the Tampa Bay Derby on March 9 and fourth in the Arkansas Derby, the longest of his races at 1 1/8 miles, to earn $205,000 so far in 2013. The Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4 miles. Covello, a semiconductor analyst at Goldman Sachs, studies Thoro-Graph, a performance-rating number that is calculated on the basis of time of the race, beaten lengths, ground lost or saved, weight carried, the effect of wind, and a track variant. Falling Sky’s number is 5, the same as Giacomo, a 50-1 longshot that captured the Derby in 2005 to return $102.60 on a $2 win bet. “He’s going to be a longshot; he should be a longshot,” Covello said. “Honestly, there are 20 horses running and I don’t think any horse has more than 5 percent chance to win.” Saratoga View Covello, a football and baseball player at Georgetown University, was introduced to racing by his wife, Teri, and her parents, who took him to Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, shortly after they returned from their honeymoon in 1998. “Seeing your first horse race at Saratoga is like seeing your first baseball</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367471065402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367471409505-11</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the Intel "expert"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367471065402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:04:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, maybe if he spent a little less time at the racetrack he would know a little more about technology...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367471409505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:10:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367471907876-12</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the Intel "expert"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367471065402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:04:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Covello operates his 12-race horse business under the name Scout Stable LLC, named after his wife’s favorite character in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367471907876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:18:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367472334122-13</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the Intel "expert"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1367471065402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 01:04:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These big time Wallstreet guys need to keep their interests cultivated in order to prevent burnout.

Etisalat, as part of an exclusive agreement, was one of the first to start selling the keyboard version of the BB10 phone, which is getting much more attention compared to the full touch Z10. Less than a day after it started selling the popular model Etisalat says there are no more units for across the counter sales. However those who had pre-booked will not be disappointed as their shipments are expected to reach them soon. Axiom Telecom has also started distributing the phones to those who had pre-booked. Blackberry is expecting the phone to do much better than the Z10. Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins in a recent interview said he expects Q10 sales to be in the “tens of millions.” Recently launched Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One have already gone out of stock despite growing demand. Meanwhile, in what could be termed as an indicator of what’s in store as far as BlackBerry is concerned, Heins has said that tablets will have no future. On the same day as the company started selling its Q10 smart phone across the world, Heins is reported to have said that in five years, there wont be a need for a tablet. Speaking to Bloomberg at the Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles Heins said, "In five years I don’t think there’ll be a reason to have a tablet anymore… Maybe a big screen in your workspace, but not a tablet as such. Tablets themselves are not a good business model." The statement is significant as it once again indicates that BlackBerry, which sent conflicting signals about the future of its Playbook, might have after all abandoned the project. Emirates 247 had earlier reported quoting local BlackBerry officials here that the company could come out with an updated PlayBook soon. Currently Blackberry Bridge connects your older BlackBerry device to a PlayBook. But with Blackberry 10 you cannot do so. While the PlayBook is technically capable of running BB10 OS and fans are at least hoping that the Ontario based company that spent almost two years of their R&amp;D to come out with Playbook will come up with an update. It could also mean that Blackberry might also be planning to come out with a possible Phablet. The screen size of smartphones are increasing and have already crossed the 6 inch mark.</Msg><Username>clark.kent251</Username><Timestamp>1367488628613</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 05:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367490767068-19</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH: Processor Share, Royalty Rates to Rise, Says Canaccord</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367426927512</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:48:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So this is the #$%$ that just created ARMH bagholders at $48 ! "he maintains a view the company is “is well positioned to hold dominant processor market share within the growing smartphone and tablet markets while benefitting from royalty rate expansion due to increased Cortex-A penetration, Mali graphics attach rates, and secular trends toward chipset integration.” Not a chance of any of the above coming true, Intel will send ARM chips back down to the cheap $10-20 range again by the time its done on 10nm i.e. within 3 years. Going forward only the really small cheap ARM chips will prosperously survive, e.g. A7 and A53 as Haswell/Broadwell and Silvermont/Airmont are just going to crush A15 and A57 from above and below in a classic pincer movement. ARMH by the end of the decade will be in the teens ... if they are lucky as I don't totally rule it dropping under $10 once investors find out they have been well and truly scammed by this so called growth story. "Ramsay sees ARM increasing its share of microprocessors by the end of this decade to more than 50% from 32% at present" From who ? ARM is already the market leader in its markets and it only has share to lose in them. Its Windows adventure has already failed, anybody hear about any new WindowsRT tablets being released ? Of course not, it will be quietly dropped by MSFT as if it never existed. ARM's microprocessor share is heading down to the 20% range by the end of the decade as MIPS also will come back on the embedded side as Intel devastates the ARM tablet market.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1367490767068</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 06:32:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367493501013-20</Id><Topic><Title>ARMH: Processor Share, Royalty Rates to Rise, Says Canaccord</Title><Username>sujit_98</Username><Timestamp>1367426927512</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:48:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM share of the total semi market is 32%.

I had temporary gains up to the point that my holdings would crash and burn. I then invested in a number of high quality tech stocks, and found that I could make good money on the technology, which I taught myself, but eventually the analysts would get in and destroy the equity in these otherwise excellent storied companies. I began to realize how corrosive this is, now amplified by the internet, how the equity well of the stock market has now become institutionally corrupt. High frequency trading is obscene. Today I have learned the hard way to distrust any and all analysts. It's worse than ever now, with Covello's and Shah's and all those Motley idiots, CNBC and "BreakOut". I am astonished that the first amendment protects these bald faced liars (though I wouldn't want to change it). The whole of Wall Street and the US banking system is full of these people.

"His track record of execution and strategic leadership, combined with his open-minded approach to problem solving has earned him the respect of employees, customers and partners worldwide. He has the right combination of knowledge, depth and experience to lead the company during this period of rapid technology and industry change." Krzanich, 52, has progressed through a series of technical and leadership roles since joining Intel in 1982. "I am deeply honored by the opportunity to lead Intel," said Krzanich. "We have amazing assets, tremendous talent, and an unmatched legacy of innovation and execution. I look forward to working with our leadership team and employees worldwide to continue our proud legacy, while moving even faster into ultra-mobility, to lead Intel into the next era."

Brian is a fab PROCESS guy. I was groomed for the job by working in different parts of the organization. Prior to becoming COO, Krzanich held senior leadership positions within Intel's manufacturing organization. He was responsible for Fab/Sort Manufacturing from 2007-2011 and Assembly and Test from 2003 to 2007. From 2001 to 2003, he was responsible for the implementation of the 0.13-micron logic process technology across Intel's global factory network. From 1997 to 2001, Krzanich served as the Fab 17 plant manager, where he oversaw the integration of Digital Equipment Corporation's semiconductor manufacturing operations into Intel's manufacturing network. The assignment included building updated facilities as well as initiating and ramping 0.18-micron and 0.13-micron process technologies. Prior to this role, Krzanich held plant and manufacturing manager roles at multiple Intel factories. Krzanich began his career at Intel in 1982 in New Mexico as a process engineer. He holds a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University and has one patent for semiconductor processing. Krzanich is also a member of the Board of Directors of Lilliputian Corporation and the Semiconductor Industry Association.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367502310998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367502741972-68</Id><Topic><Title>IT'S GREEN AND GOING MUCH HIGHER!</Title><Username>vinnie_baggadonilz</Username><Timestamp>1367501985786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:39:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow Intel trades EXDIVIDEND or WITHOUT rights to the dividend. WATCH for the call and put prices when Intel crosses the strike point. The put will have all the dividend drop priced into the premium. IMO, Intel will oscillate around the $24 strike point +/- the dividend. HIGH of RANGE will be about $24.26 and LOW of RANGE will be $23.75. When Intel gets above STRIKE + dividend, they will sell CALL options and BUY PUT options which will drive the stock back down. When Intel gets below STRIKE - dividend, they will buy CALL options and SELL PUT options which will drive the stock back up. This process seems to accompany the posturing on day before ex-dividend.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367502741972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367503117960-69</Id><Topic><Title>Horible pick for CEO - another Otellini clone</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1367501408474</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:30:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"He was groomed for the job by working "</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367503117960</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:58:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367503127394-70</Id><Topic><Title>INTC crashing on the CEO pick</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1367501457221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:30:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess that market not liking it was short lived..

The idea of bringing someone in from the outside and waiting 5 or 10 years for them to master the complexity has always been a non-starter for me. Any of the top Intel executives would have been a solid choice. They are familiar with the strategy plan and can continue to implement it smoothly. Intel's mobility strategy is as solid as a rock and moving forward. Three cheers for the board for making the right choice.

We own 1,000 shares of SPY. I lost my job and have been out of work for over two years. Wife couldn't take the stress and left with the kids and her cat, she left me the dog. We bought these shares around the high and are down quite a bit. The lawyer says all the stocks have to be sold and the cash split up. Why can't we just settle for the market value of the shares and split them up that way? I guess we can both carry the losses on future taxes. This is going to be fun on the house.

The pain has been deep for Intel but Intel slowly but surely has built up a Huge army with endless ammunition. Now the counter attack has begun and Intel will soon march with guns blasting into Arm's territory. Those phones and tablets will most of them have Intel inside before the end of this decade. In fact, in two years there will be 40% of the phones using Intel and perhaps 70% if Samsung goes Intel again. The New CEO will take Intel to 10 nm and then even smaller and faster chips. Before this decade is done, Intel will have split once or twice and this board will be filled with posters who have become multi million airs from their long play on Intel. PS--Many of the new longs will be Apple longs who used their massive profits to invest and double down again with more windfalls from Intel.

The dividend game has drained all the volatility from trading. There a couple of news items pending that will make your 10% to 15% drop unlikely. Haswell will be introduced June 4th and Intel is already shipping Haswell to vendors in volumes. Haswell will stimulate a corporate refresh in laptops because of the Ultrabook features. First because the aged population of the existing HW but also because of the added security features that are part of the Ultrabook spec. Intel will behave has it always has but they are in the middle of a new product cycle which has always bumped up the revenue and profit results.

According to CNBC: It appears that the CEO candidates were asked to present their respective visions to the Board. Though these were expected to be individual presentations, Brian Krzanich and Renee James teamed up behind the scenes and made a surprise joint presentation showing the "best" vision forward for Intel. And the Board was sufficiently impressed with their vision to make them CEO and President. ======================== Though I was rooting for Stacy Smith who I believe is more personable (compared to the rather dry Krzanich), I think we have to trust the Board to have made the best decision. Of course, I am curious to know if Stacy Smith was invited to present and how he fared.

He said the strategy was developed in consultation with Renée James, Intel's longtime software chief, who was elected president by the company's board. "It's really her and I who put the strategy together and presented it to the board that got us here today," Mr. Krzanich said. "While not disclosing details of the new strategy, Mr. Krzanich said it would exploit its manufacturing-technology leadership while taking Intel into devices where it doesn't dominate today—not just smartphones and tablets, which are frequently discussed, but into areas such as wearable computing. "The company has long been on the forefront pushing chip production advances, which include shrinking the size of transistor on chips at a regular cadence often referred to as Moore's Law—a reference to Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. "While elements of the strategy will become apparent soon, the "full strategy" won't become visible until later this year, Mr. Krzanich said." My Comment: I read Dana Blankenhorn's recent SA article praising the appointment of Renee James to President. Dana seems to consider this pairing a co-CEOship. Honestly, I haven't the vaguest idea who reports to the President? What power does a president actually have inside of Intel? To my mind, in no way is this a shared power situation unless Krzanich likes to share power.</Msg><Username>t_e_n_k_a_y</Username><Timestamp>1367512188996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 12:29:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367512400139-135</Id><Topic><Title>Renee James one step closer...</Title><Username>returntorael</Username><Timestamp>1367507435179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:10:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She WAS instrumental in raising the issue of employee snatching.</Msg><Username>returntorael</Username><Timestamp>1367512400139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 12:33:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367512937748-136</Id><Topic><Title>Renee James one step closer...</Title><Username>returntorael</Username><Timestamp>1367507435179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:10:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She did a fine job as Andy Grove's TA many years ago.

End your pity party and get on with your life.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1367517206995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367517353909-169</Id><Title>Really smart to pick the COO who missed the boat and was on the board to run the company, Good job INTC</Title><Msg>Really smart to pick the COO who missed the boat and was on the board to run the company, Good job INTC</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517353909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:55:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367517563889-170</Id><Topic><Title>Really smart to pick the COO who missed the boat and was on the board to run the company, Good job INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517353909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not good if that's the best INTC could come up with</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517563889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:59:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367517624553-171</Id><Title>We still need another 15 cents</Title><Msg>to stay above 24 after it goes ex-dividend</Msg><Username>intoodeep99</Username><Timestamp>1367517624553</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367517780935-172</Id><Topic><Title>Really smart to pick the COO who missed the boat and was on the board to run the company, Good job INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517353909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good old boy system still at INTC, Give themselves stock at 0$ and sell GOOD JOB INTC</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517780935</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:03:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367517905107-173</Id><Topic><Title>MAY 18th CALL Option volumes spiking</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367516740639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:45:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>273K now</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1367517905107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:05:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367518038072-174</Id><Topic><Title>Really smart to pick the COO who missed the boat and was on the board to run the company, Good job INTC</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367517353909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOOD old boy system handing out stock for 0$ and then they all sell ,GOOD JOB INTC Great pick, Screw the shareholds</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367518038072</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:07:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367518428677-175</Id><Topic><Title>MAY 18th CALL Option volumes spiking</Title><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1367516740639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:45:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>273k $22 CALL contracts are in the money and control 27,300,000 shares of Intel stock.

Say hello to tablet-like power characteristics. In the semiconductor world, integration is omnipresent, driven by Moore’s Law. Integration reduces power and cost while increasing performance. The latest realization of this trend is the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) approach pervasive among PCs, tablets, and smartphones. And the latest SoC is Haswell. Haswell is the first new family of SoCs from Intel to target the 22nm FinFET process, which uses a non-planar transistor that wraps around the gate on three sides. While Ivy Bridge was the first family of 22nm products, it was not fully optimized for the 22nm process. The CPU was a shrink of the 32nm Sandy Bridge rather than a new design. The Haswell family encompasses a new CPU core, a new GPU, and numerous system-level changes. More importantly, it marks the beginning of Intel's more unified approach to SoCs. The Haswell family is really a set of building blocks that architects will assemble for specific markets. The Haswell CPU core is a step forward in performance (as is to be expected from Intel) but more importantly, it is a huge step down in power. This SoC should be viable for high-end tablets. Variants of Haswell are aimed as low as 10W, and future improvements may reduce this further. Intel’s 22nm FinFET node is necessary to achieve this wider range, but it's not sufficient. Haswell's architecture fully exploits the benefits of the new process technology in a way that Ivy Bridge never did. It ultimately yields higher performance and lower power, which will translate into PCs and tablets that run faster with a longer battery life.

The cache bandwidth doubled in tandem with an increase in FLOP/s from the new FMA units. Moreover, the whole memory system has been enhanced to support gather instructions and transactional memory. As tablets have become more robust and capable, in many respects Intel’s competitive focus has shifted away from AMD to the ARM ecosystem: Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia, and others. Haswell will be the first high performance x86 core that can really fit in a tablet, albeit in high-powered models around the 10W mark rather than the 4W devices. For consumers, Haswell will offer a heady combination of Windows 8 (and compatibility with the x86 software base) with excellent performance and tablet-like power characteristics. Compared to AMD or ARM-based solutions, the performance will be dramatically higher, so the biggest question will be power efficiency. There, Intel is claiming some impressive advances while keeping the details close... 2013: Year of the Intel Tablet Coming up: May 1: Microsemi Foundry News - Buzz should last at least a week or ten days May 6: Intel to announce Silvermont - Buzz should last all year May 6: Lenovo K900 release in China May 10: Lenovo K900 in India May 15-17; Google I/O Developers Conference - Buzz depends on announcements.

Bryant noted that in the appeals to the board of directors, Krzanich and Intel software and services head Renee James had actually teamed up to offer a combined vision for Intel, and that vision swayed the board. Krzanich won out against James based on his substantial experience with Intel, said Bryant. Bryant said he was not yet at liberty to disclose what the vision was. He said those who think Krzanich's familiarity with Intel's chip manufacturing signals a deeper push into the contract foundry business “are overstating the case a bit,” though he added that he has always thought Intel should do more foundry work than it has. When asked how Krzanich's tenure may be different from Otellini's, Bryant pointed out that with each new CEO over the years, Intel has invented new markets for its chips, but now it may be time for Intel to listen to the market. With Grove, we got the PC. With [Craig] Barrett, we got communications, especially WiFi [Intel's Centreno initiative]. With Paul, we got servers. The market had been mainframes and Paul really created that [X86] server market. Intel has always created a market for itself. That's been one of its strengths. I'm hoping with Brian it will likewise open up some new markets. We're hoping now to have a little more outside-in thinking, to hear what the market is saying.

WinTel tablets achieved 7.4% market share in the first quarter of 2013. These low cost computers run full Windows 8 and use the Intel Arm based Clovertrail processor. By the 2013 holidays, you will be able to buy Intel Bay Trail based tablets. Bay Trail is the quad core version of the new architecture Atom processor. With the introduction of the 22nm Bay Trail chip, all competition in the stand-alone tablet SoC business will be shut off. The Bay Trail will be the only chip able to run Windows 8 and the Android Operating system, thus covering virtually all tablets except the Apple iPad. The stand-alone tablet business is expected to grow to 200 million units. A $50 Intel SoC in each one of those represents another $10 billion market opportunity for Intel. Ultimately, these chips will also include embedded memory and may sell for twice the $50 as a super integrated SoC.

[You toss out the character assassination with absolutely nothing to back it up. No discussions of Intel's improved mobility strategy, no discussion of Intel's roadmap, no discussion of fabrication or FinFET achievements.

And of course no mention of the stock having moved up 5 bucks since November. Your post is an opinion backed by nothing - no analysis, no reasoning, no support - nothing. As such it is the worst sort of childish character assassination.

This will lead to performance and power consumption advantages over its rivals. Even the current generation of Clovertrail Atom processors is receiving good reviews. Bay Trail will further improve Intel's mobile processor offerings. With Android tablets adopting Intel processors, it might be possible for Intel to capture 30-40% of the tablet market in 2014. According to Fudzilla's "industry sources," tablets featuring Intel's upcoming quad-core Atom "Bay Trail" SoC will arrive in Q4 2013, specifically in time for the 2013 holiday season and the important consumer holidays of Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Boxing Day.

And I agree it has a good chance of happening primarily because the Tablet market has swung around so fast in favor of Android versus iOS. Even Microsoft has managed to get 7.5% market share in just 2 quarters. All PC OEMs are chomping at the bit to get a piece of the action. Once Intel delivers compelling Haswell and Bay Trail SoCs, I think these OEMs should be able to push huge volumes at good prices. I see the market adopting compelling Intel-based Tablets, Convertibles and Detachables very quickly from Q3 onwards.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1367545422066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:43:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367546089324-236</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Marcopubio aka itakebackmyapology</Title><Username>backpain_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1367507214899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:06:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U should be road kill anytime now.

Barret said to Bloomberg: "Goodness gracious, let's get off of this "the PC is dead". I was around with Intel for 35 years and I went through probably 6 or 7 iterations of the "PC is dead". You showed earlier in the program the great margins Intel's been running. There revenue grew nicely under Paul's stewardship. I don't see any of that stopping and I don't think the PC or the Ultrabook or any other form of computing that Intel is involved in is dead. They'll build off of that, they'll get into smartphones in a bigger way and into the ultramobile in a bigger way. That's where they've been putting their investment in the last several years.
