But that shouldn't be unexpected. This was no ordinary recession. When someone recovers from the flu, it takes a week or two before they're feeling 100%. On the other hand, if someone was in intensive care with double pneumonia, it's going to be quite a while before they're feeling back to themselves. Well, in 2008 and early 2009, not only was the U.S. economy in intensive care with double pneumonia, but Presidents Bush and Obama, along with Hank Paulson, had to break out the defibrillator a few times to revive the patient. The recuperation process was going to be long. But now the patient is home, up and moving around again and on the road to recovery. There's still a long way to go, but make no mistake about it - things are improving: In August, building permits were up 6.8% from last year. Employers added 163,000 jobs in July, higher than the 73,000 average from April - June. Timber company Weyerhauser (NYSE: WY), whose revenue is 84% tied to housing, saw second quarter revenue higher than it has been in several years. More employees are going on strike. According to Barron's, RBC Global Asset Management noted that there have been 17 incidences of walkouts with 1,000 or more employees - the highest since 2004-2005. That's a sign of confidence on the part of labor. If the 20% gains of the market over the past year were for a full calendar year, it would be the 22nd best performance in the past 84 years. The good news is 20% gains in the market has been a good indication of future economic growth. Let's take a look at the five markets closest to the past year's performance. In 1967, the stock market rose 20.02%. The following year, GDP rose by 4.8%. In 2009 and 1963, the market climbed 19.67% each year. GDP grew 3.2% in 2010 and 5.2% in 1964. In 1999, the market grew by 19.64% resulting in a 2.9% increase in GDP. And in 1996, when the market rose by 19.33%, GDP was higher by 4.4% just 12 months later. After so many years of suffering, it may be difficult to picture brighter days ahead, but rest assured, they're coming. That's not me being my usual cheerful self. That's the numbers and executives of some of America's top companies talking. After a near death experience, the patient is about to go back to work. Before you know it, he'll be back at the gym and on the golf course. Let's stop treating him as an invalid and start recognizing that things will return to normal.

Fudzilla Headline: TSMC tells Apple and Qualcomm where to stick their money So, now Apple is stuck with Samsung. LOL. Now that's funny. ARMs fabrication is falling apart, can't meet demand, can't produce enough 28nm products, can't satisfy customers, can't stay on the cutting edge of technology and yet Wall Street gives ARM the big P/E ratio while apparently in lockstep continuing to manipulate the Intel stock price and P/E ratio down. Intel in the meantime moves closer to 14nm production and total control over the fabrication space. What is so difficult for the morons on Wall Street to grasp? Oh that's right - they don't care about actual performance because they plan "to set" the Intel stock price. Something stinks here and it's the big firms on Wall Street setting defined stock price ranges. Not to mention the idea of Wall Street continuously attacking one of America's best companies.

I was thinking it was, now I'm thinking that was a mistake on my part.</Msg><Username>firstofmany</Username><Timestamp>1346337174629</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:32:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346337279263-40</Id><Title>Williams Capital: Intel QCOM to benefit from Samsung announcement</Title><Msg>Williams Capital reports from the IFA Conference in Berlin The Williams analyst noted that Samsung announced it's launch of ATIV Windows 8 products (which included Windows 8 phone, tablet and notebooks). Samsung also introduced its own hybrid, called the Slate, a laptop with a detachable screen. Announcements of a new product line are expected next week by Nokia (NYSE: NOK) and HTC. Willams analyst expects these new product announcements to also benefit QUALCOMM (Nasdaq: QCOM), the company that will supply a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz chipset to the new Samsung smartphone. Also, Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) could see upside as its Core i3 and i5 product will be supplied in the new Samsung Laptop/Notebook.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346337279263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:34:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346337312412-41</Id><Title>Wallis Eats Crow for Dinner Tonight</Title><Msg>How would you like that crow, Walldummy, original or extra crispy?

China exports decelerated in July, PMI is at or below 50 across every region, and the major rail companies reported double-digit declines in volumes. Communcation infrastructure is better in N. America and China as carriers prepare for a new 4G iPhone (Nasdaq: AAPL). We also believe that our Q4 estimate of flat sequential growth on Broadcom could be conservative. Recent weakness in Maxim represents an attractive entry point, in our view. At the same time, we are incrementally more cautious on TI (NYSE: TXN)(Neutral). We believe PC fundamentals are subdued owing to high channel inventory and weak orders from PC OEMs."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346337582027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:39:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346337722983-46</Id><Title>Will Intel Shares Print $23 Today?</Title><Msg>Or tomorrow?</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1346337722983</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:42:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346337850692-47</Id><Title>Gartner expects India PC shipment growth to continue in the third quart</Title><Msg>Big winner in increase was Lenovo.

DELL seems different and I think they are having a hard time competing on price and features in a flat PC environment. Lenovo just increased their market share in India by 4% at primarily DELL's expense. It depends on your investment strategy. Buying back in through put selling can get you shares even lower priced. You can sell the Jan $26 put for $2.70 and get Intel shares for effectively $26 - $2.70 = $23.30 or just the $2.70 premium if intel finishes higher than $26.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1346341468501</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:44:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346341492180-78</Id><Topic><Title>Hay PETE the CON man from CNBC look were INTC is today,</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1345834855000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 15:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pete now looks like its going under $24 so I guess you will start telling us to sell</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1346341492180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346342168450-79</Id><Title>The MB Gets Very Quiet</Title><Msg>When wallis and his stable of aliases exit.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1346342168450</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:56:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346342420032-80</Id><Topic><Title>Only a complete idiot would sell INTC at these prices</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1346338060670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:47:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I sure wouldn't short a stock at rsi 30 on the daily, HPQ and DELL and INTC all at those levels after this little dip from 26.80 to 24.21.</Msg><Username>wdblawgrow</Username><Timestamp>1346342420032</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:00:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346342871978-81</Id><Topic><Title>Battapaglia is a huge INTC bull,</Title><Username>tradermark58</Username><Timestamp>929730593000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 1999-06-18 14:29:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you need to write to the sec.

At the Mobile World Congress in February, Intel and ZTE announced that the Chinese phone maker would develop smartphones based on Intel's Atom processor, the first of which would arrive during the second half of 2012. ZTE has made good on that promise as the Grand X IN will start shipping in September in Europe. The Android 4.0-based smartphone's 4.3-inch screen has a 960-by-540 pixel resolution. That is a step up from the previously announced Orange Santa Clara, which uses the same Intel processor, but has a 4.03-inch screen with a 1024-by-600 pixel resolution. However, Lenovo's K800 has a bigger screen at 4.5 inches. The hardware specs also include an 8-megapixel camera, NFC, support for HD Voice and an FM radio. Users can access the Internet using HSDPA or Wi-Fi, including the 802.11n standard. ZTE didn't announce pricing for the Grand X IN. Intel's list of smartphone partners includes Lava, Orange, Lenovo, ZTE and Motorola Mobility. With Thursday's announcement all of them except for Motorola have announced a product. But Motorola is expected to join the others and debut its first Intel-based smartphone on Sept. 18 at an event in London.</Msg><Username>intc_inside</Username><Timestamp>1346343807874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:23:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346343877356-87</Id><Title>No support till 22.</Title><Msg>Short this pig.</Msg><Username>nj_maverick</Username><Timestamp>1346343877356</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346343888766-88</Id><Title>Tonshiba unveils 1st Ultrabook/Tablet Hybrid (Intel Inside)</Title><Msg>.

It’s time for a realty check. During the Bush administration both taxes and regulations were cut and look what happened; our country experienced slow growth, falling real wages, slow employment growth, a very substantial increase in our national debt, and the “Greatest Recession” in many of our lifetime. These facts can not be disputed. While I believe that the tax code should be completely revised and that some regulations need to be reviewed and perhaps eliminated, the Republican Party apparently does not understand that it is demand that creates growth, and consequently jobs; not lower taxes. If products are in demand and individuals have the funds available they will purchase them. Unfortunately over the past decade real wages have gone down as our country has transitioned from an industrial economy to a service economy. Adding to the problem has been the outsourcing of jobs overseas and the housing crash all of which have resulted in less cash in the pocketbook of the consumer. As a result, overall demand is down and consequently employment. What our country has to do is to get more money into the hands of the consumer. This can be done either through tax policy, public work projects, or an increase in the minimum wage. Reducing uncertainty and developing long-term solutions to the problems facing our country would also give our economy a psychological boost.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1346346011898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:00:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346347059154-98</Id><Title>I LOVE THE NEW YAHOO MESSAGE BOARDS!</Title><Msg>They are way better than/then the old ones.</Msg><Username>tooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1346347059154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:17:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346347077066-99</Id><Topic><Title>Strategic Concern About INTC</Title><Username>northtower91</Username><Timestamp>1346340064620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:21:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking to get in for long term, I'm impressed by the Ivy Bridge technologies even while the overall PC/Wintel market is weak.

Well is their doubt the results are worse. This is on top of the fact that we have gone into even more debt to accomplish this feeble growth. Your demand argument is off base when you look at the economy globally. Borrowing money from China or the Middle East to buy oil and other products from them doesn't help our economy and only puts us more in debt. The best way to creat US jobs is to make our business more competitive by lowering taxes and regulations. We would then have more demad for our products both here and abroad.

I have nothing to add to those points. The simple reality is that PC growth is slowing due to the global economy, saturation, and competition for the wallet with mobile/tablets. What is curious are two points: 1. there is a myth that Intel just have to produce a good mobile/tablet to compete with ARM and the it will start to win the tablet market. I don't think so. The problem with Intel in mobile/tablet is not technoogy, is not the chip, it is not tri-gate transistors.....it is Intel's business model. ARM is a ubiquitous architecture that many know how to implement with many IPs available to work with the ARM core and many foundries who can build it. Intel's architecture is closed and only Intel can build it. It ain't going to work in mobile/tablets!! Intel made a feeble attempt to license Atom to TSMC but it went bust in less than one year. I know some of the folks involved and Intel's licensing fees and restrictions are so unrealistic nobody would bite. On top of that, there were no IPs to go with the core! The point is....22nm is not the answer. A new chip is not the answer. Intel needs a new business model. 2. Intel touts that mobile/tablet growth is still good for Intel because it means more data centers, more servers, etc.. It is true, for now, and to a certain extent. But let's not forget that Intel's huge (and hugely expensive) technoogy and manufacturing base requires a very large volume of chips to sustain. Server chips alone will never pay for the technology and manufacturing. And without technology and manufacturing, Intel's competitiveness is in question. Just look at IBM, Sun Microsystem, TI, Motorola, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Siemens, NCR....if you try to build a businessa round server chips alone, you can't afford the economics! All of the said, Intel still has a lot going for it. What Intel needs is new leadership and new management. A visionary who can take Intel outside of its traditions and grow in new, high grwoth areas. Otellini has been CEO now for almost 8 years. Sadly, none of the strategies he embarked on resulted in anything. It is time for a change!</Msg><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1346363432477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 17:50:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346365243177-151</Id><Topic><Title>What's ailing Intel</Title><Username>billsuxx</Username><Timestamp>1346363432477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 17:50:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>its a blue chip. it may be at 30 in a few years. but it aint goin nowhere soon.</Msg><Username>sharppolly</Username><Timestamp>1346365243177</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 18:20:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346366972867-152</Id><Topic><Title>Demand Creates Jobs</Title><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1346346011898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:00:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just to make this a little on-topic, Intel has been a leader in keeping their production in the US and not outsourcing.

And then Intel went to $29+. And he shut up for a while. But then he got his little, tiny ego all brushed off, took it to the tire store and re-inflated it, got up every morning and told himself that he really wasn't an idiot and hadn't totally humiliated himself again and again and again with his posting stupidity. I put him and all his many alias on ignore a long time ago. Unfortunately I still see replies and topics. I can tell without even reading his garbage that he is posting the same things yet again. Like the 10-year statistic he trots out every time he can't find anything in the last nine years to bash Intel with. Now he is re-cycling the same old "24" garbage but has replaced $24 with $30. And he doesn't think anyone has or will notice. I suppose we will get to do this again at $36 and again at $42 and so on. Lucy is not a smart man. And he doesn't write well which is why he has to re-cycle his material and has to stick to things he can handle like saying "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddd." He bashed Intel constantly from 17.67 to almost 30. Years ago I told him it was all about the fabrication. He didn't listen. He's not a smart man. There's only a couple of possibilities as to why he is here daily embarrassing himself: 1.) He's getting paid. 2.) Intel fired him or ran over his dog or put his start-up out of business. 3.) He's psychologically damaged. 4.) He's not a smart man. 5.) Some combination of one through four. Frankly I could care less. I have him and his aliases on ignore. My world view is not something that Lucy will every affect. But I have to say that those of you who don't yet have Lucy on ignore I have to classify as equally lame. When you lie down with dogs you are bound to get fleas. I wish you the same financial success as anyone would enjoy who had listened to Lucy. None. He's not a smart man.
