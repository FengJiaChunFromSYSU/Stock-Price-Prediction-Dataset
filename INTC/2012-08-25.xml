In Q2 Apple fell to fourth place in this massive market, with the IDC Group reporting market share plunging from 20 percent to 10 percent. Gartner, Inc. (IT) reported a smaller drop from 17 to 12 percent. Regardless of which numbers are correct, the consensus is Apple struggled in China; at least for a quarter. Samsung Electronics Comp., Ltd. (KSC:005930), Apple's bitter perennial rival also fell slightly from 21 percent to 19 percent, but clung to the top sales spot. Meanwhile, a local firm, Lenovo Group, Ltd. (HKG:0992) -- makers of the Intel Corp. (INTC) x86 Android "LePhone" -- rose to second, seizing 11 percent of the market. Lenovo is currently in second place in PC sales as well, globally. ZTE Corp. (SHE:000063) also did well, moving past Apple and into third place. http://www.dailytech.com/Chinese+Produce+iPhones+But+Arent+as+Interested+in+Buying+Them/article25505.htm</Msg><Username>mytakeismine</Username><Timestamp>1345869864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:44:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345871804000-3</Id><Topic><Title>intel_dividend</Title><Username>herbal_dude</Username><Timestamp>1345850237000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remembered that.

Don't read too much into them. Tuesday's downside reversal suggested a possible triple top in the DJIA but stocks were overbought before Tuesday and the volume was light. The major indexes kept their uptrends started in June despite suffering the first weekly loss in six weeks. Unless the uptrend is broken or volume expands on the downside, pullbacks like we had this week are results of the market trying to work off its overbought condition. Overall, the market is likely to be stuck in a narrow trading range until the Fed speaks.

The fact remains - Intel is in Lenovo in China and if Lenovo has certain designs that are doing very well, which we now know that they do, don't you think they'll have those same designs with 14nm in them next year?

I have two thoughts of what is likely. #1. They don't sit across the table to negotiate with Samsung on pricing without a plan B position. TSMC, UMC and others must be a plan B which they would go to if Samsung got too greedy. So if Samsung told Apple to get lost they would have other ARM suppliers on speed dial. #2. Steve Jobs mentioned when they debuted the Intel processor back in 06 that they had been working on the project for five years. This leads me to believe that they most likely have an Intel team working on whatever designs for future SoC or MMCs that they can think of. There has to not only be something that results that captures attention of the Apple management as a solid reason to switch from ARM. Not only that but they need to have a solid plan to wet aside manufacturing capacity for Apple. I'm not certain that Intel can take on a high volume low profit margin customer like Apple without it affecting their bottom line as other more expensive, and higher margin processors get thrown on the back burner.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1345904829000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:27:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345905265000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Apple wins Samsung lawsuit...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345853348000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 20:09:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why would samsung throw out what may be their biggest source of revenue/ the only way to get their money back is via apple. you have no business sense. sorry.</Msg><Username>ramalamalongdong</Username><Timestamp>1345905265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:34:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345905695000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Is INTC a Sure Shot?

You idiots, years ago, said there was NOOO way that Apple would use Intel in Macs. But of course, being that you are complete clowns, you were wrong then and you are wrong now. Intel chips will go into Apple phones and Ipads before the end of 2013 and so eat it you little know nothings. No one who uses Apple will even notice but you message board warriors will cry about it. Of course this is inevitable and may come sooner than we think. Apple HATES Samsuck's guts and Samdung, while being stopped in America, is still going to sell the stolen goods all over the world where it already won in governments and courts. This Samsung Apple thing is a bad marriage and when the fight is over money, things never recover. If Jobs were alive, he would have already dumped Samsung for Intel but it will occur soon no matter what because Apple Likes Intel and HATES Samsung. The headquarters are only 12 miles apart. The top people run into each other at luch and dinner often. They have kids who go to schools together. http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl It is a natural alliance between Intel and Apple against the SUPER TECH GIANT Samsung. You can be sure that Samsung will attack Intel and Apple repeatedly in the years to come and Intel is the key to locking the door on the Sammy attacks on Apple's place as the world's number one profit making phone maker. While Intel will never be able to shut off Samsung to Intel chips to give Apple a huge edge, it will be able to give Apple a 6 month edge by supplying Apple first and by making the Apple chips in Intel fabs. That 6 months could stretch to 9 months and 9 months makes sammy's top edge phone always 2nd best once Intel gives Apple the 14nm Intel chips in phones. I told you Intel longs to just have a beer, watch some baseball and football, go make love to your woman or women but relax, Intel will be 30 before November ends and if--and if--Intel announces an Apple deal or if it starts to leak as a rumor, that 30 will be north of 50. Apple and Intel will be American California lovers and they will throw that nasty HOOO Samsung to the side of the road to feed on low end craaaap. 30 soon and you can , as that psycho Robert Blake, TAKE IT TO THE BANK.

Instead, the taxpayer tells the Internal Revenue Service that he owns a derivative product that is identical in every way to the stock -- except it isn't the stock, so therefore no U.S. taxes are owed. It's called a "total return equity swap," because the buyer still gets the benefit -- the "total return" -- of owning the stock, or equity. "This use of total return equity swaps, such as to avoid the U.S. dividend withholding tax, was very widespread for more than a decade, and may not be dead yet, although the IRS issued a shot-across-the-bow Notice concerning the practice in 2010," writes Daniel Shaviro, the Wayne Perry Professor of Taxation at New York University School of Law. "But taxpayers who engaged in it to avoid the dividend withholding tax were coming perilously close to committing tax fraud, in cases where the economic equivalence to direct ownership was too great."</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345939436000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:03:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345939488000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Slick Willard TAX CHEAT...</Title><Username>jerry_cornholed_you</Username><Timestamp>1345936471000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 19:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The second technique is "not legal," according to Victor Fleischer, a tax expert and professor of law at the University of Colorado. A taxpayer saves substantial amounts of money by pretending that regular income received as a management fee for running a private equity firm is not income, but is instead a capital gain. That drops the tax rate on that income from 35 percent to 15 percent. Citing the Gawker documents, Fleischer notes that Bain engaged in the management-fee maneuver to reduce the tax bill of its investors. "Unlike carried interest, which is unseemly but perfectly legal, Bain’s management fee conversions are not legal. If challenged in court, Bain would lose. The Bain partners, in my opinion, misreported their income if they reported these converted fees as capital gain instead of ordinary income," he writes. Shaviro, meanwhile, notes that Bain employed a version of the total return equity swap and says that taxpayers who engage in the practice have little legal justification for doing so. "[T]he only leg that taxpayers had to stand on in some of these cases was common practice and the apparent lack of IRS enforcement (not a very strong leg if the correct application of the law was clear)," he writes. "How far out on the limb were Bain-affiliated foreign entities that were making money through total return equity swaps, and claiming not to owe U.S. withholding tax? And what should we make of this, for purposes of the presidential campaign, if what they were doing, while legally dubious, was common practice?"</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345939488000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:04:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345939808000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 RT Version is Better Than The Windows 8 Pro Version</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345914310000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 13:05:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The $199 is a rumour &amp; basically thats a bare-bone price (if true).

Apple's latest (Samsung-manufactured) processor is using 45nm technology, which has been described as simply "too big." Samsung's attempt to improve is based on a 28nm die, which won't hit shelves until the release of the next-gen iPad in early 2013. Clearly, Intel's ahead of the game—22nm mobile in 2013, 14nm mobile in 2014. This is the advantage of having a ton of fabs and the advantage of size. If competitors can't keep up, they'll be left behind. ARM may have the early lead, but it's the second half that really matters, and that's where Intel's Tick-Tock clock management will enable it to shine. In conclusion, Intel's current valuation (P/E of around 11) and dividend yield (over 3.4%) combined make it a steal. Trefis believes Intel has a current fair value around $32, and based on even conservative growth estimates, Intel could be worth much more than that for long-term investors. Intel's proven tick-tock methodology and its dedicated fab capacity give it a very strong competitive advantage over industry players. http://seekingalpha.com/article/785471-tick-tock-the-intel-party-doesn-t-stop</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345943992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:19:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345949028000-61</Id><Topic><Title>Tick-Tock: The Intel Party Doesn't Stop</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1345943992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:19:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Supposedly, moving from one process generation to the next takes about 2 years. Tick-tock is a strategy that says update the chip architecture in a release in the middle of this (long) process generation change. How does this give Intel an advantage? Even if does give an advantage, Intel can't prevent someone else from following it. Its like copy-exactly. Good idea but you cant patent it. Tick-tock is remotely catchy, amongst the rather boring terms used by the engineering industry, so it makes a better than average headline phrase. But linking it to process advantage doesn't make any sense. They say the ant always looks for its own molehill.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1345949028000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
