Of course, Windows on Atom is a PC and will run applications from Win 3.1 to Win 7. Compare to the MS tablet. The MS tablet is TWO pieces. That's like one-in-each-hand. But the two pieces clip together and the cover becomes a keyboard. Also, picture the motion of people taking the tablet out of the cover and putting it back in the cover. The Lenovo tablet is a total tablet except that it has a home docking station with keyboard. Very neat even if it is the backup and travel computer. It does include a stylus which is PC slate style. But with the Atom processor instead of the Ivy Bridge processor then it is looking for average users and not just business users. Next problem, the MS tablet can be an Intel processor or an ARM processor. But if the tablet is an ARM processor then Windows is not really Windows but more like the operating system of the Nokia mobile phone. Of course most applications on a mobile phone are just connections to a website. But we all are looking for Windows 8 to improve screen refresh rates on tablets. It if doesn't do that then they just completely missed the most important thing.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1344485585000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344492636000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT Office is garbage</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1344443117000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:25:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who still runs old windows programs?</Msg><Username>nonelogic</Username><Timestamp>1344492636000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 02:10:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344496693000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT Office is garbage</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1344443117000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:25:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point.

So Intel get to own 3 times as much of ASML as TSMC does, which they could one day sell for a 3 times as much profit if they turn out to be the winner in EUV. But it is an interesting question what advantages accrue to members of the club: early access to equipment, big discounts, priority in the queue? And yes, news reports say ASML expects Samsung to take a 5% stake too.</Msg><Username>semiwiki</Username><Timestamp>1344513115000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 07:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344519118000-6</Id><Title>Intel rated a BUY and gets an "A" rating</Title><Msg>http://www.thestreet.com/story/11657415/1/intel-corp-stock-buy-recommendation-reiterated-intc.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1344519118000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 09:31:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344519995000-7</Id><Title>Did you fools sell at 19.78 like I did?</Title><Msg>??????????

Biswamohan Pani was also sentenced Wednesday in Boston to two years of probation and fined $17,500. He pleaded guilty in April to five counts of wire fraud. Prosecutors say the 36-year-old Pani downloaded secret documents from Intel in May 2008, shortly after he announced he was leaving his Hudson, Mass., job. Santa Clara-based Intel valued those documents at between $200 million and $400 million. The company detected and reported the theft. Advanced Micro Devices cooperated with investigators. The Sunnyvale company says it didn't know of Pani's scheme.

Computerworld - Here's the legend: at a computer trade show in 1981, Bill Gates supposedly uttered this statement, in defense of the just-introduced IBM PC's 640KB usable RAM limit: "640K ought to be enough for anybody." The initial PC was based on the Intel 8088, which was a hybrid 8/16-bit processor — thus the reason for the 640KB memory limit. Though tiny by today's standards — 64-bit systems can support up to 128GB of memory — 640KB at that time was an order of magnitude larger than the 64KB limit that faced users of 8-bit computers, such as the Apple II+ and the Commodore 64 (see more coverage on our "Bill Gates Moves On" page). Even so, Gates' alleged statement looks like one of the most dogmatic, short-sighted comments ever, a verbal blunder perhaps topped only by Digital Equipment Corp. founder Ken Olsen's 1977 quip, "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home." (Olsen did actually say that, but he said later that the quote was taken out of context, and that he was referring not to PCs but to computers set up to control houses.) Despite the enduring popularity of the legend about the 640K comment, though, it's hard to find solid proof that Gates ever said it. For example, Wikiquote, an offshoot of Wikipedia, offers no strong evidence.

If he does, they will be a text book example of how the filthy rich get away with paying little or no income tax. The American public will then become outraged and the GOP will run for the hills because they are protecting these people from paying their fair share. If this happens, our tax code will get revised and force these tax dodgers to pay up. Of course the filthy rich are spending millions to keep their GOP friends in power so this doesn't happen.

Wireless charging is cool, but only small batteries can be charged wirelessly in a reasonably small amount of time. That means that future Ultrabooks and smartphones powered by Intel will be extremely low power. Reading this will probably give the ARM guys some very drizzly bowel movements for a while. 6:41 PM Intel (INTC) might offer wireless charging technology in 2H13 for ultrabooks and smartphones using its processors, claims sometimes-accurate Digitimes. Intel's charging solution reportedly doesn't require a phone to be placed in a specific position. Separately, the site reports Intel is stepping up its solid-state drive (SSD) development efforts for the high-margin data center segment, and has developed technology to extend SSD lifetimes.
