EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME! They threw me by their numbering. The Xeon used in getting these numbers is an UNANNOUNCED version of an Ivy Bridge with 12 (TWELVE) cores. From the Aregister. The chip that Intel didn't want you to know about On the x86 portion of the Tianhe-2 system, NUDT has opted for a top-bin Ivy Bridge-EP part, and Dongarra says it is, in fact, a twelve-core Xeon E5 v2 chip (specifically, the E5-2692) running at 2.2GHz. Intel is sure to be annoyed by the release of this information, since it has not announced the core count of these processors. There has been some yammering about a ten-core part up until now, but now we know there is a twelve-core part. Intel is not expected to announce these Xeon E5 v2 processors until the fall, most likely at Intel Developer Forum in September. But as was the case with the eight-core "Sandy Bridge-EP" Xeon E5 v1 chips, Intel has ramped up production ahead of the formal launch and cherry-picked some big HPC customers to show off the processor.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371460495408</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 05:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371461130862-4</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370237011973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very soon.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1371461130862</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 05:25:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371462733756-5</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370237011973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you give me a single example of a shifting derivative?

Cuts forecasts of ARM's CPU share in the smartphone market to 72% from 86% in 2014 and beyond. Says the balance of 28% goes to Intel, however there are scenarios where Intel could gain up to 40% share if it enabled some breakthrough devices at the likes of Sony, Amazon and Motorola. Numis reduces its forecasts of ARM's share in the tablet market to 70% from 80%. Cuts EPS forecasts for FY 2014, 2015 and 2016 to 21.5p, 24.4p and 29.9p respectively. ARM is the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 3.3% at 834p.

Wall Street remains in denial though as Intel at this point is up a mere 22 cents. If ARM is down by 3.5 percent then Intel should be up by 3.5 percent. This total disconnect should start to resolve itself out soon. The big Wall Street firms have totally misplayed Intel and the chickens are now coming home to roost as fried chicken.

Windows 8 becomes 8.1 – the nomenclature is important as it signifies an incremental upgrade but we think it will be much more.

Well, you can argue that it should maybe be a 2 to 1 match. So, maybe Intel should only be up by 1.75 percent. I have thought about it a lot. Bottom line is that ARM's P/E loss should be Intel's gain. Intel's P/E should be at least 50 percent higher than where it is now. That would call for a stock price of 37.50. Which means Intel is under-valued by 12 or 13 bucks. Hmmm. Okay I'm sticking with Intel should be up by at least 4 percent today to start to reel some of that in.

Just do it. OR--if you want to avoid that, simply move the mound back 5 feet. Either will do the job. What? You say baseball is pure and how could we ever think of moving this mound back. But wait a minute. After the pitchers started to dominate completely in the late 1960s and early 1970s, baseball lowered the mound so do not tell me you cannot move the mound. It was done with radical increases in run scored resulting. But better yet--wear a helmet and move the mound back 5 feet. OK---then we have Intel and the shift to its chips in phones and tablets which will shock the world. Deal with it. It is inevitable just like is the death of the Tea party in National elections. When 1 in 4 people are non-white as now, a party, the GOP based upon wanting to go back in time when whites ruled and we had segregation is not going to happen is it. OK--you think things are bad now repuuups? Well wait until 1 in 3 voters are non-white in 8 years. The Dems will be able to run a broomstick as a candidate and win the White House by then. How about when it is 50-50? Well then the Dem primary race will be treated as the Presidential race because the Repub will lose after that getting 30% of the vote or less. Intel will hit 40 this year and 100 before the end of the decade and maybe and maybe even before the end of 2016. Things are changing boys.

Intel could be set to launch its first 8-core CPU for desktops in the second half of next year, beginning with its 2014 Haswell-E enthusiast-grade chip, according to a report on VR-Zone. Haswell-E processors will apparently be built on the 22nm 2nd generation Hi-k process and will pack up to 20MB of L3 cache. The chip also looks set to feature Intel Turbo Boost 2, in addition to support for DDR4 and 16 threads thanks to hyper-threading technology, all supported by Intel's forthcoming Wellsburg motherboard chipset. The company is apparently looking to do away with the 4-core base model in favour of 6-core and 8-core versions of the CPU. Raw power In terms of raw power, it's the biggest leap since Intel announced its first 6-core processor for desktops back in 2010. The superfast chip could primarily deliver the goods for three types of users: powerhungry gamers, overclockers, and content creators in the video, photo and music fields.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371490944889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:42:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371491340274-58</Id><Title>The Daily Double</Title><Msg>Intel Up ARMH Down What a great call by Numis.

Codenamed “Knights Landing,” the next generation of Intel MIC Architecture-based products will be available as a coprocessor or a host processor (CPU) and manufactured using Intel’s 14nm process technology featuring second generation 3-D tri-gate transistors. As a PCIe card-based coprocessor, “Knights Landing” will handle offload workloads from the system’s Intel Xeon processors and provide an upgrade path for users of current generation of coprocessors, much like it does today. However, as a host processor directly installed in the motherboard socket, it will function as a CPU and enable the next leap in compute density and performance per watt, handling all the duties of the primary processor and the specialized coprocessor at the same time. When used as a CPU, “Knights Landing” will also remove programming complexities of data transfer over PCIe, common in accelerators today. To further boost the performance for HPC workloads, Intel will significantly increase the memory bandwidth for all “Knights Landing” products by introducing integrated on-package memory. This will allow customers to take full advantage of available compute capacity without encountering memory bandwidth bottlenecks experienced today [Looks like Intel has 14nm right around the corner.]</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1371492953967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371494100356-64</Id><Title>Intel’s Top-Secret Lab Is Working On Google Glass-Like Gadgets</Title><Msg>from business insider In 2012, Intel spent $10.1 billion on research and development, making it one of the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world. Half of that money goes to wildly experimental tech, Justin Rattner, Intel CTO said Monday on stage at the Bloomberg Next Big Thing Summit. “50 cents of every dollar goes into exploratory stuff and the other 50 cents of every dollar goes into tech that serves the business unit that makes the money,” he said. Much of that experimental tech is on Intel-designed devices, though Rattner stopped short of announcing plans to bring any of these devices to market. He deftly sidestepped a question on if he thought Google Glass would become a mainstream device. Glass is built using ARM chips, Intel’s competitor, so it would have been newsworthy if he endorsed it. Even so, Intel’s lab is working on wearable tech, he said, and he does see a big future for alternatives to Glass. “Wearable computers will come in a variety of forms. Things that look like watches, head-worn devices like Google Glass of all sorts, and bio-sensors sewn into clothing,” he said. The labs are focused on the underlying technology needed for wearable devices, rather than prototypes of the devices themselves.

Those that followed your advice at $20 would have missed out on a 25% gain. Those who value your opinion will likely follow your advice. Those who think you are only pursuing your own self interest will not follow your advice. For me, I cannot take someone who spams the board like you very seriously.

Intel Corp. (INTC), the world’s largest chipmaker, is being pushed by Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich to bring new products to market more quickly and then update to refine them. “He wants to see Intel move faster. That’s very clear,” Justin Rattner, the company’s chief technology officer, said today. “We’ve been legitimately accused of trying to get everything perfect before it comes to market.” Rattner, who spoke at the Bloomberg Next Big Thing Summit in Half Moon Bay, California, said that the company is going to respond to a mobile market where products are introduced then rapidly updated. Intel has struggled to translate its dominance of personal computer processors into a foothold in tablets and smartphones. The company is working hard to develop chip technology that draws less power and enables laptops and other computing devices to get the kind of all-day battery life offered by phones, Rattner said. “There’s no question the age of handheld mobile devices and soon wearable devices are upon us,” he said. “That requires a complete rethink of how you design those systems and how you program those systems and how you provision those devices.” Intel CEO Krzanich was promoted to the top job at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker in May, succeeding Paul Otellini, who retired. Krzanich, a former factory manager, said the company will speed up efforts to kick start its work on chips for mobile devices that threaten the PC industry. Global tablet shipments are expected to eclipse PCs by 2015 as consumers flock to smaller, more affordable machines, according to researcher IDC. Intel ended 2012 with less than one percent market share in tablets and phones, according to Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. research.</Msg><Username>smokinghotblitch</Username><Timestamp>1371501487214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:38:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371501614626-92</Id><Topic><Title>Almost to the double top just a little higher, Remember to always take some profits before there gone</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1371483498778</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 11:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's been WWs hope for years now.

In real terms, with Linpack, it achieves 33.8 petaflops, in which the 384,000 CPU cores with the officially still unreleased 12-core Ivy Bridge EP (Xeon E5-2692v2 with 2.2GHz) play a role too."</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1371506586297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:03:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371508769196-100</Id><Topic><Title>Huge XP Replacement Wave on the Way</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371338601960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 19:23:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and a smaller electricity bill</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1371508769196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:39:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371511129858-101</Id><Topic><Title>INTC will go into the red by the end of the day</Title><Username>itakebackmyapology</Username><Timestamp>1371478613919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure it did</Msg><Username>albchem</Username><Timestamp>1371511129858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 19:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371514633873-102</Id><Topic><Title>Huge XP Replacement Wave on the Way</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371338601960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 19:23:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know that this story bodes well for Intel upgrade cycles, at least from the initial impression. It was introduced in September of 2001. So, it's going on a dozen year old. The thing that makes it sad to lose in perspective of Intel is that at the time a fairly robust system would have around 512 megabytes of RAM and a 40GB hard drive was considered a fairly large drive. A highly stripped down version can install in under one gig of space and a sloppy install is around 8GB. With the new smartphones hitting the market powered by Intel one of the neat things to try would be making a dual boot and running XP. Perhaps if Microsoft went to a very low annual subscription on XP they would find funding to develop it further. I could see how hooking it up to external USB, and monitor and running an actual XP session from a phone would have it's benefits, especially in enterprise situations where systems are locked down hard. Not for everyday use but in emergencies this would be amazing.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1371514633873</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 20:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371514953054-103</Id><Topic><Title>Huge XP Replacement Wave on the Way</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1371338601960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 19:23:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>XP does not do touch.
