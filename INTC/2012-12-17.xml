Comments?" [You build a dedicated TSMC fab based on what technology? The 28nm they still don't have fully ramped? And be instantly obsolete? Or the 20nm that may not exist in volume for three years? And be obsolete then? Apple loses either way with a deal with TSMC as Intel leaves TSMCs fabrication in the dust. ARM foundries are so far behind they they have to attempt to skip cycles. They can't even demonstrate a proper ramp when they don't skip cycles. Intel is on its second ramp of FinFET. This will not end well for ARM or its foundries. It's all about the fabrication. Intel's lead is insurmountable. I'm guessing that Apple has already figured it out....]</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355720843317</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:07:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355721686630-3</Id><Topic><Title>Is Apple Building a Secret Chip Factory?</Title><Username>wildandwacky39</Username><Timestamp>1355720452434</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:00:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's see - they are just starting to explore the idea so with planning, construction, testing and ramping they might get product out the door in three or four years. By that time Intel will be doing 10nm out of five facilities. Since Steve Jobs is gone, Apple will still be selling iPads and iPhones in three or four years. Does anyone think Apple can make enough incremental improvements in the existing products for them to be relevant in three or four years? So, if they go with TSMC, they should have old fabrication to go with old products in three or four years. Sounds like recipe for disaster to me. With its absence of new products and the ARM foundry fabrication crisis, Apple's future does not look bright. Well, a deal with Intel would take care of one of the problems...</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1355721686630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:21:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355722567132-4</Id><Title>A big hurdle that ARM chip producers face is the high cost of</Title><Msg>manufacturing these chips.

The tide is finally turning! Check out SemiAccurate. These guys (especially Charlie Demerjian, who I think is a founder) are mostly negative and harsh on Intel. So this article says a lot. ========================== One of the questions we’ve been dying to answer the past few years is who will win in the match-up between x86 and ARM. Charlie’s talked a lot about this duel in the past, noting that ARM’s instruction set architecture (ISA) is more efficient and less complicated than the current x86 ISA used by Intel, VIA, and AMD. But Charlie will also be the first to tell you about the almost comically large advantage that Intel has built for itself with its industry leading process technology. The outcome of this x86 versus ARM war will decide whether or not Intel can break into the quickly growing mobile market. To answer this question we’ve gathered the poster child of the Windows 8 effort, Microsoft’s Surface RT convertible tablet, and a lesser known tablet from Acer called the Iconia W510. The Surface RT uses Nvidia’s Tegra 3 processor, which is a 4 plus 1 core ARM based chip and the W510 uses a recently released Atom chip from Intel dubbed the Z2670, which is a dual core hyper-threaded chip. Both systems have 1366 by 768 pixel screens, and the screen brightness levels on these tablets were maxed out. The Surface RT has a 31.5 Watt hour battery and the Iconia W510 has a 27 Watt hour battery. In the video below I’ve done a basic comparison of the two systems and run a few benchmarks to evaluate these two tablets.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355747252943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 07:27:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355749991358-13</Id><Topic><Title>Gartner: Semiconductor Sales Neared $300 Billion In 2010 Rebound</Title><Username>sharronbyamhwqoghj6874</Username><Timestamp>1303146799000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-04-18 13:13:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are increasing fixed expenses.</Msg><Username>louisestephen288</Username><Timestamp>1355749991358</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:13:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355750178391-14</Id><Topic><Title>Atom bests Tegra 3 in performance and battery life</Title><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355747252943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 07:27:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I’m sure many of you expected Intel’s new Atom to hold a performance advantage over Nvidia’s quickly ageing Tegra 3. But the fact that this little x86 chip managed to best an ARM based competitor in battery life while providing better performance is quite a feat. For the sake of transparency it worth noting that the Surface RT lasted six hours and thirty three minutes in our video playback test and the Iconia W510 lasted six hours and fifty one minutes. I ran an additional worst case scenario battery life test after the video had been finished to confirm that Intel’s battery life advantage held even when the chip was being pushed as hard as we could make it go. In this test each of the tablets streamed a 720P video from Youtube, while running the IE 10 fishbowl benchmark, the beta fish benchmark, and an HTML 5 canvas demo that draws geometric shapes. Running these four apps in parallel put an 80 to 100 percent load on the processor of each of these tablets. Microsoft’s Surface lasted for three hours and thirty four minutes, while Acer’s Iconia lasted for three hours and forty seven minutes. Thus Acer’s tablet again has marginally better battery life than the Surface RT. Intel’s new “Clovertrail” Atom chips are very competitive solutions in the Windows 8 tablet segment. It will be interesting to see how they fair against tablets using Qualcomm’s Krait architecture, but for now it’s safe to say that these chips are able to best Nvidia’s Tegra 3 in regards to both performance and power consumption. Props to Intel for finally making Atom a competitive tablet solution.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1355750178391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:16:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355750259721-15</Id><Topic><Title>A big hurdle that ARM chip producers face is the high cost of</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355722567132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:36:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world is going ARM... ___________________ HP ditches ARM for Intel in Project Moonshot Published on 20th June 2012 by Gareth Halfacree</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1355750259721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:17:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355750316994-16</Id><Topic><Title>A big hurdle that ARM chip producers face is the high cost of</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355722567132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:36:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world is going ARM... ___________________ HP to hold off on ARM-based Windows tablet Rue Liu, Jun 29th 2012</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1355750316994</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:18:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355750383110-17</Id><Topic><Title>A big hurdle that ARM chip producers face is the high cost of</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355722567132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:36:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world is going ARM... _______________________ VMware Boss Puts Brakes on ARM Server Revolution By Cade Metz08.30.123:08 PM</Msg><Username>euro.spam</Username><Timestamp>1355750383110</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:19:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355750524425-18</Id><Topic><Title>A big hurdle that ARM chip producers face is the high cost of</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1355722567132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:36:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world is going ARM... __________________ Had Microsoft listened to Dell, it could have avoided one of the major criticisms of its new operating system: that Windows RT looks so much like Windows 8 it’s too easy for a consumer to mistakenly buy a Windows RT device, not realising it’s not a regular Windows device.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. (More...) As one of the few remaining Intel (INTC) bulls these days, it has been interesting to see the smear campaign that the sell-side has been running against shares of the company. During the first half of the year, the sell-side was extremely positive on the stock, with price targets in the $30+ range all over the place. After the stock peaked in May, testing 5 year highs (while at the same time trading at a reasonable valuation), it seemed that any and all negative news was baked in time-and-time again. Support levels were broken, the PC was slowly growing after Q2, and by Q3 it was supposedly coughing up blood after everybody got it into their heads that everyone would be throwing away their PCs for underpowered tablets. Of course, with the PC "dying," and with Intel having "missed the boat" on mobile (which seems silly since the "boat" is always coming back every year or two depending on your contract with your carrier), shares of the chip giant are at a mind-boggling bargain. Intel bears will point to the share price's stagnation over the last 10 years while conveniently ignoring the fact that Intel's EPS has been very rapidly growing due to substantial increases in net income as well as a dramatic reduction of share count.</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1355776595653</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:36:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355776606947-80</Id><Topic><Title>Taking profits is the only way to make money and you know INTC has to retest 19.23 the only ? is will it hold</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1355774401500</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:00:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am still waiting for it to test the Mar. 2009 $12 lows.

He said it LIVE, on stage. What happened to that "pledge" as he worded it??????????? Just disgusting. Each day during the month of November, the government brought in a little more than $5 billion of revenue. That’s a lot of money – but the U.S. government spent in that time more than $11 billion a day. The difference is roughly $6 billion. Of that $11 billion, the top items were as follows: The Department of Health and Human Services, which goes through roughly $3 billion a day; Social Security, which shells out roughly $2.5 billion a day; the Department of Defense, which runs a $1.8 billion daily tab; and interest on the debt, which eats up $854 million every day. Economists say the latter number is the most concerning of all – since the country gets practically nothing in exchange for that. It’s just paying the bills on the debt, and the number is subject to wild fluctuation. “We've got a $16 trillion debt, and servicing the debt is hard now,” former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana said. “This is with interest rates at record lows. God forbid something should happen to cause interest rates to go up even a little, back to where they ordinarily would be, the burden of this debt would become immensely greater.”</Msg><Username>att4glte</Username><Timestamp>1355796232365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 21:03:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355798780911-104</Id><Topic><Title>When does Intel get a new CEO?

The liberal filth won't debate him either. The liberal filth is just telling Boehner what song to play. And then they are telling him to dance to the tune. Everyone who estimated how much damage George Bush did to the world economy was wildly optimistic. Everyone, optimistic or pessamistic underestimated by a factor of 10x. That is real easy for you outraged conservatives to overlook.

Q4 earnings are on Jan. 17, I would expect they should have warned by now since most holiday sales are in and the quarter is coming to its close. AMD's CEO touted strong sales over Black Friday weekend, and we all know AMD is a distant 2nd to Intel. I predict EPS of $.63 just to tick off the shorts.</Msg><Username>gregory.lynn</Username><Timestamp>1355803204471</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 23:00:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355805932899-109</Id><Topic><Title>Is it too late for INTC to warn?</Title><Username>previs_beameister</Username><Timestamp>1355801442078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 22:30:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once again... Why is Intel one of only a handful of companies that warn? What's the purpose? The price of the stock goes down after warning then it goes down more between warning and earnings since no one wants to buy the stock. Then it goes down some more after earnings? Wouldn't it be better to not warn, get a one time hit to a stock price after bad earnings and be done with it? Some posters say the stock price goes down less after warning - look of what happened to Intel - it went straight down for the entire 3 months after last warning.</Msg><Username>bubbagumphere</Username><Timestamp>1355805932899</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 23:45:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
