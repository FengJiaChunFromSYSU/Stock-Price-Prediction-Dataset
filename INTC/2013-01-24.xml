The Razer Edge is designed to bring the PC and console gaming experience to a Windows 8 tablet. CNET gave the Razer Edge both its Best of Show and People’s Voice awards at CES, calling it “evolutionary computing” and saying that the device “succeeds in showing us where tablets, computing and even entertainment will be heading very soon.” This marks the second turn in the CES spotlight for the gaming tablet made by Razer, a San Diego company that built its reputation on computer peripherals for PC gamers. Last year a prototype of the device, called “Project Fiona,” also garnered a CNET People’s Voice award. “Games once played with a huge desktop PC can now be played anywhere,” said Intel’s Sam Gao who has been involved with “Project Fiona” since work began in fall 2011. PC Gamers Demand High Performance The touch-enabled tablet can play popular PC games such as “Call of Duty,” “Battlefield 3″ and “Elder Scrolls: Skyrim.” Despite the portable form factor, the Razer Edge can deliver high-performance gaming, according to Jitesh Shah, an Intel engineer who worked on “Project Fiona.” “The performance and gaming experience is like no other for a mobile device,” Shah said. The key, according to Shah, was moving to the third-generation, 22-nanometer Intel Core processor, codenamed “Ivy Bridge,” from a 32nm platform used in the prototype. “Going with 22nm improves performance and power simultaneously, and that’s not typical,” Shah said. “It’s usually more of a give-and-take thing, but here we have give-and-give. There’s no tradeoff.” The move to a smaller microprocessor technology also resolved the cooling issue inherent to high-performance mobile gaming devices. “We overcame heat dissipation with 22nm,” Gao said. “If the cooling solution isn’t good, you feel it in your hands.” The Razer Edge is expected to go on sale this quarter starting at $999. The two models of the 10.1-inch Windows 8 tablet have either an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, Nvidia GT640M LE GPU, and a solid-state drive of 64GB to 256GB. With added peripherals, the modular device can be used not only in tablet mode, but also in keyboard dock or docking station mode and as a gamepad controller.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1359010408417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 01:53:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359010841611-9</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings Call: Final Thoughts</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358496098094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 03:01:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looked especially better than TXN report.

Report Forecasts 1 Billion LTE Subscribers by 2016 by lackeygarrett.Jan 24, 2013 8:06 AM.Permalink . 1/23/2013 LTE’s worldwide subscriber base is projected to far exceed 100 million this year, reaching 198.1 million by the end of 2013 – a 115% increase from 92.3 million for 2012, according to a new report from IHS iSuppli. There were 612,000 LTE subscribers as of year-end 2010, the year the cellular industry’s new 4G broadband wireless networking standard was introduced. Subscriber numbers surged “by an astounding factor of 22 to 13.2 million subscribers in 2011,” and took another leap higher, growing 599% in 2012 to reach almost 100 million. LTE subscriber numbers will exceed 1 billion by 2016, IHS iSuppli forecasts in its “IHS iSuppli Wireless Communications Special Report.” “With LTE emerging as a true global technology standard, its ecosystem now faces both challenges and opportunities,” Wayne Lam, senior analyst for wireless communications stated in a press release. “Rapid adoption will drive design innovations, particularly in smartphones, but issues like spectrum fragmentation will also remain an overhang for the LTE industry that requires attention. “Overall, however, the LTE space will be less worried about rifts or division in technology and more concerned with laying the foundation for sustained growth across the entire LTE landscape.” Cellular and wireless network operators have been building out 4G LTE infrastructure in recent years. While most activity took place in Europe and Asia early on, infrastructure investments in North America fueled subscriber growth in 2011 and 2012, according to iSuppli. Smartphone upgrades also helped propel subscriber numbers higher in the last two years, they continue, “especially as 4G LTE technology hit top-of-mind for data-savvy consumers.” LTE quickly supplanted WiMAX as the de facto global standard for 4G networking, but interoperability across carriers and spectrum holdings are “far from consistent,” they note. “While the precursor 3G technology was deployed over a handful of spectrum bands globally, LTE so far has registered more than 40 different frequency spectrums, resulting in a complex landscape fro equipment and component suppliers.” Offsetting this are the substantial advantages “to be derived from LTE,” according to iSuppli. Low-latency performance facilitates delivery of live video streaming, video conferencing, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and real-time multi-player gaming, they point out. “These market opportunities, in turn, create fresh market opportunities for component supplier and device manufacturers.” “In particular, LTE is a force multiplier for innovation among smartphones. To take advantage of a more capable network, device manufacturers are accelerating the pace of innovation for applications processors, touch-screen displays, camera technology and ever-more sophisticated mobile operating systems and software,” they conclude.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1359036575739</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 09:09:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359036637541-21</Id><Topic><Title>The Great Rotation: A Flight to Equities in 2013</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1358968616202</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:16:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>poor Waldo, dumb money buys tops.

Dubbed as the Lava Xolo X500, this smartphone will come with the Atom Lexington Z2420 chip. This is the same chipset that Intel had showcased at the recently concluded Consumer Electronics Show. We have learnt from our sources that the Lava Xolo X500 is a dual-SIM smartphone, which runs on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). It sports a 3.5-inch screen with a resolution of 480X320. The processor clocks a speed of 1.2GHz and comes with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. The device packs in 512MB RAM, 4GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 32GB via microSD card. It has a 1,500mAh battery. The Xolo X500 comes with a 5-megapixel auto focus rear camera that can click seven images in the burst mode at 6 fps (frames per second). Lava has already shipped the first lot of the assignment and it's executed to arrive in the markets shortly for a best buy price of Rs. 8,999. The Lava Xolo X900 (Pics | Review) was the first Intel-powered smartphone launched in April 2012. It comes with an Intel Z2460 single-core chip that clocks in at 1.6Ghz. It has a 4.03-inch screen with 1024x600p display and offers 1GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Lava Xolo X900 was launched with Android 2.3 on-board, but later got an update to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). This smartphone is currently available for Rs. 17,500.

However, I don't see XOLO (or any other OEM) releasing subsequent Intel-based phones if the sales on the previous device were catastrophic and/or if they did not see the future revenue potential of the platform. I think Intel would do extremely well with Lexington. PC is a mass market. And Intel is great with building and supplying to mass markets. Further, it is right in line with their strategy to build huge factories with massive capacity. Intel/Android is going to decimate iPhone/iPad and Microsoft/Nokia over a 2 to 3 year period. Even if Apple and Nokia change over to x86, their management costs and overheads are too significantly high compared to Taiwan/China OEMs. When the devices are on par with each other, Apple and Nokia will just not be able to compete on price.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359040044440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:07:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359040258325-29</Id><Title>Intel gets go-ahead for $4 billion chip plant in Ireland, will produce its next-gen 14nm processors</Title><Msg>Intel has been planning to make its Ireland base one of three global manufacturing sites for its 14nm chips since May last year, and its now been given the okay by Ireland's lead planning agency.

The device is aimed at the growing number of cost-conscious and first-time buyers in Kenya who do not want to sacrifice device performance or user experience for cost. The Yolo smartphone will be sold in Safaricom shops countrywide at the entry price of Kshs. 10,999 and comes bundled with free 500 MB data. The phone is based on Intel's latest smartphone platform for emerging markets, launched earlier this month at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES). With Intel Inside, users of the Yolo smartphone are assured of fast Web browsing, impressive multimedia capabilities and a great Android* applications experience. "We're redefining what cost-conscious Kenyans can expect from a smartphone," said Peter Arina, general manager, Safaricom' s Consumer Business Unit. "The Intel-based Yolo smartphone strikes a unique balance between price and performance – we consider it to be a real breakthrough. It's great news that Kenya will be the launch country in Africa for smartphones with Intel Inside and we expect a great reception from our customers."</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1359046567260</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 11:56:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359046626118-60</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks Paul O. for standing up for shareholders</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1359046032499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 11:47:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The clueless ceo has outlived his welcome..Like, "Get the F outta here Paulie" You won;t be missed .</Msg><Username>pentomic</Username><Timestamp>1359046626118</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 11:57:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359046680398-61</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>lambayequemiriam</Username><Timestamp>1358784584665</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:09:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just signed up.

It’s healthy… and it works best when you find someone who will listen to you, nod and let you say what you need to say, without interupting you or giving you advice… just listen… empathise… support you to get it out… Once it’s off my chest, I get on with it… When that’s not the end of it though and I start looking for someone else to share my complaint with who hopefully shares the same complaint as me, then we have another problem… I begin to surround myself with people who happily chime in…. misery begets misery and recrerational complaining is born… A recreational complaint generates no solutions; only more problems A recreational complainer makes no commitments, he only blames “things” and “others”… A group of recreational complainers finds justifications for its complaints, but makes no commitment to do or change anything… Recreational complaining doesn’t help relationships or organisations much… it just slowly eats away at them… Empowered complaining is very different… The empowered complaint may come from a situation or problem I’m not happy with… but the empowered complainer wants to do something productive about it. The empowered complaint highlights an opportunity to do soemthing differently… do it better… solve the problem…. take a risk…. A group of empowered complainers generate solutions, opportunities, innovation, creativity… new ways of looking at the things they’re not happy with and ways they can make their relationships and organisations better… So… to get the most out of complaining; Allow space for, and manage, therapeutic complaining; Challenge and limit recreational complaining and; Champion, encourage and support a passionate and energised group of empowered complainers wherever and whenever possible…</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1359047456761</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 12:10:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359047780505-67</Id><Topic><Title>if I buy INTC stock by end of January, will I get the upcoming dividend of 22.5 cents</Title><Username>mcksym</Username><Timestamp>1359042467353</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:47:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must buy on or own the stock before February 4th, 2013 to collect the dividend.

Everyone knows die shrinks make chips faster, more efficient and capable of supporting new features, but they often forget that die shrinks reduce the marginal cost of each chip giving Intel pricing and gross margin advantage.

They give themselves stock options that cost them nothing and as soon as possible they dump them on their unsuspecting share holders. These options were to give insiders a piece of the action and align their interests with the real owners of the company, shareholders. They only care about themselves and not what's good for the total company or America. The American representatives in power are the same as their corporate insider friends in that they only care about themselves and not what's good for America.

The only part of Nvidia's dedicated graphics market that will remain will be the very high end. Even at the high-end it would make more sense to spend $500 on a high performance Intel CPU with great internal graphics than $250 on the CPU and another $250 on a mid-range GPU. Nearly every application can use all the cores and resources of an Intel CPU but very few apps use Nvidia's Cuda cores efficiently. Also, Gigabyte Technologies makes motherboards with built-in Thunderbolt to deliver the video directly from Intel's CPU to multiple high res displays. This is a simpler, cheaper and more efficient way to deliver video.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1359060495445</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:48:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359060571039-137</Id><Title>Intel getting crushed on very high volume</Title><Msg>Big boys are selling.

AAPL and NOK just confirmed it. The smartphone/tablet craze is nearing a end. Everyone that really wanted one now has one. As now the case with PC's, there is increasingly less motivation to upgrade your phone when the unit you have works well enough. The market nearing saturation. New products will not achieve the historical growth rates of early units. The iFad is tracking the history of the PC and will rapidly turn into a slow growth commodity market. It will happen much more quickly than it did in the case of PC's though, since the reference starting point of unit performance began much higher on the performance curve. INTC faces a slow growth PC/notebook market. It will also face a slow growth smartphone/tablet market much sooner rather than later. The only saving grace for INTC is the server market, as the installed base of users will use their units to consume increasing amounts of data over the internet. Even there, where INTC has a decent monopoly, server commoditization will reduce profit margins. INTC faces a big conundrum... focus on servers to grow their monopoly there and keep margins up, or spread the risks by trying to grow market share in the slow-to-no growth PC and now phone/tablet spaces, where margins will only decrease. This is why I hesitate to open a long position on this company, even at what many would call 'fire-sale' prices.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1359061441053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 16:04:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359061481073-144</Id><Topic><Title>INTC was going up before I posted my message</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1359059100267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:25:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raystock is anything but smart and tries to compensate by lying.

As per the deal Intel would acquire certain assets of Motorola Mobility such as non-Indian intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications. The chip maker would also buy tangible assets of the company located in the US besides getting the rights to hire some American employees of Motorola Mobility, among others. “... the market for cellular base-band processors is competitive on account of presence of major players including Qualcomm, MediaTek, Texas Instruments and Broadcom,” the CCI said in its order dated January 22. Motorola Mobility subsidiaries in India are Motorola Mobility India and Motorola Mobility Chennai. The regulator said the assets of Motorola Mobility which are being acquired by Intel do not presently generate any revenue in India. As per the order, Intel is a recent entrant into the production of components for wireless hand held devices including cellular base-band processors. The company has various subsidiaries in India including Intel Technology India, Intel Mobile Communications India and McAfee Software. Intel and Motorola Mobility had reached ‘Asset Purchase Agreement’ in December, 2012, following which they approached CCI for approval.</Msg><Username>cksrcn</Username><Timestamp>1359077899555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:38:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359078177737-171</Id><Topic><Title>Intel getting crushed on very high volume</Title><Username>backbay_bstn</Username><Timestamp>1359060571039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:49:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea im selling my 6000 shrs NOT.

Competitors like AMD has to follow with limited room of creativity. Therefore, even occassionaly, AMD came up with better CPU, INTC could easily overun it. Now, ARM is new hardware standard writer(replacing TXN/QCOM) in smartphone/tablet market. Making it even more sweet for consumers: 1. ARM only provides core design 2. NVDA, QCOM, AAPL, TXN, Samsung (pleaset tell me tick), ... design chips based on the core design thus there are limited differenciation thus chip price war among QCOM, NVDA, ..(AAPL?Samsung for internal consumption) What to do with INTC --- A LOT because tablets replacing desktop/notebook.

But this will change when Intel has empowered an ecosystem of companies like Lenovo, Acer and others to enter the market with world-class smartphones and tablets offering faster and more feature rich devices using Intel silicon. Further, devices with x86 have the option of using 64 bit W8, Android, Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux. One day Apple is going to want to run MAC OS on a mobile device and x86 will be the easiest way to achieve that. In fact, giving consumers the ability to run MAC OS on a mobile device would be one of the most effective things Apple could do to compete against the Samsung which is even better at making smartphones than Apple. Samsung has no legacy OS and tons of apps to offer customers like Microsoft with Windows 8 and Apple with MAC OS and all of it runs native on x86. Intel is going to take a huge piece of the mobile market.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1359081376867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:36:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359082832576-177</Id><Topic><Title>This is exactly why INTC is the perfect investment</Title><Username>galba_imperator</Username><Timestamp>1358983997151</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 18:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I see a line of crucifixtions along the Appian Way, all shorts.

Intel does not have a fabrication advantage in low power. It's trying to build up one by accelerating deployment of 14nm by exploiting its first mover advantage on finfets. All the 3 major foundries are very well funded and correspondingly trying to match Intel's acceleration with their own accelerated schedules. It's not going to be a cakewalk for Intel on fabrication and even having a one node fabrication advantage at low power does not guarantee success. For example, assuming Intel is able to bring 14nm to low power one year after its 22nm low power deployment (end of 2103) in the end of 2014, by that time, foundries will have 20 nm in volume and big.LITTLE configurations will be both power and performance competitive with Intel's 14nm SOC offering. That's ARMs side of the story. Whether Intel will successfully bring 14nm to low power in end of 2014 and whether big.LITTLE will actually make a difference are both speculative at this point, but the changing funding trends for the foundries don't look good for Intel.</Msg><Username>khitchdee</Username><Timestamp>1359086200420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 22:56:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359086611105-180</Id><Topic><Title>Write Standard</Title><Username>darturtle</Username><Timestamp>1359080648482</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:24:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>darturtle, you must really be khitchykook.

It is hard to estimate the margins. Each process shrink doubles the die per wafers and geometrically reduces the defects per die. Costs will go down. Power consumption drops to the resulting systems are cheaper to build. One big, new feature on Haswell servers will be the transactional memory (TSX). This feature alone should provide performance improvement on the order of double that of Romley. Think of speculative execution of locks. When software sets a lock, Haswell monitors the data it is going to access and does not disrupt the bus access unless there is a REAL conflict. Lock conflict is a real scalability bottleneck. I don't know of any similar ARM capability. tablets and phones - Intel will chew down. Lexington has a $6 cost.

Figures from IHS show that from 2012 to 2016, the market will double with shipments moving from 206 million in 2012 to 559 million in 2016. In fact, according to IHS, shipments of low-end smartphones will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51 percent from 2011 to 2016. That's faster than high-end smartphone shipments, which will grow at a CAGR of only 12 percent during the same period. The strong demand for low-end smartphones is mainly from China and other Asia-Pacific countries, as well as Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. To get its chips into low-end smartphones, Intel introduced, at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an Atom processor platform designed to target this market in emerging economies. Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst for wireless communications at IHS, called this a "shrewd strategy" that just might help Intel increase its chip business in this market segment. In the meantime, Intel declares that it continues to make progress with its acquisition of Infineon Technologies AG Wireless Solutions business and is preparing to launch its first Long-Term Evolution (LTE) solution to support 4G wireless technology -- another important milestone for Intel as it seeks to make inroads into the US smartphone market. The consensus is that the benefit to be derived from an LTE solution is substantial. According to IHS, three years after its original deployment, projections are that there will be 100 million subscribers to LTE this year.</Msg><Username>intel_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1359089436355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 23:50:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
