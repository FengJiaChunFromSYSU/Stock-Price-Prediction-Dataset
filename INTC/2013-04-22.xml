I thought it'd be worth a peak at the technical charts of each of these stocks. Apple is a stock that's been featured for several weeks, but I haven't looked at Intel or Corning from a technical point of view. Of those 3, Intel looks the most promising. It has just broken out of a complex inverse head and shoulders pattern, and has recently officially broken out of a longer term down trend. Prices are reaching overbought levels right now so it may consolidate here shortly before it can make the next move upward as long as the market doesn't sour...but $22 looks to offer good support now that it has broken above it giving a reasonable safety net. I've put up the charts and discussion on Stockineer, but I just wanted to give you guys the summary here. Good luck!</Msg><Username>stockineer</Username><Timestamp>1366628687253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 07:04:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366629711003-8</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL TECHNICALS...CHEAP STOCK?</Title><Username>stockineer</Username><Timestamp>1366628687253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 07:04:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. The Apple stock was thought out to be a cheap stock at $700, 600, 500 and now there are no buyers at 400. The investors don't think it represents a good value at $400, never mind what the technicals say. 2. INTC is primarily a hardware company, much like AAPL, where the PLC spans over two to three years. At maturity and decline phase, it gets much tougher to squeeze some profits. 3. Surely, it wouldn't be fair to compare Intel with IBM where the later sells for a multiple of 11. But nevertheless to argue that INTC would sell at a higher multiple than IBM would be naïve unless you worship at Cramer's temple. If IBM sells for a multiple of 11, Intel should sell for multiples of 8 or 9 maximum. 4. As to the dividend yield, that certainly provides some cushion if you believe the deflation era will go on indefinitely. And last, 5. Management uncertainty presents yet another negative. Stacy, IMO, will not be able to move the company to the promised land.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1366629711003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 07:21:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366630187165-9</Id><Topic><Title>INTEL TECHNICALS...CHEAP STOCK?</Title><Username>stockineer</Username><Timestamp>1366628687253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 07:04:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. That was exactly the point I make about Apple on the site, as well as the others...It was thought to be cheap at all those levels you mention, so why aren't people buying? The charts still don't say to buy Apple as it has run along its down trendline but continues in that same direction. With the exception of one whipsaw on the excitement of a potential dividend anouncement, it continues to get rejected from that trendline.

However, there is a huge wild card - Two-fers. I think most people who see some value in a laptop, would not hesitate to go in for the two-fers - detachables and convertibles. Wintel will have them, how about Apple? I think the writing is on the wall. If Apple CAN ENABLE similar two-fers (which require laptop-level performance) with ITS OWN SoCs, then a deal between Intel and Apple will NOT happen. However, if Apple SoCs cannot come out with SoCs which can bridge both Tablet-level power and laptop-level performance, Apple will be forced to use Intel and come out with a line of two-fers - which will start cannibalizing some amount of iPad and Mac sales.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1366636916733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 09:21:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366639404876-15</Id><Title>Great start...what happend?</Title><Msg>Hope it bounces back!</Msg><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1366639404876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 10:03:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366639826523-16</Id><Topic><Title>Great start...what happend?</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1366639404876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 10:03:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U.S. home resales edged downward in March, a pause in the housing market recovery that has helped boost the economy.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1366639826523</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 10:10:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366640466380-17</Id><Topic><Title>Great start...what happend?</Title><Username>billy_ray_valentine</Username><Timestamp>1366639404876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 10:03:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is fighting against the oversold status as well.

On the fundamental side, new home sales fell 4.6% in February, the biggest decline in two years. Durable goods orders ex-aircraft orders fell 2.7% in February. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index unexpectedly plunged from 68.0 in February to 59.7 in March. The Thomson Reuters /University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index plunged to a nine-month low in April. The ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly dropped from 54.2 in February to 51.3 in March, its third straight monthly decline. The ISM Non-Mfg Index, covering the services sector, also declined in March. Retail Sales fell 0.4% in March, the biggest decline in 9 months. Also, only 88,000 new jobs were created in March, much worse than the forecast for 200,000 jobs. Last week we learned that the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.1% in March versus the consensus forecast for an increase of 0.2%. And while overall housing starts were up in March, single-family home starts fell 5.0%, and permits for futures starts fell 3.9%.

Declining commodity prices usually indicate demand for goods is dropping and the economy is in trouble. For instance, the CRB Index of Commodity Prices fell 15% in the summer of 2010 and the S&amp;P 500 fell 15% in that summer’s correction.

The Windows 8 fiasco is a good example It was generation one software that was thrust upon the corporate market. Had Microsoft had any real competition they would have lost market share. It's a touch interface that really has no place in a corporate environment. Around the time of the Pentium 4 Intel was a company that was a bit more lost and lacking real direction. Having being beaten into the x64 world by AMD and the smartphone/affordable tablet world by ARM is what has redefined Intel. Today AMD is practically a footnote in the Intel annual report and ARM is feeling the pressure of Intel grow stronger every day as Intel's new fabs get finished. I know it's customary to draw a comparison between Intel and Microsoft. The amount of product failures from Microsoft is mind boggling. Intel's new product track record is much better. Intel seems to be a company that can cope with changes and redefine itself as the world changes. Microsoft seems to be a company that has enough business in core market to hide it's failures. It's ongoing identity crises never seems to end.</Msg><Username>intel_fanboy</Username><Timestamp>1366656781453</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366657153398-50</Id><Topic><Title>WE ARE APPROACHING 23, ZOMBIE WALLSTREET CASINO CLOWNS</Title><Username>singhlion2011</Username><Timestamp>1366656058126</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:40:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Singed Lion Stop whining!

Intel Media, the chip giant’s ambitious attempt to reinvent pay TV, has lost a key executive just months before going to market. Jim Baldwin, who was working as VP of Engineering for Intel Media, has left the company. Jim Baldwin was Intel Media’s VP of Engineering until his departure in April. An Intel Media spokesperson confirmed this when contacted by GigaOM, saying that “Baldwin left Intel Media to pursue opportunities outside the company.” Baldwin’s Linkedin profile put the change a bit more bluntly, listing “retired” as his current job. Intel Media’s spokesperson didn’t have any further comment on the circumstances of his departure, and Baldwin didn’t respond to a request for comment.</Msg><Username>ghostupinhere</Username><Timestamp>1366668704320</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 18:11:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366670049070-70</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft above 30$ --- Intel</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1366651972293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 13:32:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know it's customary to draw a comparison between Intel and Microsoft. The amount of product failures from Microsoft is mind boggling. Intel's new product track record is much better. Intel seems to be a company that can cope with changes and redefine itself as the world changes. Microsoft seems to be a company that has enough business in core market to hide it's failures. It's ongoing identity crises never seems to end." ---------------------------------------------------------------- I agree with most of your comments. I sometimes wish that Intel will try to diversify more aggressively and in a quicker manner. As for failing, yes Microsoft did do miserably on many products (zune comes to mind), failing is part of the game, you learn from it and do better the next time. As of now the market opened a huge gap between Microsoft and Intel pps since it sees Microsoft moving to green pastures; that being said I believe Intel will catch up and we should test 25$ rather soon, and with right timing and PR we should break thru it as well.

Substantially all of the production is coming from TSMC, which is a significant bottleneck. 20nm: Volume production in 2014/2015. TSMC has promised to ramp 20nm faster than 28nm but this appears to be nothing more than rhetoric as 20nm will be yet another level of complexity when trends have show each successive ARM die shrink to ramp significantly slower than the previous. 14/16nm: ARM foundries will pursue a half-step to FinFET by making it half FinFET and half 20nm. This clearly illustrates their lack of confidence in bringing a full step online in a reasonable time frame. There are so many unknowns with the half-step process, that any prediction of volume production cannot be reliably made. Conclusions 1.) Intel will continue to have significant opportunities for high margin foundry work, as illustrated by the Altera deal. 2.) Intel's fabrication economics will continue to improve just as ARM's are degrading. ARMs 20nm planar and the half-step to FinFET both have inferior economics to the Intel nodes. 3.) Intel will reach 450mm wafer implementation well ahead of ARM, giving them significantly improved economic benefits. Intel's lead in fabrication and manufacturing is increasing in virtually every area.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1366683351068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 22:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366683734949-77</Id><Title>Next Up: Apple</Title><Msg>Wow, I can't wait to see what Apple has for us tomorrow.
