"Then it came down to ARM versus X86 architecture. I am told there was a technical “bake-off”, where prototype silicon was tested against each other across a myriad of application-based and synthetic benchmarks. At the end of the bake-off, ARM was deemed as not having the right kind of horsepower and that its 64-bit architecture wasn’t ready soon enough. 64-bit was important as it maximized memory addressability, and the next gen console needed to run multiple apps, operating systems and hypervisors. ARM-based architectures will soon get as powerful as AMD’s Jaguar cores, but not when Sony or Microsoft needed them for their new consoles. Then there is the matter of implementation. Both Sony and Microsoft wanted a custom X86-based SOC, or system on a chip. SOCs are silicon similar in design that is in a smartphone, where every single piece of functionality is driven off of a single piece of silicon like the apps processor, graphics, video, image processing, audio, security, memory controller and I/O. The only thing separate inside the consoles are storage and some power management. The desire for an SOC makes sense for so many reasons. First is low power, as generally, SOCs are lower power than multiple pieces of silicon. Also, one piece of silicon generally takes less space and generates less heat than two or three chips. The requirement for an X86-based SOC ostensibly removed Nvidia NVDA +0.71% from the running." source: forbes</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372254061438</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372254371615-7</Id><Topic><Title>"The Real Reasons Microsoft, Sony Chose AMD For The XBOX One And PS4"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372254061438</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:41:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conclusion: "Every one of these factors above contributed to AMD getting the nod. AMD won this business because they have the advanced IP, know-how, experience and commitment to make this happen. They have leading edge IP in CPU, GPU, memory, video, audio, and I/O. They also designed the first quad core, X86 SOC, and it’s not a giant leap to take this to eight cores. Finally, AMD built an entire product division to support the effort that others weren’t prepared to commit. It was a clear-cut win.

The Galaxy Tab 3 family comes in three sizes: 7-inch, 8-inch, and 10.1-inch. The Tab's come in two color options — white and gold-brown. They will retail for $199, $299, and $399, respectively. All three devices run Android and are powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 processor, which makes them really fast. The tablets are Wi-Fi only. The 7-inch model comes with 8 GB of storage and the 8-inch and 10.1-inch models will start with 16 GB. All three models have a MicroSD card reader so you can add more storage. The Tab 3's will be available on July 7, but pre-orders start tomorrow. Samsung is offering so much variety because it was to be able to reach more customers. To help with this it is also making the tablets available at a wider variety of retailers like Best Buy, Office Depot, Wal-Mart, Newegg, and Sears. _______ PS: I knew Sammie will be back as a NV customer in a big way.

Dubbed Windows RT 8.1, this is no mere update. Windows RT 8.1 streamlines many aspects of the RT experience and adds new features such as built-in Outlook, the ability to search across different apps, and improvements for enterprise users such as NFC printing, better VPN support, support for Microsoft’s Workplace Join, and greater support for services offered by mobile device management vendors. The update paves the way for new Windows RT devices running on NVIDIA’s Tegra 4 mobile processors. Microsoft’s VP of Planning, Mike Angiulo, recently commented on the implications, stating “NVIDIA’s Tegra 4 processors will put Windows on more powerful, more portable devices than ever before.” Devices powered by Tegra 4 are going to scream through web browsing, briskly handle multiple apps and instantly switch into high fidelity gaming. All while delivering the portability and battery life ARM-based processors are known for, and on the industry’s most secure Windows platform. Rene Haas, our VP of Computing, echoed this excitement recently, saying, “The upcoming release of Outlook for RT will enhance the capabilities of RT devices, fulfilling the Windows RT promise of work and play, on one device.” We can’t wait to show the world the new Windows RT 8.1 experience, especially on Tegra 4 – the fastest mobile processor NVIDIA has ever delivered. You can download the Windows RT 8.1 Preview through the Windows Store now. Microsoft has stated the final product will be available later this year.

Unlike AMD, Nvidia has the margins and cash to easily afford a price war. But they must calculate that there is little to be gained. AMD might be a direct competitor, but in the long run the PC industry needs a competitor to keep Intel from getting too far out of line. AMD is already so cash-strapped that they are barely viable in that role. Even so, I expect AMD to follow VIA into a low performance, low cost embedded PC chipset niche.

Isn't Nvidia doing something to prevent losing sales? Nvidia got to reduce price to match the attack and sacrifice some margin. Nvidia's ARM chip business is losing money and it won't get much gaming revenue either. GPU is the bread and butter and Nvidia can't afford to lose the game market to AMD.</Msg><Username>typecheck</Username><Timestamp>1372299613299</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:20:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372300077916-70</Id><Title>Shipments of Shield delayed, but preliminary reviews/impressions are out....</Title><Msg>From Hot Hardware: Bad news and good news - bad news, product shipment delayed.....and "The good news is we’ve had our hands on a SHIELD device for a little while now and have been impressed so far. Thanks to its TEGRA 4 SoC and unmolested version of Android, the SHIELD offers a very fluid, smooth Android experience. And the build quality and feel of SHIELD is top notch. It’s unfortunate NVIDIA ran into an issue this close to launch, but even so, it’s obvious the company isn’t skimping with SHIELD. It’s very solid and feels good in the hand, though it is a bit heavy."" About some Shield optimized games: ""Real Boxing" - As a hardcore boxing fan (one of the last I presume), I was excited to play Real Boxing. Well, the game looks as good on the SHIELD in the real-world as it does in all of the demos we’ve seen up to this point. Animation is smooth and the graphics looks great. There is a bit of a learning curve to get the hang of the controls, which rely mostly on the two analog sticks and left and right shoulder buttons, but once you do, defending and throwing combinations works very well.... "AR Drone" - As for the AR Drone—holy #$%$ that thing is fun to play with. I’m not a great pilot just yet, and I’d still like to tweak the flight parameters before drawing any final conclusions, but this thing is definitely a riot. And I’m not just talking about the flying that’s fun, it’s getting a different perspective on things in the vicinity. The AR Drone streams video from its on-board HD camera to the SHIELD as you fly. Just launching the thing high into the air and peering into trees or over the houses in the neighborhood is really cool. Not to mention the possibilities if you’ve got some hot neighbors you’d like to “check in” on. Just kidding, of course! Maybe. :) That’s all we’ve got for now. It’ll be a few more weeks at least, but as soon as we’ve got a final SHIELD in hand, expect a more detailed, full review complete with video, more impressions, and benchmark</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372300077916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:27:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372301066697-71</Id><Title>Droid - Life: Unboxing and preliminary impressions of Shield</Title><Msg>SOURCE: Droid - Life "After months of waiting patiently, although sometimes we weren’t as patient, NVIDIA has provided us with a review unit of SHIELD for our testing/gaming pleasure. With this post, we will provide you a quasi-unboxing video and a device hardware gallery. Ready for a SHIELD overload? Good. The device is built well and the software pairs with the looks very nicely. It’s dark, almost giving off sort of a mysterious vibe. The few times I took it out in public, people seemed very interested in the device and had a natural feeling of wanting to play with it. Luckily, NVIDIA spared no expense making sure SHIELD came with some great games onboard, so showing off the gaming power of this device is pretty easy. Powered by NVIDIA’s Tegra 4 processor and 2GB of RAM, the device can handle any gaming task you might throw at it. It powers through titles like Grand Theft Auto and Real Boxing, still providing enough power to go around for your favorite apps and entertainment. Built into SHIELD is a 5″ 720p display, an HDMI-out port capable of providing 4K video out, a microSD slot for additional storage, plus that specially designed controller, complete with joysticks, bumpers and triggers. It’s the ultimate Android-powered gaming system _____ Not a single negative word, even with a quasi-final version of the product.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372301066697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:44:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
