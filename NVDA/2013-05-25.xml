And no sooner than the announcement was made, the "this is too expensive!" comments started showing up. I want to explain why I think that line of thinking is not only unfair, but also illogical. The issue with SHIELD, in my opinion, isn't actually with SHIELD itself but rather the way people are perceiving it. Sure, it's a portable gaming console; but first and foremost, it's an Android device. A stock Android device. It has access to the Play Store, Google services, and everything else that makes Android great. And it's packed full of the latest tech on the scene – basically, if this were a tablet or phone, the $350 price tag would make this device a no-brainer and everyone would be going nuts to get their hands on it. And that's exactly how I see it: it's essentially a next-gen tablet. In a few months, all sorts of Tegra 4-powered tablets will be hitting the scene with a variety of different features, at a myriad of different price points – none of which I expect to be at the $350 mark. $400? Maybe, but that's a bit of stretch. $450? Likely. $500 or more? Count on it. Do you think ASUS will let the next Transformer go for anything less than the TF700's launch price of $499 (excluding the dock)? Not a chance. Or what about newcomers to the game, like HP – we've already seen the company's first Tegra 4 tablet, and it's priced at a cool $480 – a full $130 higher than SHIELD. Sure, it ships with an included keyboard dock, but that's not far-off from SHIELDs built-in game controller. Comparing the two based just on utility is apples and oranges, so for all intents and purposes, they're both just accessories that amplify the device's capabilities. And what we're basically talking about it is what you get for your money – dollar for dollar.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369455469127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:17:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369455811768-2</Id><Title>With the same valuation as AMZN, this stock should be at 3 digits...</Title><Msg>more than $100..</Msg><Username>ankara1967</Username><Timestamp>1369455811768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369456035007-3</Id><Topic><Title>Shield as a deal: Why I think NVIDIA's handheld console is actually a great value</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369455469127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: Of course, let's not forget about Shield's standout feature: PC Streaming. This is a killer option for hardcore PC gamers – with a GTX 650 or higher NVIDIA graphics card, any Steam title with controller support will be able to stream from PC to SHIELD over Wi-Fi for away-from-keyboard gaming. This feature is absolutely the first of its kind. There are a few comparisons to other products being made as well, like I'll just get MOGA Pro for my phone – BOOM, I have a SHIELD. Wrong again. As someone who has both the MOGA Pocket and the MOGA Pro, I can attest to one thing: this solution is an afterthought. Sure, it works well, but it's not as if the phone you own was built from the ground up with a game controller in mind. Firstly, with a MOGA, you're sacrificing precious battery life on your mobile phone, which is a killer in itself. Secondly, you're playing over a Bluetooth connection, which can have latency issues that lead to extreme amounts of frustration and fury. With SHIELD, you can just take it out of your bag and start playing – no need to pair anything. And again, you simply can't stream PC games to your phone. NVIDIA spent countless hours over the last several months (or possibly even longer) designing and building SHIELD – do you really, honestly think that just attaching a game controller to your phone or tablet is the same thing? If so, you're lying to yourself. There's still another point to be made here: speakers. When it comes to playing games, a good audio experience is the icing on the cake. NVIDIA incorporated some killer speaker tech into SHIELD – something that is so far unmatched on phones and tablets – to provide the best possible experience when gaming.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369456035007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:27:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369456253409-4</Id><Topic><Title>Shield as a deal: Why I think NVIDIA's handheld console is actually a great value</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369455469127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:17:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 3: These guys know gaming, what makes it good, and essential elements to make it the best experience possible. For the longest time, I've been pairing my Nexus 7 with a MOGA and Jambox (or similar speaker) when I sit down to play some games. Is it overkill? Maybe, but it makes for a far better experience than using the #$%$ little speaker on the N7 along with touch controls. It would be nice to have the option to just flip open a screen and start playing without having to deal with pairing both a controller and speaker. And that's all without mentioning the cost of these things combined: Nexus 7 – $250; Jambox – $150; MOGA Pro – $50. Total: $450. That's $100 more than SHIELD, which has a fresh-off-the-presses processor and 2GB of RAM. Less money for more tech – how is that overpriced? Ultimately, the point is simple, guys and gals: it doesn't matter if you want SHIELD, or if you will personally pay $350 for it – calling it overpriced based on your own desires and/or financial situation is unfair and unreasonable. I realize that the allure isn't there for everyone (and I'm sure NVIDIA does, too), and that's OK. I'm not asking that you immediately go buy SHIELD – that's entirely up to you. What I am suggesting, though, is that you actually take into consideration what you're getting for $350; it's a next-gen tablet. A mobile game console. An entirely new genre of product. This is innovation, guys. Let's just appreciate it for what it is. androidpoliceDOTcom/2013/05/24/editorial-shield-as-a-deal-why-i-think-nvidias-handheld-console-is-actually-a-pretty-great-value/ THIS ARTICLE CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT!</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369456253409</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369456547292-5</Id><Topic><Title>Out-of-the-Box Idea for the Day: AMD Should Buy NVDA</Title><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1369339125464</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:58:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel does not need to be 1-2 process gens ahead of any ARM vendor to maintain parity on performance/watt.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369456547292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 00:35:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369458251291-6</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Xbox One 'a let down,' says Steven Butts of IGN</Title><Username>torchie4269</Username><Timestamp>1369407529033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 10:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's a midrange PC with a bunch of slow AMD low power cores and mid-range GPU.

People should wait till after E3 before complaining. I don't think sales will be falling off a cliff other than the normal seasonal drop. In the Wii-U's case marketing for the system was horrible. Mostly just gamers even really knew that a new system came out. Most other people either think its an expansion to the wii or don't know it exists. On top of that there is still a ton of people who are holding off because they are interested in the Xbox or playstation. And on even top of that lots of people don't want to buy a game system until their are several game they are interested in are available to play. Wii U has started without a strong line up. Even the good games were mostly rehashes of games that already came out for other systems that gamers interested in the Wii-U probably already had. So i don't think poor Wii-U foreshadows anything.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1369502340993</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 13:19:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369506446679-15</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Xbox One 'a let down,' says Steven Butts of IGN</Title><Username>torchie4269</Username><Timestamp>1369407529033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 10:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree 100%, I've stated the same point on this board many times.

More processing power in general leads to better graphics, AI and overall presentation. Even just better AI would improve current games. There will be more new worlds to explore. There is plenty of new IP coming. Any one could be a fresh spin on gaming. There was a time when Assassins Creed was a new IP that became popular. Then something like Call of duty is just a yearly refresh that sells well, like madden or many other sports games. Because it sells well, they don't make many changes. Something like Call of Duty is stale but It leaves room for someone else to surpass it. At this point, Only when Graphics and AI differences become unnoticeable between various platforms will there be a noticeable end to consoles. That time is not within the next 5 years.

Less than 3 weeks now. Too early to say that there is a complete lack of games. Not all the cards have been revealed yet. E3 will reveal most if not all of them. Traditionally there is a lack of solid games at launch so you may be right on that. However a hardware upgrade is still relevant. There is too much difference between last gen and this gen for it not to. Not sure if there will be a generation that's worth upgrading to after this one but console gamers have a lot to look forward to this generation. Keep in mind the Xbox 360 was designed long enough ago for 720P. It's a a bit dated at this point. And now you have the Xbox One looking at 4k resolutions. That alone is a big difference for console gamers. It also looks better and more importantly should have better AI. I've played too many games with dumb AI.
