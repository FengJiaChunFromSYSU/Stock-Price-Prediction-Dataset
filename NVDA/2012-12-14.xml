The company has demonstrated a repeated ability to create and/or enter new markets, even when the odds are stacked very highly against them. The firm emerged as the leader of the brutal graphics competition back in the late 90’s and early 2000’s, pioneered and heavily evangelized the use of GPUs as floating point co-processing monsters, and has been aggressively pushing in the mobile system-on-chip space with its "Tegra" lineup. While the mobile phone chip space is dominated by Qualcomm, Nvidia’s position as one of the premier Android tablet chip vendors is clear to the industry. However, the semiconductor world is changing, and Nvidia now faces deeper competitive pressures than it has in the past. "Tegra" faces serious competition from the legions of ARM licensees as well as Intel, which itself is "sleeping giant" that will soon leverage its significant technological prowess and resources to attempt to establish leadership in this area. Nvidia's bread-and-butter: high performing, power-efficient GPUs for gaming and workstation use are probably safe and will keep financials healthy (albeit not a "hyper growth" segment), but the firm’s latest growth vector – the "Tesla" high performance compute processors – will now face very credible competition from Intel’s "Xeon Phi", which chip-giant can sell along with its traditional server CPUs. As Intel aggressively pushes here, Nvidia will lose market share (although the TAM expansion is likely to offset share losses). The question on everybody’s mind, then, is whether Nvidia is a ripe acquisition target at these levels. There is certainly a case to be made for both sides of the argument, and that is what I will explore here. Pros – Valuation, Product Leadership, Patents The most obvious reason that Nvidia could be an attractive takeover target is that the firm is downright cheap. At a $7.82B market capitalization and $3.43B in net cash, a potential acquirer – even at a 30% premium to these levels at roughly $10B – would really only need to shell out $7B or so to acquire the company and its IP. The acquirer would get a top-notch GPU hardware and software development teams, over 4,500 graphics patents, $4.13B in trailing-twelve-month revenue (and growing), $419M of trailing-twelve-month free-cash-flow, an immediate leadership position in the workstation graphics market, and a solid footing in the mobile system-on-chip and baseband market. Ex-cash, the company trades at less than 1x price-to-sales and 8.66x earnings. At these levels, the firm represents a bargain to any potential acquirer. For Nvidia, the benefit would potentially be the freedom to more aggressively push in all of its key areas and to leverage its expertise and patents into adjacent sectors of the market without worrying about pleasing the public markets. Although it seems clear that cash is not a concern and it is fortunate enough to be able to write the checks that it needs for R&amp;D as well as supply agreements with the foundries. In fact, with the announcement of the first-ever quarterly cash dividend, it is clear that Nvidia is very well capitalized and now can afford to hand back ~36% of its profits to stakeholders. Cons – Shareholder Value, Management Style, and Other While the financial picture is generally rosy for Nvidia as an acquisition target from the perspective of the acquirer, there are certainly factors that would make Nvidia an unattractive target. First off, Nvidia’s bread-and-butter is high performance GPUs. This is a growth area in its own right, but it is not clear that such a business would see much growth under a larger firm or if another firm is even interested. Nvidia already holds the dominant position in this space with over 60% market share. Nvidia's roadmap has shown weakness in execution - manufacturing issues are the key reason for long lead times, and both Fermi and Maxwell endured long delays Nvidia's roadmap has shown weakness in execution - manufacturing issues are the key reason for long lead times, and both Fermi and Maxwell endured long delays With Tegra, there is also the problem of commoditization of CPU and GPU cores by the likes of ARM Holdings and Imagination Technologies. While Nvidia’s system-on-chip IP is good and continues to improve with each generation, CPU cores from ARM Holdings and GPU cores from ARM and Imagination make it very simple for a semiconductor firm with its own fabrication plants, such as Samsung, to develop its own highly competent solutions. The value proposition of such an acquisition also falls off of a cliff when we consider that Nvidia’s mobile GPUs are not yet truly competitive with the best from Imagination and ARM (although the next generation should be a significant improvement if "Kepler" is utilized), which can be licensed cheaply. So it boils down to this: a larger company probably doesn’t need Nvidia since it can license off-the-shelf IP and build a competing solution (or spend the cash to roll its own like Qualcomm does), but as an independent, fairly small company, Nvidia can see significant top- and bottom-line upside by taking market share and selling its products to the device vendors while maintaining the core "cash cow" of its GPU business. Another thing that would stand in the way of a potential acquisition is Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO. Nvidia is his baby, and his ambitions for the company are quite grand. Unless offered an insanely lucrative deal, or the CEO spot of the acquiring company, I find it difficult to believe that Mr. Huang would agree to an acquisition outside of a retirement move. Finally, I do not believe current shareholders would be particularly happy to accept an offer at anything below $22/share, or nearly ~100% premium to today’s levels. Why? Everybody who bought – institutions included – at about that level in 2011 are now horrifically underwater and would probably vote against such a deal unless it represented a significant premium to even those levels. At that kind of a premium, the value proposition begins to fade. Conclusion Nvidia has great technology, great management, and is growing quite nicely. However, I do not believe that an acquisition is likely in the near future, especially as the firm’s management is likely to want to continue to achieve organic growth with its "Tegra" and "Tesla" businesses. In addition, at these levels, the company is incredibly cheap, and it is not clear whether shareholders would accept a less-than-juicy offer. However, the great thing about the industry is that it is always full of surprises...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1355504823003</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 12:07:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355505727547-19</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia as an Acquisition Target: Pros and Cons</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1355504823003</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 12:07:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good piece Getanid.

The fact appears to be that they actually met possibly for a wide range of other matters! Now go eat @#$% Crazy Rumor of the Day: Intel to buy NVIDIA, make Jen-Hsun the CEO Posted by wicked December - 14 - 2012 - Friday Intel has the most advanced chip fabrication facilities in the industry, they design some of the best CPUs for personal computers, but they suck at making GPUs, and don’t even get us started about their attempts to enter the smartphone space. NVIDIA depends on TSMC to make their Tegra chips and their GPUs, with the latter widely heralded as delivering the best gaming experience today. Obviously these two companies should merge because they complement each other so well. In fact, if you search for “Intel buying NVIDIA” on Google, you’ll see that this rumor has been coming up every year since 2006. Theo Valich from The Bright Side of News, who has been covering the technology industry for well over a decade, says he heard a rumor, with his own two ears, that Intel and NVIDIA are currently in negotiations. When and if the deal is complete, NVIDIA’s CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, will become the new head of Intel. Should you believe him? To quote Theo: “This rumor should be taken not with a grain of salt, but rather with a whole 18-wheeler truck filled with the said ingredient.” Let’s face it, the PC market has peaked, the smartphone and tablet industry is booming, and Intel isn’t exactly in a good position to compete. Yes, Google and Intel signed a deal over a year ago saying that Android would run just as well on Intel chips as it does on ARM chips, but we can only think of one Intel powered Android device that mattered in 2012: Motorola’s RAZR i. If NVIDIA does get a chance to use Intel’s vast resources, are they going to dump the ARM architecture? Doesn’t that erase pretty much all the work that they’ve done over the past few years? We’ll keep an eye on this rumor, but don’t sit on the edge of your seat just yet.]</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1355513813854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:36:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355514579032-30</Id><Topic><Title>Intel having Coffeee with Jen!! :)</Title><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1355511841758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:04:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Original and Complete Story Crazy Rumor: Intel to Acquire Nvidia, Jen-Hsun the New CEO of Intel? 12/13/2012 by: Theo Valich - Get more from this author The semiconductor business is a highly cyclical one, with average length of technology agreements lasting for not more than four quarters. Thus, as the end of every year approaches, you'll see various rumors taking shape - which are a typical result of companies discussing supply for the next product cycle. One traditional rumor is the negotiation for the Apple TV between Apple and Sharp, for example - which if true, would typically be agreed around 2-3 cycles in advance, rather than a "let's do it tomorrow" gung-ho approach which rumor sites typically insist on. Thus, when we heard a rumor that Intel and Nvidia are sitting at "a coffee table" discussing the future developments, cross licensing and the like… we dismissed it as a seasonal thing. Remember, that Intel is still paying Nvidia installments of that chipset blunder settlement of yesteryear. That sum is totaling $1.5 billion dollars, and represents nothing but a #$%$ in Intel's armor (2011 revenue: $54.0 billion, 2011 net income: $17.5 billion). Insider out, Outsider in? Paul Otellini retires, leaving a void at Intel which some BoD members feel it might be best served by an outsider with an fresh perspective Insider out, Outsider in? Paul Otellini retires, leaving a void at Intel which some BoD members feel it might be best served by an outsider with an fresh perspective During the recent travels in the U.A.E., we heard a rumor which is bound to arrive on one website or another. The people who talked to us stated that the rumored acquisition talks are an extension to the technology licensing one, and that the "book of magic", Nvidia's standard ToE - should the company end up being acquired. Both companies have an active NDA which prevents them to talk about the said deal. The in-depth NDA (which enables to dig around finances, finding skeletons in the closet, etc.) comes from the first talks both companies had about the acquisition, which would have seen Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors to be powered by GeForce graphics. Nvidia said no, as we all know now. This time around, our sources have said that Intel did not categorically say no to one of requirements, should Nvidia be acquired - and that is that the CEO of Nvidia and the senior management take over the respectable roles in the new entity, regardless of the entity size. Remember that this requirement sunk the finalization of Nvidia-AMD tie up in 2005, which in turn ended with AMD paying $5.9 billion for ATI Technologies. Bear in mind that Intel's BoD announced that for the first time in history, the company is considering an external person for the role of CEO, as the investors feel that the company hasn't done enough in the mobile segment. Naturally, investors in general don't have a clue how semiconductor companies work and make profit, since for every smartphone there is a high revenue chip that delivers the service - but the Street wants to see companies battling for pennies on the dollar. As the old credo goes - What The Street wants, The Street Gets - and Intel is now entering the pennies (SoC) versus dollar (Enterprise CPUs) market in terms of profits. The difference between Nvidia and a lot of other companies is that Jen-Hsun Huang, the founder and CEO enjoys full support of the Nvidia's Board of Directors, and previous acquisition attempts (made by Intel as well) all landed on rocky surface. Howevever, should the Nvidia receive what they want (a CEO position), then everything could be arranged. Nvidia has shown it can raise to the challenge in almost any market, even when the result is that Intel, the co-founder of GENIVI automotive electronics alliance - gets thrown out from BMW cars and replaced with Tegras (for the infotainment system, of course). The company is currently valued at just $7.82 billion, which is a small chunk of change for Intel, which had higher profits. Given the cost of IP and other liabilities, the acquisition would probably not be below $15 billion - but that's a wide ballpark figure. Just like the upcoming merger between American Airlines and US Airways, where US Airways will "eat up" American and end up being named American (don't ask for logic, stronger brand name survives) - but having US Airways management for the company's leadership. Similar things happened with Continental and United merger, where the CEO of a smaller company ended up running a bigger entity. If we really end up with Jen-Hsun Huang at the head of Intel Corporation, even if for a limited time, that would be a shift in several orders of magnitude. Nvidia with Intel's resources? This rumor should be taken not with a grain of salt, but rather with a whole 18-wheeler truck filled with the said ingredient. And if you think that this is absolute crazy, remember - it was Intel that came to Nvidia to ask for GeForce GPU to be integrated with the Intel x86 CPU for products which you know today as Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell and all. Regardless of what Intel soldiers tell you, most of improvements of the said CPUs were in the GPUs. Personally, as an industry insider with 13 years of experience - I've seen stranger things happen, but I would say this rumor would even make sense. As a disclaimer, I do not own stocks in any of the companies we report about.</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1355514579032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:49:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355517463801-31</Id><Title>You Okay, Best?</Title><Msg>Saw your last post... rambling about lack of dividend and the prospect of Taiwan getting bombed.
