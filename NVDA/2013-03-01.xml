Apparently, by his own account, JH went to a "reform school" for troubled boys somewhere in the South. He was sent there not because anything he did or didn't do, but rather due to the fact that his 1st generation immigrant uncle didn't know anything better - he heard that the school offered good disciplines and was free. It wasn't Philips Academy or Andover prep schools, but JH likely derived some life-long benefits from this experience. He is tough, bold, and a true survivor. The Stanford education only reinforce these qualities.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362116076525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:34:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362117236468-4</Id><Title>Tegra 4 Juggernaut Slaughters Snapdragons</Title><Msg>Nvidia Tegra 4 Benchmarked, Crushes Competition - PC Magazine pcmagDOTcom/article2/0,2817,2415809,00.asp NVIDIA's Tegra 4 zings through the benchmarks, stomps on the Snapdragon 600 -- RootzWiki rootzwikiDOTcom/news/_/articles/announcements/nvidias-tegra-4-zings-through-the-benchmarks-stomps-on-the-snapdragon-600-r1421 NVIDIA's Tegra 4 SoC enters the benchmark ring, KOs every other competitor in one shot -- TweakTown tweaktownDOTcom/news/28731/nvidia-s-tegra-4-soc-enters-the-benchmark-ring-kos-every-other-competitor-in-one-shot/index.html#VVQyHQRkkrVUQkqG.99 NVIDIA Tegra 4 benchmarked, breaks all sorts of speed records -- Engadget engadgetDOTcom/2013/02/24/nvidia-tegra-4-benchmarked/ Tegra 4 benchmark numbers blow away competition -- Android and Me androidandmeDOTcom/2013/02/news/tegra-4-benchmark-numbers-blow-away-competition/ NVIDIA Tegra 4 Benchmarks Lay Waste to Competition -- intomobile intomobileDOTcom/2013/02/25/nvidia-tegra-4-benchmarks-lay-waste-competition/ Tegra 4 Benchmarks: NVIDIA Jumps Into Hyperspace -- UberGizmo ubergizmoDOTcom/2013/02/tegra-4-benchmarks/ Nvidia Tegra 4 Benchmarks Suggest Pure Awesomeness -- Mobile Magazine mobilemagDOTcom/2013/02/25/nvidia-tegra-4-benchmarks/ Tegra 4 performance crushes current-gen processors -- BGR bgrDOTcom/2013/02/25/tegra-4-benchmarks-343206/ Benchmarks Are In: Nvidia’s Tegra 4 Really Cooks -- Gizmodo gizmodoDOTcom/5986554/benchmarks-are-in-nvidias-tegra-4-really-cooks</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1362117236468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362117556861-5</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 Juggernaut Slaughters Snapdragons</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1362117236468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:53:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, you notice that all major tech webs have chimed in for T4, except Anandtech.

That is a very high bar to cross. On the other hand - there would be a price where everything is possible - that's life - it would be some astronomical number however. JH and team certainly believe they can take the company to $25ps - so that would be a starting point for any discussion that would preclude him running a combined company. It would be more interesting to see Nvidia morph into a system company like Apple /Samsung/HP. They are already half way there. Somebody mentioned Nvidia customizing chips for them - that certainly is a possibility - Apple had a lot of experience with that kind of relationship in the past. Apple right now is clearly behind - their GPU performance superiority in the past was achieved simply by using a large off the shelf GPU area - nothing elegant about it - such brute force approach has severe limitations in terms of power, cost and manufacturability - all of which is coming to a head at Samsung fabs.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362122779399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 02:26:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362137676755-11</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 Juggernaut Slaughters Snapdragons</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1362117236468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:53:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yawn.... where are the design wins?</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1362137676755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 06:34:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362138090604-12</Id><Title>Nvidia could be an attractive takeover target for GOOGLE very soon</Title><Msg>Google CFO says planning to 'cling' to cash for acquisitions</Msg><Username>luizimonti</Username><Timestamp>1362138090604</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 06:41:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362139963415-13</Id><Topic><Title>Mobile World Congress 2013: best of show</Title><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1362092333865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 17:58:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when it takes 9 plus months to develop a device, and Jen has lost all credibility because he lied too often, hard to see how Tegra can recover.

You ain't got no design win and you just can't bear looking at all your competitors smiling all the way to the bank. Put up the sales or shut up. nobody will start any Tegra design because Jen has zero credibility like Charlie says. assuming nvda showed fully working silicon Q1 and designs finally start on a blank sheet of paper, earliest device out is Nov/X'mas. "How do you model the Tegras?" Me: Tegra loses well over $100M for first 3Qs 2013. Sales for Tegras should dip below $100M/Q Q2 and Q3 2013.

From 3Q 2012 earnings transcript "We are committed to return cash to our shareholders and made this decision based on our strong cash position and the high confidence we have in our business to continue generating future cash." OK - A sign of maturity? After all Jensen is around 50 now. Plus he knows his baby(Nvidia) will live. But their are a lot of employees that have a lot of options that want the stock to rise or they just might seak greener pastures. The best way to retain your employees in the semiconductor business is to afford them a vision of that eventual payout on options. If you don't, the best will leave no matter what you do.

Regaining it "says" that the stock is back in a Bull Market, and after 2 years of relatively few closes above it, and none in the last 5 months, I think that's why this is happening. That said, it will be interesting to see if some of the larger shareholders finally engender a late day push to clear it and close there.

If you want I can dig out Intel's current list pricing if you want. Fundamentally a Celeron is just a fused off or die defective Core, there is no real cost difference to the die and Intel can just shift a Core type sku into the Celeron bracket if it needs more firepower, the die cost to itself is negligible. It is a big myth that Intel needs to sell its chips at $300-400 to make a profit. arkDOTintelDOTcom/products/family/43401</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362176028225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:13:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362176462150-76</Id><Topic><Title>GeekBench - Tegra 4 Scores as High as Mobile I5 Ivy Bridge Intel Processor - Must See</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362097471574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 19:24:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well.....With $25 chips equaling their lowest power 2nd highest performing mobile chip that sells for some astronomical price....How long do you think they will be able to keep those fabs open while running at 60% of capacity?

You are wrong, there is no equaling. Core is 2-4 times faster than an A15 per core. You also have a problem listening to what I am actually saying, Intel can vary the performance/price ratio of its chips to beat any ARM competition and still leave more expensive higher performer chips above it, its margin of superiority is that high. 'How long do you think they will be able to keep those fabs open while running at 60% of capacity? ' Intel's Fabs will be working at much higher capacity later this year purely by the fact that they are converting 22nm to 14nm. Intel can easily change the mix of its Fabs from production to next generation development to change its loading. Also where are these production Tegra 4s ? Haswell will arrive before Tegra 4 does in a production mobile device and that's going to do a lot more damage to Nvidia than Tegra 4 will do to Intel which is nothing btw. Tegra 4's effect on Intel will be like a cruiser's 8" shell bouncing harmlessly off a battleship's 15" armor. In fact the next generation quad-core Atom Bay Trail will handle Tegra 4 easily enough by itself at the end of the year.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362178869106</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 18:01:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362179129587-79</Id><Topic><Title>GeekBench - Tegra 4 Scores as High as Mobile I5 Ivy Bridge Intel Processor - Must See</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362097471574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 19:24:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>j777kxx, hate to jump into something... but it's a good time to go long INTC....</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362179129587</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 18:05:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362179637013-80</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation SURVEY!</Title><Username>pupatekeisha</Username><Timestamp>1361802072479</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:21:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have it already.

Your new CEO at Intel will not come on board for 3 months. All will be known in the fullness of time. Good Luck! P..S. Apple could adopt theTegra 4I in a heartbeat and there is nothing that you or anyone else can do about it. Cheap China phones are the latest buzz in the investor community....LOL</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362189528915</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 20:58:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362189924606-99</Id><Topic><Title>Finally A very good reason for Apple to consider Nvidia</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362094769243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:39:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure benchmarks are important even for a mobile processor but for the latter it has to be in the same battery life ballpark otherwise that will be the issue which is why everyone tends to focus on Surface Pro's battery life rather than its much better than ARM performance. Tegra 4 will not be immune for the same criticism if it does not come up to scratch in battery life in common usage. A6X doubles A5X performance but at the same battery life which is why Apple has stuck to dual-cores for a while now. It may go to quad-core at 28nm or more likely 20nm but it will be a balanced design whatever it chooses. We have to see Tegra 4 in both a production tablet and phone to see how competitive it will be in practice. Until then all these current benchmarks are only really telling you what Project Shield will be like as it won't be clock/thermally throttled either.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362189924606</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 21:05:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362190405556-100</Id><Topic><Title>Finally A very good reason for Apple to consider Nvidia</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362094769243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:39:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Marsavian as they in Congress We have a framework for agreement. That's good! But I must point out that the benchmarks were done with the Reference tablet....not the Project Shield. Heck I expect Project Shield to be considerably better! With that said I agree that GeekBench2 is the benchmark to use and we need to test it in the first tablet or smartphone that appears. My goodness who would have thought that an ARM processor would challenge an X86 processor on performance and Intel would say that sure...but we need to see the power usage? We truly live in an upside down world.

Neither is true except in your rather vivid imagination. Any Ivy Bridge Core over 1 Ghz will beat a 1.9 GHz A15 in single thread performance and the new 10W Y Ivy Bridges start at 1 GHz. I was talking about the Tegra 4's performance in relation to other ARMs and Atom not Core. 'With that said I agree that GeekBench2 is the benchmark to use' Geekbench2 is an overall platform benchmark that tests many things. Even the actual cpu performance tests result totals, which are divided into integer and floating point, are an average of the single-thread and multi-thread tests. If you really want to use it just be aware of it really is which is an amalgamation of many tests like cpu, memory, I-O etc.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362191785290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 21:36:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362192746746-102</Id><Topic><Title>Chitown - why do you hide ??</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362188586510</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 20:43:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Apple could adopt theTegra 4I in a heartbeat " Is Chitown another alias of yours ??
