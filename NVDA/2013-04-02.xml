Since you sold calls against your stock, I'm sure you're feeling like you made the right decision. However, as a former professional options trader, I would "suggest" to you that if you wrote any calls at 13 or 14, beyond April, that you cover them if they're trading for less than 15-25 cents. To risk missing the move that would most likely come IF we break over 13 before or after earnings, would be silly, at best. While I was certainly fooled by last Thursday's close, and consequently didn't foresee the last 2 days' action, I've been around long enough to know that trying to squeeze the last couple of dimes out of covered calls is pointless. And, for all the whiners, just look at the losses today in MRVL (2.60%), AMD (2.05%), CRUS (4.20%), CY (1.84%), SWKS (1.08%) plus many more semis down close to 1%. I mean, really, Other than this stock breaking BELOW 11, on HUGE volume, ALL OF THIS IS JUST "NOISE". CRUS is down from 45.49 to 21.125 and only 84 cents (or 4%) from its 52 week low.. The "myopic" view of this stock by SO many of the people who whine and moan, here, is RIDICULOUS! NVDA is NOT ALONE!! If this is your ONLY stock...shame on you. Just consider for a minute all the possible catalysts for the stock to rally 10-20% in a matter of days. First of all, and this IS significant, we have not HAD a move like that in quite some time, and that makes it much MORE LIKELY to happen. That's simple "probability" theory. But, beyond that, it will take ONE "significant" announcement...JUST ONE, and a day or two of 10-20% will happen. As I mentioned the other day, once we get through 13-13 1/8, there is NO "resistance" until 15. So, you'd be happy selling the stock at the equivalent of 13.35-13.50 rather than 15???? IF, by SOME chance, this stock breaks back below 12, without the "aid" of North Korea or some other exogenous event happening, I will raise my position by 25-30%, and if it goes back and tests the low, I'll double it.
