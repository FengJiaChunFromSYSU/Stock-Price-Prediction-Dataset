FWIW I have seen transistor numbers of 26m and 45m quoted for A9 and Atom so using those numbers Tegra 3 would have 104m cpu transistors vs 90m for Clover Trail. The only part of your argument that has merit is the assumption that Intel's 32nm HKMG is more advanced than TSMC's bulk 40nm so the clockspeed differential would be reduced bringing the performance closer but still Tegra 3 was touted originally as greater than Core 2 nevermind Atom so there was a gross distortion of its capability made on roadmap slides which I pointed out at the time so actual benchmark numbers now would be a surprise to those only relying on official Nvidia marketing information for their DD.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1355912932242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 05:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355916469614-4</Id><Topic><Title>Atom beats tegra3 in Windows 8.

They are in about 20 Windows 8 tablets and because CloverTrail is both such a competitive chip and has full Windows legacy capability it will severely hamper WindowsRT at birth which is not what Nvidia investors want to hear. Perhaps instead of mocking Atom with old myths you should have been paying greater attention to its progress over the last year as it will have a direct impact on current and future Tegra 3 sales. Anyway Krait is going to replace Tegra 3 in the next WindowsRT Surface tablet so that won't be your problem anymore.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1355927524592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:32:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355927671458-9</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA missed the rally two days in a row!</Title><Username>danlin78</Username><Timestamp>1355862394325</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:26:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For God's sake, please tell ibex88 to keep his mouth shut.</Msg><Username>guy_8619</Username><Timestamp>1355927671458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:34:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355928207193-10</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 Tablet - 32GB with Mobile Data Sold Out</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1355926586606</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:16:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How about a goo-phone?</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1355928207193</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:43:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355928328913-11</Id><Title>One analyst comment</Title><Msg>Conclusion: Look For Substantial Tegra Sales Growth In 2013/2014 Nvidia has, at least on paper, a killer product.

On Intel's newest mobile Atom chip(s). Yes boys -- a Pair of them. The Genuine Intel Atom/Bay Trail-T, and The Genuine Intel Atom/Valley View-T. Nicknamed the ARM Cortex A-15 Crushers. Take a look at these beauties, boys. Leaked Intel Atom Tablet Roadmap – Bay Trail-T &amp; Valley View-T Detailed Posted on 19 Nov, 2012 – 05:00 von Nicole Intel Bay Trail-T is the next generation platform for future Intel Atom based tablets with plans to hit the market in early 2014. It comes loaded with a Quad core CPU and a DirectX 11-capable GPU, which is all housed in a 22-nm SoC code named Valley View-T – and from the leaked slides it look like ARM will be facing some pretty stiff competition. Even though the platform won’t be released for more than a year, Intel is currently talking to its OEM partners about developing on the platform and we should officially hear about it at CES in a few months. Bay Trail is entering an ecosystem where currently SoCs based on a ARM Cortex-A15 architecture SoCs were preferred by various OEMs (Nokia, LG, ASUS, HTC) over the NVIDIA Tegra 3 platform. Compared to its predecessor Clover Trail, Bay Trail-T is manufactured using a 22-nm process, which in addition to lower power consumption offers an increase in performance. By comparison, Clover Trail uses 32-nm and the current ARM Cortex-A15 manufactured on 28nm. Intel has experience meeting demands for their processor and they have the fabs to back it up, other players like Qualcomm and Apple aren’t in such a secure position. The Valley View-T SoC will no longer offer hyperthreading, but rather offer an increase from 2 to 4 cores, which should offer a performance boost of 50-60%. On paper that doesn’t actually sound very impressive but it is a signification increase when you combine it with the new 7th generation GPU, the HD 4000 based on the Ivy Bridge platorm as well as the new LPDDR3-1067 RAM. The overall performance is Leagues ahead of Clover Trail but it will also put the Cortex-A15 platform to shame. The Valley View SoC is also the first “out-of-order” based CPU in the Intel Atom and it’s based on the Silver Mont Core. It is clocked between 1.6 and 2.1GHz each with a 512KB L2 cache and of course this is Quad core with a cushy 2MB. So Intel will have caught up with the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro, at least when it comes to L2 cache. The keyword word is GPU! We will be seeing the HD 4000 collection, which means that mobile HD video editing will be possible, because Intel’s QuickSync technology supports hardware acceleration. DirectX 11 is finally supported and offer game developers the ability to offer their games on this platfrom. Valley View-T will be a great choice for game developers since it also offers support for display resolutions of 2560 × 1600! Another interesting point is that you’ve got the option to include 3D cameras. Bay Trail-T offers the possibility of a stereoscopic camera for shooting 1080p at 60fps! The big question is whether or not the feature this will ever gain popularity in tablets. When it comes to battery life and standby time we can only speculate however Intel promises that Bay Trail-T consumes Half as much power compared to its predecessor, which means that x86 tablets will easily be easily seeing 10 hours of battery life." Be sure to check out the detail-filled charts too. On Intel's newest ARM Cortex A-15 Crushers. Just Google the title of the story, boys. Oh, and be sure to look for Intel's Bay Trail and Valley View chips at next month's Consumer Electronics Show. Just look for the biggest booth. No doubt the biggest crowd of tablet game developers too.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1355932728952</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 10:58:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355933227053-24</Id><Title>Nvidia - needs to break above 12.82</Title><Msg>a break above 12.82 would lead to MA-200 13.13 test.

Naturally, there's no link or anything to support his statement, but let's assume for a moment that it's true. Apple doesn't make their own chips. Well, not yet anyway. They're still shopping for land. So Apple today uses a middleman -- just like nvidia does -- to make their iChips. So the middleman -- in this case Samsung -- needs to make a profit, and needs to charge enough to also cover all the scrap chips too. Intel is different. They actually MAKE their own chips. Yes boys, Intel makes their own in wholly-owned and operated 17 fab plants. Using THE best process equipment in the world. Yes boys, the very Best. And Intel is renowned for having extremely high, profitable yields on everything they make. So if Apple's cost of an A6X chip is $17.50 -- and a lesser-efficient middleman is making them for Apple -- why, Intel should Easily be able to make those similar Genuine Intel Atom/Bay Trail-T, and Genuine Intel Atom/Valley View-T chips for way less. Waaaay less, boys. So let's say that Intel's newest Cortex A-15 Crushers cost $12 bucks per chip. Could they afford to sell 'em for $20.00? You bet they can. Not only can Intel conquer the mobile tablet market -- they will do it Profitably.</Msg><Username>perceptive.best</Username><Timestamp>1355949867630</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355950302652-38</Id><Topic><Title>While the Market rallies, nvda is struggling in the La Brea Tar Pits</Title><Username>bestnhighest.wins</Username><Timestamp>1355888777434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:46:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Basher? as in PAID basher? just guessing</Msg><Username>pennyforabuck</Username><Timestamp>1355950302652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:51:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355951594743-39</Id><Title>NVDA - not going anywhere fast</Title><Msg>Its a weak stock - weak fundamentals, weak technicals the only thing going for it is its balance sheet sell-off at close of day pretty much tells you the story with this one. no conviction buyers. still holding though will revisit tomorrow, may not hold through CES.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1355951594743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:13:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355953527849-40</Id><Topic><Title>While the Market rallies, nvda is struggling in the La Brea Tar Pits</Title><Username>bestnhighest.wins</Username><Timestamp>1355888777434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:46:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, today NVDA was up and showed impressive strength while the rest of the market was getting crushed.

It sounded so good when it was announced by carnival barker Jen. Way back on May 9, 2011. "This is a key step in NVIDIA's plans to be a major player in the mobile computing revolution," said Jen-Hsun Huang, President and CEO of NVIDIA. "Adding Icera's technology to Tegra gives us an outstanding platform to support the industry's best phones and tablets." "Icera is a perfect fit for NVIDIA. Our businesses are complementary. Icera has the right team, with a strong, proven track record. And their nimble, entrepreneurial, engineering-focused culture mirrors our own," he continued." ... adding icer's technology... outstanding platform... icera has the right team... ... proven track record... nimble... nvidia plans to be a major player... And yet it will take until the end of 2013 for icera to deliver any kind of integrated goods? Yes boys, another year yet. Clearly, Jen and his sock-puppet board got bamboozled on this icera acquisition. And bamboozled Badly.

I was struck by the similarity of the features. If this information is true it sounds like Nvidia is trying to push into cheap PC's with Tegra 4. Something along the lines of AMD's APUs. Normally I would say what a waste of time with the way tablets are selling, but coming from a base of 30 million Tegra processors sold in 2012 any additional sales would be significant. Just an aside but the discrete GPU card GT620 has 92 cores clocked at 625 Mhz. When released Nvidia claimed it was 75% faster than Intel's Ivy Bridge integrated graphics. Note: Tegra 3+ Gpu clock speeds were raised 525 Mhz from 420 Mhz. on Tegra 3. An increase of the GPU clock speeds to 625 Mhz. on a 28nm part such as Tegra 4 is not improbable.

Tegra 4 + LTE for smartphone will probably arrive in late 2013. Can't imagine much revenue from Smartphones in 2013. Tegra 3 was missing in action on smartphone front. HTC One X was quite successful internationally but nothing like Samsung flagship. HTC One X+ is sort of a novelty, I have one and its quite nice but with such limited HTC marketing its not going to move the needle. Jen claims 30M Tegra shipment in 2012. So @ $20 its a $600M revenue line. Not bad but meh. Assuming another 50% increase in Tegra sales in 2013, you are looking at $1B in 2013 revenue. That should at least lead to breakeven to positive operating margins. I don't know if that will be enough to balance the decline in PC revenue. Unless Nvidia has a breakthrough product (not slide ware) 2013 and onwards things could get quite rough as they start getting squeezed by both Intel and Qualcomm.

I thought you disappeared and as it turns out you just crawled back from under that short rock trying to sift off a few pennies and pulling your hair out trying to guess the itty-b itty direction swings. Well good luck but I have to say your post is ahhhh rather misguided, per usual. 1. "Tegra 3 was missing in action on smartphone front....HTC One X+ is sort of a novelty, I have one and its quite nice but with such limited HTC marketing its not going to move the needle." Oh you mean like Android when it came out? Furthermore, if you are selling 200 millin units in chips on a static market segment, well yeah I would tend to agree but when the projection for sales bumps total units sold by almost 40% on an exploding market segment well...I have to say hold on Mr - you aren't seeing for the forest for the trees. 2."I don't know if that will be enough to balance the decline in PC revenue." You do realize they have seen growth in this business segment righ, not to mention affected by macro conditionst? And that doesn't even take into consideration that WHEN somebody FINALLY pulls the life support bug from AMD that segment will grow by further multiples for who ever is left (NVDIA). 3."Unless Nvidia has a breakthrough product (not slide ware) 2013 and onwards things could get quite rough as they start getting squeezed by both Intel and Qualcomm." Well, this hasn't prevented Qualcomm or Intel from being successfull in the past on a large scale and this is the same retarded argument about anybody who wasn't intel or MS prior to 2007 - hmmm now look at the industry. The 800lb gorillas only affect poorly run companies in the long run. Who, I might add, don't use their agility, and nimblness and fail to capitalize on quickly changing market conditions. With the exception of Qualcomm and Samsung NVIDIA is really the only legitimate player left and they are gaining share on all fronts and with the advent of the Icera product line that should happen at an even faster rate. 4. "As I said, poor fundamentals" How are increasing revenues and success spacing out to several growth markets not to mention gaining in your legacy market, with an impecable balance sheet poor fundamentals? "poor technicals" Cant argue with that - the chart is down right ugly. " solid balance sheet." Agreed but a fundamental you felt to seperate out for some reason.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1355970663856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:31:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355971031468-54</Id><Topic><Title>tegra3 was a miserable failure on smartphones.

Jen could have gone hat-in-hand to Qualcomm, like everybody else, and said, "I would like to license your entire cheap LTE multi-band radio, please." And Qualcomm would have said, "Why sure, little fella." "We have license agreements with Every wireless manufacturer on the planet." "That'll be a buck apiece", or some equally cheap price. And with Jen only making 30 million tegra chips per year, that's what, 12 years of licensing for the $367 million price of the icera acquisition. Most importantly, nvidia cuda had cheap integrated LTE radios three (3) years earlier. Like in 2011, rather than the end of 2013. But no! Oh no no no. Jen's ego couldn't handle Licensing entire cheap radios from Qualcomm like everyone else. He's gotta Build his own, don't u know. And be Dead Last to Market with those selling-like-hotcakes integrated LTE chips. And ironically, nvidia/icera Still has to pay some licensing fees to Qualcomm for the use of their standard-essential patents upon which the entire global wireless industry is based. Ego. It blurs logical decision-making, and makes for an Expensive leader.</Msg><Username>perceptive.best</Username><Timestamp>1355977149626</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 23:19:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
