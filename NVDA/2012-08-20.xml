It is clear to me you have never in your life read a license agreement. All of the categories you call out are definitions provided at the outset of the agreement, all very common. None of these technologies are excluded, just defined for later reference. You should read section 3.2 that defines the cross license to "Intel's Patents." Patents is also described above, in section 1, THE DEFINITION SECTION as including everything. Finally, you may want to read section 3.2(c)...even had anything you said made sense, which it doesn't, NVDA very clearly has the right to have anything manufactured by a third party. You really should just walk away, there is no mercy rule here and you are being made a fool of...well, more so than usual anyway.</Msg><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1345437771000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 00:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>38</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>63</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345439327000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to Pay NVDA over 1.5 Billion by 2016</Title><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1345422551000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 20:29:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is fun to watch the flailing frustration of a spammer that is clearly out of his league when forced to defend their moronic positions. I am tiring of schooling you today, but, what the hell...I'll stomp on you some more. 1. Masks are not disclosed in patents...NOBODY and I mean NOBODY puts a mask in a patent, they are maintained as trade secrets, and are subject to copyright protection. So, no, Intel isn't copying anything. Also, a cross license just keeps parties from suing each other, your assertion that somehow Intel gets all of NVDA's research is beyond stupid. 2. Intel is effectively taxed, in the amount of 1.5 Billion (that's with a "B") for products they sell that compete with NVDA. For the next four years, an eternity in the semiconductor space, NVDA is being subsidized by Intel. I am not aware of any other companies having their expenses paid for 4 years. 3. As to your assertion that Intel can simply copy and shrink any design... beyond stupid...even for you, which is saying a lot. Heck, why don't they just shrink that 62 core super chip and just rule the world now....HA HA HA HA HA HA. Seriously, go back to talking back and forth with your multiple Yahoo IDs on how great Apple is....I have destroyed you enough today.</Msg><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1345439327000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 01:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>44</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>37</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345440422000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Just in: LG Optimus Vu goes global, Tegra 3 replacing Snapdragon</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345434846000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:54:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great find!

But you are just burning-off your credibility here. See page 77. http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581012000013/nvda-2012x10k.htm#s81B563FBB83F13D5CC2E1FD897E872A7 Note 4 - Patent Cross License Agreement "On January 10, 2011, we entered into a new six-year patent cross licensing agreement, or the License Agreement, with Intel. Under the License Agreement, Intel has granted to NVIDIA and its qualified subsidiaries, and NVIDIA has granted to Intel and Intel’s qualified subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license, without the right to sublicense to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first filing date on or before March 31, 2017, to make, have made (subject to certain limitations), use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor -- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. NVIDIA’s rights to Intel’s patents have Certain Specified Limitations, including but not limited to, NVIDIA was NOT granted a license to: (1) certain microprocessors, defined in the License Agreement as “Intel Processors” or “Intel Compatible Processors;” (2) certain chipsets that connect to Intel Processors; or (3) certain flash memory products. In connection with the License Agreement, NVIDIA and Intel mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes." Continue to deny the cold cruel Truth if you wish. But the astute readers here won't. nvidia only received rights to use a small sub-set of Intel's patents. Whereas Intel received the right to use 100% of all of nvidia's patents through the "Capture Period" of March 31, 2017. Intel will capture the right to use 'em for a six (6) year period. And then Intel can use those patents until they expire. No additional future licensing by Intel required. You may not like it "patent_killr". But that's what the Agreement says. So let's stop making yourself look Stupid, okay? -</Msg><Username>genuine.best</Username><Timestamp>1345443610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 02:20:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>45</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345444158000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Xeon Phi</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345313282000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 14:08:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, don't like the license agreement conversation anymore?

Just creating the hundreds of IDs alone is hours per week. Many of his posts are long and it takes time to try to figure out how to turn good news into bad, so this is not a trivial time investment for him. Best Guy seemed to appear on this board several years ago about the same time that Charlie Demerjian got snubbed by Nvidia when Charlie was at the Inquirer and had to leave that gig. I'm not saying there's any connection there, just trying to tie into a time frame rationally. The other thing about this Best Guy is he seems to have a direct connection to Yahoo's servers somehow. He is able to delete almost any post at will. Even to the extent of labeling them with up-arrows, indicating they will be deleted, and then, poof, they're gone. Just can't figure the guy out. So if anyone has any thoughts it would be interesting to hear them. By the way. I do think it likely that this post will get deleted, so if it does, please try to continue the thread. - thanks all, branitt</Msg><Username>mhmhm7</Username><Timestamp>1345504109000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>23</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345506796000-53</Id><Topic><Title>Does anyone know who this Best Guy is?</Title><Username>mhmhm7</Username><Timestamp>1345504109000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, he may know the moderator... he is here for one purpose...</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1345506796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:53:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345507982000-54</Id><Topic><Title>Another Win for Longs</Title><Username>ccolli64</Username><Timestamp>1345502250000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:37:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>must be something like HTC One X/S - think nvda OMAP4-ed the Snapdragon. qcom must be getting quite a pretty penny for their LTE Snapdragon.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1345507982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345508109000-55</Id><Topic><Title>Does anyone know who this Best Guy is?</Title><Username>mhmhm7</Username><Timestamp>1345504109000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>does anyone know whom this ibex guy is? let you figure that one out.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1345508109000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:15:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345509874000-56</Id><Topic><Title>Another Win for Longs</Title><Username>ccolli64</Username><Timestamp>1345502250000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:37:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice.. hopefully it adds to the next quarters revenues...</Msg><Username>aadaytrader</Username><Timestamp>1345509874000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:44:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345512954000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Does anyone know who this Best Guy is?</Title><Username>mhmhm7</Username><Timestamp>1345504109000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah I know who ibexx is - he is the guy who proved you wrong and lying every and each time you posted.
