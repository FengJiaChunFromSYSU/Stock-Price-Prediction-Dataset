However, Nvidia sometimes talk about that their roadmap is a convincing and sometimes partly deciding factor for their customers when engaging with Nvidia. So perhaps this also means that Google has seen the light regarding "Tegra 4" and has decided it is worth waiting for (otherwise their Nexus 10 could be rendered obsolete when competitors in 1H 2013 release T4 tablets).

I think nvidia made the right decision to go hard at the mobile market but they need to execute more rapidly and secure some large design wins for it to be profitable. Hopefully wayne will have massive design wins in the coming year when its announced early next year. You would think that even without mobile, the 28nm kepler line should be sellling really well considering they were selling every chip they could get their hands on as of a few months ago. It should take a whole quarter just to fill the channel sufficiently so guidance should be good. At 12, the stock has nothing priced into it at all. I suspect that after several quarters, the management will finally yield to the questions about what they are doing with all that cash and institue a potential buyback program to reduce liquidity. They need to do something for the shareholders otherwise more will leave and the price will continue to decline.</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1351530589563</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 13:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351532534688-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hello Wayne! nVidia Tegra 4 set to launch at 2013 CES in early Janaury</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1351515760427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 09:02:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are funny....

Okay? And you are distorting the facts by saying one thing is absolute why ignoring all the history from the original presentation of the road map and how that roadmap has also been adjusted. The hypocrisy can only go so far because you keep at it without giving the competitors the same level of scrutiny. It just gets old after a while. And I have no problem with the facts you present if they were really intended to be objective and balanced, which they have not been. You only added some points to 'balance' your isolated point on Nvidia because we are pointing out what you are doing.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1351563224545</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:13:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351563466376-36</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne Tegra 4 is based on quad-core A15 plus ninja core (4+1) whereas competitions have dual-core only</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1351518921461</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 09:55:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>weak... name one thing I've stated that's incorrect...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351563466376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:17:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351567861297-37</Id><Topic><Title>3G Nexus 7, Nexus 4, Nexus 10 to be available on November 13; Nexus 7 32GB is available now in US</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1351545036671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of Google launches, did you see that nvidia lost All Three new devices? Sad, but true. 1. The new $99 Nexus 7 tablet -- Google selected a China-based WonderMedia Technologies PRIZM WM8950 single-core 800 MHz Cortex-A9 CPU with Mali-400 Graphics Processing Unit. 'Cuda been Huge volume win for nvidia. 2. The new co-branded Samsung Nexus 10 tablet -- Will use a self-manufactured Samsung Exynos 5 processor. Why buy 'em when you can make better yourself, right? 3. The new LG Nexus 4 smartphone -- Nope not a Tegra. The LG Nexus 4 will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core 1.5 GHz processor. It's likely some higher-end models will have Qualcomm's integrated 4G LTE processors too. 0 for 3, boys.
