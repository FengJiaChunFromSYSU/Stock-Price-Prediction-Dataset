Take my money!!!!!</Title><Msg>0 0 0 Share Our annual Investor Day conference in Santa Clara packed a few surprises for the 90-plus attendees and many hundreds listening in on the phone line. Headlines were made by news that NVIDIA will be returning $1 billion to shareholders over the rest of this fiscal year, in addition to the $200 million returned since our fourth quarter of last year. And several new announcements and fresh demos were revealed around our NVIDIA Tegra 4 mobile chip family – which many of the financial analysts in attendance follow closely. In a good-natured exchange, Phil Carmack, senior VP of our Mobile business, made the first-ever voice call on the AT&amp;T LTE network on the Phoenix reference smartphone powered by the Tegra 4i chip. Unveiled six weeks ago, Tegra 4i is the company’s first fully integrated 4G LTE mobile processor, which is significantly faster but half the size of its nearest competitor. From the stage, Phil called his colleague Steve Allpress, chief technology officer of our modem business, who claimed he’d forgotten altogether about the presentation he was to give about the software-based modem technology, developed by UK-based Icera, which NVIDIA bought almost two years ago. The call was crystal clear. Steve, who turns out to be have been well prepared for the event, later showed for the first time our detailed schedule for obtaining full certification on AT&amp;T. He said that we’re on track for Tegra 4i devices for Q1 2014. There were also two impressive demos shown to the audience. The first showed off a new capability offered by Tegra 4’s Chimera computational-photography technology – Tap-to-Track with HDR. This enables users of devices equipped with a Tegra 4 processor to select a scene on their screen by tapping it, which would then remain in focus while the camera takes a series of HDR – or high-dynamic range—pictures or video. Such capabilities aren’t available today even on high-end professional photo and video equipment. And the second demo showed a Tegra 4i processor handily beating a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 chip running the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark, which tests the speed of JavaScript engines. In the first benchmark ever shown on Tegra 4i, the NVIDIA chip outstripped its competitor by 1.4x, demonstrating its exceptional performance.</Msg><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1365766567979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 07:36:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365772894710-4</Id><Topic><Title>Barclay cuts BRCM to SELL, citing poor semi outlook and, specifically, BRCM's discrete LTE (questionable interest)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365715065071</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 17:17:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bloomberg- IPhone Outpaced in Surging India by Less Costly Rivals As I have posted about the $99 Facebook phone - the age of integrated smartphone solutions, along with its absolutely gigantic volume and $s.

And right now, with that constant bashing of anything that is non-nvda, head honcho is getting pretty desperate - the whole Tegra program failed because the market he chased is non-existing. R&amp;D $300M per year... you believe that, I've a bridge to sell you. Long before he picked up Icera and all the extra activities, he had said that the breakeven is $1B sales. Jens' words, not mine. From 10Q Q3 '12, loss of $40M on sales of $240M = breakeven of $1.3B assuming 50% margins. I predicted that nvda will shift the books/numbers around. Sure enuf, now suddenly Tegra at $700M is 'breaking even'. Of course you can listen to Hans 'nvda to $40' Mossesman and Jen instead.........</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1365773597387</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365774119510-6</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA to return $1 billion to shareholders in current fiscal year</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365718420745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 18:13:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wouldn't look at quarterly data for a reference to the yearly breakeven, they might space RandD spending out differently through certain seasons. And also " Long before he picked up Icera" would be the early stages of Tegra, like T1 or 2, and my guess is there was a whole lot more RandD for that time period, from 1 core to dual core to 4+!, there was definitely some more spending during that period. Currently though Nvidia seems to be focusing on the 4+1 and improving that design, which might attribute to the 300M of RandD</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1365774119510</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365774685741-7</Id><Topic><Title>New independent source of information, moved since yesterday.

INTC is down, again, and so is MSFT and almost every other semi. Jen Hsun "broke" the connection with the traditional Wintel PC business with what he said, yesterday, and ALL the BAD news is OUT... As I mentioned, last night, there was likely a "sea change" in the trading of this stock, yesterday, with new "stronger hands" being the buyers. This could be a FUN day, so enjoy.

Wouldn't that mean that they are willing to 13, or however higher the price may go?</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1365785289254</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 12:48:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365785442237-32</Id><Topic><Title>You like that CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM so much then hand over your Shares for $12s OK?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365780285126</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:24:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jens is fighting the shorts. Short interest was increasing according to Nasdaq. Up ~70% in a month IIRC. The market makers will want to "sell high" to Jens. Well, sell high to Nvda. Jens will likely be selling some of "his own" shares at a higher price, while the company is buying. Almost simultaneously. The buyback will support the SP for a while. Why else would they do a buy back.

Next week is a MUCH bigger game, since instead of 469k shares at risk, it's 4.2MM shares at risk. THAT will be significant.

The old saying of "they don't ring a bell" at the bottom (or the top for that matter) was rendered inaccurate, yesterday, since in my opinion, that's exactly what Jen Hsun did. He rang the bell and said, "I've had enough...the stock is too cheap, we're going to buy @10% of it, ourselves, before the year is out, since we get NO credit for the cash on hand. Oh, and I suggest you let us surprise you on some things in the near future." He literally DID use those words, and THAT was critical to the performance of the stock, today. He also pulled off a classic "UPOD" where he got the bad news out of the way a MONTH BEFORE the earnings report. That makes the likely result of that release a "relief" or "better than expectations" rather than a disappointment. And, if you didn't listen to the presentation, do yourself a favor and watch the WHOLE thing. So much happened after their lunch, and well after the market closed, yesterday, including a very revealing Q&amp;A session. With the stock trading just 10% above its 2 year low (mid-day yesterday), that is a GREAT time for the company to buy and retire the stock, which leads to higher earnings per share. He basically gave the "all clear" sign and it was perfectly executed. Next week will prove instructive with so much more money on the line for the shorts and options shorts. Before today, there were 4.2mm shares represented by the monthly April 13s and another 8k+ traded today, so we'll see if that was people buying "to close" or "to open". We'll know the OI by Monday. If they were selling MORE of them, that would bring it to 5mm shares short at 13, and there's almost another 1mm at the 14 strike. I think the entire thing was handled perfectly, the "bell was rung" and we've had a genuine "Break Out". It was FUN to watch, all the way around. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

We don't get enough leverage on our P/E out of it for the cost at this price. And primarily, your notion that the buyback sends a message to Wall Street about Nvidia's bright future is NOT sufficient reason in my mind to sacrifice all this cash. I buy cash-rich companies because I like the buffer, the margin of saftety the cash provides. During difficult product transition times such as Nvidia has been experiencing, the cash is what enables a company to sail through unscarred. A large buyback can really trash that advantage. And yes, I'm long, with shares purchased exactly at $10 during the financial meltdown. Wouldn't it be nice it Nvidia had chosen that time to reacquire a lot of their shares, at a 23% lower price than now?</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1365815717096</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365816956648-68</Id><Topic><Title>$800 million share buyback</Title><Username>salemthecat100</Username><Timestamp>1365796740007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 15:59:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In addition to show that NV does care about its investors, JH also ups the buyback program to protect the company from a hostile takeover. This of course not discussed in public, but I think it contributed to the thinking/decision of returning more cash to investors.. ""Low stock price + no debt + big cash pile"": this typically represent a FATAL attraction to the likes of Carl Icahn, Blackstone, and all the other buyout con artists in the world. It think JH realizes this and hence acts accordingly. JH would not have done this if he didn't foresee a healthy income stream starting Q3 of this year. As Max pointed out earlier, one of the big accomplishment of yesterday's meeting was that JH successfully (at least partially) severed the ties of market perception between NV and the PC industry - this is good because, to a great extent, NV stock price had been held back by this association. He said, to paraphrase the statement, that all NVIDIA products will eventually be in the Tegra family.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365816956648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:35:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365817759032-69</Id><Topic><Title>$800 million share buyback</Title><Username>salemthecat100</Username><Timestamp>1365796740007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 15:59:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks ibexx, good points, hope you and Max are right on the money.....</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1365817759032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:49:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365822405680-70</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidias BUY BACK PROGRAM sounds like a CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365709250601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:40:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Panacro, I think there are already a couple of wins lined up for T4i, that's just my impression. If you noticed how much time was devoted to explaining the certification process for the modems, especially with AT&amp;T, then you can infer that by the end of September, we will have at least one or two announcements with AT&amp;T's phone line-up. We'll at least have some serious rumor action by that time and I'm betting the certification goes a little ahead of the schedule they showed us Thursday.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1365822405680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 23:06:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365823275150-71</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidias BUY BACK PROGRAM sounds like a CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365709250601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:40:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Toshiba AT10-A, one of the first Tegra 4 devices, has surfaced.
