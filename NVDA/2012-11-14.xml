So let's say that $1.5 billion takes it. Well, that and another $2.0 billion to pay-off their debt. So let's assume $3.5 billion is the purchase price for AMD. Let's do a quick wallet-check of the rumored buyers, shall we? 1. Microsoft -- They have $66.444 Billion of cash idling around the place. As of 9/30/12. So Microsoft could buy AMD, repay their debt, and have $62.944 Billion left. A good buyer, yes? 2. Google -- Google has $45.725 Billion of cash as of 9/30/12. So without searching the couch cushions, Google could easily buy AMD. 3. Samsung -- Samsung has a lot of cash, boys. A Lot of Cash. 15.39 Trillion Korean Won. Yes boys, KRW 15,390,000,000,000 Needless to say, Samsung could buy AMD. And have enough left over to pick up JPMorgan Chase AND Goldman Sachs too. 4. Intel -- $10.465 Billion of cash inside their vault as of 9/30/12. Yes, Intel could buy AMD, and have a cool $7 Billion left over. 5. Facebook -- $10.452 billion of cash. Lookin' good as a buyer. 6. nvidia -- Oh my. My my my. nvidia only had $3.435 billion of cash, as of 10/31/12. No doubt less after that dividend. I'm sorry boys, but nvidia doesn't seem to have the cash to buy AMD. But Jen could probably attend the auction and watch the bidding. And meet his new competitor afterwards too.</Msg><Username>analytical.best</Username><Timestamp>1352875720878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:48:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352880860237-3</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA - share repurchase</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1352867804282</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 23:36:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what the heck are you blabbering about?

Lastest in HPC</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1352830077796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:07:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HPCwire: Regarding HPC applications, what are the advantages of the CARMA solutions compared to a more traditional x86/Tesla GPU cluster? What niche are you filling with these ARM-based solutions? Tinti: CARMA solutions provides a low power platform, ideal for applications that relies mainly on GPU computing power. With typical GPU computing systems you need a platform in the range of 250 to 350 watt, for example, a dual-Intel Xeon E5 or dual-AMD Opteron 6200 or 6300 in order to have your GPUs up and running. This is fine as long as a relevant part of the computation relies on CPUs, otherwise this is simply a waste a of power. Usually GPUs are claimed to have a gigaflops per watt ratio of 3 (higher that the ~2 you can achieve on a BlueGene/Q systems, this is true only if you consider the GPU devices --around 200 watts for 600 peak gigaflops. When you consider the whole platform this ratio drops down 1.2 /0.9 not far from a pure CPU systems as documented in the Green500. With CARMA blades you need only 10 watts for the CPU, RAM, and flash drive; therefore most of the power -- 45 watts -- is dedicated to GPUs. The “must” for exploiting CARMA solution is to have an application that is strongly focused on CUDA for CARMA and CARMA2 blades, or on big data/cloud for DARMA blades. HPCwire: What is the advantage of pairing a heterogeneous ARM plus GPU Tegra 3 with a discrete Quadro GPU? What is the intended programming model for such an arrangement? Tinti: With the current generation of ARM CPUs, you cannot address algorithms based on floating point arithmetic, therefore most scientific applications are excluded. NVIDIA Quadro GPU broadens the range of applications that can be addressed and gives a huge boost to performance. CARMA is the one and the only platform available on the market that combines ARM’s low power CPUs with powerful NVIDIA GPUs. HPCwire: Will developers with existing CUDA applications, run on an x86-Tesla set-up, be able to port their codes to the CARMA platform? Yes, we provide a pre-configured cross compiling environment for ARM, CUDA, and MPI that makes this process very easy. Support services are also available. We are currently porting some applications, which will be disclosed soon. The systems come with the NVIDIA SDK and ORNL’s SHOC benchmark suite. HPCwire: Are these clusters intended for production environments? Tinti: The CARMA cluster is designed to be used in production environment, and provides a robust platform for a wide range of application: HPC, big data, and cloud. The CARMA microcluster is designed to be a perfect development platform. It’s very quiet and can also be placed beside a desk. It could be used to create, but not for critical environments since a redundant power supply or remote management feature, like IPMI, are not available yet. Based upon the feedback we will receive at SC we will eventually release a more robust version of CARMA microcluster. HPCwire: Do you have customers with installed systems, or in the pipeline, for any of the CARMA or DARMA systems? What geographies do you intend to serve? Tinti: More than 2000 CARMA dev kit has been sold so far to the most relevant research centers around the world. A lot of industries in different market such as animation, oil &amp; gas, microelectronics, telecommunications, defense, and manufacturing have adopted it as a development platform. Unfortunately we cannot disclose the name, most of them are developing innovative applications and prefer to keep their privacy right now. Most of these customers are of course waiting for a platform ready for production, like the CARMA series.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1352894940671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 07:09:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352903709642-6</Id><Title>nvda pumper boys like yellow catfish -- no fight left in 'em</Title><Msg>nvda pumper boys like yellow catfish -- no fight left in 'em nope no fight left at all they appear to have given up trying to fight the inevitable and are done be sure to google the news : 76-Pound Yellow Catfish Landed in Trinity River "Pruett kept the fish, his personal best, and had a fish fry, keeping the head for a trophy."</Msg><Username>fumbe.bapoto</Username><Timestamp>1352903709642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:35:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352904414596-7</Id><Topic><Title>nvda pumper boys like yellow catfish -- no fight left in 'em</Title><Username>fumbe.bapoto</Username><Timestamp>1352903709642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:35:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice picture -- thanks for sharing that with our show-n-tell club.

It would be a solid buy if it got there but i highly doubt that. We aren't in the middle of the great recession anymore. Also Nvidia will probably buy back more and more stock the lower it gets. NVDA Basically has 6$ of cash per share alone not including the value of patents and growth. Also it has a dividend now that it didn't have that before. I highly doubt you'll see it get to 7 low.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Chipmaker Texas Instruments said Wednesday that it will lay off 1,700 workers in an effort to shift focus away from its Struggling mobile business. The job cuts represent about 5% of TI's staff, and they are part of a previously announced restructuring initiative aimed at cutting costs and increasing its presence in the burgeoning embedded device market. Shares of Texas Instruments rose about 1% in afterhours trading. The Dallas-based company had made some headway in the smartphone market a few years ago. But recently the biggest mobile phone makers, including Samsung and Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) have opted to design their own chips for their respective Galaxy smartphones and iPhones. TI says it's time to reconsider its strategy, opting instead to embrace what many industry experts believe is the Future of the mobile sector: embedded connectivity in everyday items, including appliances, cars and even clothing. "We have a great opportunity to reshape our [mobile] processor and wireless connectivity product lines to concentrate on embedded markets," said Greg Delagi, head of TI's embedded processing division, in a statement. "These job reductions are something we do with a heavy heart because they impact people we care deeply about." TI said it expects to be able to save $450 million by the end of 2013 by making the cuts. The company said the layoffs will cost $325 million, most of which will be realized in the current quarter. " Note the last paragraph, boys. "The layoffs will cost $325 million", covering the 1,700 ex-employees. $325 million / 1,700 folks = $191,176 per ex-employee. So when Jen finally catches-up with the semiconductor industry lay-offs, remember boys. It's gonna cost a Lot of shareholder's cash.</Msg><Username>bestville_daily_gazette</Username><Timestamp>1352947028252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 21:37:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>27</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352948429829-50</Id><Topic><Title>So Best?
