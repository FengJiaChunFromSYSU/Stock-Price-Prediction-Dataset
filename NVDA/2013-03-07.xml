I only went to Wall St. to make enough money to buy a Country Inn, which I did after 8 or so years there. I had the Kedron Valley Inn for 17 years, and sold it 10 1/2 years ago, but once I got it on the road to "recovery" (it's the 8th or 9th longest continuously running Inn or Tavern in VT, circa 1828) I would do a show every other year while doing a major renovation. Living in the country and having a "family business" where any kids I had would grow up as "part of something" was the other thing I wanted to do other than perform. So, when those two parts didn't come my way, I decided that I'd do my performing in smaller venues in the country once I had established the business. It turned out well.

It sounded quite "coy", and I remember how Jensen seemed when he first spoke on CNBC, in 1999, when I first bought the stock. He looked like the "cat that swallowed the canary" and was so coy that I had to buy. I think they'll not only give better and higher guidance (I really think that the guidance was sandbagging the analysts), but that might be the event where they give the pricing, etc, for Project Shield. IF the market starts to understand that, then we should see a major run up by the end of next week in anticipation of those things. It might also be why we're already seeing signs of a better technical picture and why the stock is trading better on that front. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I do hope they clarify pricing on Project Shield and the GTC conference would be a great place while they are surrounded by the entire gaming developer community. Two things I picked up over the last week. Qualcomm is now saying they are hiring 35 game developers....to work up games optimized for their chips and today's announcement that Nvidia is Supporting Physx and Apex for PS4 games. Bottom line--Nvidia is driving open source gaming which Consoles in the past have not been. Make one game edition and sell it everywhere. Uncharted territory so how can a financial analyst profile Project Shield's potential. Did notice that the IR guy said The Shield will run android and stream PC games and soon from Nvidia's Grid! That's a killer app in my opinion if and when it comes to fruition.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362671262260</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 10:47:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362672517301-30</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia AT Wedbush Conference 8:35M ET - You Can Listen Live</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362660345154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:45:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for posting... upbeat...

Allwinner shipped more than 50 million chips in 2012 with 70% of the volume supplied to markets outside of China. Because its solution's price is only half that of global first-tier chipmakers, the company's share in the tablet market is expected to rise further in 2013. Rockchip has successfully landed orders for HP's new 7-inch entry-level tablets, while Allwinner is currently still in negotiations with some first-tier brand vendors for orders. Allwinner is currently offering its dual-core chip at a price of US$5, an upgraded dual-core model, priced at below US$10, and a quad-core chip, priced only half that of Nvidia's Tegra 3. Since Allwinner's quad-core solution does not have a large performance gap compared to Tegra 3, orders started growing in the second half of 2012 and are expected to continue staying strong in 2013.'

The Transformer AiO (all-in-one) is very true to its name, as like the Autobots, it has two completely different configurations. In desktop mode, you're looking at a Windows 8 machine running on a Core i3 / i5 / i7, with a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GT730M GPU, between 4 and 8GB of RAM, and up to a 2TB SATA HDD. It also has a DVD-RW optical drive (can you believe it?), a card reader, a bunch of ports and even a TV Tuner should you want one. Being a Windows 8 rig, it's not surprising that the 18.4-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display has ten-point multitouch, but it gets even more interesting when you free that screen from its desktop restraints. Popping it from the dock means you're now looking at a monster tablet with its own internal specs: a quad-core Tegra 3, 2 gigs of RAM and 32GB of flash storage. If you're in the mood to continue peering at Redmond's squares, it'll work as a remote terminal for the "PC Station." But, if you've got a sweet tooth, you can switch the slate to Android mode and knock around in 4.1 Jelly Bean. The Transformer AiO (P1801) is expected to be available in North America early second quarter at $1,299 for the basic model, which doesn't sound all that extortionate given the versatility of the desktop-come-tablet. Head to the source link for the full spec sheet, or check out the video below if you'd like a visual tour." NVIDIA has 2 parts in this dual-OS computer tablet: a high enough graphic card running on Win8 and an Tegra 3 SoC running Android"</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362688487197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 15:34:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362688568065-69</Id><Topic><Title>What is nvidia Up To With This?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362685199304</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 14:39:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I did not know they got royalties on it.

Generally thought Presentation was of excellent and took on several of the questions overhanging Nvidia's PPS head on. It did come through loud and clear the recommend for investors to listen to the GTC keynote address and financial presentation March 19th. New product introductions would be highlighted. This was spoken right after Nvidia Grid and Project Shield was spoken about. May just be the normal months long Nvidia marketing hype up to introduction, but perhaps not. I also thought it was very telling that the Wedbush analyst characterized Project Shield as a hit with gamers but not with the financial analysts. Thought this was very true and impossible to change that opinion until more details about the product are released. My own personal opinion is Project Shield will be accretive to revenue and profits with the only question being by how much but it would behove Nvidia to announce the pricing and start taking pre-orders as soon as possible. One feature I would love to see is something very old school but quite lucrative...i.e. make Project Shield upgradeable like Gaming PC's are with the ability to swap out the CPU/GPU when each new Tegra edition comes out. A swappable motherboard...pull out the Tegra 4 module and replace with the new Tegra 5 module keeping your controller and screen as is or heck just buy a whole new Project Shield. Pay X for this years model and Pay X minus for next years Tegra module and plug in to your old Project Shield. Won't happen but just thought it would be a huge money maker for the company.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362699750018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 18:42:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362700411439-90</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362699750018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 18:42:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With the rate of improvement in displays, I don't see the advantage in upgrading the CPU/GPU only.

Hard-core gamers who want a new processor will want a new LCD by next year anyway." Perhaps you are right panacro. But I do like the idea of upgrading like you can with discrete GPUs in PCs. But if Nvidia selects Gamestop as their primary distributor then an individual can essentially do the same. Gamestop buys the Tegra 4 Project Shield for $129 and sells you the Tegra 5 for $299. Same difference as an upgrade kit for $129. I like it...sort of like the use car market. They have value and why fill up the landfills and pollute the earth when you don't have to..OK I spent some years in California and a little bit of green rubbed off me.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362704051103</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 19:54:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362704446603-93</Id><Title>How to stream games to 77 million ps3 owners</Title><Msg>GRID...

I work in the financial industry in Denmark as internal IT developer. Physx and Apex are two awesome technologies and clearly Sony and Nvidia have an ongoing relationship. Perhabs the action is the best strategy for gamers and business relationships / not necessarily near term income. Having PS4 using Physx and Apex underscores Nvidias dominance and enables Nvidia to maintain their feature and performance edge when using Geforce. On another note / the other day Nvidia demoed a ported PS3 game to Android that also used Physx if my memory serves me correct. Perhabs it also makes it easier to port between platforms. There is some speculation about using the old PS3s in cloud gaming for providing backwards compability to PS4. Reusing unsold stock on one hand sounds smart but I do not think they have the necessary compute density to make it energy efficient like Nvidias custom Grid server platform. Therefore I believe Nvidia Grid still has some chance in Sony's Gaikai solution. We will see.

Nvidia Corp. on Tuesday extended the licensing agreement with Sony over licensing of physX software originally developed by Ageia and licensed to Sony about four years ago (not free). Under the terms of the new agreement, Nvidia’s PhysX SDK will be available to registered PlayStation 3 platform video game creators for free download and use on the SCEI Developer Network. PS3 users have been receiving free downloads and will continue to do so. 2. Nvidia Corp. on Thursday announced support for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 4 with the popular Nvidia PhysX and Nvidia APEX software development kits (SDKs). (Most probably not free) Similarly, future PS4 gamers would likely have access to free downloads. It's interesting that in NVIDIA's announcement, it says, "The PhysX technology source code SDKs for PS3 and all major gaming platforms are available for license directly from Nvidia."</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362707359152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 20:49:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362707470209-101</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362699750018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 18:42:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also if the price is somewhat near 300 dollars then the device is easier to just accummulate.
