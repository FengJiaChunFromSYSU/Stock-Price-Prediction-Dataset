Others fit in your driveway. Volkswagen just launched its latest Golf – the world’s third best-selling car – at the Paris Auto show. Available this fall, it’s longer, lower and wider than the old model. Along with a more spacious interior and more efficient engine, it features a new infotainment system powered by an NVIDIA Tegra mobile processor. NVIDIA’s processors power the Golf’s touch screen display. The big trend here: automakers want infotainment systems that have the performance and features that customers experience in their phones and tablets, but are safely integrated into the vehicle. Given the longer development cycles of a car, the trick is that the system needs to be easily upgraded to match the frenetic pace of innovation in the consumer electronics industry. So that meant the Volkswagen Group turned to NVIDIA. In addition to the Golf, Tegra has already been built into the Audi A3 and will arrive in the Skoda Octavia soon. Like today’s smartphones, the Golf’s new navigation system will offer real-time Google navigation , and, of course, rich interactive graphics. It’s all served up through a touch screen. In addition to a Tegra system-on-a-chip, the Golf’s new infotainment system can include a telephone module, tuner modules, a six-channel high-performance amplifier, and a DVD drive. NVIDIA’s products can be found in a wide range of cars, including the Tesla Model S, the Audi A7, and Lamborghini Aventador.

Nvidia's Kerpler architecture brought with it a number of advances in GPGPU with the firm touting the ability to 'vary the parallelism' depending on workload characteristics. Now the firm has released CUDA 5 to support such features, including GPU Direct and the Nsight Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Nvidia's CUDA 5 programming language will be of particular interest for those developing applications that run on Kepler GPGPUs, with the firm claiming the code changes required to make use of Kepler's dynamic parallelism features are minimal. The firm also introduced the ability to directly access libraries from object code. However Nvidia's biggest new feature in CUDA 5 is GPU Direct, which allows CUDA applications to access memory on other GPUs using the PCI-Express bus and the network card. According to Nvidia, the technology for accessing the memory of other GPUs through the PCI-Express bus can be used to lower the latency of memory accesses rather than increase the local memory available to CUDA applications. The Achilles' heel of GPGPU accelerators is their relatively small amount of local memory. When working with large datasets that can span tens of gigabytes the card has to request data from main memory, resulting in a significant bottleneck as the GPU waits to be fed data. Nvidia also announced its Nsight Eclipse IDE that not only includes CUDA syntax highlighting but also a debugger and a code profiler that the firm claims can identify performance issues with code. The firm said that its Nsight IDE is available for Linux and Mac OS X. While Nvidia is making CUDA the programming language of choice for those that use Kepler GPGPUs the wider market is moving towards OpenCL, a language that Nvidia does support but clearly not in the same way as its own proprietary CUDA language. Even though Nvidia's CUDA language is popular with researchers, it might find that some of these CUDA-only features will also have to be made available to OpenCL should it want to see continued growth.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1350310442399</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 10:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350311258985-17</Id><Title>Longs are always wrong</Title><Msg>Hey, the idiot pumpers here still trying to convince the masses this POS stock is going to 20?

See the Q2 conference call transcripts. The 5M incremental unit estimate from the Surface RT and Nexus 7 comes from what analysts have reported based on their supposed supply chain sources. Estimates I've read report ~2M Surface RT tabs produced during Q3, and ~3M Nexus 7s. There are a number of other Tegra 3 products coming to market or already in the market, but these two seem to be by far the biggest devices in terms of volume. If the reported $21 ASP for Tegra 3 is accurate, an incremental 5M units would add $105M to the Consumer Products Division over last quarter. It could easily be less units at a lower ASP, but it seems as Tegra is definitely expected to drive some of the top-line expansion.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1350320951014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 13:09:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350322453251-33</Id><Title>Reversal Coming</Title><Msg>Doji on Friday.

Yes, the cunningly brilliant chaps from ARM Holdings of Cambridge England have come up with a scheme to put a chink in the side of their archrival -- the Microsoft/Intel juggernaut. Propose to make a fake $12 buck offer for nvidia. Yes boys, a fake offer. Now, ARM Holdings has no or particular use, want or need for nvidia. Oh no no no. nvidia is just another one of ARM’s 723 licensees that politely mails them their check on the 15th of every month. But ARM knows that if they make a fake offer for nvidia, that Microsoft will Think that ARM knows something that they don’t. Which isn’t too difficult, what with Microsoft being a bunch of software guys with way too much cash that know nada about hardware and this and that. So ARM Holdings makes a fake $12 buck offer for all of nvidia. Catching Microsoft totally off guard. ‘Cause why would Anyone want to buy the last remaining graphics company that sells 80% of their GPU's to the – gasp! – PC industry? But the guys from Microsoft figure ARM Holdings knows something that they don't. And uses their Last Rite of Refusal to Match the $12 buck offer from ARM. Causing Microsoft to pizz away $7.4 Billion Dollars of their corpulent cash hoard for struggling nvidia. Making hapless pawn nvidia a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Microsoft. And the Cunningly Brilliant chaps from ARM Holdings Laugh! Oh my, how they LAUGH! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! “If we can’t beat the Windows/Intel x86 technology, we can sure lighten their cash hoard a bit.” Jolly good tomfoolery, chaps!
