Ashraf You shouldn't waste your time on worrying about Ibexx. He is an option player by his own volition. Much like you he is a quite an active trader. Sometime long, sometime short....utilizing options. Plus he trades options in amounts that would put most to sham!!!!. His public face is always bullish...but notice how quiet he becomes when option expiration is nearing except when Krimax or Mslans shows up. Nothing wrong about trading in any form and nothing wrong with making money. More power to him! Tolerance is a virtue......even on a Yahoo message board.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1365236218993</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 04:16:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365258101284-3</Id><Topic><Title>Can't resist!</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1365012591938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excellent timing, sir!</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365258101284</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 10:21:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365262082316-4</Id><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Msg>In the past weeks Intel had to face a lot of negative coverage for their upcoming Haswell processor which is due for introduction later this year and to be branded as 4th generation Core processor. One of the unofficial claims was that there was a serious bug with the accompanying Lynx Point „8 series / C220“ chipset that causes USB devices to disappear after the computer transitioned into standby mode (specifically S3). Now Intel steps in and – albeit quietly – confirms the chipset issues. In a Product Change Notification (PCN) they announce a stepping conversion from C1 to C2 which is going to fix this bug. Intel had to change metal layers to remedy the „USB SuperSpeed device remuneration erratum“. Other characteristics of the chipset are not changed. Intel recommends not to run the full suite of electronical regression tests but only a subset focussing on the USB 3.0 issue. The document lists the following chipsets that get a replacement with the new stepping: Q87, Q85, H87, Z87, B85 (desktop chipsets), C222, C224, C226 (workstation/server chipsets), QM87, HM87, HM86 (mobile chipsets). According to the PCN the new stepping will be sampled to customers starting April 19th. Final product will be available starting July 15th. Intel also makes clear that customers must be ready to receive the new stepping by July 31st. In other words, this means by then the old stepping will be phased out and gradually replaced by the new one. Due to the minor change needed to fix the problem, Intel doesn't expect a major impact on customers. The new stepping is basically a drop in replacement. While an official release date for Haswell hasn't been given yet, Intel is expected to introduce the new chip before the availability of the new chipset stepping. Reportedly Intel let customers sign an agreement to acknowledge the presence of the bug if they wanted to obtain Haswell APUs for launch. The bug in question causes nuisances like USB devices to disappear after entering standby. Detachable devices would have to be reconnected to be found again. We don't know whether the company is able to provide a workaround for affected chipsets. Based on the description only SuperSpeed (USB 3.0 that is) ports are affected, which means that using the slower USB 2.0 ports would be one way to circumvent the problem. On desktop boards manufacturers could use 3rd party chips which would increase the BOM slightly but would not be hampered by this issue. Given the additional power such a companion chip consumes as well as the space needed on the PCB such a measure is less likely on notebooks and particularly Ultrabooks where space is very precious. This is not the first chipset issue at Intel in recent history. In 2011 their Cougar Point „6 series“ chipset accompanying Sandy Bridge had a flaw in the Serial ATA controller that caused ports to degrade and subsequently fail over time. Back then the issue was only caught after affected mainboard went on sale. Rectifying the mistake set Intel back by a cool $1 billion.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365268520087-5</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>technical core competence is not only not easy to get, but just as hard to maintain. If you are not constantly in the market for those chips, starting from scratch is definitely not easy. That comes to ARM integration solutions: it is very hard for anybody to build ARM integrated solutions. Linking the ARM cores together with the GPU is the easy part. If you don't have core competence in 'cheap' radios, ala you are not already in the market selling those cheap radios, it is very hard to just hire the design engineers and build them from scratch. Add to that the radios are moving targets with the ever evolving standards. This is true for nvda or aapl or samsung or intel or mediatech or rockchip or anybody. That is why intel paid $1.2B for a radio, qcom paid $3.1B for wifi/athero, samsung bought a small wifi guy, nvda buying Icera etc. etc. As of now, there are only two companies with the complete set of radios to do a fully integrated solution.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1365268520087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365269244436-6</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>whosunw, Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom...?</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365269244436</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365271625614-7</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf, just fyi, whosunw former broadcomm employee... just so you understand who you are talking to... and the bias but NO understanding, at all, of what's underneath the hood...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365271625614</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 14:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365273602579-8</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, I see...</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365273602579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 14:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365273663757-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Confirms Haswell Chipset Bug</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365262082316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice compliments to NVDA: "technical core competence is not only not easy to get, but just as hard to maintain."

However, this was the second Friday in a row where the stock had over 5mm shares in The Final Hour (and virtually doubling the day's volume up to that point), and all to the upside. Whether it is shorts covering or smart money accumulating, there's no way to tell. We closed the week 1 cent below the 50DMA, with MUCH higher than average volume, and unless the markets collapse this coming week, I think we'll reclaim the 200DMA, which is now around 12.73. I do believe that the next time we approach 13, we will power through that level, then 13 1/8, and then, IF the volume gets to 15-20mm shares, the stock "should" explode to the upside. And, I think there's virtually NO resistance from that level to at least 15, and IF we get through 15, 20-25 would be the target. I think I've suggested that this set up is remarkably simliar to the one in early 2011, and IF that's the case, one or two pieces of "news" will be the catalyst. And, of course, if QCOM makes a move at AMD (which really IS AMD's ONLY chance), then all the barriers to someone coming after NVDA fall to the wayside. Now, I do NOT want to see NVDA taken over, UNLESS it were INTC buying in order to get Jen Hsun to become the CEO of the combined company. (And, I doubt he'd agree to a price below at least 25.) He would NOT leave NVDA to be the CEO of INTC, since NVDA is HIS "baby" and I'm sure he believes it has a much brighter future than INTC does, other than if they were to join forces. If they did that...well...good luck to ANYONE else, including QCOM, AAPL or even Samsung to compete with them. To sum up, I have a very strong feeling that something IS "in the wind" and it is coming soon. What it is, I can't be sure. Whether it's the next Kindle or something bigger; the previous run at 13 and these last 2 Fridays' huge volume in The Final Hour, and the action in some of the options are telling ME to be ready for a MAJOR move higher. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

' No-one is going to pay double the current stock price for this company, think more like $15. 'and I'm sure he believes it has a much brighter future than INTC does' not in the real world. If Intel were take over this company it would be purely to remove it as competition. Huang would quite easily sell you guys out as a) Intel would pay cash for Nvidia which means all his shares are instantly monetized b) he would get a much bigger salary at Intel c) his ego couldn't resist running the great Intel. No-one at Intel really believes Huang is a great CEO but they could put up with him for a few years if it means less competition going forward.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1365293843610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 20:17:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365300575537-12</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia's buyback is working</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365195078539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:51:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ugs, jazigurl28 is just a troll from the MJNA.PK boards - she's #$%$ that I'm telling people to stay away from that pump &amp; dump scam.
