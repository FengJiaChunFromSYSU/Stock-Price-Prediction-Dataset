The system-on-a-chip made its way into a cornucopia of tablets, including Google's Nexus 7 and Microsoft's Surface for Windows RT. What of the Tegra 4? So far, it seems, the new SoC may not be living up to its predecessor's legacy. A story by DigiTimes says that Tegra 4 shipments are "limited" despite high-profile design wins from Asus, HP, and Toshiba. The site's sources claim the "high price" of the Tegra 4 is driving hardware makers toward more affordable silicon from MediaTek and Chinese chip companies. Those same sources also believe that Nvidia "may need to wait until the release of its next-generation Tegra 4i processor with integrated 4G LTE support to turn the tables." The Tegra 4 was unveiled just before the Consumer Electronics Show in January. It has six times the graphics horsepower of the Tegra 3, and its quad ARM Cortex-A15 cores give it a substantial amount of CPU grunt, as well. The Tegra 4i is less powerful, with Cortex-A9 CPU cores and fewer graphics ALUs, but it adds an on-die LTE modem. As far as I'm aware, Tegra 4-powered devices haven't hit stores yet. DigiTimes mentions that a convertible HP offering, the $499 SlateBook x2, is due out in August. Nvidia's own Tegra 4-toting Shield handheld was supposed to debut on June 27, but it's been postponed until some time this month. As for the Tegra 4i, Nvidia said a couple of months back that certification of that chip was "on the way." Since not even the Nvidia Shield is out yet, it may be a little premature to gauge the Tegra 4's success—or the Tegra 4i's chances. Hardware makers order chips well ahead of product launches, of course, but it's still early days, and Nvidia may have time to score more design wins ahead of the holiday season." source: techreport</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373343311354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 00:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373349067174-2</Id><Title>What happened to that j7k8 dude and that Getanid pest.

The company’s 320.18 WHQL display driver has been responsible for damaged and even destroyed graphics cards in a small number of cases, according to user reports. The driver was released earlier this year on May 23. A day later, one user reported that his system failed to boot unless he removed his GPU. Two days later, another reported a BSOD, and found that reverting back to 314.22 still left them with unreadable text and horizontal lines across their screen. A log of the driver’s first few days has been handily collated over at ModCrash. Although the driver has since been superceded, the official feedback thread has seen users complain of “toasted” graphics cards as recently as last Monday. Others have pointed out less lethal but nonetheless notable issues with the update. Here’s a Battlefield 3 player attempting to fly a plane while under the influence of 320.18: You’re apparently safe if you’re using the more recent, certified 320.49 driver, which came out of beta last week. But our Nick notes that he had the offending driver installed for the best part of a month, so we thought we’d better warn you lot too. Let us know if you’re among the unlucky few affected, won’t you?" source: pcgamesn</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373380772245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 10:39:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373381207503-13</Id><Topic><Title>"Report: Tegra 4 shipments are unimpressive"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373343311354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 00:15:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"As far as I'm aware, Tegra 4-powered devices haven't hit stores yet." ...
