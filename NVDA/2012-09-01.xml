Individual stocks are then ranked according to how much they deviate from the macro Market (for simplicity purposes, the S&amp;P 500 stock index). Born out of linear regression analysis, an individual stock's return in a specific period is linked to a regression analysis of the returns of the Market.(such as a stock index). A stock with a beta of 1.87 has returns that change, on average, by 1.87 the magnitude of the overall Market's returns. So when the Market's return falls by (-3.00%), the stock's return will be expected to fall by (- 5.61%) on average. Higher-beta stocks -- like nvda -- naturally tend to be more volatile -- and therefore riskier. . My question for Best relates to beta and the CEO chopping his own guidance. Let's assume that the stock has a Beta (β) of 1.87 and the CEO chops his unattainable guidance by (-10%). Does the Beta (β) multiplier apply? So the (-10%) reduction in guidance results in an expected decline in the stock price of (-18.7%). Which for nvda would be about $11.40, right? . . .</Msg><Username>fumbe.bapoto</Username><Timestamp>1346541947840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 19:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346543337398-36</Id><Topic><Title>Sept. 12th: New iPad Mini and iPhone 5</Title><Username>seeking.best</Username><Timestamp>1344143588000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 01:13:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>. . Fumbe, While the stock could plunge 18.7% in reaction to the CEO chopping his previous bad guidance by 10% -- it might not necessarily be due to the stock's beta. Rather it might be due to the fact that the CEO has worn the same black polo shirt and jeans to every PR event for like the past 15 years now. And the Market -- she is tired of it.

Hi Best! . Thanks for posting that late-breaking iNews. Remember how last week the paid nvda pumper crew was pretending that Apple's iVictory over Samsung didn't matter -- and didn't effect nvidia? Guess that all changes, right? With the Samsung Captivate Glide being included on the NEW list of 21 patent-infringing devices. That's the same Samsung Captivate Glide phone that uses nvidia Tegra 2 parts, right? It sure is. Check it out for yourself. Google this: "Tegra Super Phones - NVIDIA" . My my my.
