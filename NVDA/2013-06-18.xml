SOURCE: WSJ "Its shift is not a surprise. AMD, whose minority share has withered in so-called x86 server chips that Intel also sells, has since early 2012 been signaling plans to augment that product line. Nor will AMD be the first to field an ARM chip for servers. Rival Applied Micro Circuits AMCC +4.11% in April said it is shipping sample quantities of what it calls a “server on a chip” called X-Gene. AMD does not expect to deliver samples of Seattle until the first quarter of 2014, with commercial quantities arriving in the second half of that year.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371533438447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 01:30:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371534902446-2</Id><Topic><Title>AMD to reveal its first ARM based chip, the "Seattle" on Tuesday</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371533438447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 01:30:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>28nm Cortex A57.

Seattle "Seattle" will be the industry's only 64-bit ARM-based server SoC from a proven server processor supplier. "Seattle" is an 8- and then 16-core CPU based on the ARM Cortex-A57 core and is expected to run at or greater than 2 GHz. The "Seattle" processor is expected to offer 2-4X the performance of AMD's recently announced AMD Opteron X-Series processor with significant improvement in compute-per-watt. It will deliver 128GB DRAM support, extensive offload engines for better power efficiency and reduced CPU loading, server caliber encryption, and compression and legacy networking including integrated 10GbE. It will be the first processor from AMD to integrate AMD's advanced Freedom™ Fabric for dense compute systems directly onto the chip. AMD plans to sample "Seattle" in the first quarter of 2014 with production in the second half of the year. Berlin "Berlin" is an x86-based processor that will be available both as a CPU and APU. The processor boasts four next-generation "Steamroller" cores and will offer almost 8X the gigaflops per-watt compared to current AMD Opteron™ 6386SE processor. It will be the first server APU built on AMD's revolutionary Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA), which enables uniform memory access for the CPU and GPU and makes programming as easy as C++. "Berlin" will offer extraordinary compute per-watt that enables massive rack density. It is expected to be available in the first half of 2014. ..." source: marketwire</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371552371950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 06:46:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371553187208-5</Id><Topic><Title>"Why Qualcomm is likely to power Microsoft’s next Surface RT"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370440505260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 09:55:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quaulcomm Kicked Nvidia OUT of the Next Nexus 7 and it looks like the Surface RT is next.

Then again, I had the impression that AMD was throwing things at the wall to see what might stick late last year when they announced their ARM servers. Given their financial situation at that time, I can't say I blame them. I am not sure there is a living to be made strictly based on low-end PC chips and consoles; they need ideas. Of course, it depends on pricing. If INTC wants fat margins, they may leave a sliver of room for lower margin competition to exist.

Back in early 2011 the stock broke out and first the 146 WMA (weekly moving average) became support followed by the 358 WMA and then finally the 310 WMA. Then the stock crashed 6 months later and the latter two became resistance while the 146 WMA oscillated over the following years between resistance and support and is now support at 14.37 and arcing up. The 310 WMA is now 15.48 and arcing down. I don't know which will prove stronger when these two meet but they will meet in 6-9 months and the stock will either go up or down whichever proves stronger. The 358 WMA at 16.35 is the highest MA resistance and is gently dropping, eventually overcome that and early 2011 stock prices are possible again. All the stock indicators say there is more buying than selling but if you have dropping MAs that does not always show up in price rises as Asks are lowered under that situation.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371582524939</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 15:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371582580491-57</Id><Topic><Title>Have we consolidated in the $14s long enough?</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1371566013530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 10:33:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>stockchartsdotcom/c-sc/sc?s=NVDA&amp;p=W&amp;b=5&amp;g=0&amp;i=t21667470963&amp;r=1371582556064</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1371582580491</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 15:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371582941665-58</Id><Title>NVIDIA stretching CUDA coding to ARM chips</Title><Msg>Hot from ISC 2013 Nvidia's new CUDA 5.5 release aims to overcome the inherent mathematical suckiness of the ARM architecture by unleashing the powers of GPUs working in conjunction with those popular low-power chips – and not just ones from Nvidia. Nvidia is working on its own implementation of a 64-bit ARM processor, code-named Project Denver, and is keen on porting its CUDA parallel programming environment to it. But if Nvidia wants to sell a lot of Tesla coprocessor cards to do the number crunching for modestly powered ARM chips, it needs to make CUDA available not just on its own future ARM processors, but on any and all ARM-based server chips. And that is precisely what Nvidia is doing with its CUDA 5.5 tool, which was announced at the International Super Computing conference in Leipzig, Germany. "We can't just support an Nvidia ARM platform," explains Sumit Gupta, general manager of the Tesla Accelerated Computing business unit at the company. "There are ARM CPUs coming into the enterprise market, and by next year there will be a whole bunch of them, and we want to connect GPUs to all of them. This will open up CUDA to more customers." And help Nvidia sell more Tesla coprocessors. Perhaps a lot more.....

Its DX11, OpenGL 4.3, and GPGPU capabilities, along with vastly superior performance and efficiency, create a new class of licensable GPU cores. Through our efforts designing Tegra into mobile devices, we’ve gained valuable experience designing for the smallest power envelopes. As a result, Kepler can operate in a half-watt power envelope, making it scalable from smartphones to supercomputers. Kepler is the basis for currently shipping GeForce, Quadro and Tesla GPUs, as well as our next-generation Tegra mobile processor codenamed Logan. Licensees will receive all necessary designs, collateral and support to integrate NVIDIA’s powerful graphics cores into their devices. We’ll also offer licensing rights to our visual computing portfolio. This will enable licensees to develop their own GPU functionality while enjoying design freedom under the best visual computing patent portfolio in the world. This opportunity simply didn’t exist several years ago because there was really just one computing device – the PC. But the swirling universe of new computing devices provides new opportunities to license our GPU core or visual computing portfolio.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371593580552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 18:13:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371594274242-85</Id><Topic><Title>Wheels falling off the Nvidia bus, Nexus 7 QCOM, Surface RT QCOM, GPU IP for Sale</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371592989292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 18:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The market VOETED on Nvidia's Everything Must Go Plan AMD UP, QCOM UP, INTC UP, and the Next Nexus 7 and Surface RT 2 vendors GOOG and MSFT were UP The only one competing with Nvidia that was DOWN today was Nvidia.

I have often said that their graphic are the main differentiator for the mobile chips, which his a lean proposition since the rest of it is just an ARM copy with some thoughtful arrangement and interconnection. A gross simplification, I realize, but still more true than false, IMO. So, with this approach, they sell what they are good at and let the customer bypass them for the part that they just pass through to someone else, anyway (the ARM core and the fab work). Clever, although I hope it isn't a reflection of limited traction for Tegra products so much as a way to open far more doors. You could certainly look at it either way. Imagination Technology has something like 1/10 their market cap, which is also a comparison that you could read several ways.</Msg><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1371594396435</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 18:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371594474930-87</Id><Topic><Title>Wheels falling off the Nvidia bus, Nexus 7 QCOM, Surface RT QCOM, GPU IP for Sale</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371592989292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 18:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oops, MSFT gave up 2 pennies late in the day.

At the same time, the decision would also create a potential opportunity for Nvidia to be able to market GPU technology to companies like Apple or Samsung, which prefer to design chips that now compete with Nvidia’s own ARM-based Tegra microprocessor but rely on others for graphics. “I can see them licensing to their ‘frenemies’ like Apple and even Samsung,” says Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. “This unlocks a lot of the potential and business they left on the table.” It also raises the question of whether Nvidia would be willing to license technology to direct competitors, like Advanced Micro Devices AMD +0.99%.

Tegra is two markets: Tablet (Android and RT) and Smartphone (android). Tablet is doing fine with multiple new design wins announced. Smartphone needs LTE (a long qualification), so we need to see Q1-14 before we know for sure if T4i is not getting traction. T4i may or may not ship in the US, but it will certainly ship in very large Asian markets.</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1371603862551</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 21:04:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371604169674-106</Id><Title>You know Nvidia had its REAR KICKED when Nvidia fans actt like #$%$</Title><Msg>IMHO of course</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371604169674</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 21:09:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371604264112-107</Id><Topic><Title>Wheels falling off the Nvidia bus, Nexus 7 QCOM, Surface RT QCOM, GPU IP for Sale</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371592989292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 18:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What did the market think of Nvidia's BS plan? lol DOWN how much today?

As one NV exec said that the potential new licensees - which, collectively, could represent a big piece of the market - would come from new markets such as TV and medical devices. THose guys would custom-fit the cpu and gpu ratio to suit their needs. THis is also the fundamental problem with AMD's APUs where the range of combo options are rather narrow. There is no way NV would develop special situation SoCs for the markets of TV and medical devices. These are just 2 examples.</Msg><Username>apollinaire123</Username><Timestamp>1371611725706</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 23:15:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371612300907-114</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg comments on next-gen Surface RT tablet</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371590541101</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:22:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's weird that this is getting so much press to me. I recall that MS always intended to include Qualcomm's Snapdragon in versions of the first Surface RTs, but they were cancelled for whatever reason. Now they are back in some versions after not executing the first run . . why is that significant? Sounds like MS is trying to stick to some part of the original plan that didn't go so well the first time, and including Qualcomm really isn't anything new. Nvidia is still keeping a clear foothold in MS's plans which isn't necessarily that great given the first iteration's reception.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1371612300907</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 23:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371613364507-115</Id><Title>Put NVDA for sale is better than lincensing for investors</Title><Msg>that have been stuck since Tegra I was hyped.
