Until Intel new CEO clearly articulate the company's new identity and vision, the stock INTC will only make small gains at best, assuming Haswell, Iris Pro, and clovertrail/baytrail etc all perform well in sales. The investment community needs to see the forest, not only the tress. Andy Grove rescued Intel from the Dram crisis in the mid-1080s, and gave Intel a clear new identify of becoming the world's greatest microprocessor designer. Intel has reaped huge benefits from Grove's repositioning for over 25 years, and now it is clearly no longer working in the post-PC era. What will Intel's new identify be? Can it compete effectively not as the top dog, but as a distant third in the mobile space? Can it succeed in its future initiatives without being a de facto monopolist? How quickly can Intel's senior management, engineers, as well as marketers adjust to the new mindset? Until some indications of answers are demonstrated, many (not all) investors will continue to see risks investing in this stock. The two new strategic directions mostly frequently mentioned - mobile and manufacturing - are all inherently associated with lower GM than what INTC was traditionally accustomed to - fairly or unfairly.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370240623954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 02:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370241737652-3</Id><Title>Anandtech reviews Iris Pro, concluding that "nVIDIA is fairly safe"</Title><Msg>A very extensive review. Below are concluding remarks: "Final Words For the past few years Intel has been threatening to make discrete GPUs obsolete with its march towards higher performing integrated GPUs. Given what we know about Iris Pro today, I'd say NVIDIA is fairly safe. The highest performing implementation of NVIDIA's GeForce GT 650M remains appreciably quicker than Iris Pro 5200 on average. Intel does catch up in some areas, but that's by no means the norm. NVIDIA's recently announced GT 750M should increase the margin a bit as well. Haswell doesn't pose any imminent threat to NVIDIA's position in traditional gaming notebooks. OpenCL performance is excellent, which is surprising given how little public attention Intel has given to the standard from a GPU perspective. ...... anandtechDOTcom/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested/20</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370241737652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 02:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370241911017-4</Id><Topic><Title>Anandtech reviews Iris Pro, concluding that "nVIDIA is fairly safe"</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370241737652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 02:42:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For gaming, absolutely - there's really no way that I would have expected Iris Pro to displace dGPUs for gamers.

Following your logic AMD is DOA" Now I know you can't read. First, I said Tegra 4 is DOA NOT Nvidia is DOA. How many times do you need to read something before in sinks in? Second, AMD announced Jaguar APU parts were shipping for revenue in April and launched the product in May. Nvidia has NOT launched a Tegra 4 part to date so no OEM can sell Tegra 4 parts before Nvidia launches Tegra 4 parts. Third, After AMD announced Jaguar APU SoC parts were shipping for revenue (sold) and launched they allowed Sony and Microsoft to announce major products based on Jaguar cores. So for the logically slow, Nvidia has to first launch a product or all you are doing is wishing they would launch a product so OEMs can sell something with Tegra 4 inside. AMD launched Jaguar, OEMs and ODMs announced products using Jaguar and products are for sale today. Try and keep up, can you but a Tegra 4 product today? If you can't buy a Tegra 4 product today its BS, especially since Nvidia has not launched Tegra 4. I can buy a Jaguar product today as can all the sites benchmarking Jaguar systems.

Could it be destined for a future Surface tablet? That's not clear yet but Qualcomm hints at future RT products with its silicon. "Qualcomm continues to build on its relationship with Microsoft by helping to launch and optimize the newest build of Windows for Snapdragon, Windows 8.1 RT," the chip supplier said. The statement continued. "The next processor to be featured in upcoming Windows 8.1 RT computers will be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800." Meet the Snapdragon 800: Bound for Windows 8.1 RT tablets Quad-core: Supports up to four cores, 2.2GHz per core. USB 3.0: USB 3.0 is coming to more RT devices. 4G/LTE: 3G/4G/LTE is integrated, Qualcomm's strength is integration of 3G/4G into its silicon. Very-high-resolution displays: Supports up to 2,560x2,048 resolution. And Microsoft seems keen on the silicon. "We are excited [about]...the next iteration of Windows RT 8.1 [and] their new Snapdragon 800 processors," Mike Anguilo, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft, said in a statement. His statement also mentions the "numerous advantages of these new processors" including integrated 4G/LTE."
