"NVIDIA's Colorado-based team Abandoned the work on x86 instruction set architecture and pushed through with "reinventing" the Project Denver core..." . Jeepers Best, World-renowned semiconductor manufacturing expert Charlie Demerjian was 100% correct -- again. Charlie informed us OVER A YEAR AGO that "Project Denver" -- a lame and desperate attempt by Jen to copycat a Genuine Intel x86 processor -- would Never see the light of day. "Never" said Charlie, presciently, Check it out for yourself, boys. Google for Charlie Demerjian's Masterpiece: What is Project Denver based on? "SemiAccurate has it on very good authority that this [Project Denver] would not have succeeded, and based on what the sources showed us, the chip Never would have made it to market." -- Charlie Demerjian, Aug 5, 2011. . It is Absolutely Impossible to emulate the Intel x86 architectue without infringing on many of Intel's 5,000+ patents relating to the x86 processor. And since Jen failed -- and Failed Badly -- in his attempt to cross-license Intel's x86 patents, the end result of Jen's "Project Denver" folly was a massive waste of R&amp;D cash. .

The name that popped out many times on our recent trip to the US and as you could have guessed the main competitor for both Intel and Nvidia is now Qualcomm. Qualcomm has swept across the US smartphone market due to its dominance with LTE integrated SOC and Intel and Nvidia want a piece of that market. Right now AMD looks quite weak in its eternal fight against Intel and the Core architecture dominates the PC and especially notebook market, the fight goes down to tablets and phones. Intel wants to get into many Windows 8 and eventually Android tablets as well as phones. Qualcomm is in the way and it currently looks really strong in these markets. The key to success is LTE as well as low power chips and Intel is getting better and better in this market with each generation. It is finally starting to get important phone design wins, such as Motorola, and with Windows 8 we will see many tablets based on Intel Atom Clover Trail chips. Don’t forget the new category started by Asus that everyone now calls convertibles, which is basically an Asus transformer or – insert brand here — transformer, basically a convertible tablet or a tablet with a keyboard dock. We saw Dell and HP making these machines with Windows 8 that will hit the market in late October as soon as Windows 8 goes public. The big fight will be Intel versus the rest of the ARM market. Qualcomm and to some extent Nvidia are key targets and the showdown is about to start in roughly a month.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1348244560427</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348244865914-10</Id><Title>RBC Capital Downgraded NVIDIA To Sector Perform - Price Target $15.00 - Sept 18, 2012</Title><Msg>Apparently, the downgrade was based on EPS leverage on Tegra sales on tablets and spending cycle on R&amp;D with LTE.
