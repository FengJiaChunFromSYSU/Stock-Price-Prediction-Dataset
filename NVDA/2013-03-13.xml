All self respecting semi companies raise their dividend at least once a year. Note: when looking at payout ratios you have to look at cash flow and on earning use the Non-GAAP earnings not GAAP earnings. Note: QCOM, BRCM, MCHP,TXN, and almost on all others analysts report Non-Gaap earnings. For some reason they report GAAP earning estimates only on Nvidia. The difference is 5 or 6 cents per qtr. for Nvidia. Looked at in that context.

I'm pretty sure this is a FALSE breakdown in ARMH, but what do I know? As for NVDA....volume has already exceeded yesterday's 3:40PM volume. Those that are short the March 13s are sh##ing in their pants, and while they ARE working hard to keep the stock down, I think they have NO idea what's about to hit them...whether it be today, tomorrow AND/OR Friday. They've already tried a couple of times to take it back down and have WASTED a LOT of "ammo". Yet, I do expect we'll see another attempt to break it back below 12.85, maybe even 12.80, before the day is out, but I also expect at least a few more attempts to "break down that wall, Mr. Gorbachov" at 13. IF, and I mean IF, we get THROUGH 13, the big test will come right around 13 1/8, which is the high of the calendar year, and also the high for MANY months. A close OVER that level will give the stock a straight shot to 14, and possibly 15. ONE "headline" of substance, and those shorts are toast. They #$%$ u me" that there's NO way ANYONE will buy and take us through there, since they've been able to sell calls without consequence for SO long. The options have only traded about 2k, out of an OI of almost 48k, and the price hasn't exceeded a dime. They're willing to risk MILLIONS rather than cover, and THIS time, I think they'll get run over. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I wouldn't write off the future of ARM servers like Gelsinger did. Those who say NEVER are usually blessed with block heads. ""ARM based servers hold the promise of extremely low power and excellent performance per Watt ratios. It's theoretically possible to place an incredible number of servers into a single rack; there are already implementations with as many as 1000 ARM servers in one rack (48 server nodes in a 2U chassis).

You just get suckered by all the call writers. But back to the topic at hand. I did some more reading on ASR agreements and reread the 10K section pertaining to Nvidia's 4Q ASR with an investment bank. From Wikipedia: Accelerated share repurchase (ASR) refers to a method that publicly traded companies may use to buy back shares of its stock from the market. "The ASR method involves the company buying its shares from an investment bank (who in turn borrowed them from their clients), and paying cash to the investment bank while entering into a forward contract. The investment bank will then seek to purchase shares of the company from the market to return to its clients. At the end of the transaction, the company may receive even more shares than it initially received, which are then retired.[1] This method can be contrasted with a typical open market repurchase, where the company simply announces that it is repurchasing shares on the market, and then does so. A firm might choose the ASR method as a way of reducing the number of shares outstanding for a fixed cost, transferring the risk to the investment bank (which is now short the stock) for a negotiated premium. By purchasing the shares in this way, it immediately exchanges a fixed amount of money for shares of its stock. It is currently being theorized that such arrangements are used by management to manipulate earnings figures for incentive compensation and reporting reasons." So Nvidia gave the unnamed investment bank $100M on Nov. 29th or a few days before. Looks like the forward contract was for approx. 60 days. If they are doing the same this quarter, I suspect they started it right after Nvidia went ex div., because they will wan't the settlement date within the quarter. Note: The forward contract period can be as short as 30 days.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363210552512</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 17:35:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363211052453-61</Id><Topic><Title>screw this stock...</Title><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1363204336849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 15:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I haven't sold everything.

But in all sincerity Nvidia has never included a financial presentation at GTC. Don't you think that is just a little strange? Plus the Investor of Relations went around the country to 3 different investor conferences in the last 4 weeks saying that Jensen would present a financial plan at GTC and be sure and watch. It's a big deal IMHO. Other semis lay out their yearly plans in $ and cents, sure looks like Nvidia will. And who ever thought Nvidia would initiate a dividend and stock buyback but they did!

However, in contrast to the other two spikes to 13, last week, the stock spent a GOOD part of the day at 12.89-90...just look at the chart to the right of this board. And, I was also stunned to see that almost NO March 13 calls traded after I posted around 1:30PM! NONE! So, the OI probably remains at 45-50k calls, and we'll know in the morning. Now, some of you may have seen the SPIKE in BBRY, around 3:20, and the volume went from 35mm shares to 57mm shares in 20 minutes!!! And, the next 20 minutes took it to 82mm shares. The stock jumped 8.15% and then another 2.62% in the after market. It took ONE headline to get this to happen and that IS what's going to happen in NVDA, with all deference to Frank, Mslans, and several others that are ready to give up. It may have to wait until next week...so be it. I'll lose a little on the March 13s that I bought, but my stock position is significant and that's what really matters. That said, I WOULD like to see these options "snakes" get RUN OVER, just once, so that the game of selling calls "with impunity" will finally end. I'm JUST as frustrated as any of you, but please don't give up. Everything is "aligned" for the stock to do what BBRY and others have recently done, and even though those snakes survived another day, they have TWO days to go, and you can bet your last nickel that they were VERY nervous, this morning, given the spike that I was looking for and the surge in volume. They threw over 4mm shares at the stock in the last hour, and walked it back down. Who has the deeper pockets, the Bulls or the Bears? With NVDA likely putting a "floor" under the stock, and John's probably right about another ASR or larger buyback, it depends on what the Big PMs at Fidelity, Paul Tudor Jones and others decide to do. I'm SURE THEIR pockets are deeper .

The 1.9GHz Cortex-A15-based device is on track to ship in 2Q13. The company also announced its first smartphone customer, ZTE, which will build a phone using Tegra 4 along with Nvidia’s i500 LTE cellular modem. The unnamed ZTE handset is set to launch in mid-2013 in China. When Nvidia originally announced Tegra 4, it provided little performance data, but it did demonstrate working silicon. At MWC, the company continued its product revelation by disclosing new details of the architecture and its capabilities (as well as limitations). Judging from this preliminary information, Tegra 4 rates as the highest-performing mobile ARM processor—if power constraints don’t throttle the cores. This performance takes aim at Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon processors; Nvidia offered a wide range of benchmark results that clearly showed Tegra 4 leading both the APQ8064 and (judging from our estimates) the forthcoming Snapdragon 800. Despite Tegra 4’s more powerful Cortex-A15 CPUs and much improved graphics unit, Nvidia claims the chip will increase battery life under normal user workloads compared with Tegra 3. Power efficiency improves through the use of 28nm HPL transistors, which reduce static leakage, and because the more powerful A15 core can process typical workloads at a lower clock frequency and core voltage (reducing active power). On the lab bench, Nvidia’s Cortex-A15 CPU core clearly outperforms Qualcomm’s Krait CPU. Few mobile products, however, have the thermal capacity to run all four Tegra 4 CPUs at their maximum speed, even for short periods. Thus, Tegra 4 systems will not match Nvidia’s quoted performance. But until we see actual products, we don’t know how big the shortfall will be.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363230267771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 23:04:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363230381896-90</Id><Topic><Title>Linley on Mobile Tegra 4 Outperforms Snapdragon</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1363230267771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 23:04:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!

I for one see no reason why growth and income cannot be combined as many of the stellar stocks have performed in the last 3 years. I suspect based on Nvidia's recent actions that they agree with me...i.e. initiating a dividend and starting a share buyback. In no way can anyone imply that this impacts any future growth when cash represents 45% of market capitalization along with $700M in annual cash flow. Initial results of this change has been an increase of institutional ownership to a multi-year high, a reduction in Beta-but still too high, and slight but distinct change in the quality of stock ownership. Too me the recent change by Nvidia to share holder friendly actions is a win-win for the company and those that view Nvidia as an investment rather than a quick hit on some particular weekly options. Certainly the company does not wish their stock to be a plaything of traders. But with all of that said I'm sure you want the stock price to go up as I do so best wishes to you.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363233394833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 23:56:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
