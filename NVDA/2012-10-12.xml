Since it focuses on some niche parts of the PC industry like gaming computers, it has enjoyed higher profit margins when compared to other more "generic" chipmakers. However, that might not be enough to keep the stock elevated in a declining macro environment for the PC industry and the global economy in general. Multiple signs are adding up fast and pointing to a worse than expected slowdown in PC sales. Furthermore, the industry might not get relief from the highly anticipated launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system, since some recent reports say it has glitches. While NVIDIA shares have been faring better than some chipmakers in recent days, it seems like that the stock could be poised to breakdown and hit new 52-week lows in the coming days and weeks. Here are 4 reasons why NVIDIA shares could be heading lower soon: 1. NVIDIA already saw a slowdown in earnings last quarter as it reported earnings of $119 million, or 19 cents a share, which was down from earnings of $151.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Based on recent revenue and profit warnings from some top chip makers, it appears that revenues could be poised to head even lower. 2. Intel (INTC) recently warned that Q3 revenues and earnings would come in significantly lower than what had been expected. The weakness was significant and revenue estimates are now expected to be around $13.8 billion versus prior estimates that were as high as about $14.8 billion. A recent Reuters article sums up the troublesome warning from Intel, and it states: "A revision of Intel targets had been expected by some analysts after PC makers Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ) and Dell Inc (DELL) warned of slow demand last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the 8 percent reduction in the top chipmaker's revenue outlook was much more severe than expected. Intel also withdrew its full-year forecast." 3. More recently, on October 11th, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced that third quarter revenues might be down about 10% from the prior quarter. This leading chipmaker also said margins would take a major hit in the quarter that just ended on September 30, from expectations of about 44% to just 31%. AMD shares were already trading near 52-week lows, but this news took the stock down even further in after hours trading to new lows. This warning is yet another and very fresh sign that seems to indicate estimates for many companies in the chip and PC sector are too high and therefore prone to disappointment. 4. When compared to other chip stocks, NVIDIA shares still look expensive and that could mean the stock has additional downside potential. Intel trades for about 10 times earnings and it pays a dividend yield of about 4%. AMD shares are also trading for about 10 times earnings estimates for 2013, although it does not offer a dividend. However, NVIDIA shares trade at about 14 times earnings which is a significant premium, and one that might not be sustainable. With industry leaders like Intel and AMD seeing a recent and significant reduction in chip demand, and with both of those stocks hitting fresh 52-week lows in the past day, it seems increasingly likely that NVIDIA might be the next chip stock to make the 52-week low list.</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1350051137311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:12:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350051766798-15</Id><Topic><Title>EXTRA: A US appeals court overturn Judge Koh's earlier ruling</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1349984858838</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh no, what will The Best Show reply to this!?</Msg><Username>lifesuckswhenstocksaredown</Username><Timestamp>1350051766798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:22:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350052399107-16</Id><Topic><Title>EXTRA: A US appeals court overturn Judge Koh's earlier ruling</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1349984858838</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm sorry.

It says several top executives in the industry for Di. But the tough negotiating style can backfire on IT giant. Those who today enters a mobile shop belonging to Vodafone, Three, Tele2 and Telenor to buy an iPhone will probably have friendly but firm assistance to unpack the phone. There is a reason that operators want them leaving the stores should do it with an activated iPhone. The number started mobiles control: how Apple benefits deliveries Iphone between operators. It says several independent sources Di. But even historical sales levels come into play. Prior to the launch of a new Apple phone does the U.S. giant clear to operators, which account for about two-thirds of iPhone sales in Sweden, that their sales of older models will have an impact on how many copies of the new model they can expect. Apple settles also the operator pricing of the iPhone, according to several sources. Several top executives in the industry believe that Apple plays out operators against each other. "Apple could, for example, the launch of the iPhone 5 invite us to sell more of their before last model, the iPhone 4th If we said we did not believe in the strategy was the reply from Apple that it was important for our future cooperation. It was understood that we would otherwise have fewer deliveries of the newer models. And if we did as they said there was always another operator who is willing to do it, was mortified, "says a centrally placed source at one of the largest operators. The huge demand for mainly new iPhone models, which are not fully matched by asset makes the method works. "Apple pushes operators, who beat the knot on themselves to become priority in the distribution of the phones as they enter. The operator gets the most make the most money, which makes the situation quite hysterical - all crawling for Apple, "says a senior executive in the telecommunications industry. Demand for the iPhone in Sweden, according to a well-informed industry source higher than in most other countries, which affects the relative strengths. "Apple has a completely different logic. Other mobile providers have carrots to get us to increase our sales of their products: they offer to help with the launch, promotions, and provides grants for marketing, "says one operator source. The operators Di. been in contact with the claim that the previously dominant Nokia in its heyday did not act in a similar way. "No, this is absolutely unique," says a top director. "Nokia helped. Apple has a new business model, there are many who have been tough to adapt to it, "said an industry source. There is an awe for Apple, whose products paved the way for the mobile data usage. Di. sources speaks only on condition that their names not be mentioned. Many impressed by how Apple uses its strong position. But the day Apple loses its footing few Swedish operators will reach out to help, if you believe the DI industry representatives have been in contact with. Apple has not commented on its sales practices for Di.</Msg><Username>lifesuckswhenstocksaredown</Username><Timestamp>1350054382450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:06:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350056047880-18</Id><Topic><Title>With the PC biz out-of-fashion, what will PC parts maker nvidia pretend to be next?</Title><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1350018043537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 01:00:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"With the PC business out-of-fashion, what will PC parts maker nvidia pretend to be next?" Well Best, it’s almost Halloween. So here’s an idea for His-n-Hers, non-integrated nvidia chip costumes. The Materials. 1. Two white sheets – the start of All good Halloween costumes, right boys? 2. For hers – cheap tawdry-looking plastic jewelry The Apparatus. 1. Scissors 2. Black Magic Marker The Process. For His. Using the scissors, cut out the head and the arm holes. Then using the Black Magic Marker, draw a large chip-looking square. Carefully write “Tegra #3” in the square. You can add the optional little feet to the chip if you want, to achieve that photo-realism look. For Hers. Cut out the head and arms as before, but she will be much more picky about how it looks. Then using the Black Magic Marker, draw a smaller chip-looking square. Carefully write “Cheap Icera Radio” in the square. Draw in the little chip feet, but more carefully than before. Have her put on the aforementioned cheap tawdry-looking plastic jewelry. And Presto! His-n-Hers costumes. Of a nvidia Tegra #3 chip, with a cheap non-integrated radio . Well, come to think of it, they could be integrated later, I suppose. But you’ll have to ask whosunw for the lewd video.</Msg><Username>bests.idea</Username><Timestamp>1350056047880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350058352094-19</Id><Title>mountain of cash! not for shareholders!</Title><Msg>just for safekeeping</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1350058352094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:12:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350058556906-20</Id><Title>Clover Trail vs Tegra 3</Title><Msg>Lenovo unveils convertible devices - see the specs notebookcheckDOTnet/Lenovo-unveils-convertible-devices.82950.0.html Check out the specs of the 11.6" devices.

Intel goes where the money is and if the money is now in mobile it will devote its full attention there now. Its ability and execution is excellent just like say Apple even though they operate different business models. If the first-generation Atom shrunk to 32nm is doing this just wait until the out-of-order instruction processing 22nm second generation model tips up next year in multi-thread single,dual and quad-core form. By 2014 they will also be able to get their mainline top of the range performance model the 14nm Broadwell down to 5W which will be another bad surprise for the quad-core ARM models who are trying to displace it from notebooks. 22 nm Haswell and its 14nm shrink Broadwell will be one of the highest performing processors ever built and Project Denver and the other 64-bit ARMs better be damned good if it hopes to remotely compete in the cpu performance arena.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350060726371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:52:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350061186836-24</Id><Topic><Title>Clover Trail vs Tegra 3</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350058556906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:15:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last time I looked Intel makes billions on its processor dies unlike Nvidia which funnily enough seems to make more losses the more it sell..
