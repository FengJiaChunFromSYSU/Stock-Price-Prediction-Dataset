And Google may silently quit this game too, by picking S4Pro instead of newer S600's etc. Maybe the correct tablet price is $350, being $200 too cheap and $500 too expensive. Of course NVIDIA will eventually sell its own tablets if OEMs don't react, and that's what Shield is testing. I think we all know that NVIDIA enjoys brand recognition, but investors are impatient by now. The other major issue is the OS, tablets are different to smartphones and I'm not sure if Android takes that in. And if Win RT vs Android tablets specs are compared, it can be seen that they're charging 200$ for Windows+Office, which isn't giving anything for free.</Msg><Username>xavigonza</Username><Timestamp>1368696014570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 05:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368706082856-4</Id><Topic><Title>AMD UP 83% YTD, UP 3% Today on Heavy Volume, The BEAT Goes On.</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1368647211268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:46:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You may need to revise that figure later after GS have finished shearing all the AMD console sheep they just rounded up.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368706082856</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 08:08:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368707624030-5</Id><Title>AMD Cut To SELL At GS, NVDA Should Move Up Fast</Title><Msg>AMD better issue those new shares fast before it goes back down to $2.00, late buyers will be stuck for loss.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1368707624030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 08:33:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368712984069-6</Id><Topic><Title>AMD Cut To SELL At GS, NVDA Should Move Up Fast</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1368707624030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 08:33:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Almost makes you wonder if GS is trying to keep Nvidia stock from rising to fast :-D</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1368712984069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:03:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368714220128-7</Id><Topic><Title>AMD UP 83% YTD, UP 3% Today on Heavy Volume, The BEAT Goes On.</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1368647211268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:46:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's going to be a rough coming week for AMD.

The Nexus 7 has recently been made available to a far larger market, which should result in a few million more sales before the end of the production of this model. (Which, BTW, should have been a clue that the current model wasn't being replaced: you don't introduce a product into new markets only to declare it superseded a few weeks later in its original market.

The 8-inch Surface will use touch panels supplied by Samsung Electronics and Nvidia-developed processors, and Taiwan-based ODM Pegatron will be responsible for production, the sources said. In consideration of clearing inventories of existing 10.6-inch Surface tablets, Microsoft will launch the 10.x-inch, possibly lower than 10.6-inch, Surface at the earliest in the third quarter, the sources indicated. Microsoft expects initial monthly shipments of the two devices to reach one million units, implying that Microsoft is more optimistic about the sales performance of the two models than of existing models, the sources said. There were 49.2 million tablets shipped globally during the first quarter of 2013 and Apple shipped 19.5 million units for a market share of 39.6%, followed by Samsung with 8.8 million units, Asustek Computer 2.7 million units, Amazon 1.8 million and Microsoft 900,000 units, the sources cited IDC statistics as indicating.

However, even incorporating the expected gaming revenue and earnings, the stock is trading at 22X our new 2014 CY EPS estimate as the gaming opportunity only partially offsets the continued secular challenges in the company’s core PC business (we estimate that the PC business will generate 45% of the company’s 2013 revenue). We therefore believe this recent move in the stock is just the latest in a long history of unsustainable rallies, and we are downgrading the stock to Sell. We believe the current multiple is unjustified for any company with such significant exposure to the secularly declining PC market. Covello thinks that total gaming revenue in 2014 could be $960 million, based on total “application processor unit” shipments of 12 million units. However, Covello sees AMD losing share in PC chips amidst a troubled market, with shipments dropping to 153.5 million this year from 157.7 million last year: PC business remains a headwind. Our model assumes that AMD continues to lose market share in the core PC market, and we assume AMD’s share of PC client processors declines to 13% in 2014 from 17% in 2012 (Exhibit 3). We believe our view on AMD’s share in the PC client business is below consensus. We expect AMD will lose further share in the performance areas of the market to Intel, as we believe Intel’s integrated design and manufacturing allows it to more quickly ramp leading edge products. In power-sensitive applications, we believe AMD will lose share to new ARM-based entrants.....</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368724534873</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 13:15:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368724590575-28</Id><Topic><Title>MISM looks ready to take off.
