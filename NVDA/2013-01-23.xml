That's a pretty rough financial situation. But even with the substantial charges to get out of their fab obligation, AMD might be avoiding the higher costs they would have faced running a half-empty fab. One wonders where they are finding the money and people to develop products for the mobile/embedded space. Almost certainly that's coming out of GPU development. It's clear that AMD's situation removes the pricing pressure on Nvidia, which you can see from the advertised prices on video cards.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1358923382953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 01:43:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358941073295-3</Id><Topic><Title>Potential Takeover Targets: Morgan Stanley Report</Title><Username>followon</Username><Timestamp>1358903442105</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 20:10:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From TMF: "Intel enjoys leadership position in the traditional workstation, server, and HPC markets with its Xeon product line.

The shorts try to find bad news and promote the #$%$ out of it and the hedge funds follow suit to buy shares from them. The company will have a nice pop running up to earnings and with the release of the game system. I believe the game system will be a success as it runs android and that is hitting many user bases and will attract developers. Even if the shield is not a success the release and news of the following will run this 14. At that point its a sideways walk until its clear on the success. The stock is oversold and is a good strong buy under 13 and a hold after that as it climbs to 14. Due some DD the company has solid earnings and profits and boosted free cash flow ATM.

The latest report on the next PlayStation console (courtesy of Kotaku), allegedly codenamed "Orbis," puts AMD at the heart of both CPU and GPU: an eight core AMD64 CPU and an AMD R10XX GPU are said to drive the system. That's at least the dev kit that the site's tipster has as of right now, but those specs -- yes, even biggies like these -- could change completely by retail availability. Should AMD remain the CPU/GPU manufacturer, both Nintendo's Wii U and the next PlayStation will be powered by AMD chips; not too shabby for a company that's been bleeding talent. The rumors we've seen of the next Xbox also point to x64 architecture, but it's unclear whether that'll be supplied by AMD or another manufacturer. If those rumors pan out however, it would mean that a single unified architecture would power two of the major gaming consoles as well your laptop and desktop -- something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

Due to iMac sales being cannibalized by the Genuine Apple iPad tablet.
