THE ONE AND ONLY, boys. And yet another new Intel monopoly is born. Separately, it must be Crushing for Jen to watch Intel's x86 Clover Trail absolutely sweep the Enterprise Market for Windows 8 -- totally unopposed by anyone. Jen Tried to make a mobile x86 copycat chip, right? He sure did. Seven (7) years of fruitless R&amp;D effort on the original Project Denver project, spent trying to emulate how a Genuine Intel x86 chip works. Wasted. And Wasted Badly. 'Cause Jen failed to negotiate a license to use a few of Intel's 5,000+ patents on the x86 architecture that he needed to make his dunder-headed scheme work. Largely because Jen pizzed 'em off by suing Intel. Suing Intel -- and then asking for favors -- just ain't the way to do it. Nope. End result: Intel will be the One And Only company with an x86 mobile processor specificially designed to meet the locked-down Microsoft specifications for Windows 8 for tablets.

The low power fifth core is worth the expense given what it gives you in non high intensity battery usage life. Kal-El is still a relatively small die size at 80 sq mm compared to its competition so it's not going to be an expensive chip even if yields were problematic due to number of cores and complexity. Some spoiled core chips could be sold as Tegra 2s anyway which increases effective yield. Why is he nit-picking about clock speeds, how are the other mobile 40nm A9s doing in comparison ? So Krait may beat it in clock speed and single thread performance but it is 28nm as well as a newer architecture, 28nm Kal-El+ is following shortly which should help increase the clock speed and all variants will have double the cores of Krait. The deal about Charlie is that he is often good at getting scoops but it is often best to ignore his over the top analysis and do your own analysis on what you think the actual raw data of the scoop is.'</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1348941098033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 13:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348941970558-15</Id><Topic><Title>Ibexx vs. Best, on pay tv, order your package today!!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1348937686348</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:54:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's a little tip for ibbey.

Soon after the iPhone 5 went on sale last Friday, users started filling up discussion forums and social networks with reports of scratches and nicks on their brand-new phones. People say they've noticed the defects around the aluminum band surrounding the phone, with the issue more visible on the black version of the new iPhone. Those complaints don't appear to bother Apple. "Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver color," Apple Senior Marketing VP Phil Schiller said in an e-mail, according to 9to5Mac. "That is normal." Apple seems much more taken aback by the flap over its iOS 6 Maps app -- so much so that CEO Tim Cook on Friday took the startling step, for Apple, of issuing a major mea culpa for falling short of delivering the best possible experience. "We are extremely sorry," Cook wrote, "for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better." But back to the iPhone: A purple halo also seems to plaguing some iPhone 5 owners, reportedly occurring on photographs if you aim your iPhone 5 camera toward a bright light source such as the sun or an incandescent light. If you then move the camera so the light source is off-screen, a purple halo effect can be seen through the camera. That effect also shows up on any pictures that are taken. Users are also complaining of lines of static appearing across their keyboard as they type. But the problem seems to occur only when they enter their passwords at the App Store or iTunes store. Just days after the iPhone 5 hit the market, Apple supplier Foxconn experienced an hours-long riot at one of its factories that involved some 2,000 workers. The riot appears to have been related to overtime pay, and Foxconn has pledged to "make overtime payments as promised." Foxconn's working conditions have faced increased scrutiny and criticism of late. Along with riots, the facilities have experienced suicide, explosions and reports of harsh working conditions. As Apple announced first-weekend iPhone 5 sales figures of 5 million units sold, CNET published a special report -- From rocks to recycling: The life of an iPhone -- in which we take a hard look at the human toll of creating iPhones, the environmental concerns raised by mining for the raw materials, and what happens to iPhones when people get rid of them. CNET's Jay Greene traveled to China to get the down-and-dirty details.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1348971269444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348971663667-33</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone 5 honeymoon over already</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1348971269444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:14:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Source: news.cnet[dotcom]/8301-13579_3-57522869-37/apples-ios-6-stumbles-on-basic-connectivity-wi-fi PHILADELPHIA -- Apple's iOS 6 has not fared well with Wi-Fi. Though this isn't the first time a new Apple operating system or device has had Wi-Fi issues, the situation this time around has been exacerbated by the release of the iPhone 5, putting an iOS 6 device immediately into millions of consumers' hands. Not to mention all of the upgrades. Reports cite 60 percent of iPhone and roughly 40 percent of iPad owners upgrading to the new OS so far. The fallout is numerous forum discussions on Wi-Fi connectivity problems. For example, there are currently two major Wi-Fi threads (at least) in the Apple Support Communities -- here and here. Together, those two threads total, so far, more than 150 pages. And count me in as an affected user in the two groups cited above. My iPhone 5 and Retina iPad (now with iOS 6) work on some Wi-Fi networks and not others. Which brings us to yet another thread related to iOS 6 and Netgear routers. The only way I could quickly get my iPhone 5 and Retina iPad working on a Netgear Wi-Fi router was to downgrade the firmware. That worked but seemed like an odd solution. (And, it's safe to say, one a lot of consumers would not be aware of.) And other kinds of Wi-Fi issues are popping up in forums, such as a persistently slow Wi-Fi speeds, which is different than the plain-old-doesn't-connect snafu. (I had the latter issue only.) As usual, Apple is officially mum on the issue, i.e., the company hasn't made an official statement, though Apple's technical support is aware of the problem. The person I contacted said Apple knows about the Wi-Fi problem and that it was tech support's job to "document everything" so Apple can eventually come up with a fix. And while we're on the subject, the 4G LTE on my iPhone 5 and Retina iPad can be spotty (I had been forced to use LTE when I would normally connect to Wi-Fi, but couldn't). Even in dense metropolitan areas (for example, Los Angeles and Philadelphia) connectivity can bounce back and forth between 3G and LTE like a pinball. But that's another topic for another day. Of course, this hasn't been Apple's only problem with the rollout of iOS 6. Apple Maps has been slammed, eliciting an apology from CEO Tim Cook. Looks like Apple has its damage-control work cut out for it.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1348971663667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348972564903-34</Id><Title>Tim has Cooked Apple - Put A Fork In It: It Is Done</Title><Msg>Apple's iOS 6 stumbles on basic connectivity: Wi-Fi news.cnet[dotcom]/8301-13579_3-57522869-37/apples-ios-6-stumbles-on-basic-connectivity-wi-fi iPhone 5 honeymoon over already news.cnet[dotcom]/8301-1001_3-57522042-92/iphone-5-honeymoon-over-already/</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1348972564903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:36:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
