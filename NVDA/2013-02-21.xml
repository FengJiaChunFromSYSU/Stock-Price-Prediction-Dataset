The core hardware seems to be a medium-high spec AMD PC chipset with integrated graphics. That design has been evolving at AMD for years, targeted at the traditional PC market. AMD presumably won the PS4 contract recently, not five years ago. Perhaps the truth behind the marketing is "AMD has been working on integrating ATI graphics into the CPU core for the past five years". But back to the real question: where is the value proposition in the next generation of consoles? For the past generations, you could buy a console that was 100x, then 10x, better at graphics than a basic PC, and spend less money doing so. For the past five years or so a good gaming PC would surpass the best console. Today every high-spec game works and looks much better when played on a PC with a middle-market external GPU. Consoles went from far ahead, to somewhat behind. This refresh will put the PS4 on part with a mid-range PC at introduction, without even the fog of a different architecture to soften the edge of a cost-performance trade-off. Sony will face this most of all, as users become aware that they won't be updating their hardware with a console that can play their old games. Instead users will need to buy into a whole new console system.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361422814760</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:00:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361423799996-2</Id><Title>Very high volume of NVDA in AH session: 1.68 million shares traded.</Title><Msg>Some huge blogs - look like BUYs: 16:11 $ 12.5933 836,496</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361423799996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:16:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361425646612-3</Id><Topic><Title>"PlayStation 4 Announced: PC-based AMD Hardware Inside"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1361414686689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 21:44:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"AMD has been working on integrating ATI graphics into the CPU core for the past five years" Wrong. If you areferring to HSA. You should know that HSA is not integrating the GPU into the CPU.You might want to educate yourself on what HSA is before making up BS. In short the CPU and GPU remain distinct parts but share access to a unified memory pool, adds context switching, etc. Not sure then look it up don't make it up. Making it up seems to be an Nvidia board problem. BTW if all that BS is true about consoles being dated is what does mean for a WEAKER SHIELD toy? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1361425646612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:47:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361428121764-4</Id><Topic><Title>"PlayStation 4 Announced: PC-based AMD Hardware Inside"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1361414686689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 21:44:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suppose the irony of the dismissal of Shield as a "toy" in the context of a discussion about console games is lost on you... And integrating the GPU onto the same die as the CPU, including implementing a potentially-common work queue, is certainly what AMD has been doing. I could be more wordy in the description, but it wouldn't have added to the discussion. I don't view Shield as a console, or a direct console replacement. It's a new category of gaming device.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361428121764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 01:28:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361429539800-5</Id><Topic><Title>Very high volume of NVDA in AH session: 1.68 million shares traded.</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361423799996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361429539800</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 01:52:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361432013878-6</Id><Topic><Title>Very high volume of NVDA in AH session: 1.68 million shares traded.</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361423799996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 00:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they look like vwap block trades. so not necessarily big trades that were entered AH at a premium relative to the closing price, just large trades closed at the volume weighted average price for the day. still interesting.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361432013878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 02:33:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361432576715-7</Id><Title>Josh</Title><Msg>wondering what brought you to NVDA ??</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361432576715</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 02:42:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361434162416-8</Id><Topic><Title>Josh</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361432576715</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 02:42:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i think the GPU business doom and gloom is way overplayed. GPU business (outside of mobile SoCs) is indeed declining but NVDA is actually showing nice Y/Y growth and Tegra seems like pure upside. I like Tegra as a play on Android and mobile more broadly, as I believe it's strategic to Google et al to ensure at least one other strong ARM-based competitor for QCOM, especially with TXN out and BRCM a year away from competing. Given the overall valuation on the company, I think one gets a reasonable price on the cash generating GPU biz that's been devalued far too much, and a free "call" on could become a massive mobile biz. I'm also not brand new to Nvidia. It's just that I logged in with Facebook for the first time so my name started showing up as "joshpritchard" instead of "thetrade50". I'm in a ton of common at an effective price of roughly 13.14, so underwater, and also a ton of upside leaps. It's grown to one of my largest positions over the past few months.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361434162416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 03:09:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361434424236-9</Id><Topic><Title>Josh</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361432576715</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 02:42:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and my activity has picked up as late frankly because there's a lot of news to digest and understand between earnings/guidance and MWC next week.

Now in the most recent quarter commentary they say the discrete modem market is disappearing. maybe so. but if that's actually what jensen et al realized early in 2012, i think R&amp;D execution efficiency may have been disrupted by a pretty serious change of plans. Not sure. Agree on Project's Denver and Boulder both being potentially huge for Nvidia. I'd like to think that we'll see a "preview" of Denver's potential in the form of Tegra 4-powered Chromebooks with touchscreens at some point later this year, which should hopefully whet the market's appetite for Denver-powered notebooks and/or desktops. I believe Denver is called the T50 within Nvidia, and that it is the next evolution after the T4, with the Tegra 4 family being the T40 series, and Tegra 3 having been the T30 series. Part of this is based on reading between the lines at SemiAccurate, so take it with a grain of salt.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361436085995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 03:41:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361436479865-13</Id><Topic><Title>Josh</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361432576715</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 02:42:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was about to say that R&amp;D execution has been very good.

Mclean, who is credited with calling the demise of Enron, has been on CNBC previously this month opining that Apple shares could go to $200. Mclean opines Apple is losing the smartphone wars, and it’s not clear the company can turn it around: It’s as much likely to see $200 as $1,000. I think there are a lot of questions. Basically, the opacity of its earnings power. Basically it’s a phone company with a few other businesses. Basically now it’s losing the operating system battle to Android. What are hedge fund managers and young kids carrying? They’re carrying an S III. Basically, Apple is holding onto women in the developed world. The more Google (GOOG) wins in Mobile, the more APple loses. On Android, Google search is 30% to 40% more profitable. Now Apple could still come out with a product out of nowhere. They have a history of doing that, albeit under other management. So, it’s not a straight line to Apple $200, Google $1,000. Disclaimer: I have no position in AAPL, long or short.

Unveiled in January, the Tegra 4 processor is the latest chip from Nvidia that promises to bring faster performance and better battery life to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The Tegra 4 is based on ARM's quad-core Cortex-A15 processor and features 72 graphics processing unit cores, along with optional support for 4G LTE. ZTE made the announcement as the company is striving to boost its presence in the smartphone market. In last year's fourth quarter, the Chinese handset maker ranked fifth among the world's largest smartphone makers, according to research firm IDC. The company has historically excelled at selling lower-end handsets, but is also aiming to release more premium models for markets such as the U.S. In January, the company showed off a flagship Android phone, called the ZTE Grand S, that was built with a 5-inch full HD screen. The handset will be released in China, and possibly the U.S. and Europe, but was unveiled loaded with a quad-core processor from Nvidia's rival Qualcomm. ZTE's Thursday statement did not discuss the features of its Tegra 4 smartphones, and only stated that the so-called "super phones" would "provide full HD entertainment and multimedia experiences" for consumers. The company did not immediately comment on when the phones would arrive in other markets outside China. Nvidia's previous chip, the Tegra 3, was also a quad-core processor that was used in devices from HTC, Asus and ZTE, and in Microsoft's Surface RT tablet.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361467881100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:31:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361467926560-71</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's much touted Exynos Octa reportedly having power issue, Galaxy IV may be delayed</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361460798167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:33:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if the material has a defect, both foundations will be effected the a15 was designed for notebooks and large tablets it is a poor design for phones this is not a problem of samsung or nvidia, it is a basic design problem since the launch of the nexus 10 and chromebook, the a15 design has showed an efficiency problem (hense the a7 cores, big-little) anandtechDOTcom/show/6768/samsung-details-exynos-5-octa-architecture-power-at-isscc-13</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361467926560</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:32:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361468056388-72</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's much touted Exynos Octa reportedly having power issue, Galaxy IV may be delayed</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361460798167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:33:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It has been reported that the nvda 4 also has a "thermal issue", not sure which one, the radio one or without it; but nevertheless it was reported.....</Msg><Username>peak_n_valley</Username><Timestamp>1361468056388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:34:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361468160462-73</Id><Topic><Title>Speculation: PS4 Streaming</Title><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1361466247479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:04:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm aware of their really strong software team. anecdotally, my friends that work in recruiting in the valley consistently say Nvidia is often a surprisingly tough competitor for top talent. but it's hard to bank on Nvidia Grid getting the business from Sony until there's some semi-concrete news to go on.

The downside for Sony is that they end up having to market something that's basically a mid-range x86 PC at launch, and will be a low end PC by mid-life. It's easier and cheaper for them now, but it's hard to see how they will differentiate and justify their tradition higher game prices. The Gaikai streaming approach almost certainly didn't influence the choice. Gaikai was purchased only a half year ago, and it sounds as if they are still working out how to stream games. It may be that streaming games is still in the prototype stage, and is entirely driven by the marketing realization that gamers won't buy the new system if it means throwing out their current investment. But in the end that's exactly what it means. If they are playing games on Sony's servers, they aren't playing their previously purchased copy.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361468744262</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:45:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361468794986-79</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's much touted Exynos Octa reportedly having power issue, Galaxy IV may be delayed</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361460798167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:33:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>also i think i've read that the fifth core is visible in android but not surface RT... but again that's from memory. i'd have to google around to find the source on that, but i don't think it really matters enough to spend a short cycle on.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361468794986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:46:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361469059008-80</Id><Topic><Title>Can NVDA drop even more than it has?</Title><Username>gabrielbaca18</Username><Timestamp>1361449196762</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 07:19:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great strategy imo</Msg><Username>moorechristopher776</Username><Timestamp>1361469059008</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:50:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361469098235-81</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC: Apple could go down to $200</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361467222384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:20:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can i ask why you make semi-regular posts of negative reporting on AAPL to the NVDA board?</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361469098235</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:51:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361469495646-82</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC: Apple could go down to $200</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361467222384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:20:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple has become a patent troll...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361469495646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 12:58:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361469653704-83</Id><Title>Samsung Exynos Octa has current-generation GPU according to Anandtech and Engadget</Title><Msg>There's nothing we can concretely do or say about the Exynos 5 Octa until it's in a device and in our hands. It's all just educated guesswork in the meantime, but that happens to be something AnandTech is rather good at. That site has reached the conclusion, based on "numerous sources," that the Octa probably uses a PowerVR 544MP3 GPU clocked at 533MHz. If true, this implies that the ARM Mali T-604 used in Exynos Dual devices like the Sammy Chromebook somehow couldn't meet Octa's needs, and that the higher-specced T-658 perhaps wasn't ready. It also suggests that Octa's graphical and GPU compute performance might lie somewhere between that of the third-gen iPad (A5X) and the fourth-gen (A6X). Frankly, a newer GPU would have been more exciting, especially given the appearance of PowerVR Series6 at CES, but big.LITTLE should still give us plenty to talk about when the new eight-core chip finally arrives.

It's extremely difficult to do. You can take ARM's core design as-is, or do a complete re-design. Tweaking even a tiny part would require re-simulating and re-validating the design, which takes months. It's may be that you read ARM targeted the standard A15 core to Samsung's fab, which has different design rules and characteristics than TSMC's fab. That could result in a big power difference between otherwise similar A15 based parts. My suspicion is that the real problem is OS tuning, not a hardware flaw. Nvidia went with the 4+1 design because at the time Linux couldn't efficiently schedule on asymmetric cores, and had power wasting timer ticks. So they threw hardware at the problem instead of improving the OS. Here we are three years later, and most of the progress has been confirming that yes, indeed, changing the OS scheduler to do optimal power management is a really hard problem.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361470512802</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:15:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361470982202-90</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's much touted Exynos Octa reportedly having power issue, Galaxy IV may be delayed</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361460798167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 10:33:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"A15 core to Samsung's fab, which has different design rules and characteristics than TSMC's fab.

Some of the technology to do this is baked into their GPU's. There is NO WAY they could achieve the same low latency high FR with AMD/ATI graphics cards. I believe that is what OnLive tried to do. NVIDIA has invested a lot in bringing this capability to market so, it would stand to reason that you couldn't just use any old GPU and server to yield the same results. There are no free lunches despite how much cheap an AMD solutions is.

At this point, I'm not sure I'll bother spending money on a PS4 or Xbox720. Since both have moved to mimic a mid-range PC (that they sell at a loss), like you noted within 2 or 3 years you can build a PC for the same price, yet get to buy the games at a very reduced price compared to the standard price for a Playstation game. Steam has sales every week slashing 75% off the price of a relatively new game. As always, it comes down to how much original content each system has. My feeling is that an even larger majority of games will eventually be ported over to the PC within 12 months of release to the console.</Msg><Username>clrodrick</Username><Timestamp>1361490836580</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 18:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361494216890-121</Id><Title>Lets face it folks, Nvidia's tegra stuff is not going anywhere.

Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang wants to build his own futuristic space-station campus – and as you might expect, the Nvidia design is black and green and built from triangles, the basic building block of the mathematics around graphics processing. And, as it turns out, the strongest shape in architecture. Nvidia was founded 20 years ago, and has grown from three people addicted to video games who were sick of #$%$ video cards to an 8,000-person company across 40 offices worldwide that doesn't just make graphics chips and GPU cards any more. Nvidia has expanded out into ARM processors and supercomputing, and extends from PCs out to tablets, smartphones, and in the coming years, servers proper. And not just as a GPU coprocessor, but as a maker of CPU/GPU hybrid chips for both PCs and servers. (That, of course, assumes that "Project Denver" comes to fruition and Nvidia can come up with an alternative interconnect to the "Aries" networking that it had its eye on and that Intel bought out from underneath it last year.) The company raked in $4.28bn last year and brought $562.5m to the bottom line, and while no one would call the GPU and adjacent CPU businesses where Nvidia plays easy ones, that might be about as good as it gets. It is good enough for Huang to shell out an unknown sum to build a massive new HQ for Nvidia. "Our headquarters in Santa Clara, just a few blocks from where we started, barely has a spare desk. We're absolutely bursting at the seams," Huang said in a blog post announcing the real estate investment. "So, we've decided to build a new campus right across the street, one as distinctive as our company." Bird's eye view of the proposed new Nvidia HQ The building – or rather pair of buildings – is being designed by Hao Ko, an architect who trained at Harvard University and who works at M. Arthur Gensler Jr. &amp; Associates in San Francisco, which did the T5 terminal for JetBlue at JFK airport in New York, the home base for UK spooks at the Government Communications Headquarters (which looks a bit like Apple's HQ spaceship), and the Shanghai Tower, which will be the tallest building in China when it is finished next year, and the second tallest in the world. "The design harmonizes smart functionality and a shape that connects with and inspires our employees – a triangle, the fundamental building block of computer graphics," Huang wrote. It also looks a bit reptilian, which may or may not be a theme Nvidia was shooting for. The company did not say when this new facility would be completed or what it would cost. ® SOURCE: Register</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361497540125</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 20:45:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361497854617-132</Id><Topic><Title>Google Chromebook Pixel at $1,299 (WiFi) and $1,449 (LTE) - how many are they gonna sell?</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361494663620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 19:57:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should read: "You know Intel is inside just by looking at the price tag."

This board should be about information and speculation, not simply shouting out unreasoned opinions to possibly convince people. I don't believe it is as black and white as this, but its better than "Lets face it folks, Nvidia's tegra stuff is not going anywhere. Losses after Losses will pile up.

Capitalize the cost of construction and then do a lease back deal at a very good rate. Friends have told me the office space rentals have skyrocketed. There current leases start expiring in 2016 so now is a good time. Wonder what kind of stature they will put in the office park but will have to wait and see. P.S. I have worked for companies where it got so crowded that directors shared the same office with their own admin. and new employees had their first office in the space frame...i.e. a desk with HF and sulfuric acid pipes running overhead. We all prayed for a layoff to get some space. As soon as the company got a little ahead new buildings were built. Was a little shocked that Nvidia only has 3300 employees in Santa Clara out of 8000 world wide. Thought that was on the small side. Also they bought the land at the exact bottom of the Silicon Valley real estate bust in March of 2009 so the lease back terms will be great.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361500148000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 21:29:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361501357774-135</Id><Topic><Title>HP's PC's Moving To Multi Operating Systems Multi Chip Strategy</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361487827111</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 18:03:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should be seeing the articles Sunday about how HP will be using a Qualcomm chip in their Android Tablet? Surprised they haven't shown up yet. I do a see trend here however so tenuous. Toshiba was going to use the TI OMAP5 processor for Windows 8 RT as well as HP. When TI pulled out of the mobile business they were both left hanging. Perhaps Nvidia picked them up as customers.

It's like throwing as many bodies as possible to bail out water off the titanic - 4 power savings core is a sign of very serious problems it turns out.

At CES, dozens of journalists and tech pundits had their hands on the Tegra 4 reference device and no one challenged NVIDIA's claim that T4 entails a 45% power saving in comparison with T3. That is a bold claim but absolutely no one challenged it. The big.LITTLE CPU configuration was developed by ARM, but it was never implemented in devices until Samsung picked it up....basically its energy efficiency has never been proven. Anandtech did review the Octa but I don't think it was ever in a reference device accessible by outsiders.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361505972004</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 23:06:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
