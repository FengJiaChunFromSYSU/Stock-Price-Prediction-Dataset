"There is no vacuum at the top." Jen getting fired is a topic for another day, ibbey. Today's concern is nvidia's swiss-cheesy looking Organization Chart. Specificially, the box that used to say "Michael Rayfield, General Manager Mobile Business Unit (Tegra)," is now, well, quite Empty. As in -- there's a Vacuum there, right boys? There sure is. The Mobile Business Unit (Tegra) today has no leader. None. 3,000 nvidia engineers now sittin' around, waiting for a non-existent leader to tell 'em what to try to design next. Like a Cub Scout Troop -- but without a Den Mother. So they're probably all playing Glowball. Again. The scary thing is, the leaderless Tegra unit was purported to be nvidia's messiah, right? Supposedly somehow scheming to offset the downward spiral in nvidia's GPU profits. Good luck with that -- with no leader. .</Msg><Username>where_is_nvidia</Username><Timestamp>1347859165336</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 01:19:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347863548029-2</Id><Title>The stupidest bashers argument that its all the end when not in Apple and Samsung</Title><Msg>I pity their stupidity.

Taipei, Aug. 7, 2012 (CENS) -- Nvidia Corp. and MediaTek Inc. are vigorously increasing contracts for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSMC's) 40nm foundry capacity to deal with strong demands for their products. Nvidia has ramped up contracts to TSMC since June this year to cope with strong demands for its Tegra 3 processors from non Apple tablet PC makers. MediaTek has increased contracts to TSMC to handle swarming orders from mainland China's smartphone makers for its MT6575 and MT6577 chips. Strong orders from the two chip vendors have strained TSMC's 40nm foundry capacity, which is estimated not to ease until October this year. Industry executives pointed out that as TSMC has mostly utilized its US$8 billion of capital expenditure for this year to boost 28nm process capacity, tight 40nm foundry supplies have hit the company unexpectedly. They said as major customers such as Qualcomm, Nvidia and AMD have robustly migrated to 28nm process from 40nm node this year, TSMC is not to blame for less investment in 40nm capacity expansion. Nvidia Tegra 3 is currently the only ARM-based quad-core processors for non-Apple tablets, making it popular with big players like Acer, Asustek, LG, Toshiba, and Sony. Even Microsoft Surface and Google Nexus 7 have adopted the processor. Tegra 3 has even begun threatening Qualcomm's 28nm Snapdragon smartphone processors, whose availability are limited by tight 28nm foundry capacity at TSMC. Around 30 smartphone models planned to roll out in the second half this year are estimated to have Tegra 3 inside them</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347870666128</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 04:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347885585908-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why that Rayfield idiot got the boot</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347869163986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 04:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tegra lost out because of lack of integration: the MT6577 comes with integrated 3G.

Reiterate buy</Title><Msg>Canaccord Genuity reiterated its Buy rating and $20 price target on NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) following checks which showed a strong production ramp for the RT version of Microsoft's Surface tablet. "We believe total production volumes in C2012 are currently forecast at roughly 6 million units, with Samsung and LG Display panel share at roughly 60/40 respectively. In Q3, we estimate panel production units should be roughly 3.5 million, followed by 2.5 million in Q4," analyst Bobby Burleson states. "The majority of these units should be RT given a three-month lag between the RT (NVDA) and Pro (INTC) versions, although we are unable to confirm the split. We expect sell-through to be healthy given the device will come pre-loaded with Office for Windows RT, making it more of a competitor to Ultrabooks than a "me too" device competing with iPad. With NVDA getting somewhere near $25 per device and consensus expectations closer to 3 million units, Surface could drive an incremental $50 million in Tegra revenue and offset a slowdown from HTC, if we assume 5 million units of production are for RT."

There are some heavy competitions building up against Tegra 3 and it seems the industry is disfavoring Nvidia's Tegra judging by a recent report. “We include Tegra 3 in this category, but that product is beginning to fall short in comparison to newer products such as Intel’s Atom Z2760 (known as Clover Trail), Qualcomm’s APQ8064, Samsung’s Exynos 5250, and TI’s OMAP 5432. All of these high-end processors are shipping or due to enter production by the end of 2012.” – (linleygroup) The Intel Atom seems to be coming out very strong and hitting almost ever market head-on immediately. The Motorola tablet that will be announced tomorrow is based on an Android 4.1 with either Intel Atom Z2580 or Z2760 processor. "Intel Announcement Tomorrow - the most likely scenario for tomorrow is not a smartphone but a Tablet based on a Wi-Fi-only Clovertrail+ Z2580.” –(carrypad) “Underneath the glass will be beat an Atom Z2760 "Clover Trail" chip: dual-core capable with "burst mode" (for quick bursts of performance when needed) and Hyperthreading -- the latter allows a dual-core chip to behave in quad-core-like fashion in some cases.” -(cnet) “The (Samsung) Series 5 model will come with an Intel Atom Z2760 processor (dual core), 2 GB of RAM and a 64 GB SSD drive.

NVIDIA also hasn't yet said who replaces Rayfield at the helm. No matter who takes his place, the departure is a Significant Blow to the crew in Santa Clara: the executive had been heading mobile development at NVIDIA since 2005, before anyone really knew the company was interested in the handheld space, and helped make the Tegra name synonymous with fast Android phones and tablets like the One X and Nexus 7.

Remember when nvidia's Chief Financial Officer was charged with fraud? By the SEC. Man-o-man what an fraudulent imbroglio that was. Here -- you can read the sordid details for yourself. From almost exactly 9 years ago. Google this: Former CFO of Nvidia Faces Fraud Charges According to SEC The highlights. "The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed fraud charges against the former chief financial officer of Nvidia Corp. The SEC's charges against Christine B. Hoberg allege that she intentionally failed to record $3.3 million in expenses relating to a deal with a supplier. As a result of that transaction, Nvidia materially overstated its gross profit and income for the quarter ended April 30, 2000, claims the SEC. Hoberg was charged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hoberg agreed to pay a penalty of nearly $672,000, which includes $597,000 in disgorgement of illegally obtained gains. She also is prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. According to the SEC's complaint, in early 2000 Nvidia was lagging behind expectations for its financial performance for the quarter ended April 30. In order to meet those expectations, Nvidia entered into an agreement with a supplier in which the supplier granted Nvidia $3.3 million in cost reduction credits for the quarter. In exchange, Nvidia agreed to repay the supplier this same amount by paying artificially higher prices on purchases later in the year. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Nvidia's explicit agreement to repay the costs to its supplier created a liability that Nvidia was required to record in its accounting records, the SEC noted. Thus, under GAAP, Nvidia should have recorded both the cost reductions and an offsetting liability for its agreement to repay the costs in the future. Instead, explained the SEC, Hoberg directed that Nvidia record only the cost-reduction portion of the transaction on its books for the April 30 quarter. By failing to record the offsetting $3.3 million liability for the second portion of the deal, added the SEC, Hoberg led Nvidia to overstate its gross profit for the quarter by 6.4 percent and its income for the quarter by 15.3 percent. To facilitate the fraud, said the SEC, Hoberg directed that Nvidia document the deal in two separate agreements, one for the cost reductions and another for Nvidia's promise to repay. During a subsequent review of Nvidia's quarterly results by its outside auditors, Hoberg provided the auditors with the first agreement but withheld the second, according to the SEC." . Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hoberg agreed to pay a penalty of nearly $672,000, which includes $597,000 in disgorgement of illegally obtained gains. She also is prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

Mike left the company on August 24th, 2012 and took on well deserved vacation time. We can now reveal that following his return from "vacation", Mike Rayfield will take charge as a senior executive at Micron Technology. According to sources close to the heart of the company, Mike will lead the business opportunities in the Low-Power DRAM field, with memories such as LPDDR2, LPDDR3, DDR4, DDR4L and ultimately LPDDR4 powering billions (you've read it correctly) of mobile devices by 2020. Currently, it is not certain who will lead the Mobile BU in NVIDIA, but we're not surprised at Micron managing to scoop the top talent. The company is in a great shape, and regardless who wins in the numerous computing wars (Storage, Mobile, Desktop, Server), chances are they will need the memory from Micron. The company is working on management restructuring and preparing the business units for the arrival of new memory standards, such as LPDDR3, DDR4, Hybrid Memory Cube and ReRAM. In any case, Mike will have one heck of a portfolio to manage</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347932622098</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:43:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347933558352-65</Id><Title>Where is the amdshortisstupid guy?</Title><Msg>After AMD have crashed he disappeared.

Buy low sell high. Nvda is notorious for wild swings. Rallied last from 9 to 27 in quick fashion then blast back down. Wldnt be surprised if bashers bought high and cut low hence bashing this stock. We ain't stupid. We buy low. When rally we sell!</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347937743678</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347939678021-67</Id><Topic><Title>I think NVIDIA is performing a timely "retooling" of its top echelon</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1347935468289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 22:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those swings are getting smaller now. I don't we will have many more real significant swings. Seems like we are in a pretty tight range here between high 12s/low 13s to mid 14s.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1347939678021</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:41:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347940648722-68</Id><Title>Since when did Seeking Alpha become a "headline news source"</Title><Msg>Yahoo please fix this, Seeking Alpha is nothing but a blog post.</Msg><Username>standog10</Username><Timestamp>1347940648722</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:57:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
