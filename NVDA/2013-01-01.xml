I figure annualized GAAP earnings should be $1.30 or higher in a year." mslans $1.30 in annualized GAAP earnings does seem possible! Especially since the Senate last night included a reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit. If the House passes the Fiscal Cliff Bill as is today, Nvidia's US income tax rate will drop by 4 percentage points. About $10M to $12M a quarter adding $0.08 to annualized earnings. PPS would be near $20 in a year. Too Optimistic? mslans There is very good chance you are right, but IMHO only if Tegra is breakeven in the 2nd half of the year. If this happens, WS Analysts would jump their earnings estimates driving the stock price upward. Let's hope the die shrink to 28nm from 40nm kickstarts Tegra gross margins in 2013 like it did for Geforce gross margins in 2012. But I cannot overemphasize the importance of Nvidia paying a dividend. This and the stock buyback(if happening) has effectively changed Nvidia from a speculative play to an investment. Because of this, I intend to hold my stock because I doubt I will ever again be able to buy at $11.50 a share again no matter how much the day trading stock boys try to influence the stock price through postings or articles on the internet. Bet they move on to some other play sooner rather than later.

Chief Executive Officer Jen doesn’t get any bonus for 2012, does he? I would hope not. The guy’s “leadership” was bad during 2012. Oh so Bad. Jen’s company underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by (-27.67%) Which is clearly a sign of bad leadership, right? It sure is. Well okay. Maybe bad vision, bad strategy, and bad execution too. Jen selling all of nvidia’s IP to Intel Corporation wasn’t the best move either. And since Jen is the titular head of this misguided outfit – he is responsible. It would be a crime if Jen’s hand-picked, sock puppet Board of Toadies votes to pay the guy any bonus for 2012. The Big Dog owners of nvidia will most assuredly be outraged. Yes, Outraged, boys. Even more outraged than they were about going 19 years without a dividend. Outraged about how on earth a Chief Executive Officer of a company turning in negative alpha of (-27.67%) could possibly earn any Bonus. And they will probably use their Monte Blancs to check some different proxy circles. You know, where it says “Re-Election of Directors”. Heck, they might even write-in a few hand-picked names of their own. The outraged Big Dog owners can do that, don't u know.</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1357060348043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 12:12:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>19</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357063020398-7</Id><Topic><Title>shareholders must check it out!</Title><Username>jeffwatson412</Username><Timestamp>1356471527249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 16:38:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks !</Msg><Username>guilfordleo</Username><Timestamp>1357063020398</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 12:57:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357068540632-8</Id><Topic><Title>nvda Underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by (-26.67%)</Title><Username>bestnhighest.wins</Username><Timestamp>1357007102153</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 21:25:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed, Best.

New Years Eve was a light trading day, however nothing is for certain but if a deal gets passed I imagine it will be well received.

"Fiscal Cliff was just a taste of things to come, its all austerity from here on out.

The flip side of this argument is the economy is improving in spite of beltway incompetence, and companies have hoards of cash that need to be put to good use.

Might it be because the European supercomputer builders either know, -- or suspect -- that the horrendous loss-generating "tegra" ARM chip folly could be cancelled soon? You know.
