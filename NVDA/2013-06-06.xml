This new Toshiba tablet centres around a beautiful stylus, and an even better looking screen. The beautifully rhymey Excite Write from Toshiba is a 10.1-inch, Tegra 4-powered tablet with a beautiful 2560 x 1600 screen resolution and an incredibly responsive stylus. The Write is running Android 4.2, packs in 2GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, micro-HDMI for video out and a micro-SD slot for expandable storage. The Write also backs Harman Kardon stereo speakers with a new microphone set-up that Toshiba is calling DTS Premium Voice Pro for better audio interactivity and VOIP. The Excite Write is a premium tablet at a really reasonable price, coming in at $US599 (Australian prices coming soon). The incredible 2560×1600 screen resolution makes the Xcite Write one of the highest resolution tablets out on the market today, and it makes everything look fabulous. The colours you get on the Write are simply incredible. To top it off, the screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 2, which is more than welcome on our beloved gadgets. Flip the Write over and you’ll find a bright dimpled silver aluminium exterior which — when combined with premium speakers, a high resolution screen and top-quality specs — actually serves to make the whole thing pretty heavy to lug around. The Excite Write isn’t exactly unwieldy, but it’s probably going to strain your arm if you use it for a prolonged period of time. The stylus is great thanks to 1024 points of touch on the digitiser, and with a new suite of optical recognition software from Toshiba, this is a tablet for people who love to take notes.

This week at the Computex Taipei expo, AMD doubled down on its “Unified Gaming Strategy,” and promises to work directly with game developers to make PC ports of console games easier going forward." ... "Everyone seems to be benefiting except Nvidia here. The real worry with AMD’s push for unified gaming is that games developers might shirk Nvidia optimizations. If it’s relatively simple to get Xbox One games up and running on PCs with AMD graphics, publishers might not see the need to spend the additional cash to optimize for Nvidia cards. This could be a huge hassle for the majority of PC gamers with existing Nvidia cards, but it would be even worse for Nvidia itself. While AMD has been lagging well behind lately, this PC-console strategy could help it leapfrog its competitors in a meaningful way."

Do you think that Sony and MSFT want their partners to help developers port games out of their controlled and profitable console ecosystems? They do not. Consider how easy it would be for MSFT to run the Xbox on a streamlined version of Windows, and yet that they haven't done that. Even the new Xbox essentially runs two parallel OS.

That means as long as Intel, not AMD, can't product a decent iGPU Nvidia is safe.

Yes, I read the whole article and cut-and-paste the part about the HP tablet in order to include the entire last paragraph about Nvidia. (the whole article was too long) The reason I put the article up was because you and other Nvidia fans called reports of the Toshiba tablet crashing and overheating a lie or rumor. But there was a site who had access to the tablet and ran test then did report that it crashed and runs hot. As far as I can tell no one checked before calling it a lie or rumor, including you.

While there has been market discussion for some time in terms of Intel’s opportunity in tablets, we think these recent design wins represent a significant accomplishment in gaining traction with Tier-1 customers. Intel has traditionally been strong on the Windows OS platform, but is also seeing traction with Android. We note that share for both operating systems is expected to increase with Android accounting for more than half of the market. While WinRT has been a disappointment to date, we still expect WinOS share to grow to 16% of the market by 2016. We believe Intel tablet processors could have a TAM opportunity amounting to twothirds of the market [...] Design wins at Samsung and Asus are utilizing Intel’s current generation tablet processor (Clover Trail). We expect Intel will realize increased success as it rolls out its next-generation processor (Bay Trail) in 4Q. Bay Trail will feature design improvements including a faster processor, better graphics, and improved power efficiency. We believe the improved specs will benefit Intel."" Sterne Agee: ""We believe there is something in INTC for everybody. For the bulls, it is new product ramps at advanced nodes that close the power gap with ARM and significantly improve the chances of end-market success. For Bears it is that the core PC market which is still ~60%+ of revenues continues to be sluggish, Capex requirements for ROI continue to be high, and the success of Silvermont might hasten the decline of PCs and NBs.""

We believe it also adds uncertainty to the 4Q Win8.1 PC-Tablet mix for OEMs-ODMs. The Handset/Tablet market inherently has shorter product cycles, more product SKUs, more competition and lower margins than the oligopolistic PC market with INTC’s dominance. But in the near term we believe INTC can mitigate the downside with new ramps and improving GMs with utilization. For INTC also, the attendant top-line increase from a tablet upside is much lower than the top-line upside from a Win8 NB pickup. We should note that IDC expects the tablet market to grow at a ~35% CAGR with the near-term PC market flattish. Longer-term unless INTC changes its business model to focus on cash flow or earnings generated, we believe GM and profitability in the lower ASP market might be a potential headwind.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370552929400</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 17:08:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370554046944-56</Id><Topic><Title>"AMD has console gaming in its pocket, but can it squeeze out Nvidia on the PC?"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370539827336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:30:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't understand consoles of today.

Nvidia is poised to put its Tegra 4 processors into everything from phones and tablets to gaming devices and laptops, further erasing the line between dedicated PCs and other tech devices. PC makers like Asus are pushing the design envelope to deliver dual- and even triple-function devices, and all signs point to this trend continuing strong.""

PC Gamers demand top performance, and are willing to pay for the latest and greatest in the pursuit of victory. As PC gaming has gotten bigger, the effort by manufacturers to attract gamers has expanded to nearly every category in the tech world. Gaming components, systems, and peripherals were out in full force in Taiwan, and many vendors courted the gaming set with appearances by professional gamers, contests for competitive overclockers, and large gaming displays.
