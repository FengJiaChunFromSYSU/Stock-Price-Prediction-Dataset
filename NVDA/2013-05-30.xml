I'll be waiting for the second generation of the shield, as I do not have the appropriate geforce card to do pc streaming, and also would want to wait for the kinks to be ironed out (ie pc streaming functionality is still described as being in beta). I have not seen any nvidia shield youtube videos that do much showcasing of non-gaming functionality (other than the remote control one). Perhaps, they want to avoid the backlash that Xbox One received for not showcasing enough gaming during the reveal event.</Msg><Username>morrowltd</Username><Timestamp>1369930362708</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369930492357-10</Id><Topic><Title>Really?

I NEVER expected Tegra 4 would be in the next-gen Nexus . Reasons being the following: 1. Google always wanted to play the musical chairs - spreading the usage of component suppliers and OEMs to spread its Android/Chrome to expand its ecosystems. Remember El Goog is selling content to make its fortune, thus the widest exposure would work to its advantage. 2. Google tablets seemed to derive from the business concept of being "good enough, but cheap" as the original Nexus 7 is. Tegra 4 would be too expensive for this purpose. The rumored SoC inside the nest-gen N7 is Snapdragon S4 Pro - basically a "last generation" chip which is also in Nexus 10 made by Samsung. 3. Tegra 4 wouldn't b be available in volume quantities for July release, as the N7 line can be expected to continue its high volume sales. (At least Google assumes so). Google would've needed Tegra 4 to be available in huge volumes by April for the final product release in July. No way these timelines could match. 4. Google likely has other product in development deploying Tegra 4 - the Moto X phone being one of them. Others could include a successor to Nexus 10 tablet and a Google Chrome book. THe year is gonna be interesting....hang around and enjoy owning NVDA for a change. :)</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369937175815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 14:06:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369943549397-19</Id><Topic><Title>Re: look for an increase in screwish activity over the next 30-40 days</Title><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369398384547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 08:26:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>volume today 3 million shares below 3 month average</Msg><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369943549397</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369944163583-20</Id><Topic><Title>HP SlateBook X2 to be launched in Europe in late July</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369859995532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are not even any more portable than a small laptop.

It's one of a quartet of new Kepler graphics cards that Nvidia is introducing today — the others being the GTX 760M, 765M, and 770M — all of which are said to be at least 30 percent faster than their last-generation counterparts. What that means in practical terms is that so long as your shiny new laptop has a GTX 700M-series GPU inside it, you should be able to game away quite happily at the popular 1920 x 1080 resolution. The performance difference between the four new models will mostly be felt in the amount of extra graphical frills you can enable at that resolution. That being said, the flagship 780M can be configured with up to 4GB of GDDR5 and 1,536 CUDA cores, potentially allowing you to step up into even higher resolutions. Before you start dreaming of a high-res ultrabook like the Toshiba Kirabook exploiting one of these chips, it's worth noting that Nvidia's new hardware is destined primarily for bulkier machines in the 14- to 18-inch display range. Even though the company anticipates this new generation of computers to be thinner and lighter, the basic power and cooling requirements of a high-end graphics chip mean you won't be looking at the sveltest possible laptop. Computex 2013 is set to kick off in Taipei next week, which is when we can expect Intel to finally lift the veil of secrecy from around its Haswell CPUs, opening up the floodgates for a deluge of new laptops. Nvidia's new GTX range is sure to figure prominently among them, so anyone considering an imminent upgrade would be well advised to soak in the Computex news before making a final decision.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369960066922</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 20:27:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369966259146-24</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA tweet: "We just released a slew of GeForce GTX mobile processors.
