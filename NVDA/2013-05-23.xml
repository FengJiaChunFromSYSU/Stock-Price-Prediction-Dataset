"We believe AMD will receive revenues of $60-$80 per PS4 and xBox One shipped for its processor," he said. He continued, "We believe that both the PS3 and xBox 360 shipped between 70-to-75 million units each over the past few years.

Sounds like a tenuous investing premise. If everything goes well, they might stop losing money. Is this why AMD's price run-up has stalled out in the face of the actual Xbox announcement as opposed to the rumors? Is this why people say "buy the rumor, sell the news" Your current job at AMD is a great place to get a good understanding of the sector, but it won't teach you much about investing. It also seems to cloud your judgment on the competition. I suggest that you do some reading before you put too much at stake.

Fun fact: Did you know that, at last report, NVDA had enough cash to buy AMD outright and to pay off their substantial debt? I actually think it would be worth thinking about, if only INTC hadn't put such interesting terms into AMD's x86 license. Hope you are aware of those terms as an investor.

This is not a new chip. Thanks to the Tegra 4i's software defined radio technology (pdf), support for new technologies can be integrated with a mere software update instead. That makes it somewhat more future proof than competing chips, as it's now compatible with a network that doesn't even exist in the real world… yet. "An additional advantage of the technology is its tiny size. Because the modem is designed with general purpose Deep Execution Processors (DXP), it’s 40 percent the size of a conventional LTE modem," the company said. "The benefit is a fast, high performance, adaptable modem in a tiny footprint." The chip's modem is also multi-mode, the company said, delivering 4G LTE-Advanced while also supporting LTE Cat 3, 3G, and 2G, meaning it will work even where LTE networks aren’t available. Other LTE-Advanced features will be coming soon in software, the company said. Because there are no 4G LTE-Advanced networks up and running, Nvidia had an emulated version running at CTIA, and the "Phoenix" Tegra 4i reference smartphone showing speeds of 150 Mbps. Phoenix is a fully-functional smartphone with a 5-inch 1080p display, 13MP camera and integrated 4G LTE. "We also demonstrated Phoenix running on a live AT&amp;T LTE network – showing video streaming over LTE and voice calls," the company said. "It’s a great proof point of our strong progress in Tegra 4i modem stability and performance." tomshardwareDOTcom/news/Tegra-4i-Phoenix-LTE-Advanced-CTIA-2013-i500,22703.html</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369335763876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:02:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369335809531-27</Id><Topic><Title>"XBox One and PS4 Could Add $9B in Revenue for AMD (AMD) - Jefferies"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1369324129559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 11:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"9 billion sounds optimistic for selling a door stop and a paper weight. lol" Are you talking about that SHIELD Condom Toy or Xbox and Playstation?

The largest personal computer maker's stock price has surged 11% in pre-market trading after its second-quarter earnings report topped Wall Street estimates. The company pulled in $27.6 billion in the second quarter, down from more than $30 billion generated the same time a year ago. However, HP CEO Meg Whitman says her plans to turaround the ailing PC maker are still on track. "This (2013) is a fix-and-rebuild year, and we think revenue growth is possible in 2014," she says. Advanced Micro Devices down. Shares of AMD have dropped 3% after unveiling new chips aimed at tablets and thin laptops.

This 7-inch tablet comes equipped with a 1280-by-800-pixel IPS LCD, a quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor, 1GB RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. The Sero 7 Pro will also run Android 4.2 "Jelly Bean."

This company has great leadership, great products, and a great future ahead of it. I'm a super long, so I'm content to watch NVDA grow and continue to put out products that impress the tech community.

While both devices include similar housings, the internals differ significantly, as you might expect. The cheaper model includes a 1.6GHz dual-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, 4 gigs of internal storage (plus a microSD slot with support for 32GB cards), a 1,024 x 600-pixel 7-inch display, 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera, a four-hour battery and Android 4.1. The Pro model boasts a 1.3GHz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, 1GB RAM, 8 gigs of storage, an upgraded 1,280 x 800 display, a 2MP camera up front with a 5MP cam on the rear, up to 10 hours of battery life and Android 4.2. You should be able to snag both tablets at your local Walmart store or through the retailer's website beginning tomorrow.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369352119548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 19:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369353148678-62</Id><Topic><Title>Hisense Tegra 3 Tablet- Sold at Walmart</Title><Username>ugs</Username><Timestamp>1369344340040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:25:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read that Walmart routinely orders drug tests and character screens for prospective employess.

That's why Apple doesn't bother to sell there. (BTW, Walmart is second only to Best Buy in external sales of Apple products.) It's easy to turn your nose up at Walmart if you have easy access to different retailers. But there are big parts of the U.S. where Walmart is the only reasonable local store. Getting Walmart to sell your product is a big deal. For this product Walmart probably built in a big margin, and can drop the price significantly if they wish. It's probable that they'll use it as leverage to push down their wholesale cost for Apple' products.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1369353901820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:05:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369354968922-64</Id><Topic><Title>Hisense Tegra 3 Tablet- Sold at Walmart</Title><Username>ugs</Username><Timestamp>1369344340040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:25:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a fine price for the equipment.

Go ask apple investors how that's working for them. Betting on future products is how you make the $$$. Products that have the ability to blindside the market and create upside surprise are what you need to get excited about.

That’s Henry Samueli’s view of the semiconductor industry in a nutshell. The chief technology officer of Broadcom Corp. was shockingly frank in an on-stage interview at an event celebrating the 40th anniversary of Ethernet. “Moore’s Law is coming to an end—in the next decade it will pretty much come to an end so we have 15 years or so,” Samueli told several dozen Silicon Valley technology veterans. “Standard CMOS silicon transistors will stop scaling around 5 nm and everything will plateau,” he said. “I am comfortable we will get to terabit networking speeds, but I’m not sure I see a path to petabit speeds,” said the co-founder of one of the world’s largest communications chip companies. “You will see density of network switch boards leveling off and when you see the network progress level off it will change the dynamics of the entire industry,” he said. “We still have another 15 years or so to enjoy, but we need to prepare at some point for a network that doesn’t double in bandwidth every two years,” he added. Plenty of pundits have predicted the end of CMOS scaling before, but rarely veteran executives of well established chip vendors with deep technical understanding. Before co-founding Broadcom in 1991, Samueli was a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA, specializing in communications chips. The end of CMOS scaling “has been one of my biggest concerns for some time,” Samueli told EE Times after participating in a panel discussion. “We’ve been talking to customers about this for awhile,” he said.

Nvidia isn't hurting for resources, they can hire another coder with those billions to keep Tegra 4 on schedule if Tegra 4 was on schedule. You could have asked the old Tegra UNIT HEAD all about how well Tegra 4 was going while he was cleaning out his desk, collecting his belongings and handing in his badge if he wasn't in such a hurry to get away. lol He's gone because Tegra 4 is DOA He probably spent his last days there holed up in his office playing with his prototype SHIELD Toy. The Tegra "project" is a mess and QCOM is enjoying Nvidia's Tegra melt down.
