For evidence, look no further than Apple Inc.'s effort to find a company other than ferocious rival Samsung Electronics Co. to make the sophisticated chip brains used in Apple's iPads and iPhones. This month, after years of technical delays, Apple finally signed a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make some of the chips starting in 2014, according to a TSMC executive. The process had been beset by glitches preventing the chips from meeting Apple's speed and power standards, TSMC officials said. Despite the deal, Samsung will remain the primary supplier through next year, one of these executives said. Apple is one of Samsung's biggest customers for processors and memory chips. But the two firms compete directly in the mobile-phone market and have spent the better part of the past two years suing and countersuing over the look, feel and features of their gadgets. Both companies declined to comment. They were ideal partners a decade ago, when the two didn't really compete. Then Samsung started rolling out smartphones that today eclipse the iPhone in units shipped. In the past year, Apple executives have expressed concern that their dependence on Samsung limits Apple's ability to control its destiny by constricting Apple's negotiating power and ability to use different technologies, according to people who have been told so by Apple executives. Apple, Cupertino, Calif.,has cut back on some purchases. It no longer buys iPhone screens from Samsung and has reduced iPad-screen purchases, suppliers say. And Apple has been buying more flash-memory chips—an essential component for storing data—from other makers, say former Apple executives and officials at another chip supplier.

The microprocessor brains that control iPods, iPhones and iPads are Samsung-built. And some new iPads still use Samsung screens, according to examinations of the devices by industry analysts. Apple's conundrum: Samsung is the world's biggest maker of some of the most sophisticated parts that Apple craves, such as processors, memory and high-resolution screens. Apple also has more than a half-decade invested in working with Samsung to build custom chips. Replicating that elsewhere is daunting, former Apple executives say. The component choices for Apple "aren't good, which is why they keep buying from Samsung," says Michael Marks, who teaches a course on supply chains at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and is chairman of SanDisk Corp., SNDK +1.04% which sells memory chips to Apple. Plus, the maturing tech business has left fewer big players to partner with. "That's forced more of these strange bedfellows, because the choices are limited." Apple's deal this month to start buying chips from TSMC is a milestone. Apple long wanted to build its own processors, and it bought a chip company in 2008 to begin designing the chips itself. But it continued to rely on Samsung to make them. As early as 2010, Apple and TSMC started discussing working together to build the chips, say the TSMC executives. In 2011, TSMC senior executive Chiang Shang-yi met Apple officials to discuss collaborating on the complex process. Apple asked to invest in TSMC, or to have TSMC set aside factory space dedicated to Apple chips, the executives say. TSMC Chairman Morris Chang rejected both requests because the company wanted to maintain its independence and manufacturing flexibility, the executives say. TSMC plans to start mass-producing the chips early next year using advanced "20-nanometer" technology, which makes the chips potentially smaller and more energy-efficient.

In the 1980s, early in the PC revolution, chip maker Intel Corp. INTC +0.75% agreed to share technology with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD 0.00% Later, AMD became a major rival, and Intel spent years trying to undo the agreement. Samsung has reason to keep the Apple relationship alive. Apple is still Samsung's biggest customer for components, and a complete retreat by Apple from Samsung would hurt Samsung's earnings, analysts say. Apple's component orders from Samsung were set to hit around $10 billion last year, says Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong. That represents a significant chunk of the 67.89 trillion won ($59.13 billion) Samsung posted in sales from its component business, which includes chips and displays. The Apple processor, where Samsung is currently the sole supplier, accounted for $5 billion of purchases in 2012, he estimates. "If Samsung loses Apple as a client, it will have an impact because Apple represents a large portion" of Samsung's sales of non-memory chips, he says.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372535493521</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 15:51:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372539905190-4</Id><Title>NVIDIA Got nothing to show, sheild what?</Title><Msg>Guys, this company keeps coming up with noise and smoke without any fire underneath. Graphics is a dead business unless embedded in SOC. In Mobile they have 0 design wins with Tegra. Go and check their own website (bunch of discontinued phones since 2011). This company is history. They are living off hype. In mobile, Qualcomm is just warming up with almost 100% of the high end smartphones excluding only the apps processor in iPhone. Just look at the market and see what products are selling.
