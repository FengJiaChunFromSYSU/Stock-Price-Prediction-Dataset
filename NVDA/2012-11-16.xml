The market may well have discounted that possibility in advance, which may be one of the reasons that NVDA has hit a 52 week low. The market acts as a price discovery and discounting mechanism, and is generally forward-looking, so the lowered guidance may have already been anticipated to some degree, which may mean that there may not be a full 15% drop. 3) As with any stock, NVDA's price is (to some degree) tied to the overall market. With a beta of 1.8, NVDA actually moves with larger swings than the overall market, so any move to the upside or downside of the overall market will be amplified. The actual movement of NVDA is therefore dependent on other factors than the change in guidance, which may amplify or minimize the price change in NVDA. That said, it is possible it could go to 10.72, but it is by no means guaranteed. I would think that the greater likelihood of hitting that price is based on the overall market at this point rather than the change in guidance.</Msg><Username>just_me_over_here_again</Username><Timestamp>1353089229339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:07:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353089347553-24</Id><Topic><Title>Can't believe how this stock is being beat up...</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1353079263941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 10:21:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they just announced another long delay for Wayne, from CES Jan to god knows when. why shouldn't the stock be beaten down more. silicon talks and #$%$ walks cause silicon = sales $s while #$%$ = NO sales $s. pumper boyz and brown nosers, justify yourselves with $s.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1353089347553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:09:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353089842829-25</Id><Title>sorry longs - NVDA reaction is very telling, its headed lower</Title><Msg>I was looking for a tell in NVDA to see if it has reached a bottom.

From his other, good trades. Not including buying nvda at a much higher price, of course. So rather than sitting around doing nothing, and helplessly watch nvda go down and down every day -- just sell nvda for the Tax Loss, zero-out some of the the fine capital gains already harvested from the aforementioned other Good stocks and call it a year. 5) It is true that there is no hard and fast rule on adjusting prices due to guidance. A lot of it has to do with the "Trust Factor" of the CEO giving the guidance. So for example with nvidia, NOBODY trusts Jen's self-interest serving guidance. NOBODY. The guy owns entirely too much nvda stock to trust what he says. And his guidance of $1.025 billion for the next quarter is Highly Highly suspicious. 'Cuase it would be Crushing to Jen's ego to have guidance Lower then $1 billion. Just Crushing. He would have to tell folks that he's in charge of a company with just "several hundred million of sales", rather than "ir's a billion plus company." Accordingly, many folks are suspicious of Jen's guidance, and think it'll be Well below the magical $1 billion for the quarter. 6) It is unbridled baloney malarkey to think that nvidia is tied to the market. nvda is plunging solely because the future outlook of nvidia sucks. And for proof, just look at trading action at this very moment. The Good Stocks, as evidenced by the Dow and the NASDAQ average are going okay. The Dow is UP +0.07%, and the Nasdaq is UP +0.27% No problemo with the Market, boys. She's doing just fine. But nvda is DOWN DOWN DOWN today -- Minus (-2.61%) as we speak. Did I mention? It is unbridled baloney malarkey to think that nvidia's problems are somehow related to the Market. $10.72, boys.

It may certainly make sense to do so if you have realized gains, or gains that you want to lock in an offset, but if you have gains that you would otherwise rather defer, it may not be worth selling now. Response to 5) I agree Response to 6) It appears that you do not know the definition of beta. In the short term, the day-to-day fluctuations of a stock may vary more widely from the underlying index, but over time, the beta gives an indication of the correlation of the price of a stock to the overall market. NVDA has a beta of 1.8, which means that on average the price movement of NVDA will be about 1.8 times the price movement of the overall market. I downloaded the price history for NASDAQ and NVDA for the last year. A quick and dirty comparison of the daily price movements shows that NVDA on average moves 2.3 times the price movement of the NASDAQ in that time frame, which is not far from what you should expect based on the beta (1.8). The value for the beta may use a different time frame and a different reference, and uses a more rigorous calculation. (There is a specific statistical calculation for beta and alpha, which may also result in a slight different result. I just did a simple unweighted average of the comparison of the daily price moves for NVDA vs. the NASDAQ as a ballpark figure.) So your claim that it is malarkey that there is a correlation between the price moves of NVDA (or any stock) in relation to any underlying index is itself malarkey. How hard is it to actually do some research? It took just a few minutes to do my simple calculation. It's not like beta is a mystery. It is one of the major indicators used for stocks, and appears on the summary page for every stock on Yahoo.</Msg><Username>just_me_over_here_again</Username><Timestamp>1353094366954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:32:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353094664929-40</Id><Topic><Title>x div Nov23</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353092748732</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:05:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are getting a K-1 this is not a dividend but instead a distribtion- differnt animals entirely.</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1353094664929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:37:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353095342838-41</Id><Topic><Title>x div Nov23</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353092748732</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:05:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If you are getting a K-1 this is not a dividend but instead a distribtion- differnt animals entirely."

I was talking to a QCOM engineer about competitive landscape and they don't even consider Nvidia a threat (now that's insulting). Icera 450 is not even in production only sampling and according to the engineer, 2 years behind QCOM in technology. - Icera 500 was announced in May 2012, not a single peep since then though. Go back and read last quarter transcript - Jen never gave a clear answer on anything, it was all about taping out that and sampling this. He had the gall to say that NVDA is qualified with AT&amp;T on the data side and working on 3g/4g voice qualification. Well - that is a 1 Yr project for QCOM with mature, proven technology. Guess when NVDA will be qualified - you guessed it, 2014! Contrast that with better companies that put Silicon in their customers hands and only make announcements when they have a shipping product. In past there used to be a large short interest and much smaller float in NVDA - so a propaganda announcement would cause a strong uptick. That has changed. Now NVDA is a just a miserable stock, headed in the same direction as AMD. There will be a spectacular blow-up when NVDA loses Asus and that will be the end of it. Buy quality companies with established moats - QCOM, BRCM etc. don't waste your time on 2nd tier companies like NVDA. and Good Luck to long term "owners" who continue to believe in Jen's vision.

While NVDA has been drowning in cash. NVDA is a top tier company that isn't going away and Is doing what it has to do to get into new markets. NVDA doesn't have much to loose by pushing Tegra and project Denver and in fact has much to gain from doing so. It may even take chunks of market share from Intel. Its only 0 revenue at the moment because it takes time to make brand new products like this. They are taking arm technology and trying to get as much performance as possible without having to deal with the normal power constraints of of low power portable devices. It requires a drastically different approach than tegra devices. Denver is a catalyst next year though. By pushing cloud gaming and other cloud stuff they can get more GPUs sold outside of the PC. They make lots more money on GPUs. And They make more as yields go up too. They mentioned the cloud gaming/computing stuff in the conference call as something that is just coming out now. So the full impact wont be certain for a while.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1353105078155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:31:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353105644091-51</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!
