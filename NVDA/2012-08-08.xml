I think they are looking for a new foundry. Where does the idea that a new design team is needed come from? Frankly AAPL's PA Semi team has a great track record designing and building exactly the chip they need to maintain their leadership with a great cost/perf ratio. Why mess with success? is one question. Another question is that if we assume NVDA will just become stronger in the mobile device design win space, why would appl want to climb on that same train? How do they differentiate? NVDA and AAPL aren't so close. I think there is mutual respect, but their business models diverge a lot. AAPL wants all the features and performance but doesn't want to pay anything for it. NVDA delivers all the features and performance and wants to charge a premium for it. I know Jobs and JHH didn't see eye to eye on this, so it's hard to know if those feelings still carry on. I would say the odds, while not impossible, tends towards unlikely, much as I would love to see an AAPL mobile design win.

The Taiwan Economic News reported that both TSMC and UMC were offering discounts of 5 percent on wafers produced using 40-nm and other mainstream process technologies with effect from September.

Early on a figure of 600,000 had been mentioned as an 'initial' production batch in a Digitimes article. But with the Google Play store and retailers quickly selling out of the 16GB model and with demand apparently stronger than expected we've been eagerly waiting for some more info to leak so we could see just how many of Google and Asus's new babies were hitting consumer's hands. Well...we might have just had our first release of pertinent info. In another 'Digitimes' article released early this morning the Taiwan based technology source, which admittedly has a sketch record, reports that in the 3rd quarter of 2012, the company will order a grand total of 4 million display panels from manufacturing partners Wintek and TPK. From the article: Quote Taiwan-based TPK Holding and Wintek will ship an estimated total of 4.0 million OGS (one glass solution) touch panels for use in Nexus 7 tablet PCs during the third quarter of 2012, according to industry sources in Taiwan. "Each of the two companies shipped 500,000 such panels in June and 700,000 units in July, resulting in a cumulative total shipment volume of 2.4 million units so far, the sources pointed out." The article goes on to say that in the 4th quarter production is expected to be reduced to between 100,000 to 400,000 panels (and thus devices) per month because of what it expects will be added competition in the 7 inch sector by a new version of Amazon's Kindle Fire and a possible new iPad device from Apple (their rumored 'iPad Mini). Of course we think the Nexus 7 will hold up rather well against any new Amazon or Apple competition and so wouldn't be surprised if the Nexus 7 figures ended up in the high part of that range which would bring the total of Nexus 7 Tablets sold over the 5 million point for 2012. Of course these figures are for numbers of devices manufactured...not necessarily sold. However, considering the apparent demand for the device we think actual sales figures will be very close to these. So are you impressed by the numbers of Nexus 7s apparently being made? More or less than you thought? And how do you think the Nexus 7 sales will hold up during the all-important holiday shopping season, especially against new devices from Amazon and Apple? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Some past articles suggested that Samsung was supplying a percentage of engineering in the chip design. I was under the impression that a number of original PA people have left Apple sometime ago? Apple will most likely lose the performance lead starting when T4 is available. I just don't think Apple and some others won't be able to keep up with Nvidia. I guess it comes down to if Apple will be content with their current design process with good enough performance standards, or is it important to them to sustain top performance and features that Nvidia can offer? I still think that advanced gaming, GTX, GeForce Grid, and Project Denver are compelling features that Apple should at least consider.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344429451000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 08:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344429903000-9</Id><Topic><Title>how many Nexus 7's built so far???</Title><Username>Nine_feet_underground</Username><Timestamp>1344427029000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 07:57:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know, but think about it for a while, it's a high quality tablet priced at $200!

But I don't see that that ultimate performance is Aapl's top priority. Look to the past to inform the future. Apple takes a seemingly stale segment (music players, cell phones and slates) and redefines the segment by establishing a gold standard sort of product. The whole high tech industry ooohs and aaahs and works really hard to emulate that product. When enough like products have entered the market, what does Apple do? They move on to the next segment to optimize. Today there are two dilemmas: 1, what is the next consumer segment ripe for optimizing, where do they train their ever so capable product development attention, and 2, is there a new visionary to identify that opportunity and run product development with Steve gone? My belief is Apple is done for a while on the market changing front, perhaps never to recover that midas touch again. So maybe you're right and they have to continue to optimize their current products to milk them as long as they can. But I just don't see another 10 year stretch with 3 giant hits in a row happening any time soon. Maybe we'll be surprised. As Kvimax says, we'll know if the fullness of time.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1344435182000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344435331000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Will Apple use custom Tegra chip?</Title><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344378213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:23:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- "APPLE IS SITTING ON A TON OF CASH -- WHAT BETTER WAY TO DEPLOY IT !" Yes, Apple needs to fab their own proprietary chips. And you can bet they are working on exactly that. Apple has mastered the design of SoC processors. Their self-designed chips are the Best and Fastest in the industry. And they have the iVolume to keep a couple of fab plants busy. 24/7/364 Their only weakness is they are still relying on patent thief Samsung to fab them. With $120 Million in cash, Apple can and will do whatever they need to do. And they now need their own chip fabrication plant(s). Folks laughed, right? When Apple decided to open their own retail stores. "What? Sell electronic devices directly to the public?" "Why, that's a crazy idea." And today, Apple has 500 conveniently located Apple Stores. Which are the #1 most successful retail stores of any type on the planet on a sales-per-square-foot basis. Tiffany &amp; Co. is #2. So it will be with chip fabrication as well. "What? Fabricate your own self-designed proprietary chips?" "Why, that's a crazy idea." No more crazy than being the only electronic device manufacturer with their own fleet of 500 retail stores. Just watch, boys. Apple will go into chip fabrication too. And have the only semiconductor plant(s) with an Apple Store in the Visitors Center. A popular stop on the iTour, don't u know. Like Disneyland -- with school buses full of iKids.

The company delivered weak first quarter results. The expected decline in PC demand may affect the demand for NVIDIA’s graphics cards. However, growth trends in the smartphone and tablet markets are encouraging, since NVIDIA’s Tegra chips could see some resultant growth. Moreover, the acquisition of data chip manufacturer Icera will add value to its product portfolio. The newly introduced NVIDIA PhysX technology will likely attract more gaming customers. However, NVIDIA’s performance may be tempered slightly by the weak gaming market, economic slowdown in Europe and increased competition.&gt;&gt; Currently, NVIDIA holds a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating.

So that brings us to the blank box for 2Q2013. Revenue. Well, a year ago nvidia had Revenues of $1.016 billion for the quarter. But with Jen now sellin' Tegra chips Below their cost of manufacture, -- to optically boost Revenues -- does it really matter what Revenues are? It does not. EPS. A year ago, nvidia had Real, Genuine GAAP EPS of $.25 per share. None of that "pro-forma" voodoo accounting fandango stuff here. This quarter it's an iron lock that EPS will NOT be $.25 per share. Nope. Not even close. Not unless 'ole Jen hit a bubbling crude under the nvidia parking lot while shootin' at some squirrels tryin' to barely keep his family fed. $.15 if he's lucky. So that's a year-to-year Miss of another Dime (-$.10). Dividends. Forgetta 'bout it. For the 6 months the guy's already (-$.22) BEHIND last year. So there we have it. The 2Q nvidia Earnings Preview. Yet Another Bad Quarter. Oh, and look for a lot of talk from Cathy the Interim CFO about "linked quarters" and "pro-forma" earnings. It sounds better than the cold, cruel Reality of being (-$.22) behind last year's YTD GAAP earnings. -</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1344466929000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 19:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344467674000-53</Id><Title>TEGRA = TIGER = NVDA EXPLODING with or without INTC buyout!</Title><Msg>Tomorow: A beat and positive spin and upping forecast from TEGRA SALES!!!!
