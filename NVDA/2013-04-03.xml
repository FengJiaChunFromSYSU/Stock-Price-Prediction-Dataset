The probability of the stock NOT having some kind of MAJOR move higher (the only real chance of LOWER is North Korea, or a HUGE overall market selloff) in the next few months is tiny. The stock has been range-bound for longer than ANY time I can remember, and as I've said, it will likely only take ONE major announcement and the stock will be 10-20% higher in 1-3 days. That's just MY opinion, but I still would "suggest" that anyone short calls with a 13 or 14 strike that are trading as low as 15-25 cents should buy them back NOW and take a look at a higher strike in January, like the 15s, which give you upside to 15.40 or so, and give you 40 cents, now, which is more than most of the 13s are trading for. Much more upside and the same or more "protection" OR "income" to the downside. And, once again, we were not even CLOSE to being the worst semi, today. Sheesh...CRUS, which was down over 4%, yesterday, was down ANOTHER 4%, today, and closed at a NEW 52 week low. TXN down 1.77%, INTC down 1.89% and on and on. I've stated what I'm doing for myself, and will continue to add if for some absurd reason the stock goes lower. And, along with a pretty substantial stock position, I started building a call position, yesterday and today, starting with June and going out to next January, at 13s and 14s. If I'm wrong, again, so be it. But I simply find this to be one of the MOST compelling opportunities I've seen in a long time. As the technicians say, "The longer the BASE, the HIGHER in space". It will happen SUDDENLY, and there will be no looking back. When? I don't know, but I'm betting it's by June. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time?

Those were the days when it was mostly pro vs. pro, and far lower volume. I buy calls only when I see something that is compelling. And, I look at the horizon for clues about what and when there might be catalysts, and also look at the Final Hour of trading, and basically every 10 minutes from 3:20 on. (You might be able to go back to what I was writing about 2 years ago, starting in January 2011, before the last incredible move.) Part of my stock position dates back to just after the IPO, which ended up splitting 12 times, if memory serves. (I took out my initial investment times 8, and still had stock left over.) Part of it was bought during the Financial Crisis, and some has been added from 12.05, today, to 12.38, a few weeks ago, and Monday at 12.44. I'm just trying to tell you that I used to sell calls against Arbitrage positions for a living, and studied and used the Black-Scholes options pricing models, and can offer to you that these options are grossly MIS-PRICED, in my opinion. I wouldn't be short any of them with YOUR money, let alone mine. If I'm wrong, so be it. I've tried to offer my experience to whomever is interested. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I'm seeing a negative trend here. Nvidia is a great company, truly innovative with serious technological expertise. But the stock performance is truly lousy. Now how does lousy stock performance drive a great company into the ground, you ask? First let's isolate on one salient fact......The weighted average of all un exercised employee stock options at Nvidia is $14.48. This isn't something new. Other than the brief period in the 1Q of 2011, it has been the case. Now why should we care about underwater employee stock options?....we are investors and traders right. Not employees....OK there may be a few employee message posters but not many I would think. To put it simply...the main retention tool for keeping employees is stock options. When these don't pan out...i.e. stay underwater employee retention is harder and other tools are used which are listed below: 1) Restrictive Stock Units or RSUs are used. These guarantee the employee some income upon exercise because the basis is zero cost. 2) Cash compensation in the form of salaries and cash bonuses are increased. 3) 401K match programs or enhanced. From a shareholder's perspective each item is a negative IMHO for the following reasons: 1) RSU's provide ZERO incentive to move the stock price....Employee's are essentially guaranteed income because of the zero basis...Note: Nvidia is issuing the RSU's in a much greater amount than it was in the go go years. 2) Cash compensation in salaries and bonuses increase OPEX...the very thing that WS analysts does not like in a flat revenue environment. 3) 401K match program increase OPEX too. Nvidia just instituted a 401k match. Hard to believe but they didn't have one before 4Q 2012. Now all of these items are inconsequential if the stock price goes up. Who cares says the shareholder then? Right! But when the stock price doesn't go up and costs and employee compensation is going especially for management then there is a disconnect!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1365038760451</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 21:26:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365040108101-56</Id><Topic><Title>The Viscious Circle - How A Lousy Stock Performance Drives A Great Company Into The Ground</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1365038760451</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 21:26:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what about the vicious cycle......It's simply this increasing Opex in a flat to down revenue environment drives the stock down. But investing for the long term is what's happening you say....Keep the faith. Well of course....in the end all will be well. But in the meantime WS looks out a couple of quarters and says....."Show me the money" and the stock goes down.....employee options further underwater and HR institutes more programs to retain employees and OPEX goes up and the circle repeats. Until what? The bottom.......and all those bells, whistles, and horns go off(Nvidia design wins, earnings beat, guidance upside, WS turns bullish and you can buy a few cents off the bottom. When that will be and at what stock price no ones knows. Certainly no one that posts on this message board can be sure 100%.

However 2 years ago I saw the same compelling set up and "legged into" another HUGE options position over the course of a few weeks. From what I see, it's going to happen, again, SOON. You know, it became my mantra to NEVER BUY OR SELL ALL of a position at once. I "scale or leg into" positions, and actually HOPE that the stock goes down after my initial buy, since I never buy more than 25-50% on the first buy. So, this week has been "perfect" for me to average down (do NOT listen to the Major Wall St. firms about averaging down...they'll tell you it doesn't work)....MY experience says otherwise, and in a BIG way.) I did that in 2011, and had a "laddered" position with various amounts at different strikes spread out of a 6-9 month time frame. In TWO weeks, that year, that position alone netted double 6 figures and I scaled OUT of that position. That's what we were trained to do. So, you do what you like. Your "argument" about the RSU, et al, may turn out to be a determining factor, but I highly doubt it. NVDA has not only kept its talent, it's still hiring even more. I'm in, will add, and have a good feeling about all of this. I'm thankful for whomever walked the stock down, the last 3 days, and if they persist, I'll thank them, again. Anyone who thinks there's even CLOSE to the same downside as upside risk is delusional...in MY opinion. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.
