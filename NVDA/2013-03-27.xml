Renesas noted that the bus architecture has dedicated CPU and IP caches to reduce the DDR3 memory bandwidth consumption. In order to ensure adequate memory bandwidth, the R-Car H2 is equipped with two independent DDR3-1600 32-bit interfaces. Renesas said the R-Car H2 chip is available now.

Since I don't care that much about it, I'm not going to fight with the message board police if this, too, doesn't get posted. The whining the last few days is simply absurd. There has been NO volume, other than in the Final Hour, and that's the ONLY part of the day that really "matters", especially to the pros. Both of the last 2 days had low volume that was added to rather dramatically in the last hour, and on Monday it was the last 10 minutes. On both days the surge in volume was to the UPSIDE and the stock closed well off its lows, or as in yesterday, virtually at its highs. But, all the moaning and griping about the volume and price movement is so childish as to almost keep me from being involved on here at all. To make a big deal about the stock going down 10, 15, 20cents on LOW volume is RIDICULOUS! ( And, BTW...if people weren't so myopic about THIS stock, they would have seen the SAME kind of LOW volume in BRCM, QCOM, AMD, AAPL and many others, yesterday.) And, for whomever said: "I don't see anything good about the stock being held down so the company can buy back mores shares"....well, are you kidding me??? REALLY? If, somehow, GS, JPM or whomever IS somehow holding down the stock so the company can buy 10s of millions of shares at THIS PRICE, that would be GRREAT! For both the company AND the shareholders. I saw yesterday's pop building RIGHT at 3PM. From then until 3:20, the stock added 1mm shares and moved up almost 1/2%. In the final ten minutes another 1mm shares were bought and there were some BIG blocks ALL trading on upticks. This is GOOD action, and nothing that happens BEFORE 3PM MATTERS, AT all (barring some actual news announcement pertaining to the company or the worldwide economy). So, one last time...it's NOT how the stock STARTS the day, it's how it FINISHES...i.e. The Final Hour. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I've probably been guilty of some whining lately, but that's only because I'm a long-time long that's growing a tad frustrated waiting for the breakout and end to NVDA's bear market. We both know this stock should be in the $20s by now, given the huge markets that the company is beginning to penetrate. So it's a little painful to see us still languishing near $12.50... Anyway, I hope that a serious breakout is soon upon us, and hope that you're well.</Msg><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1364392078182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364393244265-8</Id><Topic><Title>The Final Hour</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1364391022875</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:30:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think NVDA is about to initiate a new direction.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364393244265</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:07:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364393697873-9</Id><Topic><Title>The Final Hour</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1364391022875</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:30:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, Ibexx. The refusal of the stock to really break down and the last two day's final hours being so positive, and even seeing it up for a few minutes, today, with the market getting hit, sure seems like we're on the cusp of a new trend. I'd surely like to see the volume expand some more, and IF the market doesn't get really hammered, here, I think we will see the stock up, today.

NVIDIA insists it's still on track for launch in late Q2 (by the end of June) and have already decided internally how much to price it. When pressed on whether we'll see the Shield sell for under $500, NVIDIA senior PR manager Bryan Del Rizzo refused to budge. Maybe we'll hear more at E3 in June? We'd better, because by then, there will be even more gaming hardware available or worth waiting for. The Ouya, Razer Edge Pro, GameStick, PS4, next-gen Xbox and "Steam Box" will all be vying for our dollars.

The quality of games is an issue. Also, it can be hard to make a buck as every developer is getting crowded out from the 10s of thousands of other developers all trying to sell their game for $10...oops I mean $5....oops I mean $2....ah the heck of it just make it free and try to add some in game purchases to make any money. Also, given there is no proper direction pad and button layout and relies too much on touch screen interaction, it is hard to put out popular action games that involve precise movements and aiming. Given that these are the best sellers on console, that is an issue. In any case, I wish all game developers luck since I gaming is a favorite hobby of mine, and I'd like to see all areas continue to innovate and thrive, from PC to console to mobile.</Msg><Username>clrodrick</Username><Timestamp>1364425872612</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 19:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364426234539-50</Id><Title>One technical websites says this about NVDA....make sure to count the number of stars</Title><Msg>""Price and moving averages has closed above its Short term moving average.
