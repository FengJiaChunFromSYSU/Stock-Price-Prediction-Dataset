The truth is that Tegra 4 was announced back in January of this year and we are only saw the first shipping devices this past week. To be fair, Qualcomm is still in the same boat with their Snapdragon 800 with no shipping devices as of yet but the Xperia Z Ultra has been announced and will ship shortly. Nvidia has won the battle of who ships first with the 10.1" Toshiba Excite Write tablet which features a Tegra 4 SoC and Android 4.2.1 with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 at $600. This tablet has officially been available since last week, so it seems like Nvidia beat Qualcomm to shipping their SoC in a consumer product first. In addition to that, Slowly but surely, Nvidia has been picking up design wins for the Tegra 4 even with their competitors speaking ill of the product and its perceived lack of design wins. Technically, Nvidia has more rumored/known design wins than Qualcomm does with the Tegra 4 when compared to the Snapdragon 800. However, it remains to be seen who will be able to ship more of their chips and who's SoC is really the fastest, especially when you consider that when we benchmarked the Snapdragon 800 no Tegra 4 devices were available for us to compare against. Once I do get my hands on a Tegra 4 device, you bet I will be testing it to compare it against our available Snapdragon 800 scores.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374466302156</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 00:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374466586976-2</Id><Topic><Title>BSN comments on Shield shipping, race between Tegra 4 and S800 to be first to market</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374466302156</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 00:11:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: Shield, now and future s you can tell above, I was playing some Skyrim on the SHIELD with PC Streaming with almost no artifacts. The overall experience was fairly good, however, since this was during GDC, Nvidia had spent a lot more time fine tuning the device's controls and software. Nvidia treated E3 like a soft launch of sorts for SHIELD even though it wouldn't actually be available for another month and a half but it still wasn't completely finished yet. I can't wait to see the finished product in my hands and to test it to see how well Tegra 4 stacks up. I still have a feeling that Tegra 4 is merely a half-step from Nvidia and that the real horsepower will come with Tegra 5 next year which should offer us desktop gaming and performance in a mobile form factor. It remains to be seen whether or not Tegra 4 can really compete with Qualcomm's Snapdragon and Samsung's Exynos, but I really hope it can so that someone can put some pressure on Qualcomm to be more competitive. I also really wish someone would build a device with an amazing camera sensor so that we could test out the Tegra 4's own unique imaging pipeline. Fundamentally, I think that the SHIELD is a great device and I hope that it spurs developers to want to develop for Tegra 4 because of the device's relative openess compared to other devices out there. I see the SHIELD as a dual purpose gaming device and development platform for Tegra 4. I'm excited to see what kind of unique use cases can be made up for the SHIELD that haven't already been thought of purely because of the device's controller, display and Tegra 4 SoC. Whether or not it it is actually a great device remains to be seen.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374466586976</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 00:16:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
