Remember how they exited DSL business at just the right time - there were many skeptics, second guessing at that time also. I think TXN has concluded that smartphone/tablet App Processor business does not make the ROI and margin cut any more. Apple and Samsung - the 2 big volume movers have in-sourced SOC. You essentially have too many players chasing the rest of the OEMs. But none of these other players (other than Amazon Kindle) have meaningful volume. There is bound to be further paring down in OEM space in 2013. As I have stated before, QCOM has established itself as #1 and with their R&amp;D $, it will be difficult to dislodge them from the perch. Now the fight is clearly for #2 spot. I used to think that NVDA has a chance to get there in 2013 but my views are changing. The main reason is that NVDA is not interested in volume smartphone segment - maybe rightfully so. NVDA's focus is clearly on Tablet where they think they can differentiate with high-end SOC solution. In volume smartphone segment, chipset provider has to bring other pieces of puzzle (wifi, gps, nfc etc.) together. QCOM, BRCM are much better positioned. I hope NVDA doesn't do any boneheaded acquisition (MRVL or, AMD) and stay the course in 2013.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1352955755667</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 00:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352959912440-2</Id><Title>Apple : One of the highest dividend payers in the United States.</Title><Msg>Apple to distribute another $2.5 billion to shareholders via Thursday dividend AppleInsider | Wednesday, November 14, 2012, 10:20 pm By Daniel Eran Dilger Apple will pay shareholders its second dividend in 17 years tomorrow, distributing roughly $2.5 billion in $2.65 per share across the company's 935 million outstanding shares. Flush with billions in cash it simply can't spend fast enough, Apple first announced plans for a dividend program in March, alongside a $10 billion share buyback program. Each quarter, the company stated it will pay its shareholders a $2.65 per share dividend. Shareholders of record will receive dividend payments tomorrow, November 15th. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted that the company has "used some of our cash to make great investments in our business through increased research and development, acquisitions, new retail store openings, strategic prepayments and capital expenditures in our supply chain, and building out our infrastructure. You’ll see more of all of these in the future. “Even with these investments," he added, "we can maintain a war chest for strategic opportunities and have Plenty of cash to run our business. So we are going to initiate a dividend and share repurchase program." Can't spend fast enough to make a dent Over the next three years, Apple has stated that its buyback and dividend plans will distribute $45 billion from its cash pile, with quarterly dividends handing out $2.5 billion per quarter. Apple is earning new cash faster than it is paying out in dividends however, so its $2.5 billion in quarterly dividend payments has not reduced Apple's cash hoard over the past two quarters. In the company's June quarter, Apple announced the accumulation of an additional $7 billion in cash, while in its most recent earnings report, it announced having piled up another $4.2 billion, leaving it with $121.4 billion in cash at the end of its fiscal 2012 as reported in October. Apple will continue paying new quarterly dividends about a month and a half after the end of each subsequent quarter. A dividend equivalent will also be paid to holders of Apple's restricted shares, although Cook declined to collect dividend payments for the 1.125 million shares of restricted stock he has been granted, which would otherwise be worth over $75 million. The company's current dividend payment rate is quite modest when compared to its current and future cash position. At the same time, Apple's $2.5 billion in quarterly dividend payments makes it one of the highest dividend payers in the U.S." "In the company's June quarter, Apple announced the accumulation of an additional $7 billion in cash, while in its most recent earnings report, it announced having piled up another $4.2 billion, leaving it with $121.4 billion in cash at the end of its fiscal 2012 as reported in October.

But recently the biggest mobile phone makers, including Samsung and Apple have opted to design their own chips for their respective Galaxy smartphones and iPhones. TI says it's time to reconsider its strategy, opting instead to embrace what many industry experts believe is the Future of the mobile sector: embedded connectivity in everyday items, including appliances, cars and even clothing." Maybe Jen didn't see the news? About Samsung and Apple opting to design their own smartphone chips. Which explains why nvidia has only 00.90% of the cellphone application market. Here. Take a look, boys. At that highly educational chart from EE Times. ("Analysts clash over Marvell's apps processor sales - EE Times") Which shows Smartphone Application Processor Shipments (millions of units), for the First Half of 2012. Here. I'll graciously provide it again for Our fine readers. 96.5 million __ Qualcomm, THE King of smartphone application processors 65.6 million __ Apple's self-designed iProcessors 29.9 million __ Samsung self-designed processors 23.2 million __ Marvell processors 18.4 million __ Texas Instruments ("This market is too small, boys") 12.6 million __ Broadcom smartphone processors + on-board cheerleaders 10.9 million __ Mediatek processors 4.6 million __ ST processors 2.4 million __ nvidia 1.1 million __ Spreadstrum With little nvidia having only a miniscule 00.90% of the smartphone processor market, is nvidia really IN the smartphone processor market? Ranked #9 out of 10? Looks like time for nvidia to reconsider their mobile processor strategy.

You may not have all the facts so I will excuse your naivete on this subject. getanid, the list is long - let me list a few critical ones - from an organizational level, QCOM is basically used by majority of carriers on the cell side. It will be non-trivial for anyone to attack their position from just the client/device side. - QCOM has mastered the complexity of universal standards packed in the chipset. This is very very important for large carriers as they go through a very tedious certification process. Anyone trying to break-in will have to go through a very long cycle before they are certified. - QCOM is packing wifi, BT, GPS and a whole host of functionality on the same silicon. Its was amazing to see their power numbers - absolute nutso Most importantly, it will be many years before Grey will be seen in any mass products because of certification cycles. You will probably first see them introduced in some obscure products in China (just like earlier Icera modems). I am convinced about this now - regardless of what fan boys say. - For S4 Pro, I am sure their benchmark numbers were all skewed to amplify their products but they were 2-3x better than Tegra 3. Which is probably not much too worry about as I am sure Wayne will smoke S4 Pro and the cycle will continue.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353031491333</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 21:04:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353032409648-34</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 3G is sold out at both AT&amp;T and Google Play store</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1353013580138</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:06:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Jen already said tablet shipments will be down next quarter."

More bad news in the pipeline from the Son of Larrabee ... blogsDOTbarronsDOTcom/techtraderdaily/2012/11/15/nvidias-tesla-sees-new-challenge-in-intcs-phi-says-evercore 'The problem for Nvidia is, with their dominant share, they have a lot to lose while Intel has everything to gain, writes Wang: As the incumbent, NVDA dominates the space with c.90% share (with AMD (UW) the balance) and operates its PSB unit at a robust OM (45% in 1H12). But similar to ARMH (OW) / INTC in server, this is an asymmetric relationship where it hurts NVDA more than it helps INTC. We are incrementally more negative on NVDA as a result. As INTC executes its Phi roadmap and ramps up performance, we anticipate competitive (revs) and pricing (GM) headwinds for NVDA in the coming years. Notably, every 5% decline in PSB revs equates to -5c of EPS. Admittedly, we’re early in identifying this trend but think the question is not IF but WHEN they gain traction. As a side note, it appears AMD has fallen to a very distant 3rd – less relevant in this area than ever.
