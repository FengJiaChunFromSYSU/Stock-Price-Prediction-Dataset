With Jen waving a #4 in the air. Saying "Lookie, lookie". But there's no real Tegra #4 parts available -- like to Buy or anything. Oh no no no. Just vaporware and sensationalized press releases about #4 this and #4 that. . Then at the MWC show Feb. 25-28 we see ZTE and Asus become "launch partners" for the #4 -- just as they were for the unprofitable #3 and the unprofitable #2. 'Cause they like getting those free 100k or so of "engineering samples." And then the Reality sets in. That the Tegra attempt #4 is woefully late and has no integrated LTE modem. Yes boys, Woefully Late and No Cheap On-Board Radio. And that there's not much left in the way of customers. 'Cause Samsung and Qualcomm and Broadcom will have taken them all. So Jen's turtle-like Tegra/Consuming Products Business loses even more money. Than the #3 or #2 did. And remember, the Tegra #3 is on track to lose about One Third of a Billion Dollars of nvda shareholder's cash -- just for 2012. So expect the 2013 Tegra/Consuming Products Business loses to be even Larger than that. We've seen this bad movie before, right? We sure have.
