China Mobile is at the cusp of upgrading 2G subscribers to 3G. Choice of smartphones supporting TD-SCDMA is limited. Hence Quad-Core Grand Era will provide a great affordable choice to China Mobile subscribers. Won't be suprised China Mobile will provide subsidies as well. "MY understanding is that TD-CDMA network is only deployed in China, not in any other countries. Am I right in this?" ==&gt; TD-SCDMA is owned by the Chinese government and licensed to China Mobile. Other carries in China such as China Telcom and China Unicom do not use TD-SCDMA. "I hope ZTE Grand Era will have a different version going global....any information on this?" Supporting other based band (W-CDMA, etc) is a lot easier than TD-SCDMA.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1345782618000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 00:30:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345783201000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Potential Weakness</Title><Username>tarrahimo848</Username><Timestamp>1345736422000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:40:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep them coming.</Msg><Username>briarvcb0802</Username><Timestamp>1345783201000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 00:40:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345783330000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm APQ8064 Benchmarked in GLBenchmark 2.5</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345775200000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 22:26:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- In excerpts. "Qualcomm invited us on their campus to take a second look at the APQ8064 based MDP and to test it alongside an ASUS Transformer [Tegra #3] tablet with both running at a very similar resolution (the MDP actually runs at a slightly higher resolution. We then proceeded to test both devices in Kishonti's new GLBenchmark 2.5 and the results were even more astonishing than what we had found during the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Benchmarking Day in San Francisco a month ago. In the tests, we tested the Egypt HD benchmark on both devices in both onscreen and offscreen settings. With the Tegra 3 based ASUS Transformer, we got 13 fps onscreen and 9 fps offscreen. We then later confirmed these scores on our own against our Tegra 3 based HTC One X which got the exact same score since both devices run the same processor at the same speed with the same GPU at the same resolution. The Qualcomm APQ8064 MDP, however, blew our minds with its performance. Reporting an onscreen framerate of 37 fps and an offscreen fps of 29fps. This represents an increase of almost 3x compared against the Tegra 3 on the onscreen test and over 3x improvement on the offscreen test. The onscreen test is running the devices at their native (around 720P) resolution while the offscreen test is actually running them at 1080P which is different from GLBenchmark 2.1.5 which ran the offscreen at 720P. Looking at these results, there's no doubt that the secret sauce in the APQ8064 lies within the GPU's sheer power. The Adreno 320 GPU is by far the fastest GPU we've seen in an Android based device and we're interested to see what kind of a GPU experience it can deliver in WindowsRT as well. Qualcomm has been pretty focused on talking about Android, however, we all know that all of the ARM vendors are quietly awaiting the arrival of Windows8RT. Once again, this is not necessarily a production device like the upcoming LG Optimus G, which will be packing the Qualcomm APQ8064 and an MDM9614 LTE modem. We're hopefuly to get one of those APQ8064 enabled devices sometime this fall and to compare shipping devices. So far, Qualcomm has definitely shown that they've put the ball into Nvidias's and Intel's court and challenged them to beat Qualcomm. We should be hearing about Nvidia's and Intel's responses by the end of this year, if we don't, then those companies are probably going to be in trouble." My my my.

Qualcomm now has thirteen (13) different 28-nanometer Snapdragon S4's. And twelve (12) of them have wireless radio technology. Right there on the same processor chip. "On-board radio" it's called. Take a look at the Impressive line-up of Qualcomm Snapdragon S4's. Scroll down to the bottom. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip) Thirteen different Snapdragon S4 versions, right boys? And how many nvidia Tegra chips have "on-board" radio technology? Hummm? Or are made in that zippy 28-nanometer process? Hummm? Speak up now, boys. You seem to be quitely whispering into your shoes. ZERO is the correct answer to both questions. Not one Tegra chip has any on-board wireless communication radio. None. And not one Tegra chip is made on the 28-nanometer process. They're all have those nethanderal 40-nanometer pathways. The time is near, right boys? For the Nvidia Board of Directors to pull-the-plug. On Jen's hopelessly late and uncompetitive Tegra folly. And END Jen's failed experiment in making commodity ARM chips. Or one by one, we will watch Qualcomm's fleet of S4 Snapdragons replace the Tegra #3 in everything they're in.

Heck, with the CPB/Tegra losses growing exponentially, maybe it'll make it to a cool Half Billion Dollars lost by year end 2012 -- who knows? CPB/Tegra MARGINS -- First Half -- year-to-year (-61.39%) __ Six months ended July 29, 2012 (-24.40%) __ Six months ended July 31, 2011 Imagine losing $161.39 on every $100.00 sale? That’s exactly what Jen’s CPB /Tegra business is doing. Selling Tegra’s WELL below their cost. And the funny thing is – the pumper boys cheer every time the Tegra has a “win”! When they should be mourning the loss of even more cash. -</Msg><Username>ct.bestula</Username><Timestamp>1345819702000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:48:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345819887000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Watch For Potential Topping&gt;</Title><Username>samanthak191</Username><Timestamp>1345810716000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 08:18:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very good record</Msg><Username>ameliajoshep623</Username><Timestamp>1345819887000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:51:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345819950000-32</Id><Topic><Title>Attach suggestion to a dependable inspirational icon limited NVDA dealers</Title><Username>rich.morrison35</Username><Timestamp>1345816840000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:00:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is true, on other blogs, major news........</Msg><Username>lindsey.guerrero34</Username><Timestamp>1345819950000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:52:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345820184000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Buried deep in 10-Q: Skyrocketing Tegra losses</Title><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1345738682000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 12:18:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, Patent points out that "CPB" includes a lot more business than Tegra and you re-post and change the label to "CBP/Tegra"....ROTFL FAIL FAIL FAIL Patent owns you, LOL</Msg><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345820184000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:56:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345820626000-34</Id><Title>Stupid spammers think people on this board influence the stock price?</Title><Msg>Total insanity to think that</Msg><Username>stocktrader4444</Username><Timestamp>1345820626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345821047000-35</Id><Title>LG Optimus Vu</Title><Msg>Sales set to explode with another Tegra 3 win. http://androidheadlines.com/2012/08/featured-lg-tegra-3-based-phablet-going-global.html Lining up for an explosive quarter for Nvidia.</Msg><Username>value_investor2002</Username><Timestamp>1345821047000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:10:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345821170000-36</Id><Topic><Title>Iphone ranks 7th in China's smartphone market, watch out, ZTE</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345821089000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:11:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dominating in China is the motherlode for NVDA shareholders. :)</Msg><Username>cognitive_thought</Username><Timestamp>1345821170000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345821261000-37</Id><Title>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEPT 6 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</Title><Msg>Mark your calendars folks.

Most people assume that's when Amazon will unveil a new batch of Kindle devices, including updated eReaders and possibly even a 10-inch Kindle Fire. There might even be a refreshed 7-inch Kindle Fire in the mix now that competition is heating up with the recent launch of the Nexus 7. But might Amazon also unveil a smartphone? It's a long shot, but while the smart money is on Amazon unveiling tablets and electronic readers, it's not totally inconceivable it will also launch a mobile phone. In fact, you shouldn't be totally shocked if the company does. It was reported by The Wall Street Journal back in July that Amazon was testing a smartphone prototype and expected to mass produce the device by late 2012 or early 2013. Those time frames still work if Amazon announces a phone in early September. It would also steal some thunder away from Apple's upcoming iPhone 5 launch, which most expect will take place on September 12 during a press event of its own. In fact, September looks to be a busy month for smartphones, with Nokia likely to announce a Windows 8 device during a joint event with Microsoft on September 5. Again, Amazon in all likelihood will stick with tablets and readers for its upcoming event, but if so, the question surrounding the e-tailer's smartphone plans becomes a matter of "when," not "if." -----------------------Maybe amzn may use nvidia's kai phone?--------let's see</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345823934000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:58:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345823985000-47</Id><Topic><Title>Time for the run up to $22.42</Title><Username>tech_six_sense</Username><Timestamp>1345334778000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 20:06:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oops I did mean Revenue, too much Tanqueray last night. lol http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=NVDA+Analyst+Estimates Watch the vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tlqx_ckWvU</Msg><Username>tech_six_sense</Username><Timestamp>1345823985000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345824085000-48</Id><Topic><Title>Time for the run up to $22.42</Title><Username>tech_six_sense</Username><Timestamp>1345334778000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 20:06:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two words: KAI PLATFORM It will change the game completely.

From earnings transcript, mentioned that a year ago, they werent name among 48 companies as a potential successful company in its transition. Now it is ranked no. 2!!! Spending on r&amp;d is imperative for their survival. Previous years their sales from tegra sucks. They now just need to ramp up more sales to spread the r&amp;d cost and Bingo.... they will turn this tegra line profitable. Smartphone and tablet may one day become superphone and supertablet. Replacing gaming consoles. Nvidia with its Gpu specialty is in great position to capitalize on gamers needs. Just go check out Dead Trigger, the game, and u will know what i mean. I believe nvda spending huge cash figuring out how to squeeze kepler into phone and tablet. Once nvdia figure it out, nvidia will become a dominant player.

Acccording to the just filed 10-Q, nvda's CPB/Tegra business lost ($191,641,000.00) for the six months ended July 29, 2012 Selling those Tegra chips -- to customers like Microsoft. So nvidia is likely to lose what this year on those Tegra's? ($191,641,000.00) x 2 = ($383,282,000.00) Probably more -- since the Tegra's losses are growing exponentially. So if Microsoft bought nvidia, then Microsoft would get to lose ($450,000,000.00) or so on the Tegra folly, right?.

While design specifications are typically closely held ahead of new product launches, leaks are also rampant, and some reports have claimed that Nvidia's (NVDA) Tegra 3 processor will power the next-generation Kindle Fire. It's always prudent to take these reports with a grain of salt. For instance, there were numerous reports last spring and summer claiming that Nvidia's Tegra 2 would power the original Kindle Fire, but the design win ultimately went to Texas Instruments (TXN). It's likely that Amazon chose TI's OMAP processor because it was able to get better pricing from TI than from Nvidia. Given Amazon's desire to minimize the cost of the tablet, this was probably a good decision on its part. http://seekingalpha.com/article/825401-a-kindle-fire-design-win-could-turbocharge-nvidia-shares</Msg><Username>rchites</Username><Timestamp>1345844280000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 17:38:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345844459000-94</Id><Topic><Title>Why nvidia tegra line loses money</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345825195000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:19:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WAIT for the Kindle FIRE! http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/tablets/amazon-kindle-fire-2-release-date-news-and-rumours-1043361</Msg><Username>presisdonebush</Username><Timestamp>1345844459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 17:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345844817000-95</Id><Topic><Title>Why nvidia tegra line loses money</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345825195000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:19:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OVER FOOLS they DOMINATE industries they ramp in!.... The Company holds more than 1,900 issued patents worldwide, including ones covering designs and insights that are essential to modern computing . NVDA hits it big with the Electric Vehical- the car's interior completes its futuristic appeal with a 17-inch touchscreen powered by NVIDIA's (Nasdaq: NVDA ) Tegra 3 processor. Tesla CEO Elon Musk chose NVIDIA's chips because of their ability to render crisp 3-D graphics and maps without draining the car's battery. The Tegra 3 is the first generation that I feel has the capability to catapult Nvidia to the top of the market. This reminds me of the late 90′s when their graphics chips where clearly becoming the best on the market. Many pundits will say that Nvidia doesn’t stand a chance against bigger rivals like Qualcomm which makes the Snapdragon processor, Apple’s A5 chip, or Intel’s Atom chip. The true story is not only does Tegra 3 compete with these, it’s beating them in most benchmark test. And let me warn you Qualcomm, Apple, and Intel, the beating is only going to get worse. I have seen this story before, once Nvidia gets the edge it maintains it. The launch of Tegra 3 accelerated Nvidia’s revenue contribution from its consumer products business, showing a 36% sequential increase last quarter to just over $179 million. Those record sales of Tegra 3 processors last quarter will continue, as Nvidia has had a number of big design wins lately, most notably Google’s Nexus 7, the world’s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet, and Microsoft’s Windows RT Surface tablet. So we have two parts to Nvidia now. It’s not just a graphics chip company anymore, as it has a growing mobile computing business as well, which could become larger than its core graphics business in the future The success of Tegra 3 as well as a rebound in its GPU business translated into blowout earnings last quarter, with EPS coming in at 27 cents vs estimates of 15 cents. For the current quarter, the company expects revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, the average estimates of analysts was $1.09 billion. Nvidia’s core business is going to be fine, and they will be widely successful in mobile computing as well. Most gamers don’t go to that extreme, but they still want a high performance graphics card for their pc. Nvidia’s current market cap is $9 billion, and they have almost $3.3 billion in cash and no debt. Given the earnings guidance, the company’s EPS should be about $1 for the year, giving it a current p/e of 14. Considering the growth of Tegra 3, and the company’s market share position in graphics, next year earnings could be blowouts, possible $1.50 a share or more for the year. Diversifying- Nvidia knows that tablets and smartphones are only going to become more popular, and who better than to make a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), northbridge, southbridge, and memory controller onto one package to go into these devices? Don’t be fooled by the market that don’t get NVDA or understand it. The true story is not only does Tegra 3 compete with these, it’s beating them in most benchmark test. And let me warn you Qualcomm, Apple, and Intel, the beating is only going to get worse. I have seen this story before, once Nvidia gets the edge it maintains it.

Revenue for the quarter came in at $1.04 billion. This was higher than last year’s revenue which was reported at $924.0 million and analysts expectations of $1.01 billion. Worst is over!- On the profit front, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings oft 27 cents per share compared to 16 cents per share for the same quarter last year. Analysts forecast earnings of 22 cents per share. Better outlook- Generally speaking, the company’s chips sales outside of the PC market appears to be boosting revenue. Sales in this area will likely be critical to the company going forward, as global PC sales appear to be waning, so says noted research firm Gartner. NVIDIA's Tegra series chips will be featured in both Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) upcoming Surface Windows RT tablet PC and are already featured in Google's (Nasdaq: GOOG) Nexus 7 tablet. In addition, investors might keep an eye on new cloud computing technologies, which NVIDIA announced at its recent GPI Technology Conference SALES RECORDS- "Our investments in mobile computing and visual computing are both paying off," said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. "Tegra has achieved record sales as tablets come into their own. Our GPU business made strong gains in a weak market, boosted by our breakthrough Kepler architecture. Looking ahead, we're optimistic, as our investments position us right at the center of the fastest growing segments of computing." FUTURE PROOF- Nvidia’s Grid and VGX cloud graphics processors enable gamer-grade or professional-grade graphics capabilities on absolutely any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets or even smartphones. 100% - Without doubts, cloud graphics processing technologies are among the most important technologies Nvidia has ever developed. However, it will take some time before they will be adopted by the mass market. The key technologies powering the new platform are Nvidia GeForce Grid GPUs with dedicated ultra-low-latency streaming technology and cloud graphics software. Together, they fundamentally change the economics and experience of cloud gaming, enabling gaming-as-a-service providers to operate scalable data centers at costs that are in line with those of movie-streaming services. Gaikai will be the first Nvidia customer to adopt GeForce Grid MULTI MEDIA- Fast streaming technology reduces server latency to as little as 10 milliseconds by capturing and encoding a game frame in a single pass. The GeForce Grid platform uses fast-frame capture, concurrent rendering and single-pass encoding to achieve ultra-fast game streaming.

It’s a Decisive Win for Apple, with the jury awarding damages of $1,049,343,540 to Apple The jury found Samsung infringed many of Apple’s utility and design patents, particularly with regard to the nearly 20 phones that Apple had called into question. In addition, the jury found that in most cases, Samsung’s patent infringements were Knowing and Willful. It also found that Apple’s patents were Valid." Pay to the Order of Apple. $1,049,343,540 Unless the Judge decides to Treble part or All of it. For being deliberate and willful patent theft. Then the damages will be More, of course. Much more. The Judge will also decide which Samsung cellphones and tablets should be injoined from being sold in these fine United States of America. Until they are re-designed so they no longer infringe on Apple's valid and enforceable patents. Impact on nvidia: Likely a suspension in orders from Samsung for a while. Maybe a looooong while, boys.
