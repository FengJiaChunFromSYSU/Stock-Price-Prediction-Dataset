I believe that there are currently no other chips using the 600 series, despite a whole series listed on ARMH's website.

You know, if I were to place ultimate blame, I would place it on Jen's loud mouth. Not only does he not have anything unique to loud mouth with, but after such a graphic lesson on IBM yielding all the value added to msft and intc, Jen started out by saying he would own the ARM proc market and create himself a monopoly. No oem would ever sign up to that, hence nobody big would go with nvda chips. As I said, next up: wearables. Space is more than at a premium, it is non-existing. Would be an interesting fight there.
