Nvidia positions itself at the premium end of the market, and it has served them well so far. They grew up in the video car business, where the rush to the bottom put half of their competitors out of business each generation. Not having a SoC priced for a $99 device is consistent. Is it possible to have a well-supported chip and make a profit at a sub-$10 selling price? That's what the SoC likely costs in a $100 device. $2-$4 of that goes to ARM for a core and GPU license, and $5+ for the chip and packaging. That leaves very little money for the design team, and no margin for the high cost of re-spinning a flawed design. I don't see $100 tablets as a profitable business for a SoC vendor. Only ARM and TSMC make money. Even $200 tablets only make sense if the chip is used in millions of them before an update is needed. Compare that to the automotive market, where Nvidia is quietly piling up design wins. The modules have higher reliability requirements, but you can sell the same high-margin design for a year or two, and keep the business for a decade.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1351009486858</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:24:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351010007070-15</Id><Topic><Title>come on Ibexx, what kind of stock is NVDA?</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1351006799478</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 11:39:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sell it because I'm unhappy? bull.....that is a defeatist way of life.....not happy? leave....come on man.

Then about 5 minutes later Apple announced the new iMac and confirmed that both had NVDA discrete graphics, sending NVDA back up to a high of the day. I'm cautiously optimistic.
