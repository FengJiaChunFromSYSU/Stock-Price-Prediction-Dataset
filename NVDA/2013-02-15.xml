This will gradually change, let's hope, beginning H2 of 2013 when the wireless gap is narrow. CEO Huang repeatedly stressed this point at the earnings cc . He said: nVidia needs 3 things to gain leadership in the mobile area: --Application processor (check) --Wireless processor/modern (4G LTE, working on it, this is where the OpEx goes) --Software stack (check, or at least NVIDIA is not handicapped) The fact that NVIDIA "appears" to go for tablets as a top priority is a false illusion. Smartphones, whether high end or midrange/low end, entails huge volumes; its total addressable market is at least 5 times greater than the projected volume for tablets in the next few years. Jen Hsun would love to have a bigger piece of this pie, but it will happen only when Grey (Tegra 4 + I500) is certified by major carriers and shipped. No amount of theorizing can conceal the fact that NVIDIA is trying to accomplish the same tasks on connectivity in 2-3 years while Qualcomm had 27 years to do it. I am very proud of what NVIDIA has done so far, but there is no denying that they are still behind. Qualcomm's recent bashing of NVIDIA was only valid on the connectivity part, not the app processor.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360916106168</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 03:15:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360920913636-5</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA Drops Into The 11's Tomorrow</Title><Username>jaysjazzy</Username><Timestamp>1360793505073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 17:11:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I watched and learned you are as clueless as they come... or are you getting paid to bash this stock?

Elemental pioneered the use of GPUs to optimize video streaming over IP networks, and we continue to innovate with new technologies designed to take best advantage of parallel processing architectures. Our new architecture harnesses the power of the latest NVIDIA Tesla GPU accelerators based on the Kepler architecture. Multiscreen Services Skyrocket Today’s news comes as pay TV operators, content owners and broadcasters work to expand their infrastructure to deliver multiscreen video. Multiscreen services are becoming critical to all these markets: Consumers are expected to double their IPTV subscriptions by 2016, according to market-researcher Infonetics. iPads and other smart tablets are seeing breakout sales. Sixty-five percent of US households will watch 58 billion hours of TV and video on the devices by 2017, according to market research firm TDG. Video infrastructure spending will reach $1 billion by 2016, Infonetics says. The secret sauce for successful multiscreen deployment: flexible software built on high-performance, programmable hardware.

Check out why Samsung, with their own proc. and cheap radio, is bring out multiple models with brcm totally integrated solutions. 2. still trying to go LTE LTE LTE - anybody who cares to do some google will find out even by 2015, 2G/3G is the overwhelming bulk of the market. And nvda ain,t got those 'cheap' radios. Hence nvda's accessible market is extremely small especially once you throw in aapl, samsung will never use nvda for high end.

From Exor Studios, Dead Arrival 2 features an array of custom weapons, including a minigun and rocket launcher, wrapped up in an industrial series of maps filled with snares and zombies. The game is played from a birds-eye perspective that looks similar to the Dead Ops Arcade map on Black Ops. The graphics have been ramped up for SHIELD’s ultra-powerful hardware. The upgrades for the Tegra 4 become more apparent when the enhancements are shut off via a toggle on the device, which is showcased in the video above. Dead Arrival 2 features dynamic shadows that transform realistically as the player moves, rather than the typical “baked-in” shadows often seen on mobile games. Other enhancements include physics added to items such as crates, which can be impacted by the player (shot with a rocket, for example), as well as realistic gore when zombies are annihilated. Because no zombie game would be complete without it, there’s also a multi-player mode, which allows gamers to play with other gamers online, or with other Shield-owning friends from the comfort of their own living room. and reader comments Lawrence H•12 hours ago− damn, thats now three games for this thing that look beyond freaking awesome...when the hell can i buy it?</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360941669972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:21:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360942417587-22</Id><Title>OT/WSJ today: Sox high dividend stocks with growth potential (posting this for our cash drooling friend)</Title><Msg>1.

These guys ( like myself) appeciate openness, multi-function and standardization of the PC platform, because we game on it, we trade -invest on it, we watch movies on it , we browse the internet , do email etc . The fact Shield is using Android should not be underestimated as a key buying motivation. I suspect that given a choice of single function mobile gaming v.s multi-function Shield gaming, it will be a no brainer for PC Gamers to choose Shield as the preferred mobile gaming device Now there is a very large segment that is used ot closed dedicated consoles and will buy the Sony / Nitendo device over Shield but those consumers are not in the bulls eye for NVDA NVDA is going after the addtional descretionary spend from PC gamers, to simply leverage the good will and trust established by NVDA with millions of PC gamers worldwide. So while overall PC sales slow, NVDA has found a way to leverage its install base and derive even more money from the same PC Gamer / consumer that AMD and INTC cannot. And Shield also enlarges tradtional GPU market share because AMD is locked out of Shield which will soon be crushed to an even greater extent regardless of GPU performance relative to NVDA GPUs Shield is a game changer in multiple dimensions and its potential contribution as both a revenue generator in it own right, and as an inducment to buy a NVDA GPU is not yet reflected in the stock I believe Shield will surprise many analysts in the coming months and add handsomely to its valuation</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360945344649-31</Id><Title>Look at the same cast of characters now so HAPPY to still be $12s BUT once said $26 wasn't enough</Title><Msg>They have NO CLUE what they're doing in Nvidia.

Is 350K per quarter what my fellow longs are hoping to be "high volume shipments"? If that number translates to $100M in revenue, I back-out an assumed ASP of $285, but it seems dubious that their BOM will be sub $140, so the decent margins you're expecting would still bring down the cumulative gross margin, unless they really do drive offsetting sales with GPUs that have above-average gross margins. I do think this possible/likely (see my post on thinking bundling of Shields with Kepler GPUs would make sense as part of their go-to-market strategy) but would presumably would only apply to a subset of the overall Shield sales (I hope). IMO I'd say "high volume shipments" would need to be ramping to at least 1M/quarter in the first full quarter of sales, and that the price will probably need to be $300. That's presumably part of the potential for great 2H revenue leverage that Huang discussed. My extreme bull case that has Shield turning into what I'd consider a true high volume success, is at least approaching the success had MSFT had with Kinect as an accessory device to XBox when it was first introduced in 2010. They had a larger install base with Xbox than Nvidia does with Kepler GPUs that support Shield, but they sold 480K devices in the first week &amp; something like 8 million in the first 60 days. Maybe a couple million in Q4?</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360946765549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:46:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360946872640-43</Id><Topic><Title>Why Shield has an likely opportunity for high volume shipments</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>correction, I think the price will need to be $300 to preserve the overall gross margins -- unless they're Q1 guidance will be that Q2 and the remainder of the year will see gross margin deterioration as Shield ramps sales.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360946872640</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360946927774-44</Id><Topic><Title>Why Shield has an likely opportunity for high volume shipments</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm trying to write " $300" as in greater than $300 but either I've made the typo twice in a row or Yahoo is editing out the caret.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360946927774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:48:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360946948283-45</Id><Topic><Title>Why Shield has an likely opportunity for high volume shipments</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>confirmed.

Currently all reports indicate that Microsoft plans to require a full-time internet connection for the Xbox720 to work to verify game licenses, which by all accounts will prohibit the use of used games and games released for the 360 and first gen Xbox. I believe Sony is planning the same for PS4. They will singlehandedly crush the sales of their own platforms, so I don't think NVDA is too worried. Granted that may change when they realize they wont sell many of their consoles, but the Tegra 4 is a mobile device SoC anyway. Your post is irrelevant. NVDA owns GPUs right now, as evidenced by their increase in market share from AMD. NVDA knows gaming.

Exactly like the Shield's 5 inch screen. But IPOD touch has a camera. Then look at the components because no phone parts. Also look at Moga game controller maybe $20 in parts. It just looks like a good proxy for a BOM cost from the Shield. Also take a look at the articles on the Shield. One saidthey are looking for a distributor in the UK....must be a good partner to sell to gamers. Note: Gamestop distributes in the US, Canada, and Europe but pulled out of the UK because all the retail stores going into bankruptcy sell stuff at a loss. Point being- It's being marketed to hard core gamers. You won't see Project Shield in the toy aisle at Walmart or at best buy. At least not at first. But what's wrong with selling 1.4M units a year at say $299 with a BOM cost of $140 and distributer costs of say $20. It will litterally cause the Tegra Processor Divisions revenue to grow 50% overnight. Plus the tie end with nvidia GPUs is priceless. Goodbuy AMD standalone gamer graphics.

I guess I should ask what your expectations are for Tegra in 2013. Do you see them matching the 50% growth from FY2013, slowing down, or accelerating? I'm looking at other consoles to try to benchmark what a "high volume" success would look like. Looking at Xbox and PS3 sales over their ~7 years since launch, both have racked up just over 75M unit sales, or just above 10M a year. That's an average of just over 2.5M a quarter for each of them, or 5M/quarter between the two. The Wii has shipped 99M units in 6 years, just over 4M per quarter on average. As far as handhelds go, the 3DS has sold 29M units in less than 2 years since it's release and SNE's PS Vita, widely accepted as a failure, sold 2M units in its first year. So between living room and handheld consoles, the 3 big incumbents have averaged over 13M units per quarter. What do you consider a big success for Nvidia? 2.5% of that market? That's what 350K a quarter suggests. Maybe that's a base or bear case if you really believe the product will be compelling. But 7-8% of that (which is what 1M is) doesn't seem so off base as a bull case to me.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360950968671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 12:56:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360951028657-70</Id><Title>Press: Forbes covers Shield Marketing / weekly Demos - comments overall positive -</Title><Msg>forbesDOTcom/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/02/15/this-is-tegra-4-powered-zombie-survival-on-nvidias-project-shield/ Text from Forbes artilce Nvidia has pulled the trigger on the Project Shield marketing machine. Twice weekly they’re taking to YouTube with extended looks at both traditional PC games streaming to the portable, and upcoming Android releases optimized for Tegra 4. Yesterday the team highlighted top-down zombie survival shooter Dead on Arrival 2 and the enhanced graphical capabilities the new chipset brings to the table. Nvidia has several members of the Project Shield group visiting game studios, helping them optimize their titles for Tegra 4. In the video below, we’re shown the fruits of those efforts between Nvidia and developer N3V. Even though the footage is off-screen and not direct feed, the enhancements are noticeable. Heavy cloth interacts realistically with the player as he walks through it, dynamic shadows cast from flashlights and enemies paint the scene with an eerie atmosphere, and crates tumble and explode realistically. Nvidia’s PhysX technology makes this possible. The Project SHIELD team also demonstrates Dead on Arrival 2 without Tegra 4 features, via a toggle which is most likely exclusive to these pre-release models. Suffice to say it looks bland, but I wonder if it was intentionally coded this way to underscore the Tegra 4′s superiority. Skepticism aside, what we’re shown here looks fantastic especially for a 1st generation game that’s still a work in progress. We still don’t have a release date for Project SHIELD and only a small handful of Tegra 4-enhanced games have been revealed, but it seems Nvidia’s weekly video blogs will be a reliable portal for more information.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360951028657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 12:57:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360951219295-71</Id><Title>Why are UP days an Nvidia success and DOWN days due to manipulation?</Title><Msg>Because Nvidia fans are in DENIAL?

Note: This assumes they will distribute to US and Canada the 1st quarter, UK and Europe the 2nd qtr, and Asia in the 3rd qtr out. So obviously it would be a ramp. Bottom line - $400M in revenue the 1st year and 150M operating income or $125M profit or 20 cents per share in earnings. Now that would be a huge success and analysts would jump up and take notice for sure.

If you like you can look at the BOM costs of Nintendo's latest hand held...$103 and add in higher quality component costs. I just convinced that the BOM costs will be below $150. One thing that people have to remember is nvidia is onlylaunching in the US and Canada the first quarter so sales probably will only be a few hundred thousand at best. But what is important to me is how it is accretive to earnings. Anything that might add 20% to earnings for a company is something that WS and funds will take notice of it looks like it is selling. Comparing the Shield to other products that aren't the same is a zero sum game to me. It's all about earnings.

Seems that'd be a bigger opportunity, arguably with a much bigger end market than hardcore gamers or 350K units a quarter, and would move many more Tegras. That's part of why I don't think the $150 BOM with everything featured in the Shield passes the sniff test. That said, I'd guess having the extra room allowed by the Shield form factor does make it cheaper overall by allowing them to have the battery and other components in the controller body, rather than behind the screen, making it easier/cheaper to put everything together in the unit. I certainly hope they're able to charge $300 or less and still make a nice profit.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360953978845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:46:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360954337327-89</Id><Topic><Title>Why Shield has an likely opportunity for high volume shipments</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agreed. but i and others that like to have models (e.g. analysts) stil need to model it somehow, other than just putting a big question mark for Shield going forward. i concede completely that using incumbent living room and mobile consoles isn't the only or best way to take a slice at it--and I'd happily welcome anyone sharing their approach to it.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360954337327</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:52:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360954353808-90</Id><Topic><Title>Number of game titles confirmed for OUYA: 481</Title><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1360953640957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:40:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>181 comments in less than 24 hours.

Do you know where all those models came from on Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. All the WS analysts used the same source....Mercury research. Tim Luke of Barclays even included the dominant number directly from the quarterly mercury research report. GPUs, GM, units, by performance category etc. It's still available to them and the public for $9500/yr. for 5 site licenses. But alas the market changed and in many ways the analysts are lost at sea. Oh they wish for the days of taking the report and then issuing buy or sell research notes based on the huge models they had built. Plus Intel, AMD, and Nvidia have all become here's our guidance hope you like it and then do not answer any questions. meanifully.

I handed you the guidance that all my execs. will be graded on to get their bonus and if they don't they won't get that bonus including me." Steve Sanghi of MCHP. So they have been reduced to channel checks? which is laughable and only get behind "Story Stocks". The story drives the MoMO stocks. Perhaps Nvidia is weaving the web with Grid and The Shield to become a "Story Stock". Ah then it doesn't matter what the models say when your the"Netflix of Gaming".

I've used that exact same approach on Nvidia myself, but essentially stopped about year ago because the business was changing so rapidly. Not to say I don't still model a little. I even got into a few small Baaken oil companies 4 years ago and was modeling oil production by well. Note: I knew nothing about the oil business at the time. Got lucky and made some money and then got out. Now I just look for companies that thave the potential to grow reasonably well that return capital to shareholders continuously so I won't be hurt or lose sleep if I'm wrong. Nvidia fits that bill for me. P.S It was the dividend and the share buybacks along with all that drooling cash (nod to Ibexx) that convinced me to buy back into Nvidia.

Nvidia’s mainstream LTE chip codenamed Grey, is expected to show up ahead of schedule. The 28nm A9 chip was expected in the latter part of 2013, but it looks like it might come a bit earlier. We are talking a few months ahead of schedule, not quarters. Grey has already won some design wins with phone manufacturers. It is not meant for high-end phones, this is what Tegra 4 + Icera 500 LTE is for. Grey should fit nicely into the mainstream performance market, for so-called runner up phones. We have heard that there are some phone designs from big manufacturers based on Grey. Nvidia always lacked a mainstream SoC and selling its last Tegra generation as a mainstream part didn't really work in the past. Tegra 3 completely overshadowed Tegra 2, and we practically didn’t seen any designs based on Tegra 2 after Tegra 3 showed up. Nvidia did make some cheaper Tegra 3 versions, like the one used in the Nexus 7 and other entry level products, but having a real dedicated chip for this market will definitely help Nvidia. The future for Grey as a cheaper LTE alternative to Tegra 4 looks good, as long as Nvidia can meet its original schedule. This chip is also Nvidia’s first crack at integrating a rather complex LTE modem on the core. Let’s see how it goes. Surely it can go a lot smoother than Tegra 4.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360963114262</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 16:18:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360963310960-118</Id><Topic><Title>Fudzilla says Grey (T3 + LTE) is months ahead of schedule, has designs</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360963114262</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 16:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"mainstream performance market" = high volume (hopefully) &amp; not competing as directly with Apple or Samsung Galaxy</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360963310960</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 16:21:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360965203342-119</Id><Title>Shield Market &amp; Games</Title><Msg>1. 481 Android Games ON THE GO W/WO WiFi - assuming what plays on Ouya plays Well on Shield just as well w Phsyxs 2. x00 PC Games W WiFi W GTi6xx - Desktop PC to Shield Play 3. ?

Following HP’s announcement of its first Chromebook, the company is allegedly working on its first Android tablet, according to two unnamed sources cited by Read Write’s Taylor Wimberly. Details are scarce, but the tablet will reportedly be a high-end product with an Nvidia Tegra 4 processor—not a budget tablet, in other words—and it could be announced in the coming weeks. "I think it's a smart move if HP can invest enough to differentiate itself within the Android ecosystem," says Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Strategy and Insights. How can HP do that? Moorhead has a suggestion that plays to the company's recent business-friendly focus. "Enterprise needs a hardened version of Android to feel safe about it as an operating system, particularly when it comes to things that have sensitive data, such as HIPAA, medical information, and government information," he says. "That's an area of differentiation that HP can bring to the table." pcworldDOTcom/article/2028168/why-hp-could-embrace-android-for-tablets.html</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360976471506</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 20:01:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360978899336-125</Id><Title>What is Nvidia's follow up to Kepler.

Since you've apparently blocked me, you won't be seeing this but thought to post here quickly when I have a chance. Be careful about what you assume about anyone on here with regard to your posts, ie I think you assume I'm a 'retail' trader with limited experience in trading or a non-critical perma bull regarding Nvidia or something like that. That isn't really the case but it doesn't matter at this point. The volume on the calls is interesting because it reflects what I suspected would be happening in the last half of this month as MWC approaches. Jen has been intentionally coy IMO and really is showing the wisdom of sharing less at the earnings CC's. I think the pattern is being set to continue to outperform estimates at every earnings report while underestimating every forthcoming quarter. Every road map shown by a company evolves and so is Nvidia's road map and it is really impossible to follow the exact plan for any company imo because of the hurdles just get harder as the performance benchmarks start pushing a limit imo which is why I think Apple and others rarely show their 'maps' to the public, just the results. These calls are anticipating news for sure. These next two weeks should be interesting. I'm expecting a couple of dips early next week before it surges up, perhaps over $14 the last week this month.

Dr. Paul Jacobs, the Chairman of QUALCOMM, did such a nice job giving the keynote address at the CES in Las Vegas, the Mobile World Congress people in Barcelona have chosen Dr. Paul Jabobs to also give the first-day luncheon keynote address. Here's the details. Keynote Address: "Vertical Disruption" Mon 25 Feb, 11:30 - 13:00 (Hall 4 - Conference Village - Auditorium 1) Dr. Paul E. Jacobs is chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of Qualcomm Incorporated. A leader in the field of mobile communications for over two decades and a key architect of Qualcomm’s strategic vision, Dr. Jacobs’ responsibilities include leadership and oversight of all the Company’s initiatives and operations. Through his technology innovations and advocacy, Dr. Jacobs spearheaded Qualcomm’s efforts to develop and commercialize mobile technology breakthroughs that have contributed significantly to the growth of both the Company and the industry. Important developments which began under Dr. Jacobs include: the first smartphone based on Palm OS®; inclusion of GPS capabilities in mobile phones (which led to the acquisition of SnapTrack™ and Qualcomm's development of gpsOne™ position-location technology); the Brew® system, which enables over-the-air downloading of applications; QChat, a Voice over IP, push-to-talk system; and mirasol®, an advanced reflective display technology. Following the completion of his Ph.D. in 1989 and a year as a post-doctoral researcher at a French government lab in Toulouse, Dr. Jacobs joined the Company fulltime in 1990 as a development engineer leading the mobile phone digital signal processor software team. Five years later, Dr. Jacobs became vice president and general manager of the combined handset and integrated circuit division, which was subsequently divided into Qualcomm Consumer Products (QCP) and QCT, respectively. In 1996, Dr. Jacobs was named senior vice president of the Company and in 1997, president of QCP. Under Dr. Jacobs, QCP (prior to its sale to Kyocera Wireless in 2000) moved into the No. 2 CDMA handset supplier position in the U.S. In 2000, Dr. Jacobs was named executive vice president of Qualcomm and in 2001, group president of Qualcomm Wireless &amp; Internet (QWI), where he oversaw Qualcomm Technology Licensing, Qualcomm Internet Services, MediaFLO USA Inc. and MediaFLO technology development, Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, Qualcomm Enterprise Services, Qualcomm Government Technologies and Qualcomm Technology &amp; Ventures. As Qualcomm executive vice president, he was also responsible for administering the Company's corporate marketing functions and standards organization. Dr. Jacobs became CEO in July 2005 and was appointed Chairman in 2009. As an innovative leader of a broad range of technical teams within Qualcomm, Dr. Jacobs has been granted more than 40 patents for his inventions in the areas of wireless technology and devices. Dr. Jacobs is chairman of the U.S.-Korea Business Council and of the Advisory Board of the University of California, Berkeley, College of Engineering; trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; and a member of the US-India CEO Forum and the Young President's Organization. Dr. Jacobs received his bachelor's (1984) and master's (1986) degrees as well as his doctorate (1989) in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and subsequently endowed the Paul and Stacy Jacobs Distinguished Professor of Engineering chair at the school. He is a member of the Phi Beta Kappa, Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi honor societies. Dr. Jacobs is a recipient of a number of industry, academic and corporate leadership awards: 2007 - 2010 Institutional Investor, List of America’s Best (Telecom Sector) - Best CEO 2008 Berkeley Engineering Innovation Award 2008 Radio Club of America, The Sarnoff Citation 2009 IEEE CASS Industrial Pioneer Award 2010 Higginbotham Corporate Leadership Award 2011 Laptop Magazine, 25 Most Influential People in Mobile 2011 NCAFP Global Business Leadership Award</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1360984487755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 22:14:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360985195836-131</Id><Topic><Title>What is Nvidia's follow up to Kepler.

I just re-watched most of the keynote from CES to see if I missed anything about Grey. Unless I missed it again, I don't think Jensen discussed Grey when talking about Tegra/Icera (nor when talking about Grid or Shield)--he focused on Tegra 4 (as quad A15s) and a separate i500... the slide actually shows them as two parts. Did he mention "Grey" or a tegra with a built-in Icera modem in a Q&amp;A after the keynote that you saw or read about (or attended)? I'm still saying the first iteration of Grey is reported to be "Tegra 3" but I guess to be more specific, my understanding is that the first Tegra processor to come to market with an integrated modem is going to still be quad-A9s (not A15s), but built on 28nm instead of 40nm, with an integrated icera modem. But they can call that part of the Tegra 4 family if they want, since it's just branding, and maybe that'll make more sense. I'd be pleased to learn that they're actually going to be able to bring Tegra 4 (as in quadcore A15s) with an integrated Icera modem ahead of schedule, but I thought they were only talking about the Tegra 4 as being the new quadcore A15s.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360986628792</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 22:50:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360986729751-134</Id><Topic><Title>Sizeable volume in $13.50, $14 calls expiring next friday</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360970457490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 18:20:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Okay, you know the post isn't mean-spirited or critical of you and you just need to respond without reading the rest?

You have plenty of information and are clearly digging into as many sources as you can for Nvidia which is good.

If I got the same comment, I wouldn't have thought it was patronizing at all. You seem to be pretty young because your sensitivity to any criticism is really high. " sounds pretty critical to me--you call me thin-skinned, insecure, young (in a pejorative way), overly sensitive, suggest I should be spending time writing SA articles (?) instead of posting, and earlier you called me emotional and defensive. the comment i said was patronizing was you commenting something like "sounds like a positive, right" when clearly it was positive, and i was going out of my way to add reporting on the company's clarification of guidance for the forum's benefit. i believe the OP had not seen the clarification about it being calendar Q2, not fiscal, so i was overtly sharing the positive correction with others, and assumed you must have realized this before writing your comment. if you didn't, i guess it wasn't as patronizing as i perceived it, but keep in mind, that was after you responded to one of my comments saying that you assumed a typo of me referring to Q2 instead of Q1 was the entire basis for the concerns/disappointments that i took the time to thoroughly explain and no one else was able to constructively refute. i said i found that annoying/frustrating, and i stand by that. then in another post you say you sold some nvidia stock in spite of what you've portrayed as strick confidence in Nvidia. Ok, that's up to you -- but it is kind of funny when you criticize Ashraf for sounding too focused on the near-term, and seemed to react emotionally yourself to fellow longs (like myself) identifying concerns about what the company guided. fine if you don't think change in guidance and strategy matters (e.g. the company saying the discrete modem market is disappearing when it's clearly not), but you basically just refused to acknowledge the points and instead made personal criticisms about me and others... and yeah, it did sound like psychological projection. as does your apparent need to continue posting to me, but i'm willing to accept that i'm just annoyed with you and overly sensitive to your prods at this point (which is why i continue to be fine with you ignoring me). so for the record, since I don't have any problem with transparency: you're right about me being relatively young, i guess. I'm 28. You can find information about me pretty easily online since i try to make it a general rule to always use my real name and be transparent. I've been investing/trading full-time since leaving Facebook in June 2010. I went there straight out of college, where i got degrees in psychology, economics, and an MS in management science and engineering (stanford's rough approximation of an MBA-lite). I was the revenue/monetization analyst at FB for ~2 years then worked ~2 years as a software engineer on monetization products. then i left because frankly my fb stock meant i didn't have to work for anyone anymore. i started investing in the public markets heavily in 2010 after selling some of my fb stock and deciding angel investments weren't for me and that i didn't particularly enjoy writing code all day. i'd rather analyze public companies, build my own predictions, and make trades when I think i've identified dislocations in value due to analysts and/or investors not understanding something that i do. so i spend lots of time following the companies i invest or trade in, and i build models that are as detailed as possible, and try to keep track of as many details as possible. it's served me pretty well, i've had some massive wins and have generally made a point of sharing my analysis publicly and trying to get as much critical feedback on the actual research/analysis as possible. my biggest win by far was correctly calling the Motorola acquisition months before it happened--and that only came because i was following Google extremely closely, watched the Nortel IP auction play out, then searched for companies with the IP Google needed. That's roughly the time I started having more conviction on Nvidia (first as an Android play, but not an acquisition target)... so it's now since about May 2011 that i've been following nvidia extremely closely. i believe more closely than most analysts or investors, since i have the time to follow details very closely that others don't. criticize that if you'd like, i don't really care.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360989766938</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 23:42:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360989853764-138</Id><Topic><Title>Sizeable volume in $13.50, $14 calls expiring next friday</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360970457490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 18:20:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm not sure what's the reason for suddenly posting so much on this board when you could be putting together articles for SA instead which is what I thought you had been doing." I haven't seen Josh post any articles on S/A. Josh has probably just become interested in Nvidia, invested in it, has some time and trying to learn more. Ashraf is the S/A writer and he's making a good living at it one click at a time. Excellent writing skills and quite prolific. Not sure if his investment advice is any good though but that's not what S/A is for. Just an aside and don't laugh...I am going to praise something that Motley Fool does but you might already know about it. Notice it years ago but don't look there anymore. They have a section where unpaid writers post their trades and then a system that ranks those trades against indices. That way when reading posted articles recommending certain stocks etc. one can see how well their recommendations have been. Wish S/A would do the same but again that's not what S/A is for. It's a media operation like all websites supported by google sense. What I have noticed after about a year or so their top writers move on to paid salary writing positions at other web sites such as "The Street" or "Forbes" or set up their own Blogs and run their own google adsense business. I'm referring to the Journalists not the investment advisers that are trolling for customers.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360989853764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 23:44:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
