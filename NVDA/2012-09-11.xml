I don't think this would be strategic, unless the T3 provided significant cost savings and/or the other chips were supply-constrained. Maybe in future cycles Apple and Nvidia will work together so that Nvidia can provide a Kepler GPU for a future generation of Apple's chips. I guess theoretically there could be surprise news that Kepler is already the GPU in the A6, but again I think the probability of that is nearly zero. Thus far, Apple has been using completely different GPU technology via Imagination Technology.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1347377440448</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:30:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378047425-26</Id><Title>Looking for another entry at 13.25 today</Title><Msg>Looks like she might head back down. could be triple shooting star, straight through 12.5 - 12.75</Msg><Username>stockguy123456</Username><Timestamp>1347378047425</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378217542-27</Id><Title>WEEEEEE! ,plop......typical</Title><Msg>Shooting star pattern, dangerous Bear signal coming after today</Msg><Username>stockguy123456</Username><Timestamp>1347378217542</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378479040-28</Id><Title>come on stupid support...I want 13.25 again...</Title><Msg>come on babyyyyyyy</Msg><Username>stockguy123456</Username><Timestamp>1347378479040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:47:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378512062-29</Id><Title>Amazon fell back to pre-Kindle Fire HD levels....almost</Title><Msg>I wonder why????

The Texas Instruments 4460 processor inside the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD is actually pretty old. It didn't take me long to find some real benchmarks for the chip. Since the Google Nexus 7 tablet is the main competition for the 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, the processor benchmarks show the Nvidia (NVDA) Tegra 3 chip out-performs the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD Texas Instruments (TXN) 4460 chip by 85-192%. On graphics benchmarks, the Google Nexus 7 Tegra 3 chip beats the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD Texas Instruments 4460 chip by 52-53%. OMAP 4460 inside the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD is likely to end up slower since it's pretty much the same chip that we tested in Galaxy Nexus last year. It ends up significantly slower in most benchmarks than the latest flagship phones.</Msg><Username>alwasontop</Username><Timestamp>1347398140326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 17:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347406562106-53</Id><Title>Is Microsoft making a gaming holodeck for your home?</Title><Msg>According to a patent filed by Microsoft, it looks like the video games of the future could take over our entire living rooms — holodeck style. Microsoft has filed a patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for "an interactive computing system configured to provide an immersive display experience." That immersive display experience means that the games you play would be projected on all four walls of your living room. How would this work? For a sneak peek, see the images above and below, which Microsoft submitted to the patent office. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office/Microsoft Microsoft summarizes what it's working on like this: "An immersive display environment is provided to a human user by projecting a peripheral image onto environmental surfaces around the user. The peripheral images serve as an extension to a primary image displayed on a primary display." What that means is, while the player is focused on the primary display — both the TV and the wall in front — "they may be aware of an approaching video game enemy" from the images displayed on the surfaces around them, reads the patent. Meanwhile, "the user may turn around and observe an enemy sneaking up from behind." The lengthy patent submission says the system would include: an "interactive computing system" (i.e. a game console), an "environmental display device" (for projecting the images on the walls around you), a "depth camera" and a "user tracking device" — the latter of which refers to the Kinect-looking gadget pictured in the top image. Meanwhile, according to the patent submission, 3-D headgear may (or may not) also be used with the system. How far off in the future we might see this new gaming experience isn't clear; nor is it clear whether this is a project Microsoft is working on in conjunction with its next home game machine. But the patent filing has certianly added fuel to the rumors already flying around that yet-to-be-revealed machine — which has been dubbed the Xbox 720. One thing is for sure, Microsoft is very interested in finding more immersive ways for you to experience your video games. Earlier this year, documents were leaked that purported to show off Microsoft's new game machine as well as the next generation of Kinect — a system that would make use of augmented reality glasses. And Microsoft's not alone. The Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles (see video below) have been gaining a lot of buzz and a lot of support in the gaming community. Meanwhile, these students are working on a holodeck project of their own. After all, who doesn't want to live the holodeck dream?</Msg><Username>btpuckfan</Username><Timestamp>1347406562106</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347409688462-54</Id><Topic><Title>To the bashers who says nexus 10 going to samsung eyxnos, Tegra going into ipad mini !</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347374054582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:34:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must be dreaming.
