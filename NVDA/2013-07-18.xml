Precious 14nm technology allocated for Low ASP Low Margin Mobile products is a winning strategy? The X86 architecture no matter how much they try to reinvent it is just plain inefficient in many ways. The new CEO will step down in 2 years if the board is doing their job - he oversold his strategy to get the job BUT nothing will happen since he is simply told them what they wanted to hear. Intel will shrink - not completely but it will. Nvidia had done a great job reinventing themselves and it helps tremendously that they are relatively small to start with. It's not completed yet but they are pretty close. Imagine 20% of intel revenue coming from mobile and tablets.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1374127326330</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 02:02:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374129209828-4</Id><Title>New York Times' David Pogue reviews OUYA (must read!, it's fun)</Title><Msg>SOURCE: NYTimes, July 17 The ending paragraphs: ""So yes, the company will spend the coming months running around stomping bugs, and game creators need time to dream up more offbeat winners.

It took me months to realize that I was wrong about it being a major market. Way more people have TVs than TV studios. Far more people have ipods than guitars. Content consumption is the major market. I was even wrong about them being useful tools. We are now in the early days of tablets becoming productivity devices. They make lousy keyboard, but OK keypads. They are good at checkbox lists, and excel at structured reports like home inspections where a mash-up of boilerplate text, a limited amount of new text and pictures are combined.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1374167496156</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:11:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374167594468-42</Id><Topic><Title>AMD sells x86 CPUs too, why is the MARKET Giving AMD a Free Pass this AM?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374157749827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:29:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did AMD open HIGHER or what?

This time, he’s dogging Intel. “You’ll see a whole bunch of tablets based on Snapdragon 800 in the market this year,” he told Bloomberg. “There’s a lot of talk about Intel and tablets. Clearly we see them still being far behind in mobile.” Them’s fightin’ words, as they say. He added that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors have a balance of battery life preservation and strong processing, communications, video, graphics, and more, which he says Intel doesn’t have. Of course, this is merely so much bluster at this point; neither Intel nor Qualcomm are exactly winning the mobile market. However, it’s good that they’re both making efforts in that vein, because juggernauts like Apple and Samsung could benefit from more competition. It’s also a little unusual for a company to talk this much trash publicly about a competitor--or should we say to a competitor--but it’s actually somewhat refreshing. The harsh words are a challenge, and when big companies challenge each other, they tend to make more competitive products, which benefits consumers in every way. Have at it, Raj. _______ It seems that the more QC does this kind of defensive talk, the more its stock falls.....look no further than today's trading.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374170743253</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:05:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374178109942-49</Id><Topic><Title>Intel - A Tap Dancing Mammoth - NOT</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1374127326330</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 02:02:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes all the sense in the world.

That doesn't hold much water based on research. So far, they have generally been used for less efficiency-critical parts, but it doesn't have to be that way. We'll see with Bay Trail. The signs this year are good. As for low ASP parts, you have to wonder about INTC's overcapacity at the moment. If they don't have some contract with Apple ready to go (I doubt that they do, but the rumors won't die, will they?) then there is little reason not to try to flood the market and take everyone else's margins. Might as well run over 90% capacity, right? If you can sell twice the goods at the half the margin, your accounts look the same. Everyone else's accounts, however... that is a different story. So, I wouldn't not look to INTC to leave their plants half-empty.

We believe Intel has had to guide down so frequently because its full-year outlooks have been too high. We attribute this to management struggling to accept how cannibalistic tablets and handsets are to PCs. (2) Even though Intel guided down, we believe there is further risk. Intel’s implied 4Q13 sales growth is up 6-7% qoq, a number it has achieved only once in the last five years. (3) Intel’s implied 4Q13 gross margin guidance is flat to down, which we have long argued is the metric that the stock is best correlated with . We believe many investors were looking for sequential growth in margins for the rest of 2013 and into 2014, so even if Intel is able to hit its revenue targets, potentially lower margins will be a headwind. (4) We believe the stock is expensive, as it was already trading at 13X forward consensus EPS despite secular challenges, and Street estimates are likely to move lower post the call. As we have written previously, Intel would need to fully reset both its P&amp;L guidance and spend significantly less on capex for us to be more positive.” _____ I include here only comments from GS because (like it or not) they have the most influence on market.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374183901198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 17:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374184630251-57</Id><Topic><Title>OUYA overtakes Xbox One in Amazon sales ranking, PS4 remains close to the top</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374183303949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 17:35:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Arent the PS4 and the Xbox One pre-orders?

Does anyone here have a clue why HEADCASE is bashing every other tech on the planet on the Nvidia message board and then gets upset when fans of those other techs call him on his BS? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374202325781</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:52:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374202582172-66</Id><Title>All that Bashing aimed at the other techs can only mean Nvidia was DOWN today right?</Title><Msg>Does anyone care about Nvidis anymore? lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374202582172</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374202836504-67</Id><Title>Don't look now but the ONLY post with "Nvidia" in the title are the ones I put up. lol</Title><Msg>No one wants to talk about Nvidia on the Nvidia board can only mean Nvidia sucks.

Its productive life is far from being over. Below is a short list of these new products - definitely not all inclusive: --OUYA microconsole - introduced in late June, 2013 --XOLO Play T1000 - introduced in July, 2013 in India for the mass market --Toshiba Excite Pure 7" tablet - introduced in US, Canada, Germany, France, UK last week, July 2013 --Hisense Sero 7" Pro - introduced in late May/early June, available at Walmart --Wikipad gaming tablet - refreshed version introduced in June, 2013 --Nabi XD 10" tablet - tablet for younger users, just received Editor's Choice Award from major tech site, -introduced in June, 2013 --ASUS memo 10: touchscreen tablet - introduced in June to global market (available at Walmart) Last, but not the least, Nexus is still entering new markets in devloping countries almost every month or every other month! I expect N7 will continue its popularity after N7 2 launch because of TegraZone and the device's gaming capability - cheaper too. This list also does not include the numerous white-box tablets being made and sold in China.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374202884470</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 23:01:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374203549320-69</Id><Topic><Title>A HEADCASE is Trying to BS this board about Ouya vs Xbox One and PS4.</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374108320136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 20:45:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HEADCASE is still trying to BS this board about Ouya. He PRETENDS NOT TO KNOW that PS4 and Xbox One are NOT AVAILABLE and won't be for several months. He routinely drops any mention of PRE-ORDER when talking about PS4 and Xbox One sales. lol Why? We all know the PS4 and Xbox One will trounce Ouya when it actually goes on sale. The Launch Day and Day One PRE-ORDER Editons are waiting list only now. Even the CEO of Ouya isn't claiming that Ouya will challenge PS4 and Xbox One in sales, she is no fool. Why is HEADCASE trying to fool this board? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374203549320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 23:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374205051367-70</Id><Title>Why Won't HEADCASE Bash INTC, QCOM, AAPL, MSFT, SNE and AMD on Their Boards?</Title><Msg>I he wants to bash other techs why is he doing that BS here? Is he afraid to post his "claims" on the other boards? Do you see me CRITIQUING AAPL, INTC, AMD, QCOM, , BRCM, GOOG, Xbox One, PS4, Next Nexus here on the Nvidia board? Is the Nvidia board to discuss Nvidia or bash every other tech that sells a chip? Now I said discuss Nvidia not post love letters to Jen and Company. Do you really want fans of all those other techs getting into an open debate with HEADCASE on the Nvidia board over all the made up BS he throws up here? How many times have I challenged the made up nonsense and mindless BASHING he post? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374205051367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 23:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
