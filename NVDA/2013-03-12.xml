Bouygues Telecom launched the service in July, to their new BBox Sensation users, and are currently expanding to their legacy customers. What has the adoption rate been among the subscribers? It’s still in the early days of the service, but initial results are extremely strong. Over one in ten users who get exposed to the service end up signing up for the Playcast service. What games are available? Playcast has partnerships with game publishers like Capcom, Codemasters, Atari, Disney, Sega, THQ and Warner Bros. Titles include “Street Fighter”, “Sonic Generations”, “Batman – Arkham City”, “Homefront”, “Test Drive Unlimited 2” and “Lego Batman.” It’s been reported that Playcast will be available in the United States this year, do you have any updates? We do anticipate a launch in the US, and are in talks with several major players.

Tegra 5 (Logan) to reature Kepler GPU, Tegra 6 gets Maxwell</Title><Msg>At this year’s CES conference, NVIDIA unveiled their latest mobile SOC Tegra 4 equipped with a Quad Core Cortex-A15 CPU and 72 GeForce class GPU cores. The chip has not been released to public yet and we have already got the first details on NVIDIA’s next-generation Tegra chip thanks to Sweclockers. NVIDIA Tegra 5 SOC To Get Kepler GPU Architecture According to the Sweclockers, the NVIDIA Tegra 5 SOC which would be codenamed “Logan” would feature NVIDIA’s latest Kepler GPU architecture. The addition of Kepler architecture on NVIDIA Tegra 5 would drop the need of separate pixel and vertex shaders and instead feature a unified architecture. This is the similar to what NVIDIA did with their GeForce 600 series lineup at launch by dropping the hot-clocks leaving only the GPU and memory clocks intact, this also resulted in 3 times the higher core count in Kepler generation of GPUs compared to Fermi. In return, the NVIDIA Tegra 5 chip featuring the Kepler architecture would become much more efficient by churning out better performance consuming much lower power. Compared to Tegra 4 “Wayne” which comes with 72 cores (48 pixel and 24 vertex shaders), the NVIDIA Tegra 5 SOC if comes with even one or two Kepler SMX units would result in 192 – 384 GPU cores. This would definitely be a drastic improvement over Tegra 4. The source also mentions that the move to Kepler architecture by NVIDIA is due to limited memory bandwidth available to the GPU on the current Tegra chips. Kepler did improve NVIDIA on the memory front boasting chips rated at 6 GB/s, so we would be looking at something similar from the mobile front in the future.

Anyone who thinks that AAPL will NEVER use NVDA (even while they DO use them in laptops, etc.) for future phones, tablets, phablets, gaming devices, etc, is simply mistaken. Cook is a "manager" not an egocentric inventor like Jobs. And, to that very point, why would a firm like Susquehanna, and the other HFT firms risk MILLIONS by being short a stock that is near a multi-year low, but above its 50DMA and probably will still be above the 200DMA at day's end, JUST to make a few 100k dollars being short calls? It makes NO sense to me, and this ridiculously low volume is like "the calm before the storm". We, and they, are ONE headline away from a MAJOR move higher with HUGE volume and they could be nearly wiped out if we had another move like in 2011. And, I for one, believe we are on the precipice of just such a move and it could happen at ANY time. And, for long term holder, Mslans, I still think we'll see at least ONE move to 13, or higher, before this week is out, and those shorts WILL get nervous if we get back over 12.85 or so. 1PM volume was only 3.194mm shares, and that will NOT continue.

Agawi True Cloud requires only one version of a game to ever be written in the cloud, and we can make it accessible on any post-PC era device—meaning that one game can reach an exponentially larger audience on tablets, phablets, TVs and next generation game devices like Project Shield.” With over four million gamers and 250 million minutes streamed thus far, Agawi is now opening up the cloud even more by integrating True Cloud with NVIDIA’s groundbreaking new GRID processors that allow up to 12 parallel GPUs. GRID excels in graphics quality and can serve dozens of game streams simultaneously from one server, providing an economic solution with the power to revolutionize the entire market. “By incorporating GRID servers, Agawi’s True Cloud is realizing the dream of gaming on any device, anywhere,” said Phil Eisler, general manager of NVIDIA GRID cloud gaming at NVIDIA. “The 12 GPUs found inside GRID K340 servers are designed to enable the smooth, seamless interactive experience of a high-performance gaming PC on mobile devices and unlock the cloud as the universal vehicle for fast and economical gaming.” Blue Box, PEER 1 and XO Communications have partnered with Agawi to streamline across cloud service providers, management service providers and colocation centers. The True Cloud architecture will eliminate heavy data storage and costs, making it increasingly affordable for game publishers to stream their games and for users to play titles instantly, from social to mid-core to AAA."

Two things stand out. First, if you look at the intraday chart, you'll see one of THE most amazing "reverse head and shoulders" patterns that you'll EVER see in one day in a stock. Truly classic. Second, the late volume surge, AGAIN, coinciding with the rally back to new highs for the day. And, wow, those shorts put a LOT of BIG blocks in the way, and were finally able to knock the stock off the high by a few cents in the last few minutes. But, at 1PM, we had only 3.199mm shares and the stock was near the low of the day, at 12.57-58. Then, at 3PM, we only had 4.303mm, with the stock at 12.62-63, both LESS than yesterday. Even at 3:30, there was only 4.893mm, but the stock was about unched at 12.69-70. Then 5.138mm at 3:40, the stock 12.72-3, trying for a new high for the day.. That's when the volume REALLY spiked, and by 3:50 we had 5.919mm and the stock was at the high so far at 12.76-77. We hit 12.78 with a few minutes to go, but the Bears had to use 1.75mm MORE shares to keep the stock from moving higher and we finished with 7.7mm shares, MORE than yesterday. To ME, that's a "tell", and why I still think we will see 13 or higher, sometime before the week ends. Perhaps some MORE "chatter" will come from the Tech Press about GTC...;) I remember reading a book when I was a teenager, in French..."Les Jeux Sont Fait"....or "The Chips are Down"...nice pun, but really meaning Let the Games Begin...the "chips" are ON the TABLE...I couldn't help thinking about that book, the last few days, and today really looked like "Game ON, Boys and Girls", and all we need is a little MORE volume, ONE headline....ANYTHING, and we'll see the volume return to 10-15-20mm shares in a heartbeat, and the stock will soar. So, for my "friend" (I hope) Mslans, I've seen this "game" before, and the set up is truly compelling, at least to me. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I really suspect Nvidia is serious about cutting the share count significantly because they are confident about the business going forward. The share count dropped for the first time from one quarter to the next in 4 years. This is a big deal!

Then Susquehanna issued a sell opinion Monday morning (No reason, No Price Target) to return an old favor to the unnamed investment bank. I'm sure stranger things have happened. Besides.....those High Frequency Trading Algorithms can be programed to go up as well as down I would think. Who knows...but when investment banks proudly say every quarter that their trading desks made money every day except 1 or 2 days in the quarter.....anything is possible. Something is coming out March 19th and I'm sure the Investment bank wants to be even by Friday!

The stock buyback to me is matter of CONFIDENCE in the business going forward. I have followed Nvidia for years and traded the stock since 2009. The hit on the early failures on some GPUs in 2008 was a real shock to the company. Cash was cut in half and the stock dropped by a factor of 3. Thankfully I didn't own any stock then. Then along came the Intel squable and Nvidia's whole existence was threatened by Intel. PC makers were told if you use Nvidia chipsets no Intel CPUs for you. Nvidia came up with ION as a discrete gpiu and Apple stood by them with the original MacAir. Then for around 6 months vague rumors were floated in the Tech Press about Nvidia making an X86 CPU and what was all that hiring of former Transmeta employees doing at Nvidia. Nvidia filed a Lawsuit and Intel caved a week before the Jury was to be empaneled. Nvidia settled and said thank you very much for the $1.5B and I promise never to make an x86 CPU....but silently must have laughed all the way to the bank because voila within 2 months Tegra an ARM chip was born. So growing up is the wrong way to put....It's more like "We are Home Now" and Intel can't hurt us no more because High Cost CPUs are dinosaurs in consumer PCs except in Luxury laptops like Apple's, Gaming PC's, and Servers. Besides the Geekbench2 benchmarks prove that current generations of Intel I3 and I5 mobile processors are not all that great when an ARM based Tegra 4 can equal them for 1/10th the cost. Now Nvidia is in to so many new businesses along with Tegra mobile processors that even if the other 800 lb chipzilla QCOM delays adoption of Tegra 4 in phones Nvidia is in the best shape it has been in 5 years with a huge pile of cash....Over $6 a share. Hence the dividend and the on-going share buybacks.They have confidence going forward in the cash flow. Perhaps Tim Cook of Apple just doesn't see as rosy future for his company as Jensen does for his!

This week, the company's CEO has announced that it has stopped taking pre-orders for the Razer Edge Pro due to high demand. In a post on his Facebook page, CEO Min-Liang Tan stated: We've had to stop taking pre-orders for the Razer Edge Pro as the pre-orders have gone beyond our foreseeable manufacturing capacity (i.e. all stock is sold out for the months to come) ... We're doing everything we can to get more units out in the coming months. We appreciate the patience. The post did not state how many units of the Razer Edge Pro were ordered. Just a reminder: the 10.1 tablet has a Intel Core i7 processor, an an NVIDIA GT640M LE GPU and 8GB of DDR3 RAM. A 128GB version was being sold for $1,299 while a 256GB version was selling for for $1,499. Tan did say that there were very limited amounts of the cheaper Razer Edge tablet that are still available for sale on Razer's website. It is priced at $999 and comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, an NVIDIA GT640M LE GPU, 4GB of DDR3 RAM, and a 64GB SSD. Razer is also selling some accessories for both tablets including the Gamepad Controller for $249.99 that adds two game controllers, one on either side of the tablet. _______ Harbinger of good things to come for mobile gaming! Project Shield should command very favorable pricing IMHO.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363138017638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363138259080-71</Id><Topic><Title>Gaming Win 8 tablet, Razor Edge Pro, pre-order sales halted due to high demand (Win 8, Intel Core i5, NVIDIA graphics)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363138017638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:26:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Source: neowinDOTnet/news/windows-8-based-razer-edge-pro-tablet-pre-orders-halted-due-to-high-demand?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363138259080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:30:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363140760448-72</Id><Title>So what happens when Nvidia graphics marketshare drops to 10% from 16%</Title><Msg>by the end of this year.
