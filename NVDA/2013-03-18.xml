If so these costs are only what they are putting in. The cost structure is likely very different for everyone else. If they stream single player story games. Most are only 8-16 hr games. so lets say 16 hr game at 40 cents an hour is only $6.40. If they charge more for it than that they would make money. and it says the costs will be halved quickly so profits would get much better.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1363595802883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 04:36:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363600260256-2</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed NVDA Research Report !</Title><Username>danieljones497</Username><Timestamp>1363186107555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 10:48:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome report !</Msg><Username>hoy.melissa</Username><Timestamp>1363600260256</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 05:51:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363608607687-3</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's Tizen OS could make Google Nervous</Title><Username>followon</Username><Timestamp>1363574234747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 22:37:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure Samsung would like to be 100% vertical, but doesn't realize their limitations.

Combined with increased security and system manageability, NVIDIA GRID delivers the most flexible, accelerated VDI experience for end users. In addition to the demos, Supermicro executives will present strategies and server architecture designs to consider when selecting GPU platforms for HPC, cloud and workstation applications.

So, I missed today's "action", which from what I can see was INaction, but, yes, I DO think the long Bear Market in NVDA is ending, but whether it takes another day, a week, or longer, I certainly can't say. The volume has completely vanished, again, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The stock certainly has become the plaything of HF Traders, and other than that, it still could be that the company is buying back stock and using a major firm to do that for them, and those folks could be holding the stock DOWN in order to get the company as much stock as possible at the lowest price possible. This, of course, would be VERY GOOD for the company, and by extension, its shareholders, in the long run. The GTC SHOULD be a catalyst for more volume, I would think, and higher prices.

Despite showing off a wide array of upcoming games, the new DualShock controller and talking about some of the cool social technology that's going to be integrated, Sony decided that now wasn't the time to show the actual console. In a recent interview with the BBC, Kaz Kirai, the CEO of Sony, stated that the decision was made because "we still have a long way to go before the actual product launch and there are going to be a lot of opportunities for us to talk about and provide additional details on the PS4." "It wasn't actually a launch, we just talked about the console and there will be more information to come. It keeps people guessing and that's a good thing." It's rumoured that Sony will use E3 as a stage to show off the PS4, as they will have a dedicated platform with the majority of the world's media focussed in. It would also be the ideal time for them to show off the hardware to media outlets during the remainder of the show.
