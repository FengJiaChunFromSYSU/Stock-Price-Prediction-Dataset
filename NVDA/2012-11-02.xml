You can bet that One X+ leaves S3 in dust. The android phone torch has been firmly passed from S3 to One X+.

First, they bill Astronomical Amounts for all of their multi-continent litigation against Google's antitrust behavior. And then they iCollect THREE TIMES (3x) their total legal fees from Google. On behalf of their aggrieved and damaged client -- Apple.

After the U.S. Federal Trade Commissions sues Google, and a judge finds them guilty of their bad antitrust behavior, and their aggrieved and damaged competitors Apple, Microsoft, Oracle et al. received Trebled damages from Google -- that android operating system isn't likely to be free anymore, right Best?. Google will have to charge for it. A lot. To recover their bazillions in fines. And if android is no longer free, the OEM cellphone makers aren't going to use it much because, well, it isn't free anymore. And without free android, nvidia's 00.90% market share for cellphone processors will plunge even lower. So indirectly, Google's bad antitrust behavor kills off the nvidia Tegra folly.</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1351864985040</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:03:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>22</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351867581438-8</Id><Title>gotta love options manipulation</Title><Msg>too obvious</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1351867581438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:46:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351912334399-9</Id><Topic><Title>Oh my.

Those plunging sales numbers forecast for the tegra-powered Nexus 7. 833,000 __ November 2012 397,000 __ December 2012 Is that due to the imminent arrival of that new high volume $99 Nexus 7 tablet? Which will use a China-based WonderMedia Technologies PRIZM WM8950 single-core 800 MHz Cortex-A9 CPU with Mali-400 Graphics Processing Unit -- instead of the current nvidia Tegra 3. Causing the aforementioned Precipitous Plunge in the sales of that old legacy Nexus 7 tablet. {CLINK clink clink clink, bink bink} The Tegra gets kicked to the curb.
