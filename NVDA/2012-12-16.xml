I've lost track. Of the number of of spec sheet-less, working prototype-less and most importantly, Launch Partner-less announcements for the badly delayed Wayne. There oughta be a law, you know. Yes boys, and industry standardized Law. That says you can't have more than three (3) announcements for vaporware parts without actually showing the working goods, and a Genuine Launch Partner willing to actually buy said goods. After three announcements, said vaporware should be deemed to be Shopworn Goods -- and further re-announcements are not permitted. And no. Those free engineering-sample-receivers shouldn't count as Genuine Launch Partners. Oh no no no. They're not actually "partners" -- they're more like hoes, but paid in parts. Which would eliminate Asus and ZTE as Jen's perennial "launch partners". It's sad you know. Oh so sad. That Jen has absolutely Nothing ready to launch at the 2013 CES. Absolutely Nothing, boys. So he's forced to re-announce at the CES what's already been announced and re-announced five (5) times or so. Most disturbing is that Jen STILL has no real Launch Partner for the Wayne chip. Plenty of announcements now -- but no Genuine Launch Partner.</Msg><Username>bnh.police</Username><Timestamp>1355638865532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 01:21:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355639214746-4</Id><Topic><Title>Try this again - NVIDIA DARPA Contract</Title><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1355422898865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:21:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dude whatever intellectual property discovered working for DARPA will become the property of NVDA.

Now, if you are talking about the lack of progress on the mobile GPU/Processor I would say; maybe, but considering that they still have beaten out Qualcomm and TI on many fronts and earned many large profile wins, all things considered, I would say there is some distinct intangibles or points of differentiation that the others simply can't compete with that. If you've listen to Jame's talk, the one being referred to in the subject line of this post, on the matter it's the system down approach that delivers the real "value add" and differentiation. It's not the clock speed, not transistor cluster, or any other minute technical hardware detail that matters but the ecosystem and ancillary technology gives them the edge. I agree their is something for being first but having that ecosystem is an intangible that nobody really considers - MS is still the standard in the enterprise not because it has great or "better" products per say but in large part because their technology is where a vast majority of trained technical talent is trained on.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1355703208182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 19:13:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355703332278-19</Id><Title>Nikkei Stock Average soars 1.6%= US futures booming!</Title><Msg>Nikkei Stock Average soars 1.6%= US futures booming!
