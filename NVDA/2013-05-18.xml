Apple was in trouble only because they used Samsung fabs which is at least 1.5 generation behind - that is a killer! Apple is no longer using Samsung so they can at least keep up with NVDA from a technology node. On the GPU side it's obvious NVDA is pulling way ahead. NVDA I belief had indicated a willingness to consider licensing the GPU if I recall correctly - I don't think they would refuse Apple. Coming back to Samsung - they are in trouble - big trouble if they are to build themselves. So for their high end stuff - it would be buying from QCOM or NVDA - I have no doubt. On the plain vanilla phones - they'll use their own fabs and designs. Samsung fabs are just too far behind at this stage - that means no more high end ARM stuff for them. The beauty is - TSMC will never take their business so they are stuck - may be Global foundries would take their business.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368850203694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 00:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368855640972-2</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Global Foundries? LOL! People need chips made, not powerpoint slides of new process tech that's coming! That being said, no. Apple won't use Nvidia's chips. Apple's in-house SoC/core design team is more than competent (in fact, Swift is probably a better design than A15 for phones, but less beefy for tabs), and manufacturing is their only issue. Moving to TSMC is likely, but it's also somewhat risky as TSMC would have to put in place some extra capacity to satiate Apple's needs. Samsung, OTOH, could very well use Nvidia chips in its products if they turn out to have a very real advantage over what can be done in house.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368855640972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 01:40:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368864463236-3</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung is now at the same generation as TSMC, 28nm, and their gate-first actually gives them density advantage. As for future processes they need to master gate-last for 20nm but usually Samsung's memory needs drives their process advances so I would not bank on them not doing 20nm or 14nm FinFETs for long. As for design they will use generic ARM and IT, so A15 and Power VR5 for the Octa and A57 and Power VR6 in the future. Samsung the device maker has shown that they are pretty agnostic about whether they use their own chips or anybody else's but I don't see them using Tegra 4 or 5 which are A15 based like their Octa and gives no real advantage but if Project Denver in Tegra 6 is particularly better than A57 then maybe they might use it.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368864463236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 04:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368882746096-4</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA is unusually strong on a Friday</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368808477962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 12:34:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think NVDA will sell 11 million units of Shield.

The references to personal control of a vehicle (think of a very capable RC controller), and the idea of head to head strategy games where players take the perspective of their avatar are two areas I hadn't considered for shield. Enderly paints an interesting picture of Shield's potential. I think Two Points bear repeating: 1. A new open platform. From a higher vantage point, Nvidia has provide a new canvas or opportunity for creativity. Once in developer get the hands-on time the potential for new gaming experiences really has a different set of bounds. The killer app? It's coming. Maybe not immediately, but the latitude this system provide offer some great opportunities for exploitation. With the relationships that NVDA has with the development community, I'm sure some very bright minds have been thinking about exploiting these capabilities for some time now. In a year or two there will be a new genre of gaming, I'm certain. It's also interesting that NVDA is now large enough to take on the platforms who established the market and who helped NVDA pay the bills early on in the guise of PS3 and XBox. Enderly points out these platforms are waning so the traditional model was due for a shake up. Great, here it is. Open standards are huge when done well. But the real magic about this one is there is no Intel, Microsoft, ATI, 3DFX, Rambus, Sega, Sony or Nintendo to muddy it up and to try and get the upper hand. NVDA is the king of PC gaming and they are rightly asserting the title to the throne here.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1368888992929</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 10:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368889038643-6</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Shield: revolutionizing gaming</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368817475688</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:04:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obviously the rub is volume and the success of the platform. My view is NVDA doesn't care about selling shields per se, they would be happy to have dozens of shield-clone systems on the market at varying price points. What is key here is the open standard. It's 1982 again and IBM made public the specs to the XT PC, a new open standard is on it's way. 2. The other area is the mobile software business model, it's smartphone games on steroids. NVDA is taking care of those who feed them. Mobile game developers have figured out free ware to hook the user, and then a smaller fee to unlock the rest of the game. The number of low cost but compelling games for smart phones is pretty amazing. With Shield, developers can offer the richness of experience of a Call of Duty type title where the first level is free, and instead of a $60 price point (where a million or two could be sold), it's a $10 price point where 10s of millions are sold. Developers must be stoked. Google also has to be really excited, particularly about the potential versus everyone's favorite closed system, iOS. Between the momentum from smart phones, tablets and now this specific gaming opportunity, Android really has an interesting potential to catapult itself clearly into first place over Apple and Microsoft. My sense is NVDA is still struggling a bit for homes for Tegra. It will be interesting to see what the back half of the year brings. At the same time, the Automotive opportunity we hear is growing and will soon be a $.5B business. That's great, there is now a large and growing Tegra base to leverage. And Shield is the great next point of leverage for the Tegra. (Can't you just see Audi offering a premium Shield for backseat passengers?) As an investor, I can say I am really very pleased with the risk NVDA is taking here. I would like to see Asus, Quanta, Compal and the rest of the ODM community to get on board. There is huge potential here.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1368889038643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 10:57:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368889804970-7</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Shield: revolutionizing gaming</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368817475688</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:04:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lovely analysis, thanks schmenkle!</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1368889804970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:10:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368891257565-8</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My point is - THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE DESIGN OR ARCHITECTURE! IF you don't have the process - no amount of good design is going to help. THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM WITH SAMMY. That is why Apple is behind. Their ONLY salvation is moving to a capable fab like TSMC - not only can they deliver 28nm a year ago - they are noy starting to do risk production in Q3 for 20nm. Isn't it obvious from the thread above that SAMMY's problem is not whether T4 is better than E5? They can't even FAB the E5 and get decent qty and yields - which translates into a very high risk production meaning some of the products will die prematurely - that is why most of the E5 is going into 3rd world countries as a precaution. When you have massive yield issues - you'll have to cherry pick each lot that you can ship as prime material and there won't be too many that will be "prime".</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368891257565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:34:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368891765068-9</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sammie is developing its own LTE. pretty soon, any high volume high end or feature phones will be from oems who have their own proc + radio.

When Nvidia spent a mere chum change $10m to get Shield into the market - how many units do they think it would take before they get payback on their investment? Meanwhile - it created such a buzz for them - that it would have cost more if they had spent it on mere advertisement and PR for the company the traditional way. Lets see the ROI - Let's say ~ Shield Cost ~ $125. Wholesale price ~ $250 GM ~ $125 OH ~ 10% .... Net ~ $100 for each Shield sold $10M/100 = 100K units for the typical journalist / paparazzi / drama major - this is very hard math.

The high density is only good if they can get it manufactured consistently with no problems. They are 1.5 generations behind TSMC. DRAM processes are very different from the more complex Logic processes. They will eventually be in 20nm, 14nm - only after TSMC had been there 1.5years to 2 years - leading to my point that if they want to continue to be a leader in state of the art Smart phones they will have to use QCOM or NVIDIA even more going forward. Samsung has massive fabs and being able to make only 1 in 10 E5s (on a higher density process???) for the G4 is pathetic and points to a very severe problem they are having. So being Agnostic about what they use is more of a necessity than a virtue. They will have great "paper designs" of T5, T6 and T7 equivalents but no fab to process it in and certainly no manufacturing capability until the node is mature - they are learning and trying to fix their 28nm process whilst at TSMC it's considered a mature OLD Technology! At this rate the 20nm at TSMC will be more mature than Sammy's 28nm in the next 6 months :) ... poor Sammy.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368894086814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:21:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368896158900-14</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung is going to be doing all the Apple ipad/iphone refreshes in the summer on their 28nm.

They shipped 10M so far and only 1M from their own 28nm fab and the other 9m from TSMC fab? Now TSMC doesn't have 30X more 28nm fab capacity than Sammy. (may be 50X of you include all the 28nm wafers they are running for everybody). And TSMC had been shipping 28nm for more than a year! If that is not leading them by more than one generation - I don't what is. The other hard fact is - if you are in the CPU/GPU business you don't have a choice of not needing to be in front when it comes to process technology - Sammy DID not choose not to have 28nm a year and a half ago because they did not need it - what a farce! Plain simple fact - they are behind. The gate process they chose was not because they wanted a higher density - it's primarily because it's a simpler process - if they had chosen to do the gate last process - they would be 3 years behind on the 28nm. Good luck to Apple if they have to use Sammy for 28nm - Andy Grove would say this about Sammy's 28nm fab - "Eating like an Elephant and defecating like a Canary!" This is why - when you have yield problems - it gets exponentially worse with larger die -Apple will have a very large die with all the extra GPUs in it. Bye Bye Sammy!</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368920845354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 19:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
