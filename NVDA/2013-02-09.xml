ARM server barrage ? ROFL. 'As development begins to depend more on parallelism for performance increases, a place where intel is at a significant disadvantage' only in your ignorant erroneous imagination. 'how is intel going to match a 16 core arm processor running at 1 ghz with a 32w power profile and costs less than $300? No windows + poor scale = bye bye intel.' There is no 16 core arm processor but there are 8-core Core server processors with 16 threads so Intel actually has the advantage in parallel processing already. As you are just waving your arms about in oblivious ignorance here's a little reality to bring your down to Planet Earth. A quad-core Intel Core i7 3770K was benchmarked against a 12 core 30W 1.2 GHz A9 cluster which is very similar to the spec you just quoted. Not only was it 5 times as fast but it was 50% more performance/power efficient as well. The low voltage Xeons are twice as power efficient as this i7 and Romley is an 8 core chip so you can clearly see that ARM is just a very loud paper tiger whose only threat is maybe to make Intel server guys die from laughter ;-). wwwDOTphoronixDOTcom/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=phoronix_effimass_cluster&amp;num=11</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1360445331523</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 16:28:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360445423274-24</Id><Title>GTX 780 Titan - Somewhere between $899 and $1300</Title><Msg>Read the Gamer Message Boards.

ROFL, that perfectly describes YOU !!! 'First of all linking 4 bunch of omap dev boards together via Ethernet isn't an apples to apples comparison. Having all those cores are on the same chip will have a completely different result in compute per watt not to mention speed - shall I go into all the details why?' I am afraid it is an apples to apples comparison because there is not going to be a native 16 core ARM server chip, there is not even going to be a native 8 Core ARM server chip, there will only be duals (AMCC) and quads (ARM) and they will be be connected with an interconnect similar in performance to Ethernet which will have all the bandwidth, latency and coherency drawbacks of any cluster. As it happens the benchmark tested was not even a coherent one so actual performance will be worse on a single system memory image like an RDBMS e.g. Oracle. 'Another point to make here is that hyper threading is not a true concurrency model although they can stager the instructions and reduce the penalty for context switching its not a truly concurrent core' More made up nonsense. Hyperthreading is a prime example of SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading). The clue is in the name lol ! ' Finally this test didn't measure sustained performance in a real world environment but instead peak performance.' LOL, you really don't want anything real world for your toy ARM processors, the embarrassment will only continue ;-). 'So as I said once we get a 16 core arm a15/a51 on a similar die size as the Xeon how will intel compete?' Very easily and will be less trouble than genuinely native 16 core multi-threaded 64-bit MIPS/Sparc chips when they tried. 'Oh and most importantly the cost of those intel procs run in the range of 1-2k about 5 times more than what a comparable arm proc would cost.' Price can be elastic whenever competition calls and anyway the cpu is usually 10% the cost of a server so is just noise really. p.s. I have worked in this industry probably more years than you have been alive. I vividly remember the first Intel vs ARM chip battles 25-30 years ago when the first PCs came out and this one will be no different, ARM will take its whipped tail and sulk back to embedded ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1360455566818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 19:19:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360455842606-33</Id><Title>By now, we should have seen some A15 products.

But then, no one expects any real information from a swing trader. The "new" Wikipad isn't anything new, it is a 7 in reincarnation of the old 10-inch Wikipad introduced last year following a 2012 CES launch. The old Wikipad, claimed to be a detachable tablet attached to a game controller with a 10-inch display, was marketed through GameStop at the price of $499. Soon after its release, the gadget disappeared from the shelves (embarrassingly!) because of a serious mechanical problem and had to be retooled. Meanwhile, other game-playing devices came out better and cheaper, so the manufacturer of Wikipad decided to capture the rush to 7-inch tablets and reintroduced the current version of 7 inch Wikipad at half of its original price with essentially the same specs except for a 3 inch reduction of the screen. Let's hope the lower price will get the right audience and its mechanical problems have indeed been fixed. You see, not everyone can make a modified console easily, and I content that Qualcomm's expertise in making Project Shield's kind of hardware is UNPROVEN. (Naturally QC's marketing say there is no interest on their part). Kindly provide the proper technical/marketing context next time when you ask a big question or throw up a big buzz word....make sure you know what it means.

My point is that you have nervously shown every trait of a trader looking for a quick buck: buy out rumors; buy back shares, increase dividend, raise the guidance (like MCHP), sell PR at any cost etc etc. Pathetic!

Google is already using Tegra 3 in its Nexus 7 and there's every indication that it will use the Tegra 4 in its second-generation Nexus 7 to be unveiled at Google I/O 2013 this May. The Tegra 4 also promises to be a lot more powerful than the Samsung Exynos 5 used in the Samsung Chromebook. That's a good thing since the Exynos 5 is a bit too slow for Chrome OS. All of this is speculation, all we know is that there is mention of an upcoming Chrome device in the Chrome OS source code, codenamed "puppy." The code mentions support for T114 dalmore, the codename of the upcoming Tegra 4, which makes it very likely that there will be a Tegra 4-powered Chromebook. It also makes sense financially, Chromebooks have started selling well recently, but only because of the price. In fact, the $249, â‚¬190 ARM-powered Samsung Chromebook started this trend. Not only is an ARM Chromebook cheaper, it's also completely silent since it doesn't have any fans for cooling and uses very little power. All in all, there are plenty of incentives to use an ARM processor in a Chromebook. And since the Tegra 4 promises to be the fastest ARM SoC for at least a few months, it makes sense to use it. Just who is building this Tegra 4 Chromebook is another matter. So far, Google has relied on partners, Samsung, Acer and more recently Lenovo and HP. It's been working well so far. That said, a Nexus Chromebook powered by Tegra 4 to be unveiled at Google I/O alongside a new Nexus 7, possibly powered by the same SoC, doesn't seem too out of far-fetched.

Tomasmann So be it... But let's review the history of Nvidia PPS over the last few years. Remember 2010 long and dreary slowly dropping Intel and Nvidia was suing each other. The stock around 10 or so and voila the miracle happened. Intel paid Nvidia 1.5B. Nvidia launched Tegra 2. Motorola Xoom even has a Super Bowl Ad for gosh sakes. and the stock shot up to something like $25 and then started to fall back. The true believers held on but I sold increments from $22 to $18. Of course being the accursed Trader that I am. But many a loyal long forever buy and hold guy wrote calls....were you one of them? It seems to me that if you wrote calls you were a trader too....oh person of little faith...LOL Since then I have traded Nvidia twice....I try to buy low and sell higher how much higher I don't know. Fast forward to today... News Flash Nvidia issues a dividend in November an the stock drops to $11.50. I think perhaps Nvidia gets it,so I buy back in. Cash pile is huge and getting bigger. Gamer GPUs doing great against AMD which just could be on it's last legs...but Tegra....Meh but improving. Now they have goe with the Gamer thing which I personally think is a winner So think about it...If Nvidia wants to they can have this stock at $15 to $16 in a month without jeopardizing the long term. Just buy back a few shares. The dividend shocked the heck out of me and I like dividends..my favorite stock that I own is MCHP and they buy back stock when they think the stock is too low. The CEO has options too but only sells at the high. Notice Jensen didn;t sell his options in the 4th qtr. He kept them. Perhaps he is waiting for $15 to $16 like I am. It's coming and if you are long you will like it too.
