Also Samsung did 32nm first which TSMC skipped. The S600 is still on TSMC's 28nm LP process which is why it is available in volume, it is a mature process now after initial yield/ramp problems last year which Qualcomm complained about publicly. The correct comparison would be between the Octa and Tegra 4 as they are both quad-core A15s on HKMG 28nm processes and as you can see Octa won that race to market.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368937668441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 00:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368938497657-2</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When talk about technology node - we talk about the geometries first and foremost, and then the different flavors. Sorry, Sammy is 18 months late to the dance. And the will be 2 years late to the next dance - 20nm. For a company with mega fabs to manage only 1m parts with 3 months to get to that volume is pathetic. They are agnostic because they failed and they had to use a supposedly lower performance S600 part to top it because that's the only way to stay in business. There won't be a E6 when Logan shows up :0 - and they would be once again agnostic and put Logan in G5 - what else can they do - have a castrated E5 running against Logan in G5?</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368938497657</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 00:41:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368945031711-3</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>""There won't be a E6 when Logan shows up :0 -""" Not only that. Samsung may come around even sooner - before Logan's time in 2015. When Tegra 4i gets validated and becomes available at the end of this year, Samsung will find this app processor to be "the" top choice to deploy for their largest (and fastest growing) midrange phone markets. All 4 selection criteria are met in the optimal sense: cost, performance, energy saving, and volume availability. For midrange smartphones, cost and volume availability would likely trump considerations for battery life and performance. And that will happen by Q1 2014, assuming that NV continues to proceed well with Tegra 4i's certification process. I think it's a small "IF" based on the optimism expressed by NV management in the past few weeks.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368945031711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 02:30:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368947780792-4</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Absolutely!

Even Jen is now forced to acknowledge that with aapl and samsung having a duopoly in the high end, there is really not enough space left for an independent app processor merchant. Longs here, longs here are still in lala land thinking the mobile guys will ever let themselves create an Intel to an IBM in PC. The mobile guys are very careful to brand their product to be void of the component suppliers. And even Samsung is trying to get out from under the Android brand, let alone the app proc. The 'graphic' advantage or the PD advantage is only in the heads of the longs here. nvda brings absolutely nothing unique to the mobile space. Next battle field: wearables. Here, space compared to a cell phone is like an aircraft carrier to a dinghy. I suspect single chip solutions will rule and nvda ain't got enuf 'cheap' radios to join the party.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1368969471235</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 09:17:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368970684501-8</Id><Title>this is how the US should deal with Nvidia insider traders from NYC...</Title><Msg>"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities executed two men on Sunday convicted of working for Is raeli spy agencies, Iran's Fars news agency reported.

If you are that far off on the second statement, I wouldn't give you any credence for your first statement. Better go find out how far off some of your investment assumptions are. Wearables!!
