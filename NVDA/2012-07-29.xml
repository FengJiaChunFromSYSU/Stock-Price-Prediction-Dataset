Apple Paid 278 million for PA, but would have to pay big-time billions for Nvidia. With market cap larger than MSFT &amp; Google combined, funding might not be much of an issue for Apple. Gaming is a significant growth area that Apple is deficient in. Nvidia is right in the thick of things with Tegra, VGX, GeForce Grid, and project Denver. Would deny access to Nvidia products to competition. Jen won't sell because he knows that Nvidia is now in the catbird seat, and will want to see the company he created be the preeminent force in technology. Apple will need to pay as high, or more of a percentage premium that has ever been paid for any acquisition. I'm sure he would want control to some extent also thrown in. Apple buying Nvidia anytime soon is unlikely, but not out of the question.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1343566112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 08:48:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343566184000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Dear Jen-hsun</Title><Username>bs_checker</Username><Timestamp>1342393736000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-15 19:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know all about how your family insider tick game works. g-d bless his mom and dad and the youngest brother.

Apple acquiring just nvidia's Tegra division for it's Elephantine tax loss carryforwards. Let's assume that the accumulated losses from Jen's Tegra folly total $1.5 Billion Dollars ($1,500,000,000.00). Now, if the nvidia Board of Directors pulled the plug on Jen's Tegra folly today, it would take many, many, many quarters to use-up that Elephantine tax loss carry-forward. Nvda had Income Before Tax of a mere $77.095 million for the most recent quarter ending April 28, 2012. So that's what, twenty (20) quarters to make use of all those Tegra division tax loss carry-forwards. But, if nvidia's Board of Directors instead Sold the Tegra division -- and it's valuable tax loss carry-forwards -- to Apple, they could shut it down and make immediate use of the Tegra's Billion and a Half in tax losses. Apple had Income before Tax of $15,532,000.00 for their most recent quarter ending March 30, 2012. So Apple could make use of ALL of Tegra losses in just one quarter. Makes a lot of sense, right? Sell the doomed Tegra division to Apple, -- say for $.10 cents on the dollar of tax losses, or $150mm -- and Apple shuts it down and writes off the losses from Jen's Tegra folly -- Pronto. A win-win, right boys? It sure is. Keep in mind that nvidia's perpetually "Interim CFO" was previously nvidia's Head of Taxes lady. So she will instantly appreciate this brilliant idea, and maybe be able to explain it to Jen. Using little T-charts and pictures of checks and this and that going back and forth. A bestogram of taxes, as it were. -</Msg><Username>bestogram</Username><Timestamp>1343579114000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 12:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343581165000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to Acquire AuthenTec, next NVDA</Title><Username>hus108</Username><Timestamp>1343522378000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 20:39:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- CORRECTION.

Intel has declined to comment on products that have not yet been announced as well as its partners' product plans or launch schedules. Although Lenovo and Intel displayed engineering samples of their first jointly-developed Android-based tablet PC in April, adopting Android 4.0.4 and Medfield, and were ready to launch in mid-2012, after evaluating factors such as the launch of Windows 8 and RT, upcoming entry-level Android tablet PCs from first-tier players, and Apple's new iPad, Lenovo has decided to delay the launch to further observe the market. The sources pointed out that although Intel has gained support from telecom carriers and smartphone players such as Orange, Lava International, ZTE, Lenovo and Motorola in the smartphone market, the average sales performance of these partners' Medfield/Android-based smartphones is strongly concerning Intel. Intel originally expected Motorola and ZTE to both provide full support for its Medfield/Android-based tablet PC plans, but as the vendors are turning cautious about their tablet PC business, the sources expect the morale of Intel's platform to definitely be impacted. In October, after the launch of Windows 8, Intel is set to release the Atom Z2760 processor for its Clover Trail platform, designed specifically for the operating system, while offering 22nm Ivy Bridge processors for high-end Windows 8-based tablet PCs.</Msg><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1343613782000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 22:03:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343613885000-29</Id><Topic><Title>Intel: "No one is even close."</Title><Username>big_dog.wins</Username><Timestamp>1343588307000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 14:58:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By coming up with the wildly successful Medfield using state of the art process achieving a Dual Core A9 performance for twice the cost.</Msg><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1343613885000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 22:04:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343614055000-30</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to Acquire AuthenTec, next NVDA</Title><Username>hus108</Username><Timestamp>1343522378000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 20:39:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One problem ....

Jeepers Best. So what happened to him? The Real chitownbarber22, that is. The guy who wrote about collecting aluminun cans, and carnival freak shows, and cockroachs and sewers, and mobile homes and propane tanks, and trailer parks and truck stop bathroom attendants, and AMDSH1T, and cleaning circus cages. The Real chitownbarber22 would Never have written, "Perhaps you can expand on your assertion..." Nope. A gay imposter chitownbarber22 probably wrote that. Did he not make bail? Again. Did aliens beam him up for further clinical study? Maybe a one way trip to the Soylent Green factory? Did he finally enroll in truck driving school? The readers here deserve to know.

If none of the poorer semiconductor manufacturers, -- like TSMC -- ante-up to play at the ASML "Billion Dollar Minimum" table, Intel OWNS the 450 mm EUV process, right? If Intel is the only one paying ASML to develop the teeny tiny tools needed for this and that, then Intel should be the Big Winner. Like any decent lottery.
