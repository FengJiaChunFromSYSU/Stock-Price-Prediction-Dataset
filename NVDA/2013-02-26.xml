The Nvidia Phoenix – pictured here – is a reference phone for the time being, but the company has already shown it’s not afraid to make its own kit with Project Shield and now could be setting its sights on the smartphone and tablet market. Nvidia is keeping schtum about the particulars, but reckons that with its components facing tougher market conditions (the unlikely phrases ‘increasingly vertical’ and ‘commoditisation’ were used) a move to make its own smartphones and tablets will pay off in the long run. Although the Nvidia Phoenix was built to show off the silicon maker’s new Tegra 4i system-on-a-chip (an evolution of the Tegra 4 architecture), the company is punting it as the ‘ideal device’, admits it is creating the hardware in its own labs and is currently preparing to go to market (in Q2) with Project Shield. In other words, there is nothing to stop Nvidia making and selling its own mobiles and tablets. Of course, the folks at Nvidia won’t outright admit they’re working on consumer hardware, but they also won’t flatly deny it.

I do wish they had kept the Project Shield quiet though until they were close to launch. Say one or two months. If they could sell phones and tablets directly to the telcos starting in China I see a good chance for success. Nvidia does have good name recognition in China from GPUs in PC's. In the US, I can understand why the carriers would want to buy a high end smartphone such as the Phoenix at a decent price, but unsure how they would market it to the consumer without making it free on a 2 year contract because the consumer can get an Apple or Sumsung phone for $200 because of the ridiculas subsidies the carriers pay those two companies. I believe only Google has the were withal to challenge those two in the smartphone market in the US. Note: I have been watching BLU products tegra 3 quattro phones on Amazon and they have been selling some but the quantities are not spectacular by any means. Only the carriers can bring high enough volumes to justify the expense of going alone. In my opinion. One other thought......Ouya going on sale in June along with Project Shield will be a good test case for the proposition of Nvidia entering the hardware business in phones and tablets. But in reality I can't understand why Google just doesn't drop a dime and buy Nvidia and merge it with Motorola. Then you would be talking about something very powerful!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361885286339</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 08:28:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361887543696-17</Id><Topic><Title>MWC 2013: nVidia Phoenix (T4i inside) could be your next smartphone</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1361882082823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 07:34:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ouya needs to upgrade its innards from T3 to T4 or at least to T4i, otherwise, it would be hard to make an inroad to the gamers market, especially when Shield becomes available at the same time.

Agree, but Ouya is just helping build the ecosystem....i.e. cheap but decent Android games like Nintendo games but at 1/10th the price. What's good is they run much better of course on Tegra 4. I wish Nvidia would put Project Shield up for pre-order and tell us what it will cost. Enough PR already. Everyone of the 50M gamers world wide already know about the Shield. It sounds crazy...but just put it up on the website with a price and delivery date and a countdown clock that counts the orders as they come it....Like the National Debt Clock.

By most accounts, T4 and T4i sales won't really register until Q3, which is why NVDA gave lower guidance after the last earnings. We might see some minor movement if product announcements are made, but I expect us to trade sideways until Shield, T4, and T4i can start to make inroads on the margins. I'm content to collect the dividend until this fall, and I'm very curious to see the guidance for next quarter. That should give us some insight on whether or not NVDA expects to take away marketshare from QCOM in the smartphone market, and whether or not we can expect Shield to be a seller. But, I'm an investor, not a trader so this is a marathon, not a sprint. Long term, I expect NVDA to move up nicely to the upper teens, possibly even breaking 20, but it will take some time to see the rewards of their new products. They've beaten on recent earnings, and I don't expect that will change. It's undervalued and a cheap stock, if people have the patience to wait it out.</Msg><Username>delano_00</Username><Timestamp>1361891129557</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 10:05:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361891537678-26</Id><Topic><Title>Odd of NVDA breaking out today?

That we’re soon to find out. The HTC One’s Qualcomm chip is able to score an impressive 12,xxx points in Quadrant which is staggering in comparison to the LG Optimus G’s already high 7,400 and the Nexus 4 and Samsung Galaxy S3′s 5,xxx (the N4′ scores play within the 4,800 to 5,700 range), thing is, the Nvidiat’s reference tablet with a Tegra 4 chip garnered over 16,000 points which is even more astonishing. We know, Quadrant is just as reliable as the rumor-mill but it’s still a pretty good way to easily showcase a device’s processing prowess. Engadget was able to test drive the system on SunSpider and here’s what they have to say, “the tablet chewed through all that code in just 499ms (keep in mind that lower numbers are better in this particular test). To give you some perspective, the iPad 4 scores an average of 865ms in the test.” which means users should expect an overall faster browsing experience on a Tegra 4-powered device, it’s worth noting one of the strongest selling points of Apple’s iPad tablets are the devices’ ability offer a fast and smooth browsing, the Tegra 4 can essentially deliver the same experience. Don’t get carried away by those impressive numbers though, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 is yet to come out of its silicon cage — that will surely start another endless episode of buzz in the tech community, Qualcomm’s cream of the crop will start appearing in devices within Q3 or Q4. The Nvidia Tegra 4 on the other hand, is expected to invade the market within August.

Can you take a hint of why?</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361893139817</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 10:38:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361893277757-32</Id><Topic><Title>Has Nvidia decided to dump this tegra nonsense...</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361840997678</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 20:09:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Feeding trolls, esp. unclever ijuts, is boring. zap- u gone!</Msg><Username>strawman_best</Username><Timestamp>1361893277757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 10:41:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361893393058-33</Id><Topic><Title>HTC One outdated already? - NVIDIA Tegra 4 takes on Qualcomm...</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361891755268</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 10:15:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will you have a cold one for this?

ZTE S800 Demo Unit????</Title><Msg>At the Mobile World Congress today, ZTE announced the Grand Memo Android smartphone. The Grand Memo is a very special smartphone with a 5.7-inch display which has a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution. To us, ZTE sends mixed signals by launching a flagship model with a huge display but with an average resolution. Well, two months ago, a 1280 x 720 HD display would be top of the range. But since last year, Sony, HTC and LG has announced one high-end model each. And all of these have a Full HD display. That is 1920 x 1080. Increasing the display size to 5.7 inch without increasing the resolution has resulted in a low PPI of 258. Hey, even its little brother ZTE Grand S has a Full HD resolution on a 5-inch display. We saw two different Grand Memo models here at the MWC. One with GPS coverage and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, but also a model for China and some other Asian countries. That model was configured with support for other network frequencies. RAM and all other specs but the processor and the supported networks was identical. TD-LTE Band 38/39/40, FDD-LTE Band 7, TDSCDMA Band 34/39, GSM Band 2/3/8. This model was powered by a nVidia Tegra 3 processor and Marvel PXA1802 modem. Snapdragon 800 is currently the fastest processor from Qualcomm. The specification sheet and ZTE staff claimed that the Snapdragon processor will be clocked at 1.7. We run the app AnTuTu to see what the benchmark scores was. It ended on 13173 which is surprisingly low given the promised speed improvement of the Snapdragon 800. AnTuTu also reported a clock speed of 1.5 GHz which makes us believe that this was a demo unit with an older processor inside." What surprised us a little was that the ZTE staff promoted the panorama camera as one of Grand Memo's major feature. Hopefully, they are not a part of the ZTE design team. All other makers of Android smartphone has realized that they need something extra to differentiate these powerful handset from another. Seems like ZTE buys hardware from the shelf and install a close to vanilla Android on top. Sony, Samsung and LG develop hardware in-house such as camera modules, screen technology and processors. They also adds number of extra features such free cloud-services, talk-to-my-fridge functionality and so on. Like ZTE, we think there is a market for large screens, but the 5.7-inch Grand Memo might be too big and not for everyone.

It was kind of slow. Actually, it was really slow - I haven't seen UI lag like that on a top-tier smartphone in over a year. It was terrible switching between tasks, and while ZTE's hilariously overwrought UI is likely slowing it down a fair bit, something just didn't feel right for a phone allegedly running on the very newest Snapdragon chip. Well, something was not right - because ZTE was very wrong about the specifications of its own product. Originally, ZTE claimed the Grand Memo had a Snapdragon 800 chipset - the most powerful mobile chip Qualcomm makes, and which probably isn't even available outside limited manufacturing samples at this point. And ZTE didn't just claim this once - it was said during the press event, and the Snapdragon 800 is mentioned 5 times in the official press release. Then, Qualcomm chimed in and said 'no way, the Grand Memo is running a Snapdragon 600.' Which is still a really fast chip (it's in the HTC One, as well). But then we decided to do a little sleuthing, and as far as we can tell, that's not even true: all benchmarks we've run so far point to an APQ8064 processor - the Snapdragon S4 Pro found in the Nexus 4, Optimus G, and numerous other devices from late last year. The Snapdragon 600 is an APQ8064T."</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1361896587093</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:36:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361897138385-41</Id><Topic><Title>IMPORTANT REPORT ON NVDA (MUST SEE)</Title><Username>jaredmurray772</Username><Timestamp>1360272322771</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:25:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very good report. thank you.</Msg><Username>nicklee463</Username><Timestamp>1361897138385</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:45:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361897487486-42</Id><Title>verizon network</Title><Msg>Altair is teaming with nvidia.

They survived in an industry that pushed out half of the competitors every generation, and slashing prices was typical in the death throes. They are the last GPU company standing, with ATI moving into the second tier with the other embedded GPU companies (e.g. on ARM). Nvidia certainly hasn't suffered from not being in the other consoles. It appears they are pursuing a strategy of making consoles irrelevant rather than fighting to be a low-margin design supplier for a business that may be in decline. (Actually I think the console makers are just barely in time with their refresh. Switching to a x86+GPU platform is admitting special hardware no longer has an advantage. Or, to put it another way, the magic is all in the GPU and you can match or (with $$) better that in a regular PC. But most consumers haven't internalized that and they still have a shot at getting most users to refresh their hardware and remain locked into the platform for another generation. Waiting another year would be a disaster. Even Christmas 2013 is a long way off when it come to gamer's opinions.)</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361905085194</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:58:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361905350509-56</Id><Topic><Title>expected some design wins by now</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361904372823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:46:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>:-) I'm less agitated than I might sound... but frankly the Tegra 4 seems MORE impressive than I expected. So I'm scratching my head wondering why there haven't been more announcements or at least rumors of them. I'm sure the devices will come. And I'm actually relatively more excited about the Shield's prospects after watching Sony's PS4 event last week. But you know, I just think Nvidia's got a lot more going on than the stock is reflecting. I have a relatively tiny bit of exposure to nearer-dated calls (march and june), so I'm a little disappointed that those will probably have to be sold at a loss given time decay and no move in the stock... but otherwise I'm fine just sitting back on the common and leaps and I'll probably just shut up on the boards soon. Dividend payments are nice, though. I'm expecting more capital appreciation here though... and have been for a while. Have Jan 2014 and Jan 2015 calls in addition to common, feel good about those, but am admittedly confused by how things have played out from CES through this point. Granted, my expectations were lofty. And it's great that the stock didn't get punished for the lower-than-consensus Q1 guidance... but Tegra 4 and Tegra 4i both sound so good to me that I'm left wondering if I've just been somewhat bamboozled by NVDA's marketing prowess.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361905350509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:02:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361905490530-57</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm relegated to touting 4K video encode?</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361904813157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fair enough, let me rephrase that as "NVDA just get some freaking design wins that your customers will be excited to announce".</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361905490530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:04:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361905858850-58</Id><Title>Massive wall at $12.41 can't break that.</Title><Msg>NVDA should be at least $17 but man clearly they will not let this thing break $12.41</Msg><Username>firetheboardofdirectors</Username><Timestamp>1361905858850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:10:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361906112486-59</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm relegated to touting 4K video encode?</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361904813157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, in reality there are not that many design wins to around.

It's a whole bunch of things - the A15s may run hot but if the rest of the system draws much less power than a similar A15 set up by the competition - ie total power at the system level - TEGRA 4 WINS!

Besides......No small OEM would ever think of announcing something early, before they had what they needed from Qualcomm already signed in an iron glad contract for fear of retaliation.

ZTE's "Mimosa X" comes to mind specifically since I was looking forward to it at the end of 2012 as the first phone that'd feature Tegra + Icera that supposedly had high volume potential as a mainstream budget device in China. But It ended up turning into a non-story. I get all the arguments about it being less-than-ideal strategically for OEMs to announce devices at MWC now that won't be commercially available until the end of 2013, but i'm still sticking to my story that that is exactly what Nvidia said we should still expect this year after analysts/pundits questioned the dearth of Tegra 4 announcements at CES. Maybe NVDA wasn't ready for the evolution in strategy on behalf of the partner OEMs, to now stay mum until at MWC about devices coming at the end of the year. But it is a change from last year, and I suspect that it's at least partly because Tegra 4 is shipping 6 months later than originally planned/promised to the OEMs.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361917389373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 17:23:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361917993622-82</Id><Topic><Title>Engadget gushes over T4 following benchmark suite run</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1361913557206</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 16:19:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Think you meant 'not going to want', yes?</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1361917993622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 17:33:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361919330865-83</Id><Topic><Title>AMD is carving out a niche in the gaming business with PS4, Xbox and Nintendo.

Kass later pulled back on his comments, but the rumor had already caught fire and pushed Apple up as much as 2 percent. Shares calmed back down and closed up 1.4 percent at $448.97." Now, shareholders -- possibly including Einhorn -- are planning to pack in to Cupertino to hear Apple CEO Tim Cook speak, and experts say many are waiting to hear what Einhorn has been pushing for since he started his crusade: plans to push some of the company's stuffed cash coffers back to them. A stock split would be unlikely to actually create value, since it would double the number of shares, but halve the value, and investors are likely seeking something better. "(Einhorn is) a proxy for other investors saying to Apple: 'Do something with all that cash you have,'" Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay told The Mercury News on Tuesday. "So there's this tension going into the meeting between Apple and the investors Einhorn represents. Tim Cook can't avoid talking about it. This is a huge subject and it's right there on the table for everyone to see."
