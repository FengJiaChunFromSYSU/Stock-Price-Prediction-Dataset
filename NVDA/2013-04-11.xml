Still, if The Korea Times is to be believed, the unhappy marriage between the two could rapidly be heading towards a divorce. While Apple has previously splashed out several billion per year on Samsung components, the newspaper is suggesting that Cupertino will turn to TSMC to produce its next generation of mobile CPUs -- a rumor that's been making the rounds recently. It's source, and executive at one of Samsung's partners, claims the manufacturer has been cut out of development of the A7 CPU, adding a little bit more credence to those claims. What's more, the same source reports that TSMC is gearing up its 20-nanometer production line to crank out the hardware ready for 2014.

The downside is SO limited and the upside SO great, that I won't be surprised if we finish higher no matter what. If we don't see the stock down more than 1 1/2%, then it will likely reverse to the upside almost immediately. With TWO downgrades of MSFT, and INTC down 2 1/2% in the pre-market, HPQ down 6.5%, and BRCM down almost 3%, a modest 1-1 1/2% decline in NVDA will be a real "tell" that none of this news matters at this point. You MIGHT have a "window" to buy until noon, when the Investors' Day starts. We only need ONE piece of tangible "news" to be announced...Project Shield release date and price, news about the buyback, design win/wins, full year guidance update, etc, and we will rocket higher. I did just check, and ALL those calls that were bought, yesterday, were TO OPEN, as OI increased in all the calls I mentioned. "Someone" knows "something" and while they're not supposed to, they do. It should prove to be a most interesting day, although very little will matter until The Final Hour. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said that a decision to delay a new version of its Tegra mobile-phone chip is contributing to “flat” growth in that business this year. Tegra growth will be little changed from a year earlier, Huang told analysts today at a company event. In addition, business conditions will be “rather muted” in the first half of the year as the personal-computer market declines, he said. Nvidia, a maker of graphics processors that help make games and video look more vibrant and realistic, is working to lessen its dependence on the PC market, which makes up most of revenue. Tegra is an applications processor for phones that Nvidia is trying to use to grab a slice of the faster growth in smartphones and tablet computers. Huang said that Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia had decided to delay the introduction of a processor called Tegra 4 in order to bring forward another product, called Tegra 4i, which has a built-in cellular modem, something that the market is demanding. Shares fell 3.2 percent to $12.41 as of 12:38 p.m. in New York. The stock had climbed 4.6 percent this year through yesterday.

This will bring to $1.2 billion the total capital returned to shareholders since the company announced its quarterly dividend program in November 2012. NVIDIA had previously disclosed the return of $200 million in capital to shareholders since November. This includes $100 million in shares repurchased in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 27, 2013 and $100 million in dividends paid in the current and previous quarters. The return of a further $1 billion will largely be through a structured stock repurchase program, which includes the $100 million being repurchased in the current quarter. It also includes the company's quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share, which has amounted to about $50 million a quarter. "NVIDIA's strategies are gaining traction in the market and make us confident in our ability to continue generating cash," said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. "We are now broadening our program of giving back cash to our shareholders and plan to return a further $1 billion by the end of this fiscal year." Further details of the plan will be provided next month with the release of NVIDIA's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 ending April 28, 2013.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1365702969294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365703055351-52</Id><Topic><Title>If SHIELD runs on Tegra 4 and Tegra 4 is DELAYED is SHEILD DELAYED?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365701279726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:27:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"And anything said TODAY is NEW news."

Literally,speaking, it benefits them because there will be fewer shares outstanding, so each shareholder commands more of the ownership than they would have otherwise. Look, if you don't think that better days are ahead you won't be a shareholder. So, reversing dilution isn't really a problem, eh? In fact, when sales improve, it will be a great thing. Again, if you don't think Tegra will do well in the 6 - 18 month timeframe, you probably aren't investing. I will probably sell if they don't have some great T4i wins to report by end of year.

You can't overlook the effect of the buyback. It means that P/E ratio will also drop which affects the larger institutions decisions as well. It's great that you see the diversity in buyers but I think the buyer(s) at the time of the announcement could be telling.

Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said that while Tegra has been growing "very quickly," the business will be "about flat" this year. That's because Nvidia pushed back the launch of its Tegra 4 chip by a quarter in order to ready its 4G LTE capabilities, he said. The company introduced Tegra 4 at the Consumer Electronics Show in January and then launched its chip that integrates LTE with its app processor,Tegra 4i, a month later. "The LTE marketplace is growing faster than any transition that has happened in wireless," Huang said during an investor presentation. "It was important for us to engage that marketplace as quickly as possible. ... We decided we'd sacrifice the schedule of Tegra 4 by a quarter so we could pull in Tegra 4i by more than two. ... That was a good decision." Nvidia traditionally has been known for making graphics processing units found in computers and game consoles, but the company has taken steps to expand its customer base. It has been counting on its Tegra mobile chip to help offset weakness in its core PC market, but so far, it hasn't been enough. Tegra is showing up in many tablets, including the Microsoft Surface RT, but its presence in smartphones is minimal. Many analysts have been expecting Tegra to show little, if any, growth this year. While Nvidia is blaming the weakness on its chip release schedule, tougher competition likely also plays a role. Qualcomm, the dominant chip provider for smartphones, has been gaining more traction in tablets while Nvidia's smartphone push hasn't been as quick as hoped.

Does it matter? It's all a matter of price, really. To play devil's advocate here, even if they do think the company will be sold, shouldn't they run it as if it won't be, unless a solid offer is in-hand? This is not saying that I think it will be sold, just that I don't expect any signs to be sent either way. MSFT bought out one of my holdings years ago. No rumors ahead of time, it was just popped on the news one day. All done. Doesn't happen that way all the time (obviously) but sometimes it does. So, I don't worry about it either way. Personally, I don't expect a sale because there are relatively few companies for whom it would make sense, and they would have to think about anti-competitive issues. INTC? Would help them to get the graphics, but probably anti-competitive. QCOM? They are doing okay without the graphics, even if they might do even better with them. Probably anti-competitive. AMD? Hard to see the advantage for either party. BRCM? More of a merger than an aquisition. No rumors about that one from anyone in-the-know, although it might make the most sense. MSFT? Interesting first right-of-refusal agreements that were discussed a while back, but so far little interest in in-house chip design. Who knows, but probably they are happier to play suppliers against each other. Like BRCM, probably makes more sense that most of the others. AAPL? They might want the graphics to improve their offerings a bit, but hard to see it being worth it for them overall. Selling discrete graphics really doesn't seem like their thing, but the server chip ventures might be interesting. Notice something interesting, though. Tegra is at the base on any of those. Tegra. Overall, nothing I would invest based on, but interesting to think about - which is the only reason I took the time to write out my thoughts. Not interested in swaying anyone either way.

The company instituted a dividend program in November, at 7.5 cents per share per quarter, and has paid out $100 million in dividends last quarter, and made $100 million of buybacks. The company said the balance of the capital payout will be in share repurchases this fiscal year, which ends next January. Reflecting on the announcement, Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets, who has a Sector Perform rating on Nvidia shares, writes this afternoon “In our view, the stock is not upticking as valuation backstop of 2x cash is under-pressure due to cash burn.” “NVDA needs to move to an EPS multiple (vs. cash) valuation in-order for these actions to be rewarded.” Nvidia shares are more likely today reflecting the terrible PC numbers from Q1 announced last night by Gartner and IDC. Update: At the meeting, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said sales of the company’s “Tegra” processor family for mobile devices will be flat for this fiscal year ending next January relative to the $723 million recorded in fiscal ’13. In a note to clients this afternoon, Raymond James‘s Hans Mosesmann reiterates a Strong Buy rating and a $17 price target, writing that the outlook is better than the bears’ expectation for Tegra sales to decline this year, though it’s less than the double-digit growth he’s been modeling. Mosesmann cut his estimate for this year to $4.09 billion in revenue and 58 cents in EPS from a prior $4.15 billion and 60 cents to reflect the lower Tegra view. :</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365716788684</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 17:46:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365716819717-120</Id><Title>What happened to that J7k8 dude who said tegra4 beats Intel Core i</Title><Msg>in geekbench benchmarks.

Given the strategic important of LTE modem capability in today’s smartphone/tablet markets, the decision makes sense to us while admittedly creating investor frustration [...] Tegra Breakeven Closer than Thought: A common bear case for investors has been that Tegra R&amp;D efforts will continue to pressure profitability going forward. Management lifted the kimono with a segregated R&amp;D composition, revealing that Tegra specific R&amp;D was only $300 million. With ~50% gross margins on ~$700 million in sales, Tegra is already above breakeven on an annualized basis.

That one came right after Jen mentioned the buyback and the other when he showed them FaceWorks and "Ira". Both times the stock jumped 30-40 cents in seconds, and I think this is the precursor of moves to come. Jen had that same "coy" look he had the first time I ever saw him, on Power Lunch on CNBC, right after they had come public. He looked like the proverbial "cat that swallowed the canary", that day, and it was because he already knew that he was getting in the first XBox. He had that same look, today. The options volume was more subdued, other than in tomorrow's weekly and next weeks monthly OpEx. I won't know until the morning whether they added to positions or closed them out. But, the Q&amp;A gave Jen some fabulous opportunities to "tell" them what's coming, and he gave them more than I thought he would. He almost came right out and said: "I finally figured out how Steve Jobs, and others, got you people behind their stocks...they UNDER-promised and OVER-delivered." Hint...Hint...Wink...Wink...Just classic. He obviously can't wait to announce the price on PS, but must have a BIG thing planned for the official announcement, and just won't ruin that by doing it now. And I thought the interim CFO handled everything quite well, as well as some of the other speakers for their particular department. All-in-all, how anyone could watch that and NOT want to own this stock...well, it's just beyond my pay grade. Today's trading was a "sea change" kind of trading day. Closed with HUGE volume, ABOVE the "gap down open", (and above the 200DMA, again) even though it had dropped over 4% at one point. Consider that to mean that the stock might have "changed partners", like at a dance. With INTC and MSFT not recovering, it now no longer matters what they do in the PC arena, since Jen said he's just not "in that low-priced pc business".

For the first time NV's mobile chief Carmack shared with us the R/D money going into Tegra annually --it is $300 MM vs the misconstrued amount of over a $1 billion as frequently quoted by a number of visiting bashers. Even more interesting is the timelines for /I50T4i certification processes - the development time required for telco deployment of T4i is more than 12 months long, about twice as required by tablet + LTE (discrete). Hopefully some of the self-styled critics of this board (many of them claimed to be longs) would start to understand the laborious and drawn-out process, and weighed their words in the future about NVIDIA "not executing". IMHO, NVIDIA has done an amazing job in three years, trying to catch up with a giant (Qualcomm) who has been in this space for more than 25 years, and who has 10x more resources than the brave and smart challenger NVIDIA!
