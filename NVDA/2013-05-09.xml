An ARM based version of Windows is going to be an even tougher sell with both AMD and Intel gunning for the fanless Windows 8 space. Tegra's best chance is to dominate the Android tablet/convertible market. There, I think that Nvidia can probably hold off Intel's incursion by really pushing Android gaming/Tegra Zone, as well as by broadly advertising the native Android apps that don't quite run well on Intel's chips.

RT Lower cost hardware - WinTel = Bloated Hardware &amp; Bloated APU cost 2. RT pound for pound of Lion is excessively more power efficient. Just compare the play time per watt hour for each platform - WinTel will never do that because they'll flat out loose. Instead they'll talk about all day computing (pssst on a 65WHr battery!) 3. 1&amp;2 = Lighter footprint 4. Notice how #$%$ WinTel Note Books still are after 30 years it's still pretty much the STOOPID 1376 x 768 resolutions! And anything higher is a freaking serious premium and or weighs a TON! 1080P ARM based tablets are getting common and reasonably CHEAP. 5. MS Office built in means you can do serious work on a 1.5 lbs machine! And if they price it right (which is the main thing holding it back) it will be a huge winner. With MSO and more APPS - it would be more desirable than iOS/ Android/WinTel platform. 6. Apps will come - Rome was built in one day??? Legacy software mainly affects old farts who have to use stuff like QB &amp; ET or Fidelity trading Platform. Many of these are now in the cloud but not as good as the offline versions.

Tegra 4i will likely finally get nvidia into smartphones in a decent way. may or may not effect stock price for another 3-9 months but once investors see it being a huge part of nvidia then stocks going to boom. Qualcom mentioned weakness due to competition. who do you think is that competition. nvidia, intel and some others. If you think about it. Cloud processing is the future. Grid is a big part of that. Nvidia doesn't have to be in the end device. they just power the processing of the image and sound else ware and stream it to your screen. so a game system may get a demo with no download or even the full game itself. It may send you the work that guy you hired to do a video or 3d model thing, shown in real time, allowing you to make changes quicker than ever. It provides for more immediate interaction. something that is incredibly valuable in today's business world. And Nvidia can charge a small fee for servicing the technology. another source of income and one that is very consistent. All AMD has going for it is they surprised everyone by not dieing with what may finally be a turn around. It will likely be like when Nvidia went to 26 on a short squeeze only to come back down again because it overshot. You claim Nvidia is a POS. what will you be calling AMD when it does the same thing. What will it take for Nvidia to prove itself to be something that you will no longer complain about.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1368111127970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:52:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368111429133-25</Id><Topic><Title>Want to buy options</Title><Username>ticker_shuffle</Username><Timestamp>1368109711230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:28:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>people who are paying a quarter for fridays 14 calls are thinking will be positive reaction</Msg><Username>kevinrossu2</Username><Timestamp>1368111429133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:57:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368112259903-26</Id><Topic><Title>Want to buy options</Title><Username>ticker_shuffle</Username><Timestamp>1368109711230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:28:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and over 1400 contracts at 14.5 and 15 traded. a dime at 14.50. don't see it but some are expecting good earnings</Msg><Username>kevinrossu2</Username><Timestamp>1368112259903</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 11:10:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368113303936-27</Id><Topic><Title>Is this Nvidia board, or anti Apple board?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368073518212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 00:25:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dude, 2 yrs of false promises.

"Unlike PS3, we are not planning a major loss to be incurred with the launch of PS4," said Kato. "At the time we developed PS3, we made a lot of in-house investments to develop the chip, the Cell chip," he explained. "Development of the chip saw the silicon processing and all the facilities invested by us ourselves. But this time, yes we have a team working on chip development, but we already have existing technology to incorporate and also product investment and all the facilities will now be invested by our partners, other foundries, so we don't have to make all the investment in-house." Sony's next-generation console will use semi-custom accelerated processing unit chips made by technology company AMD. These chips have been designed to allow developers to "easily harness the power of parallel processing to fundamentally change the console gaming experience," AMD's John Taylor said when the partnership with Sony was announced in February."

He saw the future in mobile and cloud and has shown that hes going to pursue that. I wouldn't want any less. The first report that includes grid sales is likely this quarter. looking forward to that. 4i is ahead of scheduled. That's Very Promising. Also they have been under promising lately. They have been beating estimates quarter after quarter. Stock price is the only thing that's not moving a lot. I'd say within 1 year nvidia will be higher than were we are now. and probably going much higher. It took Xbox several years to make a market for itself. Tegra is the same. Tegra 4i is the nearest term game changer here. Phones are high volume compared to tablets and cars and whatever else they are in. The regular Tegra 4 probably wont do much better than Tegra 3 did this last year. Grid has no baseline yet. and profits this quarter will probably be cruddy due to transition to next tegra. Guidance will be what sends this stock higher if it goes higher this quarter. But because they have had so many new initiatives lately that they don't have a baseline to guide off of yet. so they have been wishy washy so far. Is this the quarter where they guide more than a quarter or two or are we a quarter or two away from that? 10 cents a share is a low enough bar to get another beat on estimates. All that's left is guidance on what they see in the coming quarters now. We are also on the verge of next gen gaming. Theirs going to be lots of upgrades to graphics cards coming soon when people realize how much of a jump has happened between the last gen and this new one. the next Xbox could have something to do with grid... we will see soon enough. With AMD your cherry picking. Why not try predicting the next boom. hindsight is 20/20.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1368116640795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 12:24:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368116663287-33</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple models of Win 8 RT machines will run on faster Tegra 4</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368059332623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RT's last chance appears to be in the 7" market, as a mini-Windows for form-factors that no one really expects to be 100% compatible, anyway. If I could trade my current Android table for something that played better with Windows and Outlook (not just Office, sorry Microsoft), I probably would. They trick is that they will have to be quite a bit cheaper, assuming that Intel and AMD produce x86 solutions that are as good as the claim.

Someone that buys a truck for only work gets a low-margin basic model that gets the job done. When they buy one for fun, they typically spend a little over twice as much and replace it much sooner. Which is far more profitable for the maker. The same is true for computers. The lesson I take away from Bluestacks is told in the reviews: we are on the verge of cloud gaming becoming becoming usable, but we need another step in compute power and lower latency. Nvidia is working both sides of that problems, with GPU-focused mobile compute chips and having the unique opportunity to reduce the latency at the video encoding point.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1368120497651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 13:28:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368120812377-42</Id><Topic><Title>Is this Nvidia board, or anti Apple board?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368073518212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 00:25:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a response from an hour ago that was supposed to be here. it starts with "investing in products...

Revenue in the three months ended in March fell 13.7%, year over year, to $954.7 million, yielding EPS of 18 cents. Analysts had been modeling $941 million and 10 cents per share. Nvidia shares are up 44 cents, or almost 3%, at $14.35, in late trading. Nvidia said it repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the quarter, and paid out $46.3 million in dividends. Nvidia’s “GPU” computing division saw sales rise 8%, year over year, and fall 5.6% from Q4′s level, to $785.6 million. Sales in the “Tegra” line of mobile application processors fell 22%, year over year, and fell 50.5%, quarter to quarter, to $103.1 million. Gross margin, on a non-GAAP basis, rose to 54.6% from 50.4% in the year-earlier quarter, and 53.2% in the prior quarter. Nvidia’s CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, remarked that “The success of Kepler-based GPUs within and beyond the PC helped drive another quarter of record margins,” adding that “Kepler is capturing share among gamers, strengthening our workstation and supercomputing segments, and will fuel new growth opportunities for our GRID server graphics solutions.” ______ PS: Tegra business did a lot better than I thought, considering that Q1 is essential a dry period during which multiple product transitions took place.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368131984240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:39:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368132270894-70</Id><Title>Can Nvidia Hold a 1% AH gain on Fri after guiding Lower Next Quarter?</Title><Msg>Nvidia did guide lower for the next quarter, didn't it?

'Da Man' was promising getting a big chunk of that $20bn mobile TAM last year or was is it the year before that, what happened to that too ?

Clearly the official financial guidance provided by NV has not included the benefits of this wild card. --Current quarter (Q2 FY2014) will see revenue increased to $975 milllion, from $954 of Q1 while maintaining a high gross margin of 54.6% --Kepler/GPU ecosystem continues to expand significantly - feeding into gamers market, servers, workstations and supercomputing.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368138595725</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 18:29:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368138715775-101</Id><Title>Revenue was decent, Margins were good, Profits in line, Tegra is a DISASTER.</Title><Msg>And that lower guidance didn't help either.

For the current quarter, the company forecast revenue of $975 million, plus or minus 2%, implying a range of between $955.5 million and $994.5 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently expected $1.01 billion. The Santa Clara, Calif., company is best known for making chips and circuit boards that help computers and videogame consoles generate visual effects. Over the years, the company has expanded into making chips for mobile devices, boosting its sales as companies such as Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) use its chips in their tablets. President and Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said Thursday the company's Kepler-based graphics processing units--or GPUs--drove record margins. "Kepler is capturing share among gamers, strengthening our workstation and supercomputing segments, and will fuel new growth opportunities for our GRID server graphics solutions," Mr. Huang said. "With Tegra 4 devices and Tegra 4i certification on the way, we're gearing up to return to growth in the second half." For the quarter ended April 28, Nvidia reported a profit of $77.9 million, or 13 cents a share, up from $60.4 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related impacts and other items, adjusted earnings were up at 18 cents from 16 cents a share. Analysts most recently forecast 10 cents a share. Revenue increased 3.2% to $954.7 million. The company in February projected roughly $940 million, well below analysts' revenue expectations at the time. onlineDOTwsjDOTcom/article/BT-CO-20130509-717114.html?mod=WSJ_qtoverview_wsjlatest</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368141887575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368142283227-112</Id><Topic><Title>WSJ; NVIDIA Q1 profit rises 29% as revenue, gross margin strengthen (VERY POSITIVE COMMENTSRY!)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368141887575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"For the current quarter, the company forecast revenue of $975 million, plus or minus 2%, implying a range of between $955.5 million and $994.5 million.

So may as well swap over ASAP.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1368156680048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 23:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368157589406-134</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA guided lower to 975M vs 1.01B estimate.That's not good at all b/c wall street looks ahead</Title><Username>nusaiba</Username><Timestamp>1368131116256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:25:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My point is, whatever their guidance is, they will beat it. If they guide higher, that means they'll do even better. And the stock is over $14 now, and I'm well in the green, so I'm happy. I know you'll continue to bash this stock, as you have for years and years, but I'm making money on it, so whatevs. Not selling yet.</Msg><Username>torchie4269</Username><Timestamp>1368157589406</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 23:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368157799577-135</Id><Topic><Title>What?
