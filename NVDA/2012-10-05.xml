While we expected that the boards would be discounted down from $4,999 from $2,499 to $2,999 range, truth was a little bit different. Amazon allegedly paid as low as $1,499 to $1,799 per card, bringing a value of the order between 15 and 18 million U.S. dollars. Tesla comes with an interesting subscription warranty program, which sets the customer back for additional $500 per board per year. That money guarantees immediate replacement should the board fail. Our sources implied that the company took that option in a heartbeat [Amazon had probably heard about nvidia's reputation for shoddy goods] , expecting to pay around $1000 to $1,500 per board (2-3y lifespan). All in all, with this one deal, Nvidia should net between 25 and 28 million U.S. dollars from a single customer. Naturally, the success of GK104 die in the HPC space and the limited supply from TSMC have another consequence - potential shortage in the consumer segment." So nvidia sold out cheap to Amazon -- like Really Dirt Cheap -- and threw the high margin consumers under the bus, since the razor-thin Amazon order will cause "limited supply and potential shortage" for the high profit consumer segment. And this is somehow a good deal for nvda shareholders? Selling Tesla cards at a ($3,500.00) discount per card. And then having nothing to sell to the profitable consumers. Hummm? Looks like Desperation by Jen to get some hollow revenues NOW to show The Street.

ALWAYS leaving out the best parts, that guy. "It might be a good idea to wait before buying a Nexus 7 All of the above is just speculation, but I am confident that Google will operate some sort of changes to the Nexus 7 come November. If my line of thought is correct, Google will drop the 8GB Nexus 7 and slash the prices of the 16GB and 32GB models. The 16GB would become the base model and go for $199, while the Nexus 7 32GB will probably cost $249. If Google decides to add 3G to the mix, the cellular equipped models will cost slightly more. If you are considering buying a Nexus 7 now, it might be a good idea to wait for a few more weeks if you can."</Msg><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1349449555229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:05:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349449840920-15</Id><Topic><Title>MUST READ: Tear-down cost analysis of Nexus 7 vs Amazon KF HD</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1349449051245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:57:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good business decision by Nvidia.

Which proves there's still a market for that slow old Tegra 3" Correct. With each lot, each chip gets less expensive to build -- it's semiconductors101. This chip is over 2 years old and is produced on an mature process. Amazing that Tegra3 is still getting designed into brand new products, isn't it? Which means that chip still has another couple of years of 50%+GMs to deliver to improve NVDA's bottom line. Pretty sweet. You really ought to learn more about the company and industry you're bashing so you don't look so foolish, besty. Quit spewing garbage.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1349476026789</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 18:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349476037477-38</Id><Topic><Title>A new Tegra 3 phone for the mass Chinese market: K-Touch Hornet 2, shipping end of October</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1349447932764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:38:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"chosen the older Tegra 3 CPU due to the lower cost.
